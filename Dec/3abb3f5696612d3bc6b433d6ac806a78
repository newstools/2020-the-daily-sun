IT WAS the moment the families had been waiting for. As the judge read out the sentences, the people in the court gallery burst into cheering and wept for joy. The five gang members who have terrorised the residents of Geluksdal near Tsakane, Ekurhuleni were finally removed from the streets. The five were each sentenced to double life imprisonment for the murder of two people, 26 years for attempted murder, five years for possession of unlicensed firearms and two years for possession of ammunition. Captain Mavela Masondo said on 7 April 2018, five men were involved in a drive-by shooting that led to the death of two men and injuring four others. “The attackers were travelling in a single vehicle and opened fire on a group of friends who were seated on the side of the road.” A tracing operation by the police led to the arrest of all the suspects on 10 April 2018. “The prosecutor read letters from the mothers of the two men who died in the shooting, emphasising that not knowing the motive for the killings makes it hard for them to find closure,” said Masondo.
