SOCIAL Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu has launched a R19 million programme to protect unaccompanied children who illegally enter Mzansi. “Children are the most vulnerable members of our society and it’s our shared responsibility to protect, nurture and care for them,” said Zulu. “Children on the move are vulnerable to exploitation, abuse and neglect. We have a collective duty of protection towards all children, especially those unaccompanied by a parent or caregiver.” She said in recent years, Mzansi had seen an increase in child migration at its borders. “We view this as a humanitarian issue rather than a matter of border control. The minister said kids migrated because of poverty, hunger and war. She said her department had set up a national steering committee to deal with the matter and co-ordinate services. “We want to find long-lasting solutions and ensure the right to protection, safety and dignified repatriation for unaccompanied and separated children.” Zulu said the committee had already signed cross-border collaboration agreements with Lesotho, Mozambique, eSwatini and Zumbabwe. “We’re conducting capacity building programmes on duty bearers in provinces. This project is to ensure proper data gathering on the number of unaccompanied and separated kids in the country.” Zulu said the department was working with International Social Services. “We owe it to our children, irrespective of nationality, to ensure we build a caring society that enables each child to reach their full potential. Every child has the right to life, survival and development.”
