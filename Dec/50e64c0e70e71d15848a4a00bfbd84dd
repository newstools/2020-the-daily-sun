Health 
minister Zweli Mkhize has cleared the air over claims that South Africa 
missed certain deadlines to partake in the Covax vaccine program, saying
 that the hold up had to do with administrative issues. Mkhize was speaking during a briefing on the latest developments of the Covid-19 in South Africa. He
 said the money will be paid to Covex in "the next two or three days", 
and has given an assurance that the necessary documentation has been 
signed. There have been reports that government missed a 15 
December payment deadline to secure vaccines via the Covax coalition. 
National Treasury had on Thursday refused to respond to Fin24 on these 
allegations. "The issue was weather we'd be participating or not 
and the decision was taken by Cabinet that we are, and so everything 
else was administrative and technical processing. So the delay is from 
that level." He explained: "The format that they (the Covax 
programme) used... and what Treasury was using was not aligned. It 
hadnothing to do with whether we wanted to take part." News24
