THE Khayelitsha Development Forum has accused the City of Cape Town of not doing enough to manage Covid-19 ekasi. This comes after safety kits were allegedly found stashed in a boardroom at Lookout Hill in Khayelitsha. Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido claimed the kits, meant for small traders, had been lying in the boardroom for more than a month. He said the second wave had already hit the country and the virus should be taken seriously. Tyhido said he received a tip-off about the safety kits and, while making enquiries, they were removed. “There are lots of traders who don’t have these kits but they’re stashed there and helping nobody.” A source said the boardroom wasn’t used for a long time because of lockdown.  “It was during this time that the city put the safety kits there. They were stashed for more than a month, but they were recently removed,” said the source. Urban management MMC Grant Twigg said the kits were for informal traders in areas such as Khayelitsha, Kuilsriver, Mfuleni, Blue Downs, Blackheath, Macassar, Somerset West, Lwandle and Nomzamo. “Distribution of the kits started in August and continues. The claim that the kits were dumped is therefore incorrect.” Twigg said the kits were distributed at the Khayelitsha Training Centre and Lookout Hill on 13 August and at Town Two Meat Market on 18 September. “Due to the shortage of storage space in Area East, the tool kits were stored at Lookout Hill in the boardroom. It’s unfortunate that a false narrative has emerged, causing unnecessary tensions,” he said. “The tool kits are distributed as and when it’;s convenient to do so. A well-organised programme was successfully implemented in August and September.”
