THE bail application of the five arrested in connection with the murder of King Goodwill Zwelithini’s son, Prince Lethukuthula Zulu, is expected to continue on Wednesday, 9 December, in the Randburg Magistrates Court in Joburg. Tshegofatso Moremane (30), Margaret Koaile (42), Portia Mmola (28), Gontse Tlholoe (30) and Dakalo Mbedzi (32) were nabbed for the murder of the prince as well as theft. Last week the accused, through their affidavits, shared details of their last encounter with the prince and his friend, whose name is still unknown. The four women told the court they were escorts and were with the prince on the night to render sexual services. They also claimed that on the way from a Randburg night club to Honeydew, drugs were bought. Accused three (Koaile) said in her affidavit, she and the prince’s friend bought drugs from a Nigerian man. Accused one (Moremane), who caught the eye of the prince on the night, said as they were in the bedroom the prince went in and out and came back with white “stuff’’ on his nose.
