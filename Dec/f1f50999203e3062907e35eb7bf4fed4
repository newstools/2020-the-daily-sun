Gogo Esther Mmutlana is facing a bleak Christmas. This comes after a 17-year-old girl she was taking care off
ran away with her R10 000. Esther from Garden Village Extension 2 in Daveyton in
Ekurhuleni said two months ago one of the neighbours brought the girl to her
house because she was leaving alone. She said no one knows the background of the girl and her
family. “She came to my neighbour and asked a place to stay and they
she was brought to me because I was leaving alone a took her.” she said She said she welcomed the girl and treated her like my
daughter. Esther said: “I was so reliefed because I’ve been leaving
alone since my husband died in 2014 and my son in 2017.” She said she trusted the girl and even gave her cards to do
grocery. “She was good girl who always do whatever I asked her. But
on that fateful day she went to the grocery and never came back. “She cleared my account and I was left with only R9. I’m so
hurt because I took her as my daughter since I don’t have kids. But she turned
against me and stole my money,” Esther said now she doesn’t have something to eat this
Christmas. “I have nothing, my fridge is empty and while other families
will be celebrating, enjoying seven colours food tomorrow. I will be forced to
lock my door and sleep because I don’t have something to cook for myself. “I’ve now realised that to be a good Samaritan is not right.
Look now the girl has vanished with my money and I’m left with nothing,” Gogo said she will not open a case against the girl. “I blame myself for trusting the girl. As much it pains me,
I have lived with it,” she said.
