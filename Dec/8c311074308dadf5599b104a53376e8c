MZANSI is set to surpass the million mark on positively identified Covid-19 cases. As of Saturday, 26 December the figure sat at 994 911, with a daily increase of more than 11 000 as the country battles the second wave of the deadly coronavirus. There is cause for concern in Limpopo as cases sky rocketed for the first time since the virus was first reported in South Africa. Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said: “We are feeling interprovincial movements, social gatherings and makarapa effect (influx of people coming to the province). Vhembe district used to be the lowest district. It has now joined Waterberg and Capricorn districts. “Compared to the first wave where many people tested positive with mild or no symptoms, we are now starting to admit more patients in our facilities. Trauma and road accidents are also worsening our situation.” Also in Limpopo, 15 people from one family tested positive for Covid-19 after they were in contact with another family member from Gauteng, A few days ago, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize told the nation about the new variant of the virus, which is found in young people without comorbidities. This new variant sparked the UK to impose a travel ban for South Africans due to the variant being more deadly than the UK’s new variant. But Mkhize rubbished the claims, stating that there was no evidence of what the UK health secretary claimed. “Banning travel between UK and South Africa is an unfortunate decision,” he said. “Such a decision would require more scientific evidence than is currently available. “There is no evidence that the South African variant is more pathogenic than the UK variant to necessitate this step,” he said.
