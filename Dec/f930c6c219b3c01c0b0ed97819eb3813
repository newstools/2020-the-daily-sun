Christmas time is family time that should be spent with the loved ones but it can be hard when the loved ones are no more. This has made various families spend time at graveyards at the graves of their deceased family and friends. Gogo Nonthuzelo Qwazi (70) from Gugulethu took her time out today to visit the grave of her late parents’, uncles and siblings at Gugulethu cemetry.  Her father died in 1989 and her mother followed six years later in 1995. She also visited his father’s late friend who stood with her family after the father’s death. “They are buried in the same grave, one on top of another, so I always visit them during Christmas. Though I visit them sometimes during the year, Christmas is the day that we used to gather and celebrate as a family. Though they are no longer with us, it doesn’t mean I dont love them anymore. Going to their grave on Christmas day is one of the indications to show them that they are still in my heart,” said gogo Qwazi.  She said her two late brothers are buried in a cemetery at Old Mutual in Thornton and she will visit them during the week. Later on, gogo will have Christmas with her children who were at church during the time she visited the graveyard. Mlungisi Madubedube (35) was at the graveyard with her sister and a sangoma where they had visited their mother’s grave. “We had a ritual whereby we asked her to give us direction in our lives. Things are not going according to our plans in life so we had to come on this special day to speak to our mother,” he said.  There were a number of families scattered around the graveyard with others praying, performing rituals while others were just putting followers on the grave.
