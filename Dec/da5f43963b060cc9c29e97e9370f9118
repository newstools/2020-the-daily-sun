I’m ready to be his side dish,” said Relebohile. Nobuhle Ngwenya said men needed to calm down and start practicing Duduzane’s million dollar walk. “Love or hate him, Duduzane is definitely the man he thinks he is. Haters are having sleepless nights. You guys will die of heart attacks,” she said. A twitter user called Nikki said: “This guy is taking us to level five lockdown.” However, men said they were gatvol of seeing their girlfriends drooling over Duduzane. “We want to see our girlfriends drool over us like they do when they see this man,” said King Ndlovu. One man, who himself participated in the challenge, said he would not let his girlfriend be entertained by other men while he was still alive. Thato Michaels said girls truly didn’t know what they wanted. He said men bought cars and changed their wardrobes just to impress them but then they ended up going crazy over walks. “We need to start accepting that we’ll never truly and fully understand women. You guys are very complicated human beings,” said Thato. Lethukthula Mntambo said if saw his girlfriend posting about Duduzane, she wouldn’t get anything from his salary. “I’m not going to tolerate an unruly girlfriend,” said Lethukthula.
