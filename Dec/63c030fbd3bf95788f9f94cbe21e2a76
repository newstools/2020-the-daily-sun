GLADAFRICA Championship sides will turn their attention to Nedbank Cup qualification this weekend, as they look to take the first step towards a journey they all hope will lead to a fairy-tale ending. TS Galaxy, who are now swimming with the big sharks in the top-flight ofMzansi football, have shown that teams from the second division can go all the way in the Ke Yona Cup. The Rockets wrote their name in the history Mzansi version of the FA Cup last year â€“ upsetting Kaizer Chiefs in the final. That has given hope to the likes of Jomo Cosmos, JDR Stars, Sekhukhune United, University of Pretoria and more Championship teams to believe that they can also shock the country. Cosmos and Sekhukhune will lock horns in arguably the headline fixture as they resume their rivalry, having already crossed paths in a four-goal thriller this season. The two sides played out to an enthralling 2-2 draw when they met in a league match just last week. Their battle will take place at the Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday (3pm). Cosmos will be confident having come from behind twice against Sekhukhune to earn the draw and then following that up with another battling display against Cape Town Spurs. Ezenkosi continued to display their bounce-back ability as they came from a goal down to stun Cape Town Spurs 2-1 in their last league match. Cosmos look like they mean business this season and appear to have learned a great deal from last season which saw them survive relegation by the skin of their teeth The other matches will see rookies Bizana Pondo Chiefs host Spurs at Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday while JDR Stars face high-flying Cape United at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve on Sunday (3 pm).
