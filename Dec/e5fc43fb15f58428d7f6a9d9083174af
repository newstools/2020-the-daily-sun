RESPECT the country’s laws! This was the message from Mpumalanga police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma recently. He told the People’s Paper that police will be out in full force during the holidays to protect citizens and to ensure that they and their property are kept safe. “We praise the joint forces for their resilience during this period, which saw perpetrators being put behind bars,” said Zuma. “Our Safer Festive Season operation yielded positive results in Mpumalanga, where over 280 suspects were arrested for being involved in various crimes including murder, rape, robbery, assault and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.” Zuma said various other activities were executed by cops throughout the province. “We call on residents to respect the law and to neither commit any crime nor drive while under the influence of alcohol,” he said. The police commissioner told Daily Sun that 57 suspects were arrested for drunk driving, and police recovered 27 firearms – 24 revolvers and three rifles – and 45 rounds of ammunition. “The suspects are expected to appear in various courts across the province, while others were issued with summons to pay fines,” said Zuma.
