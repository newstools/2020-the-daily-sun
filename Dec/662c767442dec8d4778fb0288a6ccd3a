KAIZER Chiefs could be without right-back, Ramahlwe Mphahlele in the return leg of their Caf Champions League preliminary round tie with Cameroon side PWD Bamenda on Friday. The match scheduled for a 6pm kick-off at FNB Stadium. Mphahlele suffered a hamstring injury and is a huge concern for Amakhosi mentor Gavin Hunt. "Rama is a big problem for us, he did his hamstring or whatever he's got,” Hunt said in a statement released by the club. “We won't train with any intensity before the next game on Friday, that's for sure. We'll do recovery and just a little bit of work on who, how and what. "We'll have to see who's available, because it looks like we've got a few problems already with one or two players. I just hope it doesn't affect our game (in the DStv Premiership against Black Leopards) the following week, which is a bigger concern at this point in time. Mphahlele, will be assessed over the next few days to determine his availability. "He (Mphahlele) has a hamstring strain and will be further assessed on Tuesday and Wednesday to ascertain the extent of the injury and his availability for the second leg," read the update. Chiefs won the first leg tie in Cameroon 1-0 and they will be hoping to wrap it up in Friday. If Amakhosi advance to the first round they will face Angolan side Primeiro de Agosto in a tough two-legged tie.
