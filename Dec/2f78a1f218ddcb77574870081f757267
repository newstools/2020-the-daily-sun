POLICE took down an initiation hut after complaints were received about an illegal initiation school. Captain Noloyiso Rwexana said Lingelethu West cops in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, received the complaint on Tuesday that the school was operating on Acsa ground next to Mew Way. “On arrival, the members found two youngsters who were already initiated. There was no caregivers or traditional surgeon present. “The initiates were taken by their parents and the huts were taken down,” said Rwexana. She said they were investigating cases of initiation practices. One of the family members said people didn’t respect their culture. “They should have arrested parents instead of sending the initiates home,” said the family member. “No one will respect them because they were supposed to finish everything in their huts, not in their houses.” He said all they wanted was for government officials to respect their culture. “The two initiates were wearing their masks and not sitting close to each other. “We don’t understand why they were taken home.” Mark Rwabane, vice-chairman for the Somagwaza Institute, said they are working with traditional doctors to protect initiation organisations. “We make sure that the initiations in the Western Cape are practiced in the right way and ensure that no one dies while at initiation school,” said Rwabane. He said during Covid-19, the initiation ritual was closed or postponed in Cape Town. “One of the parents had the Department of Arts and Cultures initiation documents, which the department hasn’t issued this year, he said. “How did they get these forms?” He said they understand that parents want their kids to go to initiation school, but not under these circumstances.
