THEY started working as school patrollers in August but they have never been paid. The four school patrollers from Extension 6 Primary School in Nellmapius, Tshwane, said they were working as if they were getting paid, but they haven’t received any money. Emma Matloa (48) told Daily Sun the Department of Education owes them more than R8 000 each. “I come to work every day knowing that I haven’t been paid,” she said. “I survive on my grant for my five children. I tell them I go to work every day.” The patrollers work from Monday to Friday. Emma said they signed their contracts on 1 July. “We haven’t received our salaries and we’re always told that there’s something wrong with the attendance register, but the principal submits them all the time. “We blame the department for failing us. We need our money. We can’t deal with this situation anymore. We wake up every morning and go to work, but we don’t get anything,” she said. Nompumelelo Skhosana (29) said they were unhappy as their families were suffering and they didn’t have food or money to provide for them. “We want our salaries so that we can buy food and Christmas clothes for our children,” she said. Gauteng Department of Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We have explained to all youth brigades, bus co-ordinators and patrollers that all outstanding payments have been captured and they will be paid this week.”
