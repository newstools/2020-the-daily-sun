  The former presidentâ€™s son, Duduzane Zuma, has set tongues wagging yet again, but this time not for his walk. Duduzane recently bought Somizi's cook book and signed it then afterwards gave it to him. It caused a lot of confusion among people and social was a buzz with many asking if it isn't supposed to be the other way around. The raving buzz came after media personality Somizi Mhlongo took to social media to thank Duduzane for signing the book for him. "Thank you buddy," Somizi said. In the signed book, Duduzane also left a short and brief message for Somizi. "To my brother Somizi, well done, onwards and upwards," he wrote. Shortly after Somizi shared the signed book, people started flooding his comments asking how this is possible. Thato commented and said: "How does this thing work? Doesn't the author sign the book? Duduzani is one special kind." While Sandile said people are now using Duduzane to market their brands. "I saw this coming , after that, Duduzane Challenge, I knew that people will use him to market their brands and items." Pat Mdluli shared the same sentiments with Sandile and said they might have done it to get people talking. "Thinking about this a little more deeply, I have realized that they probably did this on purpose to get people talking," he said. But Sthethelo defended Somizi and said : "Simple Duduzane bought the copy signed it and gave it to Somizi." "Even if he didn't buy it, Somizi likes Duduzane and he asked him to sign it. He keeps the signed copy in his bookshelf. No big deal. We all love Duduzane."
