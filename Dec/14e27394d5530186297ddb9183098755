THE release of two men and a 14-year-old boy accused of killing a North West cop left his family devastated. Thato Makhoana (26) was killed in July and his body was dumped alongside the road, while his car was set alight. Clopard Tsatsi, Goitseone Maseng and the boy were granted R2 000 bail by the Mmabatho Magistrates Court and the matter was postponed to February 19. But Thato’s family was left with questions after the suspects were released on bail. They said the arrests were a step towards healing and finding closure. Thato’s mother, Lerato, said she could not sleep and wondered why there were questions and no answers in her son’s case. “The magistrate said my son’s killers needed to go out so they could take care of their families,” said Lerato. “Counselling was arranged for the 14-year-old boy, but the law does not see that my son was also a victim and that as his mother, I need closure. “They decided not to consider that my son’s three-year- old daughter also needed counselling. To me, the law only favours criminals,” she said. Lerato said the police’s silence about her son’s case was also deafening. “They did not even allocate an official to help with the running of the funeral like any other police funeral. After the funeral, they only came to take his uniform and I never saw them,” she said. “They have not even paid his salary that he worked hard for that month.” Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the matter should be handled by police national office and promised to engage with them for investigations.
