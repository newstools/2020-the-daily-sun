IF you thought that time is running out for Lehlohonolo Seema as Chippa United coach, you’d detter think again. Seema said he feels no pressure despite their poor run of form and he said his chairman Siviwe Mpengesi has been very supportive. Chippa lost their third game on the trot after going down 3-1 to fellow coastal side AmaZulu in their DStv Premiership at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Sunday. This was the club’s fourth loss in their last five games and Mpengesi, when results don’t go accordingly, is very quick to fire coaches. Dan Malesela was sacked just three games in 2018-19 season had started and Seema should count himself lucky to be still in the job, having won just one of eight league matches. And their position on the table, third from bottom with five points, doesn’t give much hope that Seema, who was appointed on 6 July before last season was completed in the bubble in Gauteng, will start 2021 as the club’s coach. However, Seema is not perturbed. “I still enjoy the support of the chairman and also the players’ support. We are still soldiering on,” Seema said after the match. “We can’t despair. We are going to work harder and make sure we achieve what we want.” This match was due to be played in Port Elizabeth but because of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Eastern Cape, both clubs agreed to swap this match. Chippa have also told SunSport their match against Golden Arrows on 9 January will be played in Durban, instead of PE. “We are finalising everything with the PSL to play the game against Arrows in Durban, instead of PE,” said club’s COO Lukhanyo Mzizi.
