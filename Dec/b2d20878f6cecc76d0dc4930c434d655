RECONCILIATION Day is all about reestablishing relations, right? But Orlando Pirates were in no reconciliatory mood as they broke Chippa United’s spirit with a narrow 1-0 league win at Orlando Stadium last night. Fresh from their MTN8 triumph, the Buccaneers were not about to let the Eastern Cape upstarts derails their momentum, at least not Fortune Makaringe, the scorer of the 86th minute goal. The victory saw Pirates extend their 14-match unbeaten run in all competitions. The last time Pirates tasted was in August when they lost to Cape Town City FC. The result means Pirates are unbeaten this season, having drawn four and won three to accumulate 13 points which leaves them in third spot in the DStv Premiership log. The Buccanners started the match on a bad foot as they were forced into a technical change in the first minute of the match. This was after striker Zakhele Lepasa was stretched off after he twisted his ankle and got replaced by last season’s top goal scorer Gabadinho Mhango as early as  90th second of the encounter. The Chilli Boys were reduced to ten men on the stroke of half-time when defender Sandile Mthethwa was sent off for putting his elbow in the face of Deon Hotto. The two teams went to the break with a 0-0 score-line. In the second half they made changes but there was nothing much to write home about until the 86th minute where Makaringe managed to find the back of the net which gave them maximum points. It is always difficult for local teams to maintain momentum post cup victory. But the win, achieved through blood and sweat before the empty stands, could be a sign of good thing to come from the top-eight cup champions. They are now in third spot, four points behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns and two behind second-placed Swallows FC after seven games. It may be fairly early days to call the league marathon, and there is still the Christmas break to follow. But the Buccaneers have shown intenton to break Sundowns’ hegemony.
