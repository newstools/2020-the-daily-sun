PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) all time goal scorer Siyabonga Nomvethe has returned to AmaZulu. Bhele, who left the club at the end of 2018-19 season, is returning to be part of new coach Benni McCarthy’s technical team. Nomvethe, who on the 2 December turned 43, this means he has official retired from football after scoring 123 goals in the PSL top flight, in a career that official started in 1997 with now defunct Africa Wanderers. According to SunSport sources, Nomvethe is not the only former club's player to join Usuthu as part of MCarthy’s technical team. Moeneeb Josephs, who played with the former FC Port striker at Orlando Pirates when they claimed the second treble in 201-12 season, is coming in to be part of the team. Initially McCarthy, when he left Cape Town City last year November, confirmed that he wanted Josephs to be goalkeeper coach at the club and this doesn't come a surprise. Josephs will also be coming back to AmaZulu a place that is familiar to him. He was appointed as the assistant caretaker to interim coach Ayanda Dlamini by the club in February this year after Usuthu, under the previous regime, sacked Jozef Vukusic. However, while he was still playing, Josephs left the club at the end of last season under the cloud after he couldn’t see eye to eye with the previous regime under the Sokhela family. This also means Josephs has officially retired from football. These changes will leave the future of Allan Freese, in charge of Usuthu's 2-0 loss Golden Arrows at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Wednesday, in doubt. These additions and changes, which Usuthu have hogged headlines with a huge shopping spree during the off season under new regime led by president Sandile Zungu, is set to be announced soon.
