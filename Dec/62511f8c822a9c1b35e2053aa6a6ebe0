PROMISING Baroka youngster Evidence “Tower” Makgopa has targeted 14 goals this season. The 20-year-old striker has scored three goals in their opening six DStv Premiership matches so far. The on-form Makgopa continued with his fine form when he scored in the Ga-Mphahlele-based side’s 2-1 victory against Chippa United in a league clash at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. Baroka’s other goal was scored by another player, Richard Mbulu, while Sandile Mthethwa netted for the Chilli Boys. “All is going well for me this season,” said Makgopa, who was promoted to the first team in January by former Baroka head coach Dylan Kerr. “All I need to do is continue working hard. I’ve not yet reached my best. The best is still to come from me. But for now, I am pleased with my performances as the team is doing well and I am scoring goals. The job of a striker is to score goals and I am happy with my contribution to the team. “I aim to score 14 goals. I believe I can do it as I am surrounded by quality teammates who have been helpful since I got promoted to the first team.” Makgopa was also full if praise for coach Matsimela Thoka. “He (Thoka) is a good guy to work with and believes in my talenting to ask he listens to you and gives you advice when you need it. I am thankful to the club chairman Khurishi Mphahlele for giving him (Thoka) this opportunity to lead the team. We are working hard as a team to make sure he is successful.” Under Thoka, who took over from the sacked Kerr, Baroka are currently third on the log with 11 points from six league games. They are only three points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Thoka’s team have won three games, drawn two and suffered only one defeat.
