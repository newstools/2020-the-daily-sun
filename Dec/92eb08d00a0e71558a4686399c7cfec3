THE South African Under-20 national men’s team, Amajita, have taken a giant step towards their goal of qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. This after Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele’s charges thumped Lesotho 7-0 in their second Cosafa Championship match played at Wolson Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. Amajita flexed their muscles against Lesotho as they looked to stamp their authority in their group also comprising of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Amajita, who had to settle for a point in their last match with Zimbabwe as they played to a 2-2 draw, were eager to collect all three against Lesotho and gain a position of strength. And they did that emphatically with a ruthless performance to put Lesotho to the sword. Sinenjongo Mkiva was the star of the show for Amajita, bagging a hat trick to help his side take a huge step towards securing qualification for the knockout stages. Amajita broke the ice as early as the 5th minutes as they pressured Thapelo Mohale of Lesotho to put one behind his own net. The Skipper, Rowan Human, then got into the action as he bagged the second before Mkiva netted the first of his three goals just before the halftime interval. As soon as the teams returned from the break, Oswin Appollis caught Lesotho sleeping and dully punished them with Amajita’s fourth goal. Mkiva then stole the show as he netted his second and third goal of the match Tshepo Myeni completed the mauling with a late strike. Amajita will now turn their attention to their final group match against Mozambique on Tuesday at the same venue and at the same time.
