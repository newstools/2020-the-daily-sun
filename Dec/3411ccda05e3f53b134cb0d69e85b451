When we enjoy the parties this festive season, we need to do it with 2021 in mind. Never forget that there’s life after Christmas and New Year. More often than not the festive atmosphere makes others drink irresponsibly and they misbehave in the process. Such misbehaviour ends in violence, with some getting injured or losing their lives. Irresponsible drinking is also the cause of people sleeping around without using condoms. It’s absurd to see girls going out with men who are senior enough to be their fathers, just so they can buy alcohol for them. A dignified girl who values her life will never sleep with a man for booze. It’s better to party before curfew lapses and go home while you can still spell your name. Drinking until dawn will always bring undesirable results. The year 2020 was the most difficult of all. We need to end it in good health so that we can enter 2021 with a good frame of mind. You don’t want to start a new year with the previous year’s depression. We shouldn’t do anything to please our friends. If you don’t have money to buy meat and alcohol, stay home.
