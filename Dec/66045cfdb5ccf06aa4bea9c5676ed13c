RESIDENTS of Klipgat, North West, were woken up by the screams of a young girl and went to out investigate. What they saw was horrific. Residents said they caught a man red-handed raping his own 13-year-old daughter. One of the residents, who caught the man doing the evil deed, said: “We wanted to beat him up, but he managed to escape.” They then took the child home to her mum. He said they’d hear screams for weeks. “It seems this man has been raping his daughter for weeks, if not months,” said the resident. The child’s 28-year-old mum said she wasn’t aware of the abuse. “I didn’t know about this and can’t say I believe it because I never saw it happening,” said the kid’s mother. “But I don’t care what happens to that man. I don’t want him here.” The woman’s neighbours claim the child’s mum knew about the rape all along. “This woman is also abusing this child,” said a resident. “She makes her clean, cook and perform wifely duties for her husband.” Residents said they don’t want to see the man in the community again. “If he dares come back, we’ll take care of him,” one resident threatened. North West police spokeswoman, Lieutenant- Colonel Amanda Funani, said the police are investigating a rape case. “The 31-year-old father is still at large,” Funani told Daily Sun. “He was allegedly going to a shop with his 13-year-old daughter when he pulled her into the bushes. “He started undressing the young victim and allegedly raped her.” She said investigations are continuing.
