THE Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance in South Africa has called for public health to come before profit. This was in response to the liquor traders’ plea with government not to ban alcohol sales in the wake of the rising infection numbers. Mzansi was shcoked into reality recently when infections reached the one million mark. There are also concerns over the shortage of hospital beds and the depletion of oxygen supplies. Hospitals are faced with the rising number of alcohol-induced injuries. Medical associations and nursing unions have called for increased controls on alcohol to allow hospitals to focus on managing Covid-19 cases. In a statement, the Alcohol Policy Alliance said it was sympathetic to the plight of particularly small liquor traders, their staff and families. “But we’re concerned that self-regulation by the industry is inevitably less important to their economic interests,” read the statement. It said the alcohol industry hasn’t delivered on its pledge to ensure that alcohol outlets observe Covid-19 protocols. “We believe their approach, like their long-standing and equally unsuccessful drink responsibly campaign, is designed to protect their profit than address the fundamental drivers of the harmful use of alcohol.” They alliance called on outlets to maintain current restrictions on off-consumption liquor sales, suspend all on-premises sales and consumption of alcohol, reduce indoor gatherings to 50 people and maintain fewer than 50% capacity at indoor venues. But Lucky Ntimane of the Liquor Traders Formation told eNCA: that if government considered a total ban on alcohol they could look at allowing taverns to operate as off-premises outlets seven days a week.“There’re solutions beyond a total lockdown.This is something we’re not going to accept. “Government should consult with us if they’re going to make decisions that affect our livelihoods.”
