MZANSI has reached the Covid-19 one million mark after 9 502 cases were reported on Sunday. This has caused panic, with some calling for government to put in place stricter laws. But some felt the economy won’t survive harsher lockdown and called for individuals to be more responsible. Mamelodi resident Sakkie Nthlame (32) said: “We have ourselves to blame for strict lockdown laws. Since we act like children, maybe the president should treat us as such.” Themba Ndou (29) said: “The numbers are rising, yet we have people ekasi who act like they’re immune to the virus. Our parents are at risk and have the most chance of not surviving. Owner of Nkuna Liquor Distributor in Mamelodi, Elizabeth Nkuna, said: “The liquor business helps put food on the table for many people. We barely survived the first months of lockdown.” She said government needed to be strict on those who don’t adhere to the regulations. “This thing of selling booze during curfew time needs to stop, and overcrowding in taverns and clubs should stop. This is the reason we find ourselves in this mess,” she said. Another resident of Mamelodi, David Muchena (46), said: “Police are weak. So even if we go back to level 5, people will still do as they please.” The National Coronavirus Command Council is expected to discuss a potential ban on alcohol. Convener of the Liquor Traders Formations, Lucky Ntimane, said: “We’ve proposed curfew measures and alcohol restrictions, if any, that still allow off-premises sales for home consumption. A complete shutdown of liquor sales would mean an end to the tavern market and the 250 000 direct jobs linked to the sector.” Meanwhile, the defence force has dismissed claims it has called back its soldiers to help the police. A statement had been doing the rounds on social media claiming soldiers would be back from Tuesday.
