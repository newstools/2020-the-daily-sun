This year’s line-up will be dominated by female musicians. Nokwazi, Winnie Khumalo, Rethabile Khumalo, Soul G and Ozana as well as Trompies will have a special performance. Kwaito star Mshoza will be celebrated on the night. The founder and CEO of the awards, Perfecta Malinga, said: “I was deeply hurt and disturbed by the sudden passing of the Queen of Kwaito, Mshoza. “As one of the leading female musicians in this male-dominated industry, Mshoza was set to perform but now has left us. We’ve since had to change the entire programme because of her passing, and make sure we pay homage to her. She’ll forever be missed, and may her soul rest in peace,” she said. The awards will be broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube on the Mzansi Kwaito and House Music Awards pages.
