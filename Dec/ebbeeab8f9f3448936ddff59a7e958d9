FOR six months they stayed in the same yard, but then the fellow tenant suddenly started demanding sex! He came to knock at their door in September. Sylvia Letswalo (40) a housewife who lives with her husband in Elandsfontein near Kempton Park, said she thought the fellow tenant wanted to borrow some sugar. He actually demanded sex. “I’m horny. Can I have one round?” he asked Sylvia’s husband, Martin, (46), who was in bed sleeping, came out to ask the man why he was disrespecting his wife. The man apparently started to swear at Martin, telling him he was good for nothing, and a fight broke out. The tenant opened a case and Martin was arrested, but was released on R500 bail. “It’s sad that police never gave him a chance to explain,” Sylvia told Daily Sun. She said she was going to open a case against the tenant, who’s fled. “We discovered in the morning that he took all his belongings and left,” she said. Martin said he was not going to sit and watch a man disrespect him and his wife. Sylvia said on the day the suspect approached her, he seemed very drunk. “I felt violated. I love my husband, and for another man to disrespect him like that was uncalled for,” she said. Sylvia said she wants the man arrested. “I’m afraid he’ll come back to target me if my husband is convicted,” she said. Captain Andre de Jager said two suspects – the woman’s husband and another tenant who helped in the fight – were arrested for assault. They are expected back in court on 7 December.
