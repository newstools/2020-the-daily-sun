HE fooled her into having sex with him, saying he was connecting her with her ancestors. After raping the 16-year-old virgin, the gobela threatened to make her go mad, disappear or get knocked down by a car. The girl – who was undergoing training last year – finally became brave enough to confide in an older sangoma, who told her parents. They opened a case and the gobela was bust and appeared in court on Thursday, 17 December. Angry izangoma, amathwasa and traditional healer organisations protested outside the Daveyton Magistrates Court. One of them shouted outside court: “Not in our name. Never! We’re not going to allow people who have no calling to drag our profession through the mud.” Gogo Penny Ndlovu, president of the Indigenous Healers of Africa, said: “What this gobela did is an insult to the ancestors. He must pay.” The thwasa’s parents were angry but relieved the man had been arrested. “My daughter still can’t read the bones. It clearly shows he was after sex and never intended to train her,” said her father. The thwasa had intended to stay a virgin until she met the right man, but the gobela seemingly robbed her of her dream. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula said the suspect will make his second appearance soon.
