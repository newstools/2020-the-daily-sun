MORE than R500 000 has already been spent on the water project that was started in October this year to give Bakubung Ba Ratheo water. The amount was for four finished boreholes from the 13 allocated. Three will be left unfinished as the water has come into contact with pit toilets and the water is unsafe to drink. Spokesman for the office of Bakubung Ba Ratheo Kgosi, Disele Phologane, said the project would put a lot of smiles on the faces of the people in the area. “No matter how much it costs, the expenditure is worthwhile because it will be giving water to our community,” said Phologane. He urged the residents to watch out for criminals stealing taps and vandalising community property. Resident Dudu Lukhele said the days of fetching water from faraway places were over. “We are grateful for this project,” said Dudu. Meanwhile on 1 December this year, the North West government appointed an administrator to deal with community issues such as traditional councils and finances. But Bakubung leadership applied for an interdict at the North West High Court to stop the appointment, saying proper consultation wasn’t done. Phologane said they won the interdict and will be going to court between March and April next year. Responding to the allegations, chief director of Traditional Affairs Simon Ruthoane said all correct processes were followed and reports of past administrators were handed to Bakubung leadership.
