A FAMILY is happy their daughter’s alleged killer took his own life. Thule Mhlongo (27) was stabbed, allegedly by her baby daddy Sfiso Gumede (29) on Wednesday, 23 December. Three days later Sfiso was found hanging from a tree in Mboza area in Umhlabuyalingana, northern KZN. Thule’s father, John, (54) said they were happy Sfiso took his own life. “It would have been more painful had he run away forever. We’re glad he later developed a conscious and killed himself,” said John. “I think upon hearing that Thule succumbed to her multiple stab wounds, he saw it fit to kill himself as well.”  John said on the day Thule was attacked, they were called to Sfiso’s home by neighbours. “Thule was still alive when we arrived there, but she had a number of stab wounds all over her body. We rushed her to Mboza Clinic, but she succumbed to her stab wounds before we could get to the clinic,” he said. John said they were unable to find out what led to his daughter’s killing, but were aware that her relationship with Sfiso had turned sour. “He beat her last month. We warned her to leave him because he had turned violent, but kids don’t listen to us when they’re blinded by love,” said John. “Her daughter is only seven years old. It’s painful that she will grow up without a mum because of her dad.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said charges of murder and an inquest were being investigated by Jozini police.
