CONFEDERATION of African Football (Caf) have approved the postponement of Kaizer Chiefs Champions League second leg preliminary tie against PWD Bamenda. Chiefs will host the Cameroonian club at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (5 December). The fixture was initially scheduled for Friday (4 December) at the same venue at 6pm. On Thursday, Amakhosi announced that the Cameroonian club have written to the Confederation of African Football asking for the match to be postponed as they were yet to arrive in SA a little over 24 hours before kickoff. Now Chiefs have confirmed that the match will be played on Saturday. "CAF have approved our proposal to play the match on Saturday 05 December 2020.  We await the Team’s arrival. Kick off is set for 18:00," Chiefs said in a short statement that was released on Twitter. Chiefs won the first leg in Limbe Cameroon 1-0, thanks to Eric Mathoho's solitary goal. Amakhosi then arrived back in Mzansi on Tuesday and Gavin Hunt’s team were busy preparing to finish the job on Friday, however, they will now play on Saturday. The winner of this game will face Angola’s Primeira de Agosto in the two legs of the first round, the stage before the group phase which is scheduled for the end of December and beginning of January.
