MATRICS said yesterday’s Setswana paper 3 was a breeze! Pupils at President Mangope High School in Rustenburg, North West, said the paper was fair and they were sure of a pass. They said Covid-19 had allowed them time to study. Ayanda Modise (18) said she wrote well but found one question challenging. “I’m not a Tswana, so the essay writing question was a bit difficult. But I’m hoping to do well,” she said. Olebogeng Phakula (19) said she enjoyed the short questions. “I enjoyed question two. I chose the TB topic. I’m well-informed on the topic and know it gave me enough marks to pass,” she said. Meanwhile, Tina Ndlovu (18), Innocent Mhlongo (18) and Prayer Makhubela (16) from Bondzeni High School in Ximhungwe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said the Xitsonga paper was a bit hard. “It was a little bit tough but I wrote well and finished on time. We believe we did well,” said Innocent.
