Rapper Mawat has been awarded a gold plaque for his single Inanda. The rapper known for his gospel and life-affirming songs received the plaque on Thursday 3 December at an event hosted by his label Gallo Record Company. Mawat said he wasn’t expecting the song, released in March, to be so big. “To be honest, I didn’t expect this because I wasn’t feeling the song. My management loved the song and that’s why it was released. Surprisingly, it went big. I wasn’t expecting this milestone. I’m grateful though that people from Inanda can have something great they can look forward to. This will be a highlight for my kasi,” he said. This is Mawat’s first song to go gold.
