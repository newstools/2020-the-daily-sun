The ousted mayor of the troubled Ditsobotla Municipality said he has accepted defeat. Daniel Buthelezi was removed from his position as a mayor on Thursday, 10 December, through a motion of no confidence. Buthelezi, who only learnt that people wanted to remove him during a special sitting, told Daily Sun he was no different from people who have been crucified for doing good. “Jesus Christ was crucified while he was not wrong. I am not different from that situation. This is not starting with me. If it could happen to the son God, who am I?” he asked. Even though Buthelezi had accepted his axing, councillors in his municipality said they had to remove him because he was sinking the municipality in debt and wasn't delivering services. EFF Councillor Themba Sonakele said the municipality was facing a financial crisis and that there was no services delivery at all. He claimed there were problems with roads, water and refuse removal in the town and kasis. “The was high level of corruption in the municipality, especially during level 3 of lockdown. Buthelezi failed dismally to advise on these challenges hence he was removed.” The new mayor Motlhanka Moreo accepted his new role. Moreo had however vowed to forge unity in the council by working with all councillors in ensuring the municipality fulfils its constitutional obligations and delivers service delivery to residents.
