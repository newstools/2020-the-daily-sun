RESIDENTS say crime has become worse after thugs began stripping off street lamps. Residents of Endlovini in Khayelitsha told the SunTeam thugs rule their kasi at night. Community leader, Lonwabo Mqina, said there’s always been a crime problem ekasi. “But it’s become worse because there’s darkness all over,” he said. A number of people he spoke to told him the bulbs were stolen by people who use them to grow dagga plants. “They say street lights are strong and fit for that job,” he said. “I don’t have enough information, but that’s the rumour.” Resident Siyavuya Nontshinga said you walk in the streets at your own risk at night. “Thugs are out to mug and rob people. Women are in more danger,” he said. Siyavuya doesn’t understand how people reach the lights. “Even with a ladder you can’t reach them because they’re so high up there.” MMC for climate and energy, Phindile Maxiti, said: “The City of Cape Town is aware of the street light outages. “We’ve experienced challenges with ongoing theft and vandalism in this region. “This places pressure on resources and affects residents, who don’t have proper street lights.” He said patrols are done in hot spots and residents must work with the city to fight crime. “The city is offering a R5 000 reward to anyone who gives out info that could lead to a conviction.” The reward applies to information leading to the arrest of people who vandalise, damage or steal infrastructure, or install illegal connections.
