DANNY Jordaan has slammed those questioning Patrice Motsepe’s football credentials as the right man for Confederation of African Football (Caf) presidency. The SA Football Association is in the forefront of the campaign to have Motsepe, the Mamelodi Sundowns president and businessman, elected the eighth Caf president in the elective congress in March. Motsepe’s candidacy has been met with scepticism in some parts of the continent, not least in the west and north regions. But Jordaan has insisted it was about time Caf maximised on commercial potential. “What Caf needs is not more plans, but money. You can have the best plans in the world, but you are not going to implement them. “I told them (critics) that I can draw the most beautiful plan for a house, but without the money to build the house, it is just a dream. “Caf does not even have 10% of the revenue of Uefa. “So how can we compete? We have to ask, ‘what is the real problem?’ It is governance, it is revenue. It is more politics and talks? “So it is clear to me that what Africa needs at the moment is what Patrice offers. So we must give him a chance and support. This is the man who was once named among the 100 best CEOs by Forbes Magazine.” Motsepe rolled out the red carpet for some of the big wigs at the weekend, inviting no less than five heads of Caf federations, including Nigeria’s Amaju Pinnick, to the Sundowns’ 50th-year celebration party in Joburg. Also in attendance were two former Caf player of the year, Samuel Eto’o and El Hadji Diouf, as well as a throng of club legends, who included former Ivory Coast international Siaka Tiene. It all seemed a great campaign trail, but Jordaan has explained there is much more work to be done to get their candidate in office. “He has to go and meet as many FA presidents as possible and that is what we are encouraging him to do,” added Jordaan.
