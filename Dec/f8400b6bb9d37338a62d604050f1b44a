EVEN when you’ve graduated and received a degree, don’t sit around waiting for the right job. These are the words of Fikile Sibiya (37) from Jozini in KZN, who’s graduated from the University of Zululand with a degree in public administration. Recently, a video of her mixing sand with which to build bricks surfaced. She told Daily Sun she decided to do this job while looking for the job she’s qualified for. She said people often hire someone to make bricks for them. “People do this when building houses because it’s cheaper than buying bricks from a warehouse,” she said. “I was suffering so I looked for that kind of work.” She said when she sees sand in the yards she knows people are building. “I knock on the door and market myself. Usually they take me.” She said she uses the money to buy food for her two kids and help her parents out. “I’m a graduate and people look down on me for doing this kind of work, but I don’t care. I need the money and I know my goal.” She’s enrolled for an honours degree in developmental studies for next year. She finished school in 2007 and did volunteer work for three years without pay. Then she worked for another three years for R1 700 per month. In 2016, she went back to school. “I was already 31, but I told myself that education is key.” So far her key hasn’t opened any doors, but she’ll make bricks and wait for the right door to be unlocked.
