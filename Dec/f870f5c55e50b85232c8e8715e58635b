GRAVES are sacred and need to be protected and respected at all times. But not the graves at Saulsville Cemetery in Atteridgeville, Tshwane. Pastor Wiseman Nazo of Atteridgeville Saulsville Pastoral Association is angry because thugs have been vandalising the graves and the overgrown grass is also making things worse. Nazo said: “We are concerned because people struggle to visit their relatives’ graves as the grass has overgrown.” According to Nazo, thugs stole the numbers on the graves, making it difficult for families to identify their graves. “Nyaope boys are stealing from these graves. They also live there. “These boys also rob people who come to the cemetery or pass by. We are now scared to visit the graves alone, but it’s safe when people come as a group,” he told Daily Sun. He said the cemetery has turned into a place of evil. “We appeal to the City of Tshwane to protect these graves because the dead are angry and not at peace,” he said. Sangoma Samuel Mabuza (56) said: “The vandalism and crime happening at the graves will anger the dead. “We respect the dead because they’re still see us.” The city’s acting chief of staff, Jordan Griffiths, said they were in the process of finalising tenders that will see contractors maintain the cemetery. “These processes did not occur under the ANC administrators and the DA-led administration has inherited a backlog of front line serve delivery tenders that need to be concluded on. “Security is a pressing concern at Saulsville cemetery and different cemeteries around the city where criminals prey on those coming to mourn. “The city is exploring how it can strengthen security at its cemeteries to combat these crimes,” said Griffiths.
