The health department has 
suspended Covid-19 screening at the Beitbridge border between South 
Africa and Zimbabwe to ease congestion. Health department 
spokesperson Popo Maja said that "in the interest of addressing the 
congestion", the department suspended temperature screening and health 
questionnaires from 23 December because "the same is performed on the 
Zimbabwe immigration side". Firstly, it has been reported that the
 antigen testing requirement, which theÂ department introduced through 
amended health directions, is slowing down processes at the border. Trucks are clocking the Manica bypass route. The
 port has deployed traffic officers at the border entrance during every 
festive season to divert light vehicles to the Manica bypass route. According
 to Maja, light vehicles are searched by South African Defence Force 
members and police officials before they proceed to port health for 
screening. "Unfortunately, trucks have blocked the Manica bypass 
route, restricting light vehicles to proceed through to Manica bypass 
for searching by law enforcement officers and screening by port health,"
 he added. In addition, Maja said there are also "high volumes of travellers to Zimbabwe". "These travellers are NOT required to provide test results." On Thursday, News24 reported that four truck drivers died while queuing at the Beitbridge border post.  News24
