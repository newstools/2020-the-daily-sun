 A dejected Itumeleng Khune admitted post-match that his recent errors had led to back-to-back negative results for Kaizer Chiefs after suffering a 2-1 defeat to SuperSport United in a league encounter at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Tuesday evening. The 33-year-old committed almost identical errors in consecutive weeks that has now led to Chiefs dropping points in a 2-2 draw to Black Leopards before Tuesday evening's defeat. The Bafana Bafana international said that he needed to perhaps curtail his tendencies to act as an additional ball-player and go back to focusing on the basics of goalkeeping. "I don't know, I think I'm trying to do too much," Khune told SuperSport TV. "I'm trying to be a ballplayer, I'm trying to be a goalkeeper at the same time. "I think that I should just go back to sticking to be a goalkeeper because I want the team to play more. I mean I don't want us to keep playing the ball in the air."I want us to play more out from the back and I want to look for those pockets [of space] unfortunately tonight the guys read the ball that I wanted to play in the pocket to Mshini (Nkosingiphile Ngcobo)."They converted the chance and it's sad that I just gave away two goals in two weeks, it's very bad and we have to go back and work on it."Because I've been playing for many seasons and I've never made such mistakes," said Khune.Chiefs will look to get back to winning ways when they next face Bloemfontein Celtic in a league clash at the FNB Stadium.Kick-off is at 18:00.
