The UN-led 16 Days of no violence against women and children has fallen on deaf ears as the slaughter of our women and children continues unabated. Gender-based violence is a serious violation of human rights and a life-threatening health and protection issue. One in three women will experience sexual or physical violence in their lifetime. In 2017, an estimated 87 000 women were murdered intentionally across the globe. In Mzansi, a woman is murdered every three hours and many are assaulted and raped before their death. These mindless acts have taken their toll on society. Our recent history is replete with brutal unprovoked violence on women. Many perpetrators have been able to get away with their crimes without any form of legal sanction to punish them for their crimes and to serve as a deterrence to others. Women live in an insecure world filled with fear. They continue to endure unprecedented violence. Their harrowing ordeals are untold, unseen and unheard of. Strong investigative disciplinary mechanisms must be put in place for those who commit gender based violence. Perhaps, this poem whose author is unknown will galvanize the world,  Treat women with total civility. May I quote the following poem: “A real man never hurts a womanBe very careful when you make a woman cry. Because God counts her tears. The woman came out of a man’s rib. “Not from his feet to be walked on And not from his head to be superior “But from his side to be equal. Under the arm to be protected . And next to the heart to be loved.” Society must wrap our beloved women in the healing garments of reverence and respect Letter by Farouk Araie, Benoni
