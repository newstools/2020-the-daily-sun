HELMAN “Midnight Express” Mkhalele’s South African national Under-20 men’s team, Amajita, seem to be peaking at the right moment in the ongoing Cosafa Championship in Port Elizabeth. Having started slowly with a 2-2 draw against Zimbabwe in their first match, Amajita were well aware that they needed to significantly improve their performances for the remainder of the competition. And their 7-0 thumping of neighbours Lesotho last time out, was a strong statement of intent and a sign that Mkhalele’s boys are getting better with every match they play. They turn their attention to Mozambique in a top of the table clash at Wolfson Stadium today (3.30 pm) with a spot in the knockout stages of the competition up for grabs. Mkhalele wants his side to show the same vigour and ruthlessness they showed against Lesotho when they face a formidable Mozambique outfit that is currently unbeaten. “It is important for us to approach that game with the right mentality,” said Mkhalele. “We have to treat it as a final. We have to treat every game from now on as a final because there is only one ticket to go to the next round, and we have to win that game to get that ticket. “We have not entertained the idea of getting anything less than a win but we are aware of the danger that is posed by the opponent. They are yet to lose a game so we have to go and ensure that they lose their first match in this tournament.” Mkhalele has suggested that he could yet again tinker with his team as he looks to give more valuable game-time ahead of the business end of the competition. “We need to give all the players a chance to show what they can do,” added Mkhalele. “We believe in a 20 man squad and we must rotate as often as possible because when you look at the number of rest days for this tournament they are not that many. You have to utilize your squad well and have players who can adapt to the demands of the competition in the next round.”
