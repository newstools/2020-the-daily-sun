Cape Town City will look to continue their good run of form in the 2020-21 DStv Premiership when they take aim at TS Galaxy at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday evening. Kick-off is at 6pm CAT (SA, GMT+2). City extended their unbeaten run to four matches with a 2-1 away win over local rivals Stellenbosch FC on 15 December, with Thabo Nodada and Craig Martin scoring their goals. The Citizens have claimed five points from four home matches this season, with their last result as hosts a 2-2 draw with Orlando Pirates in early December. “We are feeling good as a team after such a convincing win in the derby against Stellenbosch. We have been showing some consistency in recent games, so we will be looking to continue that in the last game for 2020," said City midfielder Mduduzi Mdantsane. "We won't take anything for granted though, we have been putting in the same work ethic at training to prepare for this match and the boys will work extra hard to maintain our position on the log.” Galaxy saw their winless streak in the league extended to five matches (including back-to-back defeats) when they were beaten 2-0 at champions Mamelodi Sundowns on 15 December. The Rockets have claimed three points from four away matches this season and have yet to win on the road. “It is a lot of pressure because now we don’t want to get to a situation of desperation. We don’t want to be desperate," said Galaxy head coach Dan Malesela, whose team have scored the fewest goals in the league this season. “We’ve set ourselves the standard and we should be somewhere with points, but we are not there yet so it puts a lot of pressure on us. We’ve got to get maximum points in our final game of the year." In head-to-head statistics, this will be the first top-flight league meeting between Cape Town City and TS Galaxy. - SuperSport
