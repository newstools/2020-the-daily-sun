Tributes have been pouring in for veteran journalist and
South African ambassador to Uganda, Jon Qwelane, who died in hospital this
morning at the age of 68. Qwelane was appointed South Africa’s ambassador to Uganda in
2010. His death came amid his legal battle on a controversial
column that he wrote in 2008 titled 'Call me names but gay is not okay.' The alleged hate speech matter is now before the
Constitutional Court for declaration after the Supreme Court of Appeal
overturned the High Court decision which found Qwelane guilty of hate
speech. His family has asked for privacy during this difficult time. Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem, described Qwelane as a true
example of an ethical journalist. He said Qwelane was fighting the Apartheid Government with
his pen.  "A brave activist and freedom fighter. He was declared
enemy of the state for exposing injustices wherever it happened." "It is a very very sad day for South Africa," he
said. Bloem said: "We wish to express our sincere heartfelt
condolences to the Qwelane family, friends, and media fraternity."
