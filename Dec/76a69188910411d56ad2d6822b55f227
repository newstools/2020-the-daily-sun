ALLEGED killer Muzikayise Malephane made a brief and final appearance for the year in the South Gauteng High Court in central Joburg on Wednesday. The accused, charged with premeditated murder of Tshegofatso Pule Pule, will start his trial on 15 January. The confident-looking Malephane didn’t hide from cameras. Instead, he waved at his supporters promising to text them later. During his previous appearance last month, the state told the court it had received the representations made by Malephane’s defence and had responded to them. However, Malephane’s defence attorney Jolene Muir told the court they needed to consult with their client to make further representations for the pre-trial conference. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng, presiding on the matter, said there would no longer be a sitting for pre-trial. “There’s been a lot of postponements. Therefore, the matter will go straight to trial from 15 January,” he said. Lebo Moima from the Sister’s Keeper movement expressed joy that the matter was finally going forward. “We’ve been attending this case only to be met with five minutes appearances followed by postponements. I can say we are relieved that the trial will start. “We will not give up because we want justice for Pule and her unborn child, and the family to have closure,” she said. The eight-month pregnant Pule was found murdered and hanging from a tree at Durban Deep in Roodepoort in June. Malephane was arrested on 17 June while travelling back to Gauteng from Mpumalanga.
