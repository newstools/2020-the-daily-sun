THULANI “Tyson” Hlatshwayo says he regards Happy Jele as the Orlando Pirates captain and he will have no qualms letting him lift the MTN8 Cup on Saturday. The Buccaneers square off with Bloemfontein Celtic in the top-eight final at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday at 6pm, and Hlatshwayo is expected to lead the team. Jele has been warming the bench since Hlatshwayo, the Bafana Bafana captain, took his place in the starting line-up… and his captaincy armband. But “Tyson” regards Jele as the leader of the Buccaneers ship team and will allow a space to bask in cup glory, in the event Pirates win. “As the coach has mentioned and we all know in the team that Happy Jele is the club captain, he's the captain and he's the one who leads us,” said Hlatshwayo. “Personally, I will allow him and will be okay for him and me to lift the trophy.” Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer, however, has explained that Jele is still the team captain. ”Happy is sick. He's not here and wasn't at the training session. So when Happy is not here then Tyson is the next captain. He's the team captain, and that's the reason why Tyson is here,” Zinnbauer explained.
