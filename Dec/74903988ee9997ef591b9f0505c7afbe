THE SABC has intensified the Summer Song of the Year campaign, also known as Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka. This is despite the fact that Owen Ndlovu served the broadcaster with a letter, demanding it stop the campaign. Part of Ndlovu’s letter stated: “The SABC has unlawfully reproduced and continues to unlawfully reproduce a substantial part of or make adaptations of the song of the year/summer song through the ingoma project.” In terms of the letter, the concept of Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka, as it is now called, is owned by Owen Ndlovu and not by SABC, which has infringed on the Copyright Act. The letter further instructed the SABC to stop the campaign no later than 27 December. However, the public broadcaster has neither stopped the campaign nor responded to Owen and instead intensified its campaign. On Saturday, 26 December, the SABC invited the nominated artists to campaign live on Ukhozi FM. Ukhozi FM presenter Kathide “Tshatha” Ngobe assured listeners that there was no problem. “If there was a problem, we’d not hesitate to inform you. I am therefore encouraging you to vote,” he said. Tshatha then gave the artists the opportunity to campaign for their songs. Owen told Daily Sun he has not received any response from the SABC and that he would approach the court on Monday, 28 December to apply for an interdict against the SABC. Previously, SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolela told Daily Sun the campaign would not be stopped. “The SABC can confirm that the Ukhozi FM Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka will continue despite threats from Mr Ndlovu of Michael Owen Productions (MOP). “The SABC has no unresolved and/or outstanding legal disputes with MOP.” The SABC had promised to comment but at the time of going to print, it had not done so.
