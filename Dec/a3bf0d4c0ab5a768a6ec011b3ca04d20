Mfuleni sangoma Mavusi Gqola has surprised Khayelitsha fire victims with a Christmas box. Hundreds of people were displaced by fire in two incidents in Site C area last week. The popular sangoma has decided to surprise the fire victims with groceries so that they can cook and have a Christmas like everyone else. Papamani Ngcingi from the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) housing portfolio said Mavusi was like a father Christmas to the fire victims. “These two areas affected by the fire are having a great Christmas because of him, we are excited that someone have remembered us. He did not start helping the fire victims today, he brought food to us before but we didn’t expect him to deliver something on Christmas day,” said Ngcini. Resident Mzukisi Qumza (40) said Mavusi have got a big heart, he did not hope of having a decent meal on Christmas day.  “Everything that I had bought for Christmas all burnt down in my shack so I was not expecting to have a tummy full of food on Christmas. Mavusi is a sangoma with a good heart and we are happy he thought of us at our weakest moment when we cannot help ourselves,” said Qumza. The wheelchair-bound sangoma donated 40 kgs of meat, 10kgs of rice and 50 loves of bread and some cold drinks. “I knew they needed something for Christmas, I was with them from the beginning and I thought I should do something for them on this day,” said Mavusi. He said the grocery is for victims to cook together and eat. He said his next move is to help parents with their back to school struggles. “I’m still working with the leaders to compile a list of parents that have school-going kids so that I assist them with stationery and other things for school,” he said.
