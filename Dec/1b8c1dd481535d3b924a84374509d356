FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s matter returns to the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday, 8 December. His on-and-off corruption trial together with his co-accused, Thales, a French arms company accused of bribing, is expected to continue. The corruption, fraud and money laundering charges came from the country’s procurement of arms deal, and Zuma is alleged to have taken bribes in return for providing political protection to one of the winning bidders, Thales. The state first charged him in June 2005. Zuma has repeatedly denied the charges and said his prosecution was part of a political plot to persecute him. But his case may not go ahead as planned if the same court has not handed down its judgment in a separate court challenge brought by Thales. In June this year, Thales announced that after engaging with the National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Shamila Batohi on the racketeering charges brought against it, it had to seek court relief. The company filed an application and the case was heard towards the end of October and judgment was reserved. Since the Thales challenge is linked to the Zuma trial, in September the case had to be moved to the next date, 8 December. This was while all parties wait for the court to issue a judgment. The last time the matter was to be heard in court, all parties agreed to postpone it. In a statement issued on 9 September by NPA KZN spokeswoman Natasha Kara, the decision to postpone was because the French arms dealer wants the racketeering charges to be set aside. Should the court rule on time in the Thales vs NPA matter, the Zuma trial would proceed to another stage and parties would start exchanging the last batch of information and set provisional dates for the hearing. The state, which is confident of securing a conviction against Zuma, has already indicated that it would be ready by February next year to get the trial underway.
