A Limpopo family has been scammed of R100 000 by a fake cop
to squash a docket of their arrested loved. A fake cop allegedly contacted the family of the accused
person, identified himself as Enos from Serious Corruption Unit in Polokwane. He allegedly promised the desperate family heaven and earth
by making a docket disappear only if the money was paid. Captain Matimba Maluleke the spokesman for the Hawks in
Limpopo says after the money was paid the family members of the accused became
surprised when the matter was placed on the court roll as opposed to what they
were promised by the bogus Hawks member. “They then reported the matter to the real Hawks who are now
busy with the investigations.” “Whilst busy with the investigation, another report about
bogus Hawks member who was busy demanding money from the family of another
different accused person was received.” Maluleke said. Matimba further cautioned the public that there is no member
of the Hawks who can call family members of the arrested people and demand
money for their freedom. “If people are receiving such a call, they must know that
they are about to be swindled and they are requested to report to the nearest
police station.” Maluleke added.
