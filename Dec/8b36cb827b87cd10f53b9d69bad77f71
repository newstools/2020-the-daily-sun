THE two recyclers had a fight over empty cold drink bottles, but this was no ordinary fight. One man hit the other with a hammer and attacked another with a knife – and now the man is dead and his eyes are missing! Fellow recyclers suspect the recycler, who’s disappeared, took the eyes. By the time cops arrived on Monday, 28 December the suspect had already fled from Siyabonga Plastic Recycling in Pollak Park in Springs, Ekurhuleni. Cops have appealed for help in tracing the suspect. Captain Johannes Ramphora said a worker at the company found two men at the gate when she arrived in the morning. “She found two males known to her as their customers,” he said. “We believe the two men argued over a black plastic with empty bottles for recycling.” I HATE POKING PASTORS! He said cops were told a rubbish collector known as Shluthu assaulted the other one known as Nhlanhla with a hammer several times on the head until he fell down on the ground. “The suspect allegedly took a knife and stabbed the victim several times on the upper body and he removed the eyes of the victim and ran towards Kwa Thema hostel,” said Ramphora. He said they looked for eyes but couldn’t find them. Another recycler said it was shocking that people were so angry. “We suspect there was something else behind the attack. “You can’t kill someone so brutally over empty bottles.” The victim was certified dead by paramedics. A case docket of murder was opened at Springs police station and cops are looking for the suspect. Captain Ramphora said the suspect was wearing black tracksuit pants and a red top and is about 1,6 metres tall. Anyone who has information can contact Springs police station on 011 365 5705.
