AC MILAN and Inter Milan will be vying to end the year top of the Serie A table tonight as the city rivals push to deny Juventus a 10th consecutive “Scudetto” this season. Leaders AC Milan’s unbeaten league run, which stretches back to March, faces a stiff test against Lazio in the San Siro. “We have one game left against Lazio and we might be able to achieve our first objective (staying top of Serie A) on 23 December,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. “It would add to our success in the Europa League this season, so we’d end a very positive year.” But Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan are just one point behind in second before their trip to ninth-placed Hellas Verona. Inter last won the Serie A title in 2010, with Milan taking the honours the following year. Since then Juventus have dominated. Juventus can also take advantage of injury worries among their rivals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic remains out for a sixth consecutive league match for Milan with a leg muscle injury, even if Pioli’s side have shown they can win without Ibrahimovic. But Pioli also has a crisis in midfield with Ismaël Bennacer out, Franck Kessie suspended, and Sandro Tonali, Ante Rebic and Simon Kjaer in doubt. “I’d like to have more options to choose from, but we’ll make the best of the situation as always,” said Pioli. “The squad has always done well in turning difficulties into a chance to show something different and better. But we still have a very difficult match to play, probably with few players available.” Conte’s focus is firmly on the league after his Champions League hopes came to an abrupt end. Inter’s domestic form has been better. They are on a six-match winning streak and have proved a tighter unit this month, with fewer goals conceded. – AFP
