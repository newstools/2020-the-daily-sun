FORMER Orlando Pirates coach Milutin ”Micho” Sredojevic will appear in court in February on sexual assault charges! Micho was on Friday granted bail of R10 000 by the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court and will be back in court on 25 February 2021, the NPA have confirmed. It is alleged the incident happened at the Cosafa tournament at Wolfson Stadium on Monday when the Zambia national team coach was one of the spectators. An unnamed woman was allegedly delivering coffee at the stadium when she asked Micho if he would need sugar with his coffee. He allegedly said no and disclosed that he'd need another type of sugar while pointing at his private parts. The woman reported the matter to her boss who in turn warned Micho not to do it again. But later that day, the lady went to deliver coffee again at the same venue. And this time Micho allegedly touched her buttocks. It is not the first time that the Serbia native has faced such accusations after he allegedly tried to force himself on a hotel cleaner last year. Micho summarily resigned from his position at Pirates and left the country. The police confirmed to local media that a case of the sexual offence had been opened, but did not disclose his name of the ”sports personality”.
