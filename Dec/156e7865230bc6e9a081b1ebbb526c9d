Kaizer Chiefsâ€™ 0-0 draw with Primeiro de Agosto in the CAF Champions League on Wednesday stretched their recent run to a single victory in 11 games, a hugely disappointing end to a difficult year for the AmaKhosi. But it is not their worst series of results in recent times, they had a similarly poor return at the tail-end of the 2015-16 Premier Soccer League season and the start of the next, in which they won just a single game in 15, a set of fixtures that also included Champions League matches. Since Chiefs beat Chippa United on 27 October, they have a single win, six draws and four defeats, including two against rivals Orlando Pirates. Their only win came away against Cameroon side PWD Bamenda in the Champions League, while they have managed just seven goals in those 11 games. It is reminiscent of their poor run in 2015/16, which coincidentally also started with a defeat to Pirates. A victory away at University of Pretoria was coupled with six draws and eight defeats. The run was ended by a 1-0 away win over Highlands Park, before they went on a four-game winning run to ease the pressure on then coach Steve Komphela. That was followed by no wins in nine games, which in turn was followed by five straight victories and an unbeaten run of 14 matches as Chiefs showed their true Jekyll and Hyde persona. Current coach Gavin Hunt will be desperate not to match that previous record poor run, which remains an unwanted mark for the club in the Premier Soccer League era. They are next in action away at Primeiro de Agosto in the return leg of their Champions League tie on January 6. That is followed by a home game against Maritzburg United three days later, and then away trips to AmaZulu and Cape Town City. -SuperSport.com
