GOGO Zithombi Ndlovu (77) and her sister-in-law, Amelia Mazibuko (64), are in a bitter struggle over a house. They’re fighting over a two-bedroom house situated on Khawula Road in Lamontville, south of Durban. Zithombi told Daily Sun she’s been living in the house all her life, but Amelia wants to throw her out. “The house belonged to my father, Thatheyakhe Ndlovu,” said Zithombi. “ Before my father died he said his older son Mandla must look after the house, and that if he moves out my younger brother Enock should take over.” HUSBAND: WHY I DIDNT BURY MSHOZA! But Mandla got married and moved out of the family house. Enock found a girlfriend. “Enock and Amelia started dating in the mid-1990s. But their relationship turned sour and Amelia stopped visiting. “When my brother fell sick I told her as she always claimed to be his makoti.” She said after Enock died in 2015, she didn’t hear from Amelia until 2018. “Then she served me with a notice to vacate the house. It’s a family house and Enock was only given the task of looking after it.” Amelia refused to comment, except to say: “The matter is in court and I will not comment.”
