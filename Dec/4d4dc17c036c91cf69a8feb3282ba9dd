TS GALAXY have fired coach Dan Malesela following a dismal start to the 2020-21 season. Malesela becomes the fourth Premier Soccer League (PSL) casualty this season after Baroka FC fired Dylan Kerr who then went to Black Leopards to replace Patrick Aussems who was the second coach to lose his job. Eric Tinkler was the third coach to be sown the exit door when he was released by Maritzburg United couple of weeks ago. "TS Galaxy FC has parted ways with coach, Dan Malesela following a string of poor results which saw the club failing to win a match in the last six Dstv Premiership matches," the club said in a statement. Malesela re-joined the Rockets at the start of the season having left the club 13th in the GladAfrica Championship log last season. The Rockets are currently languishing 12th in the Dstv Premiership with seven points after eight games. Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi, said it was not an easy decision to take however, they had to do it. Sukazi stated: “The decision to part ways with Coach Dan was not an easy one as he has a rich history with our club. Unfortunately,  football is a result driven business and decisions such as this can only be based on results than history." “Coach Dan will always be highly regarded at our club and his name will remain well documented in our history books.” Sukazi added. Zipho Dlangalala will take over the coaching reins on an interim basis and will be assisted by Esau Mtsweni. “Coach Zipho will be our Head Coach in the interim. All I can do is to wish him well because he deserves the opportunity to assume the Head Coaching role on a permanent basis but only time will tell. "He is a very good Coach whom I believe has the potential that is yet to be realised at the top level of the game. "Coach Zipho will be assisted by Coach Esau Mtsweni who has been serving on the same role for quite some time. We believe there is good synergy between the two Coaches which could bring success to our Club."
