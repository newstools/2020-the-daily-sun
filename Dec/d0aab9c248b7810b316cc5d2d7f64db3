THE festive season is well underway and crime is at a peak. On Wednesday, 9 December, various partners including JMPD, cops, City Parks and EMPD led a motorcade in an attempt to create awareness during this busy time of the year. Speaking to Daily Sun, Kgothatso Moloto, president of the Voices in Action organisation, said they engaged with various government departments to plan the event. “Our meeting point was at the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Joburg and we moved from one crime hotspot to another. “We want to remind the public that all these departments and stakeholders are here to serve them,” said Moloto. He explained that they normally had the event at a venue, but had to avoid overcrowding due to Covid-19 and go to the people. “We are here to say no to gender-based violence, substance abuse, human trafficking and any other crime,” he said. Moloto emphasised that everyone had an important role to play, including the community.  “Community members live among drug dealers and human traffickers. We need them on board to play an active role in cleaning out lawlessness,” he said. A woman from Hillbrow said they had no problem reporting crimes, but their concern was their safety.  She claimed that some police officers were friends with criminals and took bribes from them.  “I’ve learnt my lesson. I reported crime where I used to live and the very criminals threaten me and my family,” she said. She said that’s why they choose to mind their business, even when they witness criminal activities.
