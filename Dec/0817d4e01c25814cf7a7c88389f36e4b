Police in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge have opened a concealment of birth case after a foetus was found dumped in a mall’s toilet. The horrific incident was discovered by security guards who alerted the police in the early hours of this morning, 19 December. One of the guards said she went into the toilet to pee and discovered something that looked like a baby. “I rushed to alert my other colleagues. We were all shocked,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Donald Mdhluli said a foetus was discovered in a plastic bag in a toilet at the mall by guards, who then brought the matter to the attention of the police. “A case of concealment of birth case was opened for further investigation and the suspect is still unknown at this stage. A manhunt has been launched and we want to appeal to residents around the Acornhoek policing area to come forward and help with information on the whereabouts of this mother. “We strongly condemn such incidents because parents are supposed to be protectors of their children. We want to warn the community to stop committing acts of illegal abortion or abandoning their babies but instead, consult with the relevant organisations or government departments for assistance. “Anyone with information that can assist in the investigation is urged to call the CrimeStop number on 08600 10111,” said colonel Mdhluli
