IT would appear Mzansi teachers bear the brunt of Covid-19’s second wave, which is wreaking havoc all over the country. Education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga took to Twitter to express his concerns. He said there was a looming massive problem which could hit the education sector. He tweeted that last week 14 teachers from one province had died from the virus, and a day later 18 others died. “Grief over these holidays is too much,” he tweeted. Education director-general, Mathanzima Mweli, said the department was alarmed. According to Mweli, the impact of the virus will have a bearing on the marking of the matric exam papers. “The immediate impact of the virus is that it’ll be on the national level of the marking of the National senior certificate flowing to the teaching and learning, and when schools reopen we are extremely worried about the impact in getting every teacher for every learner,” he said He said the department’s plan is to visit all the marking centres so that when he reports back to Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and the MECs, he’d have seen first-hand what his colleagues have told him. He advised people to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. “Let’s continue wearing masks, keep a social distance and washing hands,” he said.
