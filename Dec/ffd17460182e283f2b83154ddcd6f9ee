TOKOLOSHES are rejoicing, sangomas are angry, and the ancestors are disappointed. Sangomas have told Daily Sun they need rivers to cleanse bad spirits, connect with the ancestors, and get rid of tokoloshes. Mhlonishwa Mkhize, a member of the Abathwali Bemithi Traditional Healers Organisation, said: “Water represents life. “We often go to the river as per instructions from ancestors, and they’re not happy with the closure. “We use the river for amathwasa to communicate with the ancestors and remove bad spirits.” He said sangomas never go to the river in groups.  “Only a few go at a time. We observe the use of masks and other health measures,” he said. He said people’s reckless behaviour had prevented them from performing their duties. “Government has failed to recognise the work we do for communities,” he said. “We’ve never been consulted for our input in the fight against the virus. “Our members aren’t happy with the decision but respect regulations. “We’ve asked our clients to be patient. This is also hard on them because the longer we delay treatment that requires going to the river, the more they suffer. Gobela Mamtolo Mangena said she used to take clients to the river almost every day. “We treat our clients in the ndumba, but most of the work is carried out in the river,” she said. “People are haunted by tokoloshes, which are after their money or sleep with them. I treat them with muthi at my indumba, but after that I have to take them to the flowing river so the tokoloshe can be swept away. “People will continue suffering from tokoloshe and evil spirit attacks.” On Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa moved the country back to level 3 after Covid-19 cases went over the one million mark. All beaches, dams, lakes, rivers, public parks and public swimming pools in hot spot areas are closed.
