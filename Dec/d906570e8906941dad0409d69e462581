An unemployed mother of three is asking for help after her two-roomed house burnt down. Thabelo Tshishonga (32) of Tshimbupfe-Mavhulani Village in Vuwani, Limpopo, said on Saturday night, 5 December, she went to a church gathering in Maniini Village just outside Thohoyandou. She said the church event was to celebrate a prophet’s newborn baby. “I sent my children to my mother who also lives nearby. “She was taking care of them as I went to attend the night vigil. I was happy as I was singing and praising God. “I didn’t think there was trouble in my house. My mother tried to phone me, but unfortunately my phone’s battery was flat and she couldn’t get hold of me,” said Thabelo. Thabelo said her pastor Prophet Gundo Nemandivhe, who she had visited after the event, got a call from her mother informing him that her house had caught fire and everything had burnt to ashes. She said she nearly fainted when she heard the news. She said the cause of the fire is not known. “I don’t fight with anybody here in our village as I’m a loving and peaceful person who enjoys going to church. I don’t know where I will stay with my children as Christmas is approaching now,” said Thabelo. Solly Mudau, the ward 13 councillor in Collins Chabane Municipality, said after they heard about the incident they went to investigate. She said they would place her name on the list of those who qualified for RDP houses as she is unemployed. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said an arson case is being investigated by the Vuwani police.
