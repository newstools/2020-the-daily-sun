THE Basic Education Department has announced it’s ready for the 2021 academic year. Minister Angie Motshekga said schools would reopen on 25 January and pupils were expected back on the 27th. She said all provinces had finalised admission processes and the district offices would be available to assist parents where needed. Briefing the media in Tshwane on Thursday 17 December, Motshekga said since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the department had been monitoring the state of provinces on a weekly basis to ensure there were systems in place to provide support. “We’ll maintain the delicate balance of health and safety in schools and ensure that we plug the gaps in the curriculum recovery,” she said. “Senior managers in the sector, under the leadership of the director-general, will be working during the festive season to put final touches to the already existing plan for 2021.” Motshekga said the main focus of monitoring the reopening process would be ensuring schools were ready and that blockages were addressed on time. The minister gave an update on the matric exams, which came to an end on Tuesday. She said things were proceeding well until the leaking of some of the question papers. “As a sector, we sought to have candidates rewrite the leaked papers,” she told the People’s Paper. “We strongly believe, as we still do, that this was the only way to address the lingering questions regarding the credibility and fairness of the exams.” She said the recent North Gauteng High Court ruling against the department didn’t taking into account the credibility and fairness of the National Senior Certificate. Motshekga said her department’s legal team was exploring avenues to be used in addressing what she referred to as errors in the judgment.
