MAMELODI Sundowns star midfielder Themba “Mshishi” Zwane is convinced they can surpass the 71-points tally achieved by the club in 2015-16 season. Zwane said this record can be beaten having seen how Downs’ two new strikers, Peter Shalulile and Kermit Erasmus, have adapted to the side. The deadly front three have been at the forefront of everything good in Sundowns, so far. They are being compared to the devastating attacking trio in 2016 known as the CBD, which was made up of Leonardo Castro, Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly. With Shalulile and Erasmus slowly forming that telepathic understanding alongside Zwane, the 31-year-old Mshishi believes they have similarities to the CBD and said they can also win everything on offer, both locally and internationally. The 71 points smashed by Sundowns then is the record tally points attained by the winning club since the PSL changed the format from 18 to 16 teams ahead of 2002-03 season. “We can do it, why not,” said Zwane, who was named DStv Player of the Month for October/November on Monday. “With the quality players that we have and the way we have started, if we can carry on like this and be more consistency, why not?” In 2016 when reaching the 71 point record, the Tshwane giants built up consistency and went 18 domestic games without a loss, smashing Orlando Pirates 17 match unbeaten record achieved in the 2004-05 season. Zwane said it is of paramount importance to continue playing well and build the gap at the top of the league, because there’s plenty of games to come for Sundowns in this congested season. The road in the Caf Champions League is now clear for the 10-time league champions. They face Botswana side Jwaneng Galaxy in the first round later this month. “That will be good for us because we know when we start the Champions League, there are difficult games that side,” said Zwane. “You have to count in the travelling. So it is very key that we have started this well (domestically).”
