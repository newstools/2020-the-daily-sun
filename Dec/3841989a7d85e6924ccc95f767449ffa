WITH Covid-19 bringing the world to a standstill, people can’t wait to spend Christmas Day with their loved ones. Some of Mzansi’s favourite celebs shared with Daily Sun their Christmas plans. Gomora actress Sannah Mchunu said she will be spending the day with her children. “This year has been tough and I am happy the festive season has arrived because I can finally take some time off and spend quality time with my family and reflect,” she said. “I normally cook up a feast on Christmas Day and invite my friends and family. But it will be different this year because of the lockdown regulations. It will be an intimate lunch with my children.” Radio personality Dineo Ranaka said her Christmas plans changed dramatically this year.  “As we all know, the Ranakas are a big family and we go all out to be together on Christmas Day. “That has changed this year. We decided to keep it minimal as we have elderly people in the family and we considered that they can easily get infected.” Musical duo Malumz on Decks said two events were lined up on the day. “As we cannot be with everyone as usual, we will spend the day with our immediate family and attend two events later, which we are booked for,” said Oscar Nyathi.. Maano of Mapara A Jazz said they will spend the day with their families. “Since our gigs were cancelled and some postponed due to the second wave, we will spend the day with our families,” he said. Comedian Coconut Kelz also shared how the pandemic changed her Christmas.  “Christmas looks very different this year. We normally have a big lunch with my whole family in Durban, but this year we have all split into small groups, which is difficult but necessary,” she said. DJ Sithelo Shozi said nothing has changed much for her.  “I will spend Christmas with my family, singing, stuffing our faces with good food and taking pictures for the family album,” she said.
