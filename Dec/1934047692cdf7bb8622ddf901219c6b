CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink will head back home to the Netherlands a happy man. The 57-year-old Dutch mentor has guided his side to a decent start to the season, and is satisfied with how they finished the year. They saw off TS Galaxy 3-2 in their final match of the year as they continued to surge up the DStv Premiership log. The Citizens, who are fourth on the log, are just three points adrift of joint leaders Mamelodi Sundowns and Swallows FC. Riekerink will be determined to ensure his side pick up from where they left off when the season resumes next month. But for now, he is looking forward to returning home and spending some time with his family over the festive period. “I’m looking forward to going back to Holland for a couple of days to see my family after more than a year,” said Riekerink. “That is my personal side that the public can’t see. “I have two daughters aged 20 and 22, and so I’m happy that I can go back and spend some time with them.” Riekerink, who was struggling to get his philosophy across last year at this time, has completely turned the corner. His side was flirting with relegation in the last Christmas recess but now look like a completely different outfit this year. They will look to maintain their bright start to the season when the face this season’s surprise package Swallows FC in their first game of 2021. The encounter will take place at the Dobsonville Stadium on 5 January.
