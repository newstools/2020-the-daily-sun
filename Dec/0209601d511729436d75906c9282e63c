Sportswomen will know that the most important moments are the moments before the big game. Those final hours before the big showdown can determine one’s Big Match Temperament. One of the most important aspects during these final moments is the diet. What a sportswoman eats before the game can determine the type of game they’re going to have. The same thing can be said about sex. Dieticians often say we are what we eat, and the same rule applies to sex. So, what should women eat before sex? 1. Chocolate This sweet treat is linked with the release of serotonin, a hormone that encourages feelings of happiness and well-being. 2. Avocado This creamy green fruit is packed with heart-healthy fats and fibre that can deliver lasting energy in the bedroom. 3. Strawberries These sensual fruits are high in vitamin C, which may help rev up your sex drive, boost blood flow, and ease stress and anxiety. And strawberries are great for orgasms.
