TWO inmates have escaped from Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre in Tshwane on Wednesday. Few details were given on how they managed to escape from one of the most high-security prisons in Mzansi, with its layers of cell bars, fencing, high walls and boom gates. The Department of Correctional Services spokesman, Singabakho Nxumalo, said they had launched a manhunt following the escape of two sentenced inmates from Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre. He said the escapees were a Mozambican man, Thabo Zacharia Muyambo, who was serving a life sentence for 21 counts of various crimes including rape, robbery and kidnapping as well as Johannes Chauke from Zimbabwe, who was serving 20 years for house breaking offences. “The two are still at large and members of the Emergency Support Team from Correctional Services are working closely with the SAPS and they are hot on their heels. These escapees shall be brought back behind bars,” he said. Nxumalo said the department had also initiated an internal investigation into the incident. “Members of the public are urged to contact their nearest police stations should they come into contact with the escapees,” he said. It’s not the first time that inmates had escaped from Kgosi Mampuru. In May, Zimbabwean men Morris Tyavana, Medicine Girenzi, Amos Chikwange and Sam Hlungwane were awaiting trial on charges including theft, armed robbery and housebreaking when they escaped.
