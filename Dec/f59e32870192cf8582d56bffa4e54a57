American pop culture magazine Complex has named the Yezzy foam sneaker the best sneaker of 2020. The exciting news was shared by Mrs West herself on both Twitter and Instagram. ?????? https://t.co/89u2pN7CV6  American rapper and businessman Kanye West released his much-awaited Yeezy Foam runners in June and at first they were made fun of on social media because of their rather odd design. The futuristic yet simplistic design is a slip-on crafted from one solid piece of a unique new YEEZY material – a blend of harvested algae and EVA materials. The aerodynamic silhouette features holes and ridges throughout and is rendered in a white or “Ararat” colourway. As much as these Yeezy foam runners were made fun of, they were sold out upon release.
