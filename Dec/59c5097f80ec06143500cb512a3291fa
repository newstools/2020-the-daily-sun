Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane says she is confident the court will clear her of any wrongdoing in her perjury case.  Mkhwebane was served with a summons to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court to face charges of perjury. The case was opened by non-profit organisation Accountability Now in August 2019. Mkhwebane said that as a law-abiding citizen, she would cooperate and present herself to the court on 21 January. She added she was confident that the court would clear her of any wrongdoing. According
 to a statement issued on Friday, Mkhwebane said she "learned through 
media reports that [Advocate] [Paul] Hoffman SC has now written to 
President Cyril Ramaphosa, requesting him to suspend her". On 
Tuesday, the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions decided to 
prosecute Mkhwebane for perjury, NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema said.       The Constitutional Court judgment upheld
 the February 2018 Gauteng High Court ruling that Mkhwebane pay 15% of 
the Reserve Bank's legal fees in the Absa/Bankorp review case. It 
agreed with a lower court rulingÂ that her entire Absa/Bankorp 
investigation was flawed and that she was not honest during her 
investigation. The Public Protector, in a report published on 19 
June 2017, had tasked the Special Investigating Unit with recovering 
R1.125 billion in, "misappropriated public funds", describing the funds 
as an "illegal gift" given to Bankorp by the SA Reserve Bank in the 
1980s.  Since Bankorp and other banks were later absorbed into Absa, Mkhwebane ruled that the funds be recovered from Absa.    - Compiled by Jeanette Chabalala and Adiel Ismail News24
