The Marcus
Garvey community in Philippi East, Cape Town is still shocked after a
21-year-old man was shot and killed inside his house. One of the
residents who asked his name not to be named said the deceased was with his
friends. "It
was around 21:45 when I heard gunshots, I didn't go out because I was afraid of
being involved in something I did not know," said the resident. After a few
minutes, cops arrived and that is when he went out of his house to check what
was happening. "I was
shocked to hear that he was shot after someone came running into his house,
imagine being killed inside your house," said the resident. Captain FC
Van Wyk said Philippi East SAPS members were busy with their routine patrol
when they received a complaint of a shooting that took place in Road 28, Marcus
Garvey. "Upon
arrival, they found the body of a 21-year-old man fatally wounded," said
Van Wyk. He said
according to reports the deceased was sitting in his house with his friends
when an unknown man came running being chased by unknown men. “When the
unknown men entered the house the suspects entered and shoot him twice in the
back and shoot the deceased in the head, he died on the scene due to injuries
sustained.” Van Wyk said. The
suspects also took a laptop before fleeing the scene on foot. “A murder
and attempted murder case were registered for investigation,” said Van Wyk. Another
resident said as a community the incident left them shocked and afraid. "It is
clear that the person who was running from the suspect was running for his
life, he didn't know that entering into the deceased house will end up like
this," said the resident. He said
maybe he thought if he entered a room they would leave him alone. "Criminals
are heartless and they only think about themselves or what they want, where are
we going to be safe when they have the nerve to kill people in their homes,
they deserve to rot in jail and I pray that they get arrested," said the
resident.
