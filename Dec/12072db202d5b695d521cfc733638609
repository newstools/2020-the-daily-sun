It’s important for women to stand together to fight abuse. Women, don’t allow men to do as they please with your bodies. Women must be strong and open up about their abuse. You don’t have to remain silent because one day you will end up being dead. Every day women are killed, raped and brutalised, not by monsters, but by the men with whom they share their beds, homes, workplaces, churches and streets. Violence against women and children is not a government or criminal justice system problem, but a societal problem. Failure to view it as such results in all efforts failing to eradicate this scourge in our communities. Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
