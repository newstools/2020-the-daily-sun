There’s a disturbing trend of parents believing they must neglect their duties as parents because it’s the festive season. Some parents even think it’s okay to give permission to young children to drink on certain holidays. They expose kids as young as nine to alcohol. In certain households, parents ask children to join adults in the festive drinking and merry-making. Concerned neighbours in Philippi East found out the hard way when they tried to be good citizens and stop young kids from abusing alcohol. The rude kids simply told them to voetsek! They said they were given money and permission by their parents to buy alcohol and drink. Underage drinking is harmful to a developing body and mind. Kids who start drinking young are more likely to become addicted to alcohol and even engage in violent behaviour that may lead to crime. Parents who give teenagers money to buy alcohol this festive season, thinking they’re showing them love are tragically mistaken. They’re only sending their kids down a rabbit hole. – Editor.
