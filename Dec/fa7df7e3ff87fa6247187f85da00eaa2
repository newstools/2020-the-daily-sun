THE moment of truth has arrived for the South African Under-20 men’s national team, Amajita. This as they are set to take their first step in their journey to qualify for the 2021 U-20 Fifa World Cup scheduled for Indonesia. But it all begins in the Cosafa U-20 Championship which gets underway on Thursday afternoon in Port Elizabeth. And Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele’s charges get their campaign up and running with a clash against Zimbabwe at Wolfson Stadium (3.30pm). Amajita have to reach the final of the competition to earn a spot in the 2021 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Mauritania. There, they’ll have the right to fight for a spot in the World Cup, a tournament they have reached no less than four times. They’ve played in the last two World Cup after qualifying for the 2017 edition in South Korea as well as last year in Poland. Mkhalele, who was then Thabo Senong’s assistant in those competitions, now has the responsibility to maintain that standard. He stressed the importance of beginning this long arduous journey on a positive note in the Cosafa Cup. “The aim is to use this tournament to reach next year’s U-20 Afcon tournament,” said Mkhalele. “For that to happen, we need to make it to the final of the Cosafa Cup and, of course, we want to win it.” Mkhalele, who inherited Senong’s team when he took over, has started to build his own. The only surviving member of the World Cup squad, Oswin Appollis, will be a key man for Amajita, alongside captain Rowan Human and Keletso Sifama of Kaizer Chiefs. “I’m happy with the squad that we’ve assembled for this year’s tournament,” added Mkhalele. “None of this would have been possible if it weren’t for the tremendous support we had received from various clubs in releasing their players for this camp. “For that, we’re truly grateful. This gives us ample time and sapce to prepare and work with the players leading up to this crucial event. It also allows players to gel,” he said.
