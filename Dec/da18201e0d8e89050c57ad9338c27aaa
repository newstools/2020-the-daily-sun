It’s not always that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is busy dealing with the issues affecting Mzansi citizens. She also has to take time out of her busy schedule to have a little bit of fun. In a video that surfaced on Twitter, Mkwebane is seen walking between two ladies doing challenge while laughing. Dressed in all-black attire, Mkwebane walked and threw a few jabs much to the amusement of the crowd that was screaming  on the side-lines. But not everyone is impressed that the Public Protector is involved in the #DuduzaneWalkChallenge. The video was posted by Dudu Zuma-Sambudla on her twitter account with a caption “The People’s Public Protector." Twitter users were left divided with others saying she is wasting time by joining the challenge when there is a lot to do. Others liked Mkhwebane’s fun side which she showed in public. Omkile Mkhile commented and said: “Still waiting for the proceeds of the Estina Dairy farm." Another Twitter Goolam said: “The disgraceful lady lost yet another case, this time in the Pravin Gordhan/ Ivan Pillay matter. She should be removed from office immediately and if you have so much confidence in her, make her the head of your fathers legal team.” But others defended her citing Mkhwebane’s recent achievement. “The 1st black woman yepublic protector yama clean audits in history,” said a Tweep. Mkhwebane recently lost a court case after the Constitutional Court dismissed her appeal where she sought to access former President Jacob Zuma’s tax records. Her appeal to halt the National Assembly from instituting process from the office was also dismissed by the Western Cape High Court earlier this month. Meanwhile the Public Protector is expected in court for three counts perjury next month after she was recently served with the summons.
