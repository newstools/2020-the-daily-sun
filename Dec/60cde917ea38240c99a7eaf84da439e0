GUGULETHU residents want the NY79 Stadium to be renamed after late soccer star, Anele Ngcongca. Residents, including soccer star Thobela “King” Bikwani, said Anele put the Cape Town kasi on the world map. The former Bafana Bafana and SuperSport United player said Anele deserved honour. “He was the first South African player to go for trials with Arsenal. When I say a giant has fallen, I mean it. Anele played football at the highest level,” said Thobela. “He played for the country at the World Cup and Afcon. After his funeral, we’re calling for the stadium to be named after him. We must remember Anele as a legend.” Resident Bongani Mhlatuzana (35) said he used to play soccer at the local grounds with Anele and it would be an honour for the stadium to be named after him. “Anele’s record speaks for itself. He was the finest footballer to have come out of Gugulethu. In Belgium, they’re honouring him. He played for our national team and served with distinction,” he said.  Thobela said he had plans with Anele to start a football academy to train kids from the kasi.  “Sadly, he passed on before achieving this.”We didn’t plan to only cater to Gugulethu kids. We wanted to go to other townships around Cape Town,” he said. He said he would continue with the project alone and would launch it next month.
