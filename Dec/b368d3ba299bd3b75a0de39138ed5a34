My heart bleeds when I see people sleep at post offices to be the first in the long queues for the R350 social relief grants. The never-ending queues at post offices are overwhelming. The Post Office should consider providing mobile offices to reach more people and reduce these unnecessary long queues. It’s painful because many people need the R350 for much-needed things such as food and there’s nothing they can do but to endure the long-gruelling queues. Letter by Slight Ramphaka, Florida
