A MAN (50) arrested for allegedly raping a minor (10) will spend Christmas in jail. This comes after he made a brief appearance in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 23 December. Angry protesters who came to support the victim’s family opposed bail outside court. Magistrate Tanya Du Preez told the accused that he was facing a very serious and it was his right to get a lawyer from his own pocket or from a legal board. The man opted from legal representative Eric Mashele from the legal aid board, who also confirmed it before the court. Police arrested him after he allegedly raped a girl down the valley which cuts through the Welverdiend Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. The victim’s aunt (27) said she received a call from her sister (23) saying the little girl had been raped. “The girl sadly said she has been raped by the man known in the village. It happened after he lured her with snacks, dragging her down the valley in broad daylight where he raped her. The accused also threatened to kill her if she told anyone. Doctors at hospital confirmed she was raped. So he must go and rot in jail,” said the aunt. Welverdiend Community Development Forum secretary Fortune Ndlovu said: “Residents are protesting outside court. They angrily handed over a petition to the court opposing his bail. We believe that should the court grant him bail, there is a likelihood the community would undermine confidence in the criminal justice system and ultimately react in anger which could put life of the accused at risk.” The matter has been postponed to Tuesday, 29 December, for a formal bail application.
