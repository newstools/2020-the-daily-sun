ANGRY spirits are causing crashes which lead to innocent people dying. Sangoma Majoko Hlongwane (50) told Daily Sun dead people are angry because their families didn’t fetch their spirits and that’s why people on Solomon Mahlangu Road in Nellmapius fell victim to accidents. She said there was an angry person who died on that same place years ago and his spirit was not taken and was causing accidents. “When a person dies, especially in a crash, his spirit becomes angry and the family members must perform rituals in the area to appease him and the ancestors,” she said.  She said family members should use snuff to communicate with spirits before taking them to their places. “They must bring a white cloth and perform the rituals and tell those people they are taking them home. If those rituals are not performed, many will die in the same place.” Thwasa Francinah Tshabalala (45) said sometimes when she passes nearby, she can feel the spirits of the dead people. “We must reduce the accidents in the area. These spirits need to be collected by the families.” Prophet Phumlani Ngobese (47) said it was often because of evil spirits that people died. He said we must not forget devils existed and wanted bad things to happen to good people. “We need to come and pray for the spiritual cleansing of the area to overcome the evil spirits.” Gertrude Maile (56) said the accidents have been happening in the area for years.“I call the place an evil spot because people die there. This is not reckless driving or speeding, but an evil spirit.” January Baloyi (37) said many of them ride bicycles and it’s sad that people die without reaching home or work. “You can’t believe how these people die here. It’s like something is calling them,” he said. January said he was always careful when using the road.
