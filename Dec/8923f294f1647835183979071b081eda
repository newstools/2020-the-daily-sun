SIPHO Mhlongo’s kotas are rocking his kasi. And not only are they delicious, they have catchy names. “As one of the entry-level kotas with cheese is called Cheese Boy, I needed something for the ladies. So Slay Queen seemed an appropriate name for one of the more expensive kotas,” said Sipho. He said the Slay Queen was now one of the most famous items on the menu. “Every time a customer orders the Slay Queen, they giggle and make jokes like ‘I want to eat a Slay Queen today’,” said Sipho. The 42-year-old from Naturena, south of Joburg started his business, Gaulo Street Food in 2017. He told Daily Sun he used to cater at events and for corporate clients.  “At that point, I was running another business selling video analysis software for sports clubs,” said Sipho. He said he started focusing fully on his restaurant in 2018. “I was optimistic at the beginning of 2020 and looked forward to having a food stall at the Rand Show. “Then Covid-19 happened and all plans came to an abrupt halt,” he said. Sipho said he couldn’t do much as he ran out of funds to resume his business. “I was able to start again at the beginning of September and decided to park my food trailer at the corner of my street as events are still closed,” said Sipho. He said he had an ordering and customer loyalty App, Gaulo Street Food, which customers can download from the Play Store. “They get 10% off when they order via the App and R20 free when they order for the first time,” said Sipho.
