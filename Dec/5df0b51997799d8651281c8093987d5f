YOU just can't stop the man! When you're good there's nothing that will hit brakes on you. Pitso Mosimane has delivered his second treble with two different clubs in one season respectively, with the latest being with his new club Al Ahly whom he guided to the 2020 Caf Champions League victory, Egyptian Premier League and the Egyptian Cup at the weekend. This was just months away from his victorious season with his former club Mamelodi Sundowns whom he left with the 2019-20 Premiership title, Telkom Knockout and Nedbank Cup. Astonishing, isn't it? Mosimane's side beat El Gaish 3-2 on penalties in the Egyptian Cup following a 1-1 stalemate at regulated time. “We still have two tournaments left to win, and we have to fight to clinch them,” was the ambitious statement from the coach from Kagiso. He was ecstatic following the nerve-wrecking defeat of Talae’e El Gaish: “When I was at Mamelodi Sundowns we got knocked out of the Caf Champions League, but the fate decided to bring me back in to win it with Al Ahly. El Gaish are a tough opponent and they played a good game, but at the end we succeeded to win the title.” In case you are awake and still celebrating.. Watch & enjoy ????#TrebleChampions pic.twitter.com/pjE8tbzEZh  ????♥??? https://t.co/24oIDfrk8M
