THE COVID-19 pandemic has upended all areas of life and sports is no exception. However, Netball South Africa Cecilia Molokwane is cheerful that the Spar National Netball Championship are finally happening. The tournament which was initially scheduled to take place in Stellenbosch in August, started yesterday (Monday) in Bela-Bela Limpopo province. It will run until Saturday where champions will be crowned in both A and B divisions. Talking to the media, Molokwane said it is an achievement on its own to have the tournament happening. “Being able to host the Spar National League championship is an achievement considering that we have this Covid-19 situation and now we are facing the second wave,” she said. “As Netball South Africa we could not afford to have a year that we do not do anything. We are preparing for 2021 World Youth Cup in Fiji and 2022 Commonwealth games and the most important one 2023 Netball World Cup (which will be hosted by South Africa). She continued: “Skipping a year without doing anything is a risk on its own. We had to come and bring this together make sure Netball is played in 2020.” She revealed that it has not been smooth sailing in planning the tournament under bio-bubble. “Numbers of people (players) coming in, we did Telkom Netball League (TNL) it’s less numbers… Malawi Spar challenge test was just two teams us (Spar Proteas) and Malawi. With this, the numbers are big and it’s been a challenge. However, I think at the end of the day it will all go smooth,” Molokwane revealed. Tshwane, the reigning champions started the competition on a positive note with an easy win where they defeated Ekurhuleni 67 -13. Tshwane goal defender Nozipho Ntshangase said they are aware that all the teams are targeting them this year but they are ready to defend the title. “First game, we cannot really read too much on it. It was one of those easy games,” Ntshangase said. “But we are aware it will get tough each day but I trust my teammates.”
