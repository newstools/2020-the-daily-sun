The SA Under-20 national men’s team, Amajita, have been eliminated from the Cosafa Championships. This means their dream of reaching the FIFA World Cup set to be played in Indonesia next year has gone up in smoke. This as they now cannot reach the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, a competition they could have used to reach the World Cup. They needed to reach the final of the ongoing Cosafa Championship to qualify for the Afcon, however, that is no longer possible. Their goalless draw against Mozambiquein the final match was the final nail in Amajita’s coffin with their opponents topping the group. Mozambique have qualified for the knockout stages instead and their dream of reaching the Afcon is still very much alive. Amajita wasted a ton of chances against Mozambican’s only have themselves to blame for the result. Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele was left bemoaning the countless opportunities his boys wasted leading to their demise. “I am so proud of the boys, we fought until the very end,” said Mkhalele. “We created a lot of chances but unfortunately we could not convert any of them. “It just wasn’t meant to be in the end. We wanted to represent the region at the Afcon and also reach the World Cup but we couldn’t get there. “I believe it is a hard lesson, for myself and for the boys. But I’m sure this will only make them stronger.”
