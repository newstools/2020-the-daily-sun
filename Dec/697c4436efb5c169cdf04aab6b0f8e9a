TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) CEO Sello Chokoe has confirmed to SunSport that he has been suspended by the club amid fraud allegations labelled against him. It is alleged that the former Baroka FC coach has defrauded TTM about R2m in fictitious invoices between 2019 and 2020. A high-placed source at TTM has confirmed to KickOff.com that  Chokoe received a suspension letter on Friday, with a case set to be opened with the Hawks next week. “I've sent you a charge sheet, we will open the case with Hawks next week and he has been suspended," the insider told KickOff.com. When contacted by SunSport, Chokoe confirmed that he has received a notice from the club to attend a disciplinary committee (DC) hearing. “I have received the notice and I will appear innfront of the club DC on 11 December,” said Chokoe. “That is the only thing I can say at the moment my brother nothing more.” TTM who bought the franchise of Bidvest Wits months ago have been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. For the past two months there has been complaints that the club failed to pay some of their players on time. And that resulted to the players refusing to train.
