MPUMALANGA Transport MEC Gillion Mashego expressed concern over non-compliance in some public transport. He said it was every passenger’s duty to ensure they were sanitised, wore masks and that drivers did not drink and drive. “Statistics are saying people who are getting killed on the roads are young people. “Today we are here to say you must not think of your car when you are happy and chilling. “I’ve seen motorists complying in terms of masks and sanitisers during operations on the roads, but you will have one or two people who are not complying,” said the MEC. During the operation, taxi drivers travelling to Mozambique were found without masks, sanitisers and proper travelling documents leading to their vehicles being impounded. Mashego said the department would continue to take unroadworthy vehicles off the road. He handed over 20 vehicles and urged transport inspectors to use the vehicles with care and avoid unnecessary speeding. Andres Khoza (25), who was going to Mozambique for Christmas, said he was happy that finally he was going home, although he was worried about the surge of Covid-19. “I don’t feel safe at all. There’s no social distancing here, but there is nothing I can do. I have to go home and be with my family,” he said. Justice Gomesi (29) said he was worried about traffic. He said he hoped to spend the remaining days with his family.
