TRAVELLING outside of the country may not be a good idea
this festive season. International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor has warned
South Africans to be cautious of travelling to the northern hemisphere as that
part of the world is in a second wave of Covid-19 infections. Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday, Pandor said
tourists could end up broke and stranded overseas as there was a chance that
international flights would be cancelled at short notice. Pandor warned those planning to travel that they were doing
so at own risk. “Please, ensure you’re familiar with the immigration and
health entry requirements of the country you’ll visit and South Africa’s health
entry requirements,” she said. “If you have any uncertainty regarding the entry health
requirements of the country you’ll be visiting, contact their embassy in South
Africa for assistance.” Pandor advised people to buy suitable travel insurance. She said many South Africans didn’t have suitable insurance
during the peak of the pandemic earlier this year to cover extra hotel
accommodation and new flight tickets. The minister said one of the challenges her department was
facing was bringing South Africans stranded abroad due to lockdowns. “From the time the president announced South Africa’s level
5 lockdown on 15 March to the time when international travel was again allowed
under level 1, my department, through our consular services, managed to
repatriate just over 30 000 South Africans who were stranded in all corners of
the globe, using over 350 flights,” she said.
