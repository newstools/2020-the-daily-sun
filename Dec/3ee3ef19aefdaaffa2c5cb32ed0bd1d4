COMMEMORATING World Disability Day is a good thing. But it doesn’t mean the struggle for people living with disabilities ekasi is any easier. Michael Mtandana, chairman of Vukuzenzele, told Daily Sun: “We feel like outsiders". “We need to be included in all things that are happening. “It’s as if people assume we can’t participate. “There’s a tendency of saying, ‘oh shame’ when people look at us. “We don’t want that. All we need are equal opportunities.” Vukuzenzele is an association of people living with disabilities in Nyanga, Philippi and other areas.  Mtandana and his wife Nondumiso Wowo, the organisation’s secretary, have been feeding people ekasi during lockdown. “We were not feeding those with disabilities but the able-bodied. That shows we can do something for communities. “We have people in our Whats­App groups who have to use public mobile toilets, but they can’t access the toilet. “If government really cared, these people would have been catered for and provided with a dignified place to stay.” Wowo said it’s even worse when you’re a woman with a disability. “I struggle at clinics. I have a problem with my bladder. When I need urgent help, nurses don’t act quickly. “I think twice before going to a clinic.” Mtandana said at Nyanga Junction there are no ramps for people with disabilities. “ I’ve raised this issue with councillors, but nothing is being done.” Mtandana wants the representation of people with disabilities in town councils, legislatures and Parliament to increase.
