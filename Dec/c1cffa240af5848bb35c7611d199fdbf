AN Eastern Cape doctor has been found guilty on fraud and corruption charges. Tony Moodley, 66, appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crime in Port Elizabeth for sentencing on a charge of fraud and corruption worth around R2.25 million. Moodley was arrested in July 2015 after he was linked to a Road Accident Fund fraudulent claim, said Hawks spokesperson Lwando Zenzile. He was then released on a warning upon his subsequent court appearance. Investigations showed that Moodley claimed to have treated 83 people at a bus accident in Port Elizabeth. "The Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in Port Elizabeth’s evidence proved before court that the doctor claimed to have attended to an accident scene to provide first aid services to 83 persons that were passengers on a bus on 17 June 2007, a day after the incident. The accident happened on the 16 June 2007 in Walmer, Port Elizabeth, where two buses were involved in an accident,"  said Zenzile. Moodley forwarded the claim to the Road Accident Fund through his attorneys in respect of the passengers. The Road Accident Fund, according to the investigation, suffered a loss of approximately R2.25 million due to the fraudulent claim. "The Specialised Commercial Court found him guilty on all charges and the case was postponed to the 19 April 2021 for sentencing,"  said Zenzile. -News24
