MORE than 450 wanted suspects in contact crimes were bust on Saturday and Sunday. Tshwane district commissioner, Major-General Hilda Mohajane, said the operation was focused on ensuring lockdown compliance in high-density areas within the 36 policing precincts. She said liquor outlets were raided in a number of areas in Tshwane and fines issued for contravention of the Liquor Act and more than 15 illegal liquor outlets were shut down. Mohajane said suspects, aged between 20 and 55, were arrested on various charges including murder, rape, business burglary, assault GBH and assault under the domestic violence act, transportation of liquor in contravention of the Disaster Management Act and others. “Fines were issued for possession of second-hand goods and stolen motor vehicles, and an unlicensed firearm was also recovered,” she said. Mohajane praised the detectives who ensured that wanted criminals were arrested. “Law enforcement took to the streets, focusing mostly on the hot-spot areas such as taxi ranks, malls, stop and search and tracing of wanted suspects,” she said. Mohajane said during December and January, operations will be intensified throughout Tshwane to deal harshly with people who disregard the law and non-compliance of Covid-19 regulations. She said the district would continue with crime prevention because they yielded positive results. “It is a great concern that during police raids it was found that two of the four liquor outlets visited did not comply with their liquor licence conditions,” she said. The district commissioner issued a stern warning to liquor traders and event organisers that they must comply with the liquor act. “Failure to adhere to the regulations can result in the closure of businesses,” she said.
