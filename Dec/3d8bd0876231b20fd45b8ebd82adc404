ONE moment everyone was enjoying music and having fun. The next thing bullets flew and patrons ran for cover. Six gunmen fired randomly during a robbery at Thwala Tavern in Boksburg on the night of Friday, 4 December. The robbers grabbed an undisclosed amount of cash from the till, cellphones from patrons, and expensive alcohol. Three people sustained serious injuries while others escaped with grazes. The tavern manager, DJ and an Uber driver were among those who were shot. The cashier said she was serving a customer when she saw one suspect climbing over the counter. “The suspect pointed a gun at me and demanded money,” she said. Constable Justice Ramaube said the gunmen shouted at everyone to lie down before robbing victims of their cellphones, money and stealing booze bottles. “The gunmen started firing shots at the DJ and went to the manager’s office, where they fired three shots,” he said. “On their way out they shot the Uber driver, who’d come to fetch the staff. “A witness alleged one of the suspects frequented the tavern before the shooting.” Cases of business robbery and attempted murder were opened at Boksburg North cop shop and investigations are under way. Ramaube said police are looking for six men, and anyone with information can call the police on 08600 10111.
