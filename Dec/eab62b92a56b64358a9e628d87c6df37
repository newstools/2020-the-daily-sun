WHAT happened to the days when you could trust your neighbours? When the man from Extension 6, in central Kagiso, Mogale City, left his house on Friday to visit his relatives, his neighbour allegedly took the chance to rob him. Armed with a garden spade, the tsotsi makhi sneaked into his yard to steal on Christmas Day. He packed things to steal one by one as he thought his neighbour would be gone for a long time. But the following morning he got the shock of his life when the owner of the house arrived unexpectedly. The tsotsi, who had already started moving goods he planned to steal, tried to flee but he was caught and handed over to the police. The 23-year-old was bust on Monday 28 December and will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the victim left his residence at Umkomaas Street in Extension 6, central Kagiso to visit his relatives. “He left home on Christmas Day. When he came back the following day he found his sliding door standing wide open,” said Sibiya. “The victim realised his house was broken into and as he entered, he saw the suspect carrying a laptop and running out of the yard.” Sibiya said the victim and his relative chased after the suspect and eventually managed to catch him. “They took him back to the scene of the crime where upon arrival they found the victim’s TV set outside at the corner of his house.” The suspect used a garden tool to gain entry and the sliding door was damaged. “The suspect was positively identified by the victim as his neighbour and was immediately arrested and later detained by Kagiso cops.”
