NICK Bester, the legendary athlete and coach, is targeting a return to the road next year. This after an almost miraculous recovery from a life-threatening attack earlier this year. The fabled Comrades Marathon runner was left for dead following a brutal attack while out exercising around the Magalies mountains near his home outside Pretoria in August. He was also robbed during an ordeal that left him with multiple injuries and required hospitalisation in the intensive care unit (ICU) at a local hospital. The attack triggered global outrage and again put the spotlight on the robberies and murders around the R80 freeway. Police have arrested about 10 suspects in connection with the crimes, as well as other incidents in the area Bester was brutalised. The suspects face murder and attempted murder charges. The 60-year-old was upbeat and said he had made steady progress in regaining his health. “I am now fine,” said Bester. He is most famous for winning the Comrades Marathon in 1991 at a time of 5 hours, 40 minutes and 53 seconds, as well as winning gold nine times in 15 finishes. This includes three second-place finishes. “I am close to 100% and ready for next year,” said the veteran, also a former Ironman champion. During his recovery, Bester has been concentrating on his role as the national team manager of the Nedbank Racing Club. This as athletics makes a return since the government imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of the global coronavirus locally. The most recent event is the Nedbank Running Club Enoch Skosana 10km race run last weekend in Pretoria. Jacqueline Rencontre, the race director, thanked Bester for the organisation of the event that has been hailed as a success. Gladwin Mzazi emerged victorious in the men’s race, in a time of 31:38 while Glenrose Xaba broke the race’s previous record as she romped home after 34:38 to win the women’s race. – CAJ News
