KAIZER Chiefs head coach Gavin Hunt has hinted that he might field Dumisani Zuma who recently recovered from injury when they face SuperSport United. Amakhosi travels to Lucas Moripe Stadium where they will face Matsatsantsa A Pitori in a DStv Premiership clash on Tuesday evening (7:30pm). Zuma is yet to feature for Amakhosi this season in 11 matches of all competition. He recently recovered from a hamstring injury and could get minutes on Tuesday. “We will go into the match with the same squad that played against Black Leopards. Dumisani Zuma will return to the squad but we will see how it goes. We will perhaps bring him on during the match,” Hunt told Chiefs official website. Chiefs have only won one match in six games of the 2020-21 DStv Premiership and that has put them under immense pressure. However, Hunt remains hopeful that they pick up themselves. The former SuperSport and Bidvest Wits mentor admitted that their match against his former side will not be an easy one. He said: “We must just avoid committing crucial mistakes. “We are playing against a SuperSport United which has energetic youngsters in their team. They will be a difficult opponent but it’s the same with all the teams that we face in this league. “SuperSport have their coach Kaitano Tembo whom I brought up to be my assistant, there will be history on that one. Even after losing two of their key players, Clayton Daniels and Aubrey Modiba, they still have a consistent squad and they have been together for a long time,” concludes Hunt. “This league is strange; with one win you jump several notches up the log. We just got to win our matches.” Matsatsantsa are occupying the 6th spot and from six matches and have collected 9 points, while Amakhosi are in an embarrassing 12 spot with six points from the same number of games.
