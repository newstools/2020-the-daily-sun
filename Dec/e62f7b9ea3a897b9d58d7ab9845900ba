HE WAS allegedly smoking zol with his cousin when he suddenly decided that he could swim. Without warning he jumped into the dam – but he couldn’t swim. THE MAN’S BODY WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE DAM AFTER HE HAD DROWNED! His devastated cousin, Naldo Mogomu, can’t swim but jumped in to save him. But his cousin, Armando Makukule (22), was too heavy and he couldn’t bring him to the surface. “I saw him drowning. I saw the bubbles in the water. People shouldn’t take chances with water,” he said. Naldo couldn’t stop crying yesterday as cops were removing his cousin’s body from the dam. The dam formed after residents and contractors dug up the soil over a long period of time. Residents said the dam, which is about 10 metres deep, has become a danger to the community. “Now with the schools closing, kids will be going there to swim and they may end up drowning,” said concerned resident, Abel Hlongwane (39). Armando’s uncle, Sirafi Makukule (33), said his nephew left with his cousin to go and build their own shack.  Sirafi said he received a call from Naldo at about 2pm that Armando drowned and he was waiting for police to come. “He was crying and I arranged transport to get there.” Sirafi said the death comes at a time when they have nothing. “We appeal to people to help us take his body to Mozambique.” Etwatwa police spokeswoman, Sergeant Khensani Mathebula, confirmed that an inquest docket was opened.
