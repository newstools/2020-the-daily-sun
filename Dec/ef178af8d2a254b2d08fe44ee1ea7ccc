ANY notion that Orlando Pirates are going to have it easy in the Caf Confederation Cup has certainly been dispelled. By Josef Zinnbauer’s account, the Buccaneers were up against it in Luanda where they edged Sagadra Esparanca 1-0 in their first-round first leg clash on Tuesday. Zinnbauer had his first taste of continental football when he guided the Soweto giants to victory at Coqueiros Municipal, courtesy of Thembinkosi Lorch’s goal. But guts and grit are what earned Bucs silver in Confederation Cup three years ago, and again saw them through in their first hurdle. “It was a tough game for us. The weather was very hot and the field was not so good – there was long grass and bouncy a little bit for the ball,” said Zinnbauer, reacting to the opening match. “But from minute to minute, we became better in the game against a very strong defensive team with man-marking systems. So it was not so easy for our players. “We have special players on the field that want more space and they want one-against-one, but when you always have an opponent on your back, then it’s not so easy. “But they did a good job today, especially the result. This was a team effort, and congratulations to Lorch, who scored a top goal. “The away-goal was important for us and we didn’t concede, which is also important for us. “Now we have a really good chance in the second leg to make it through to the next round.” The German will go home for Christmas in high spirits this festive, having not gotten his side off to a great start in their African safari but having also ended the team’s six-year trophy drought with the MTN8 win. However, his focus is already on the return leg, which comes on the first weekend of January. “We now switch our focus after Christmas to the Sundowns game. And in between Sundowns and Swallows comes the second leg (Caf). I hope we do well like we did today,” added Zinnbauer.
