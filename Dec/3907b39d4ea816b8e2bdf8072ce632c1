TEBOGO Manyike (45) and Keagile Mhlanga (16), both from Casteel and Newington C near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga graduated as healers on Wednesday, 23 December. The ceremony was held at famous Gobela Thembi Mhlongo’s home at Shortie Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge. Excited Mhlanga said she spent two weeks in the bushes until he arrived at Mhlongo’s home in July last year. “I would fail at school, and couldn’t concentrate in class. Prophets confirmed my calling after changing many churches. But I am now healthy and happy. After the ancestors led me to this powerful gobela in the dreams. I’m ready to go back to school after dropped out at grade 10 and heal the sick,” said Mhlanga. Manyike said she was working as an admin clerk at OR Mashego Primary School in Casteel when she started falling ill. “I became very ill and had to use crutches. Doctors diagnosed me with TB and liver problems but the medicine they gave me never worked. I would see myself in the river surrounded by healers. Traditional healers and prophets told me I had a calling. They also directed me to a healer. I am now happy and fit to back to work and heal people back home,” said Manyike. Her husband Daddy Mkhonto (46) and brother Lucas Manyike (42) attended the graduation ceremony. “We have spent a lot of money but nothing helped. We can’t believe our eyes seeing her graduating successfully. Our four kids are very happy as well,” said Daddy. Lucas said: “This is a hard story to believe. My sister was almost gone. We salute this gobela.” Gobela Thembi said: “They both came here in a horrible condition. But you can see for yourself now, they are well and happy. The ancestors opened arms for us.”
