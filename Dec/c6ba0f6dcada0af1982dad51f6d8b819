The Mzansi Magic series will make its comeback on 3 January. Mandla told SunBuzz: “The biggest thing to expect this season is Mndeni, as he’s on his quest for a new journey. “Because he lost Khethiwe, he will join Ibutho to forget about her because she keeps on appearing in dreams. It’ll be 13 episodes and it’ll be the biggest thing to happen.” Black Brain will also release a movie titled The Day After Christmas, which will star Sthandiwe Kgoroge, Hamilton Dlamini and Zola Nombona, among other actors.

They don’t know how they’ll bury her, so they walk around their village trying to find help with the burial. “The boy decides to go rob a lodge around the village, where a minister is visiting. He also plans on robbing the minister. “He finds that the minister doesn’t have money and he captures him and as they walk around, the minister realises that black people don’t have land. “He decides to help the family and black people get their land back. The movie is about land and we’re trying to bury the past, which in this case is the grandma. We used her as a metaphor. “Next year will be the greatest year Black Brain has ever had. There’s also a lot of big things, secrets I can only share next year. We’ll have big auditions for a show that’s going to hit Mzansi. Black men and women will have to be ready for auditions.” .
