THE Proteas can count a lot of positives from their recent whitewash win against Malawi in their three-match series. But one worth pointing out is the introduction of young players into the senior national netball team. Tshina Mdau made her debut in the series, winning the Player of the Match award in the first of three matches against Malawi in North West at the weekend. Also earning their first senior national caps, were Kamogelo Maseko, Nicola Smith and Sikhohliwe Mdletshe. “We also had a chance to give court time to the youngsters who are coming through the ranks and that’s another positive we can take forward as we work toward 2023,” said Proteas assistant coach Dumisani Chauke. “The girls can walk with heads held high, shoulders square. We set goals and worked hard to achieve them. Malawi are not a weak team. They’re number two in Africa and sixth in the world. “We didn’t expect them to give it to us on a silver platter. Judging by the scores, it was quite physical and hard for the girls.” Dorette Badenhorst’s team passed the Malawi test with flying colours, dominating their regional opponents in the Spar Challenge at Sun City. As Chauke said they took a chance to be back on the court lightly, considering the Covid-19 pandemic. “We weren’t even sure we’d have any netball happening this year. It wasn’t only important mentally but also emotionally to be able to get back on the court. We appreciate the opportunity,” Chauke said.
