THE bail judgment for one of the cops implicated in the murder of Nateniel Julies was postponed by the Protea Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 8 December. Sergeant Voster Netshiongolo is accused of tampering with the crime scene where Nateniel (16), who had Down syndrome, was shot and killed in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg. His bail judgment was postponed to Monday, 14 December. This after his defence lawyer, Onke Maseti, brought Netshiongolo’s bail application on new evidence before the court. However, the state argued that the evidence wasn’t new and the court had already dealt with it in Netshiongolo’s previous bail application, which saw him and his two co-accused Sergeant Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvane and Warrant Officer Caylene Whiteboy being denied bail in September. State prosecutor Mzwandile Mrwabe added that the new application was a waste of time and should never be entertained. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) further said it intended to oppose bail. Acting Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa said: “Ipid’s position is that there are no new facts that justify the accused to be approaching the court with new facts. All the facts that the accused are trying to put before court were actually dealt with previously. “On that basis, Ipid is opposing the intended bail. Our investigation is ongoing.” The overall case against all three accused has been postponed to 27 January for further investigations.
