BEACHES in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape were empty on yesterday. And not a single person could be seen in the water as law enforcement patrolled the beach front. When Daily Sun visited the area, residents said they understood why government had closed all beaches and parks, but it was inconvenient as beaches were their only source of entertainment. Bongiswa Siyona said: “The decision to close all the beaches was a wise one, especially in Port Elizabeth as people are not taking Covid-19 seriously. Yes, some businesses will suffer but money can’t buy life. Life is more important than businesses.” Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has encouraged people to comply with these restrictions. Some were seen strolling along the beach under the watchful eye of Metro police and cops. Rita Mashola (55) from Polokwane told Daily Sun her family had already planned to travel to Durban when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced beaches would be closed. The closure of beaches in eThekwini will be enforced on December 16, 25, 26 and 31 and on January 1, 2 and 3.
