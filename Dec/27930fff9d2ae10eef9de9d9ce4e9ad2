MASKANDI artist Dumakahle Nkosi is angry. This following fake news that he was shot and killed. Yesterday, Facebook was abuzz with posts suggesting Dumakahle is dead. “It’s so sad …he was shot with ten bullets …but why?” reads one post. “RIP Dumakahle.” Another fan wrote, adding crying emojis and a broken heart. The Uthando Lwakudala hitmaker told Daily Sun his rivals, especially in maskandi circles, are behind this. “I’ve been receiving calls from various people, most of them were heartbroken about my so-called death,” said Dumakahle. “As a result, I spent the whole day explaining to my family and fans that I’m not dead. I suspect my enemies, especially in the music industry, want me dead. “I don’t know their intentions but I have no doubt they created this fake news. “Fortunately, I know who are my enemies.” The singer said the news has caused pain for him and his family. “When I received the first few calls I was disturbed, shocked and angry at the same time. But I had to be strong for my family and put them at ease. I then decided to make a public announcement on Facebook,” he said. He wrote: “Kindly be informed that the news that I was shot and killed is not true. Otherwise, today I was here in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, having a good time with my fans. While we ate meat, I received calls asking if I was dead. Now I want to make it clear that Dumakahle is alive and kicking. I don’t know what have I done to the creator(s) of this.” His Facebook fan, Bachazile Mpangazitha, wrote: “I was already heartbroken by the news but now that you’re alive, I’m so happy.” Another fan, Philly Hlongwane, also wrote: “I’m glad that you’re alive. Otherwise, I was saddened by this news.”
