COPS are expected to enforce the law and pastors always preach about doing the right thing. As such, one wouldn’t expect them to be perpetrators of gender-based violence. Nyanga cop shop commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha, said gender-based violence is so rampant even cops and pastors are doing it. He said they bust an off-duty cop for domestic violence last month. He said pastors were also not spared when it comes to the abuse of women and children. “We’re arresting cops and pastors for gender-based violence in Nyanga,” he said. “The community must report men who misuse their powers.” The top cop said some parents are aware when their kids date someone who carries a firearm but don’t report this. “They only come to the cop shop when a lover has pointed the firearm at their child,” he said. He said his office is open, and those who wish to report any crime should go straight to him. He said he was aware that residents sometimes wouldn’t report crime, fearing some cops may be working with criminals. Ncatha said gender-based violence mostly happens behind closed doors, and that it’s difficult for cops to prevent it. Co-operation between cops and residents would go a long way in preventing him.
