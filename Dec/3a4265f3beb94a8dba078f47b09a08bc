THEY made sacrifices every month for a better tomorrow. And they were looking forward to reaping their rewards this festive season. But their dreams came to naught when members of Aganang Society in Molapo, Soweto, were allegedly robbed of almost R500 000 by two members in charge of saving their monthly contributions. They said things ran smoothly until two weeks ago when the money needed to be distributed. The members contributed from as little as R600 to over R15 000 monthly and had the option to recruit additional members. They were supposed to received their investments on the first week of December. One of the members, who is the bookkeeper, Sharon Ngozi, said the two members had R475 000 belonging to members. “We realised something was strange when we had to meet to prepare for the distributing the money. The two members said they were not available and one of them claimed to be travelling,” said Sharon. “They’ve been sending us from pillar to post since. They’re liars. “Our members are fuming and stressed because they want their money. I’m a single parent and both my children aren’t working. I’m taking care of their kids as well. “I’ve sacrifised everything throughout the year and at times overlooked our needs because I wanted to save money. I had hoped to buy myself a generator and repair my car.” Another member, Liza Nkadu, said: “I have two other members under my name. I don’t know what to tell them because they trusted me with their money. “My high-blood pressure has shot up and I spent days in bed. This is rather too much to bare. I neglected some of my insurance payments with the hope that when I get this money, I’ll settle all my debt.” Attempts to get comment from the two members were unsuccessful as their phones rang unanswered. Meanwhile, the police had not responded to our inquiry at the time of going to print.
