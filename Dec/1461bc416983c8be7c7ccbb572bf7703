REIGNING PSL Footballer of the Season and Mamelodi Sundowns star midfielder Themba Zwane and Swallows FC coach Brandon Truter have become the first recipients to win the Coach and Player of the Month respectively of 2020-21 season. Zwane and Truter got these awards today, the first under new sponsor DStv, after doing well in their respective clubs in October and November. The Tembisa born star has been in the scintillating form for the Tshwane giants. He has scored six league goals in the six league matches. The other goal came over the weekend when he stabbed home against bottom side Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium. Including club and country, Zwane has netted eight thus far after scoring two for Bafana against Sao Tome e Principle in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers in Port Elizabeth last month. With his form, Sundowns are currently leading the PSL log table with 14 points from six games. Truter, a novice in the PSL top flight, has provided a breath of fresh air for the Dube Birds. This is though the club plays without a focal point. Swallows are second on the table with 12 points, two points behind Sundowns with the same number of games. The former Cape Town All Stars coach thanked him, players, for his technical team, saying he’s just a recipient of winning this award because without them he wouldn’t be here. Zwane, a very shy man, also thanked Sundowns staff and players. He said his form is because the team, under Manqoba Mngqithi, Rulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela which replaced the larger than life Pitso Mosimane, has not changed the team’s tactics and the approach has been the same and that’s why they are doing so well.
