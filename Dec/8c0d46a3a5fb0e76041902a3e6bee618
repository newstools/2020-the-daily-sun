SOUTH Africa wing Aphiwe Dyantyi’s agent Gert van der Merwe says they have not taken a decision on whether to appeal the sanction or not. Dyantyi was handed a four-year ban for doping after he failed to prove that he took multiple performance-enhancing drugs in error, officials confirmed on Monday. Dyantyi, 26, tested positive for metandienone, methyltestosterone and LGD-4033 while in camp with the Springboks last July. He pleaded guilty to a doping charge, though he insisted he unknowingly ingested the substances while drinking from a friend’s water bottle at the gym. "The three-person panel accepted the guilty plea of the athlete to the doping charge,” the South African institute for Drug-Free Sport said in a statement. “They found that the athlete (Dyantyi) had failed to satisfy the burden of proof to establish that his positive dope test was not intentional. "Mr Dyantyi is effectively banned from participating in sport from the date of 13th August 2019, when he was provisionally suspended, to 12th August 2023." The statement continued: “The athlete’s rights are reserved to seek relief through lodging an appeal should he believe that he has substantive grounds for an appeal.” Dyantyi’s ban comes a month after former Bok hooker Chiliboy Ralepelle lost an appeal against an eight-year ban for doping. Dyantyi’s agent, Gert van der Merwe, told SunSport that they are going to gather this week to discuss an appeal with the player. "We are going to gather this week, analyse the decision. We will then decide whether to appeal or not,” Van der Merwe said. “At the moment there’s not much to say.” The wing made his international debut against England two years ago and played 13 tests for the Boks.
