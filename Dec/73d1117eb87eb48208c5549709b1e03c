MISS South Africa and her princesses are gearing up to represent Mzansi overseas. Shudufhadzo Musida and the runners-up, Thato Mosehle and Natasha Joubert, were crowned a little over a month ago. But they’re already preparing to take part in Miss World, Miss Supranational and Miss Universe next year. Thato will be the first entry under the Miss South Africa Organisation to enter Miss Supranational. Shudufhadzo said she wanted to make the country proud at the Miss World pageant. “I’m so excited, particularly as it celebrates a milestone anniversary and I’m following in the footsteps of those who’ve gone before me,” she said. Thato said she was excited to be the first to compete in Miss Supranational, to be held in Poland.

All three pageants were postponed to next year due to the pandemic.
