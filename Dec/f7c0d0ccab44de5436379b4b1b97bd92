PHAKAMANI Mahlambi says it was ”clear” he wasn't going to play at Mamelodi Sundowns. And that explains the reason he accepted a loan move to AmaZulu, seeing his chances of reclaiming his position in the star-studded Brazilians getting slimmer by each game. The highly talented but ill-disciplined midfielder was unveiled, along with Veli Mothwa by Usuthu on Tuesday. He joins his fourth professional team, looking to recapture the form that earned him two national team caps and a move to Egyptian giants Al Ahly. ”If I were to stay at Sundowns, it’s clear I wasn’t going to play, I wasn’t going to be selected for the national team. So, I had to find a way of getting game time so that the national team coach can select me again,” said Mahlambi. “It is my intention to go play football again and get back to the Phakamani people know. “AmaZulu have quality players, some I played with and some I grew up watching. I hope they will help me reach my full potential. ”I will help the team win trophies and finish in the top four, as the president said.” AmaZulu FC rock PSL with Mahlambi and Mothwa signings & make new appointments.#HebeUsuthu#UsuthuTogether pic.twitter.com/NameK3zHq2 https://t.co/8To5dzUADJ SUNDOWNS STAR JOINS AMAZULUhttps://t.co/UA1LHV6DhL pic.twitter.com/p4zQIRNvk7
