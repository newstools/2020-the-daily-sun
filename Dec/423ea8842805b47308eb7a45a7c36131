MDUMAZI Mhlongo and Unjoko Mbambo are at each other’s throats after releasing the same song. The two maskandi singers are accusing each other of stealing a song that has become a hit among maskandi lovers. The song, Umlaba, has caused a war of words among maskandi fans and many people are wondering who really wrote it. The lyrics and the rhythm are the same. Mdumazi said Unjoko stole it after he saw his video before the song was released and after the video went viral. Unjoko, who released an album last month, said he didn’t include the song because he wasn’t sure about it. The singers both registered Umlaba with Samro.  Mdumazi claimedhe was planning to release it with his album Amagoso, which came out on Friday, 27 November. “But after Unjoko stole it I had to release it and show people the song belongs to me. If I’d waited, people would have thought I stole it from him,” he said. Unjoko told Daily Sun he composed the song when he was preparing to release his new album, Isiziba. “I didn’t think it would be a hit, so I excluded it from my album,” he said. “When I saw Mdumazi singing it, I decided to release it as a single. If I’d waited, it would have looked as if I stole it from him.”
