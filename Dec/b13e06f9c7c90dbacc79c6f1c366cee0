It’s a tradition in Mzansi for people to celebrate the new year with fireworks in the air but, this year it's different. Minister Bheki Cele warned people to be indoors by 9 pm when the curfew starts, this has hit ekasi vendors hard. “All these years when I bought a box of firecrackers, they get finished in one day but, this time people are not buying. I bought one box on 26 December but, I still have many firecrackers, I don't know what to do with the stock I have,” said Noluthando Vukubi (30). Another vendor Langton Sambaza (45) said the year has been hard and he hoped to make money with the firecrackers. “I used to sell two boxes a day but, this year it is difficult. Over the years selling firecrackers on Christmas eve always saved me. When I spent lots of money on Christmas day, I would sell lots of firecrackers towards the New Year holidays so I would be able to have money ahead of the January disease,” said Sambaza. He said when people don't buy now, his January is going to be tough. Some kasi residents who have bought firecrackers said they will stay inside their homes but, when the new year comes, they will have to go outside but stay in their yards. “I will use firecrackers in my yard I don't think Minister Cele will have a problem with that. I will be in my yard with my family,” said Thembelani Sibisi (26) from Murray squatter camp.
