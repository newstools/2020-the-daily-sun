The EP was about going back to my roots and I wanted to include something of my foundation in the project. I think people assumed that I was going to name it “Own Your Throne”, so I wanted to surprise them,” she said. Boity explained that the nine-track EP got her “rapping her ass off. I wanted it to be a strong project, especially because it is my first. I wanted it to be memorable. It was not about trying to impress anyone. I wanted to make something I could be incredibly proud of and where I knew I worked my ass off. I had fun doing this,” she said. She hosted an exclusive listening session at Rocket in Bryanston with the likes of Moozlie, Riky Rick and entertainment commentator Phil Mphela in attendance. The celebrated TV presenter and reality star said she included her traditional roots in the EP. “There is an essence of my traditional side on one of the tracks but that wasn’t the core of things in the EP. I didn’t want people to talk about the wrong thing. I just wanted them to enjoy the music,” she explained. The EP was completed three weeks ago. A post shared by Boity Thulo (@boity)
