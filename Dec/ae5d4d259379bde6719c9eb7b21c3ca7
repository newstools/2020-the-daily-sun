Cops have sent a stern warning to young kids not to take lifts from strangers. This comes after two girls and one boy were raped by men in separate incidents. Katlehong North Police spokesman Captain Lesetja Mathobela said there were two cars, a black Golf and a blue Polo driving around targeting young kids. He said: “The suspects target young kids who are walking alone. Once they see a girl or a boy walking alone, they would stop their cars and offer the unsuspecting victim a lift. Once the victim is in the car, they would speed off to a veld where they would rape the victim.” He said on 30 November, a girl (17) was offered a lift by two men who were travelling in a black Golf. They took her to the veld where they raped her. He said on 21 November, a young boy was raped by three men who offered him a lift. The boy (17) was taken to an open veld where he was raped by the three men. Mathobela said: “On the same day, two men travelling in a blue Polo raped a girl (17). She was offered a lift on her way home from school." She was taken to a shack where she was raped and later dumped on the streets. Mathobela urged parents not to send kids to a tuck shop at night. He said they appeal to the community to come forward with any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrators or call cops on 011 960 0001.
