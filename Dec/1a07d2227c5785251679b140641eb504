Gauteng cops have seized 71 unlicensed firearms and 485
ammunition during crime combatting operations over the past seven days. Captain Mavela Masondo said some of the recoveries were made
through tip-offs from members of the community. “These weapons that include high caliber firearms like
AK-47s, R5 rifles are believed to have been used in the commission of serious
and violent crimes,” he said. Masondo raided areas such as Ekurhuleni, Alexandra,
Johannesburg District, and Tshwane. “More firearms and ammunition were recovered in all the five
districts within the province. These firearms will be sent for ballistic tests
to ascertain whether they have been previously used in the commission of
crimes,” he added.  Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias
Mawela has since applauded police officers for recovering the weapons. “The removal of such weapons from the criminals will save
lives and reduce the level of crime in our province. “The information and tip-offs received from the law-abiding
citizens proves that most community members are prepared to work with the
police,” Mawela said. He urged people to surrender illegal or unwanted firearms to
their nearest police station as the amnesty period continues until 31 January
2020.
