As South Africa continues to report rising numbers of Covid-19 cases, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says many private hospitals are packed to capacity and patients are being transferred to public hospitals instead. But public hospitals are also bursting at the seams thanks to alcohol-related traumas, including vehicle accidents caused by the consumption of alcohol, he said. "People must respect the regulations and [be aware] that the virus is getting out of hand," Mkhize said on Tuesday. "We fear hospitals will be packed like we saw in June, July and August. Many private hospitals are packed. There are people being transferred from private to public hospitals." Mkhize pleaded with South Africans to wear masks and he urged drivers to ensure that the windows of their vehicles are open when they transport passengers. "People must wash and sanitise their hands regularly. Those who have contracted the disease must isolate for 10 days and if ordered to go for quarantine, must adhere. Young people who frequent places [where there are people who] have the virus, are transmitting the virus to their elders at home. "We have a fast-growing epidemic. Yesterday (Monday), we reported 1 011 871 cumulative cases with more than 7 000 new cases. In this last epidemiological week, we have surpassed the peak of the first wave and we had indicated that the epidemiological picture would compel us to tighten restrictions," he said. He added that most new cases were in KwaZulu-Natal (2Â 275), followed by the Western Cape (2 191), Gauteng (1 849) and the Eastern Cape (384). "The overall positivity for the newly tested individuals is 32.9%, with the Western Cape at 45.6%, followed by Limpopo at 41.0%, KwaZulu-Natal at 36.0% and Mpumalanga at 33.1%. News24
