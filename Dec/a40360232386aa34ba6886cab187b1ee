THE distressed Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality in the Free
State is confident its long lasting electricity power problem will soon come to
an end. This comes after the municipality decided to hand over its
electricity services to Eskom after failing to pay the power utility the R5,3
billion it owes. Council Speaker Tumelo Thebe said their discussion with
Eskom resulted in all parties agreeing that the power utility would assist the
troubled municipality with providing electricity to the residents. Thebe disagreed with allegations that incapability, misuse
of funds, political interference and lack of resources are the main causes of
their failure to provide residents with power. He said the municipality is a licence holder and regulations
allows it to sell but not to produce electricity. Business owners in the area welcomed the decision and said
the power utility would serve with experience. Thabo Thabane from Cash Crusaders Franchisee told Daily Sun
he had suffered a lot due to the electricity problems. Thabane said he had lost
thousands of rands as a result of unstable electricity that regularly burnt his
appliances. “In the absence of power, we lose many potential customers
because no one can enter a dark shop. I’m very happy to hear that Eskom will
serve us with integrity any time from now. Under Eskom, we will buy electricity
with better rate and stability will be there whether it’s raining or not,” he
said. Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said the power
utility will make appropriate decision and announce once an agreement has been
reached. Eelier this year the state owned power utility attached the
municipality’s bank account a few days after the municipality paid R72 million
in attempt to reduce its R5,3 billion debt. But the Free State High Court ruled in favour of the
municipality and instructed FNB to release the attachment of the bank account.
