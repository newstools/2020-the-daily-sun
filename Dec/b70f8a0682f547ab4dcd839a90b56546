THE chaos at the Beitbridge border post between South Africa and Zimbabwe could have been avoided. That is according to the Road Freight Association, which has blamed the health department for the delays. “Since the department removed the requirement for truck drivers to be tested for Covid-19 at Beitbridge, the queues have been reduced significantly, from 20km to less than 5km, over the past three days,” said the association. The association’s CEO, Gavin Kelly, said: “We’re relieved that the queues are far shorter, but the crisis isn’t over yet. “The deaths could have been easily avoided. We know that the border is bustling every festive season as foreign nationals working in South Africa return home for the holidays. “To prevent this crisis from happening again, there needs to be co-ordination between the role-players involved at the border, including the private sector.” The delays at the border post over recent weeks resulted in the deaths of four truck drivers and a female bus passenger. There were also reported incidents of drivers collapsing from heat and lack of water. The association warned that although queues at the border post had been reduced significantly, the situation had not yet been fully resolved. Home Affairs has since announced congestion at Beitbridge border post has been cleared and traffic has returned to normal. The department said all lanes have been cleared and the border has been easily accessible from the afternoon of 24 December, and all travellers through Beitbridge have been processed and cleared. Home Affairs worked with the health department, the defence force, police, Sars and the Limpopo government to resolve issues that had led to traffic congestion.
