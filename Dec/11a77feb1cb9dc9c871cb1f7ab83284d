MINISTER of Sport Nathi Mthethwa will on Thursday attend Anele Ngcongca's funeral in Gugulethu, Western Cape. Mthethwa's Advisor Walter Mokoena confirmed to SunSport that the Minister on Wednesday visited Ngcongca's family following a week of drama where the sister of the former Mamelodi Sundowns star, Siyasanga, slammed the Minister on social media accusing him of failing to visit the family in mourning. But Mokoena yesterday said the Minister and the family cleared all the confusion when he visited the player's mother in Gugulethu on Wednesday afternoon. "The Minister early in the week sent a delegation led by department officials and myself, as his advisor, to come and liaise with the provincial Sports, Arts and Culture officials to coordinate our support to the family of Anele Ngcongca," explained Mokoena. "We arrived on Tuesday, met with the family and ironed out all the matters where there was misunderstanding, miscommunication, and all of those were cleared. We reported back to the Minister who arrived on Wednesday and went straight to meet with the family." Mokoena said Ngcongca's mother arrived back home on Tuesday from hospital: "So we were able to see the mother. The Minister arrived at Ngcongca's home at the same time with the Mamelodi Sundowns players and technical team. There was a message delivered and there were prayer sessions and all things that come with visiting a family that is in bereavement." Ngcongca's body, who died in a car crash in KwaZulu-Natal, will arrive at 6.30am and a small session at home, before the procession to a local church in Gugulethu at 9am, and later at 12pm to the Maitland Cemetery where he will be laid to rest. Ngcongca's burial was due last week Thursday but had to be postponed to this Thursday after his mother fell sick, and had to be hospitalised.
