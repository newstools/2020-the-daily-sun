THE pupils have had to relieve themselves in the bushes for years. But this will soon be a thing of the past. Non-profit organisation Wateraid, Tsogang Water and Sanitation and the Limpopo education department have partnered with American company Kimberly-Clark to build ablution blocks at schools in the Vhembe area. The project will focus on Masuvhelele, Mulangaphuma, Matavha and Gilbert Mulondo primary schools, as well as Jack Lavhengwa Secondary School. Tsogang project manager, Kenny Phasha, said the programme uses new technology. Phasha was speaking on Thursday, 3 December at a function held at Tshakhuma Faith Mission Church, outside Thohoyandou, where the ablution blocks were unveiled. The event was attended by education officials and councillors. Phasha said they worked with national, district and community structures. “The project engaged with communities, as well as government and local authorities,” said Phasha. “We built nine blocks of sanitation ablution facilities, 35 waste disposal containers, and donated PPEs to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.” Education department circuit manager, Livhuwani Makhuvha, was over the moon when she learnt some rural schools she oversaw would benefit. But she warned pupils and residents not to vandalise the new facilities. She said there were many reports of schools being vandalised in the area. Councillor Thina Mbedzi of the Vhembe District Municipality said the new facilities were a blessing. Mbedzi said the municipality was committed to working on new water projects to help surrounding villages.
