JOINING the fight against GBV, Solly Malatsi has donated 100 food packs to the Ekuphumleni Restoration Home ThyREST through the Solly Malatsi Legacy Foundation. The event took place in Seshego outside Polokwane in Limpopo on Monday. The home supports victims of gender-based violence, rape survivors and women seeking to exit prostitution and also cares for vulnerable women looking to rebuild their lives. The foundation’s chairman, DA MP Solly Malatsi, said they are grateful to Spar for partnering with them. “It is important that men show, in both their words and actions, that they are committed to fighting against violence against women in any form. “We need to win this fight so that women can live freely without fear,” Malatsi told Daily Sun. The home is run by Nosebuthu Javu and her team. She said they were striving to do a good job with the little resources they had to care for vulnerable women, to teach them skills and help them rebuild their lives. Javu said they were grateful for the food parcels, as they would go a long way in feeding the women on their programmes. “We are thankful to Good the Samaritans for helping our cause. “The only way to defeat GBV is for more men to get involved in the fight and to support organisations like ours,” she said.
