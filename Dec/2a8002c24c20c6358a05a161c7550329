WHEN she took her granddaughters to visit her pastor boyfriend, she expected a good time. However, Thule Sibiya and the kids lived through a horror movie. The boyfriend allegedly hacked them all to death with a bush knife in the early hours of Monday! READ: HOW WE WON THE POWERBALL JACKPOT The 46-year-old from Thornville in Pietermaritzburg and her grandchild Asemahle (4) were found dead in a pool of blood. Eight-year-old Nomcebo was rushed to Edendale Hospital, where she died on arrival. Relative Lindani Zuma (32) said he rushed to the home of the 73-year-old pastor, who was respected in the area, after receiving a call from a ward councillor. “On my way I met the councillor who instructed me to take Nomcebo, who was still breathing, to hospital. Unfortunately, she died a few minutes after we arrived.” Lindani said when he got to the scene, he was told neighbours had found the suspect hiding under a blanket, a knife in his hand. “His shirt and shoes were covered in blood,” said Zuma. Neighbours had told him they rushed to the scene after hearing a woman’s cries for help. “They said when they arrived they found Thule and Asemahle with deep wounds all over their bodies,” said Lindani. “They said when they asked the boyfriend what had happened, he claimed they were killed by an intruder. He later confessed he’d killed them.” ALSO READ: ANGRY SHOPPERS MOER DUMB THUG! The suspect apparently told neighbours he’d only met Thule three days before the incident.
