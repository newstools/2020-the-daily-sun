THE City of Cape will wait for next year to replace the road sign that was damaged by the newly formed squatter camp residents in Khayelitsha. The residents have written their newly formed area on top of the existing name. A resident said the people won’t get lost because they have been driving past this place for years. “They must know by now where Victoria Mxenge is,” said the resident. She said they were a new squatter camp and they needed people to know their name. “This was the only way. Now people know our place is called Social Distance,” she said. Mandisi Gawushe (45) said he was surprised to see the writing, but it’s a good thing. “If there’s a fire in our area, they’ll know how to get to Social Distance,” said Gawushe. “People can ask Google where is Victoria Mxenge.” He said when the city fixes the sign, they must organise another sign for them. “A sign where we can write our own name,” he said. MMC for Transport Felicity Purchase said the City’s Local Roads Maintenance team will do a site visit to find out if the graffiti can be removed. “If not, we will have to replace it at a massive cost. This will only be possible in the new year as suppliers are closed now,” said Purchase. According to her, these signs are not stock items. “Each sign is unique in words, detail, and size,” she said.
