LIFE has been tough for Azwitamisi Ambani after she gave birth to quadruplets in 2010. But things changed for the better on Saturday. The Adziambei Foundation gave her a four-roomed house. Azwitamisi (40), a security guard, was unemployed when her babies were born. The kids – Urangani, Uhone, Tambani and Ipfi – are 10 years old and had been looked after by late businessman and philanthropist, Benji Netshisaulu. Netshisaulu would donate groceries since their birth. Azwitamisi was one of two beneficiaries of brand new houses built by the foundation. Another house was handed over to the Mbulahenis, whose members are unemployed and live in abject poverty. Fhatuwani Netshishivhe said the foundation was established in 2016, in remembrance of their mother and grandmother. “Our focus is on the education of young people,” he told Daily Sun. “We offer bursaries to pupils from poor families. “We also offer motivational talks and career guidance. “We want to break the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment in rural communities.” Councillor Thina Mbedzi of the Vhembe District Municipality thanked the foundation. Mbedzi urged the families to take care of their new homes and kids to take education seriously. Traditional leader of Khubvi Village, Chief Thinawanga Randima, also graced the occasion.
