THE owners of a funeral parlour that was robbed recently say they won’t rest until they find the perpetrators. Lekota Funeral Parlour in Wynberg, north of Joburg, was robbed on Saturday, 26 December. General manager Lebogang Lekota told Daily Sun she found out on Sunday morning through a staff member, who works in the mobile toilet department. “He found the door of an office had been broken open,” she said. “He called us and we then called the police. “When we arrived we found several things had been stolen.” Lebogang said the suspects took three computer screens, two computer motherboards, a microwave oven, a projector from one office, five computers, a kettle, a music system and a speaker.  They also stole food parcels! She said forensic workers found no fingerprints, which meant the thugs were dead certain about what they were doing. “Cameras were off and apparently they haven’t been working for the past two weeks. And we didn’t know,” said Lebogang. She said the funeral parlour hired a guard in March when lockdown started, but they let him go in July. She wished the thugs had found a corpse in one of the fridges! “Maybe that would have scared them away,” she said. “I don’t understand where they get the nerve to rob a funeral parlour,” she said. “We’ll keep looking until we find the person behind this.” She said police were investigating, but they hadn’t been given a case number. Police spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo, said he’d find out what the case was and the funeral parlour would be contacted soon.
