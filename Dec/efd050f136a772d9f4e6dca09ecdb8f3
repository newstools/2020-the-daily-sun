THE festive season is well underway and crime is at a peak. A joint operation between the police and Ekurhuleni Metro cops yesterday targeted Kempton Park. Provincial police commissioner General Elias Mawela told Daily Sun they received marching orders from Police Minister Bheki Cele to tighten the grip on crime.  “During the festive season criminals are violent and target unsuspecting individuals, leaving them either dead or frustrated.” Mawela said there was taxi violence in broad daylight three days ago. “This area is big on crime and we feel criminals are camping here. A lot of robberies are taking place. Now we have come to unsettle them and recall the spaces they’re occupying,” he said. On Thursday, they held massive road blocks doing random checks of vehicles.  Some drivers were found drunk early in the morning and were arrested along with those found with suspected stolen cars. Mawela said 900 arrests were made from Wednesday in various places, and Ekurhuleni alone had more than 200 arrests. Meanwhile on Wednesday, 9 December, various partners including Joburg Metro cops, the police, City Parks and Ekurhuleni Metro cops led a motorcade to create awareness during this busy time of the year. Speaking to Daily Sun Kgothatso Moloto, president of the Voices in Action organisation, said: “We’re here to say no to gender-based violence, substance abuse, human trafficking and any other crimes.”  He said everyone had an important role to play, including the community. A woman from Hillbrow, Joburg, said they had no problem reporting crimes, but their concern was their safety. She claimed some cops were friends with thugs and took bribes.
