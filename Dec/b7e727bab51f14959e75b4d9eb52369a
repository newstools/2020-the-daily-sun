While others are unhappy about the alcohol ban, some
residents from Brown’s Farm in Philippi said President Ramaphosa saved their
kids. Residents said on Reconciliation and Christmas, young kids
were drinking booze and this was going to continue till the festive is over. This is because some underage kids drink alcohol during
holidays and ended up getting in trouble.  Parent Rose Rayile (52) said “Ramaphosa saved the lives of our children by
closing beaches and alcohol. During festive children get drunk and end up going
to the beach and drown. He should have even taken lockdown to level four
because when it was level four and five our lives were much better. Everyone
was sober and everything was okay.” Gogo Nomfanelo Kendle (58) said children become rude when
they are drunk. “When they are sober everything is okay but when they drink,
they turn into an animal that you have never seen as a parent. The idea of
banning alcohol was good but it was not good enough,” said Kendle. Gogo wants Ramaphosa to close the alcohol taps forever
because she believes that the break is too short. “He will still open the
liquor shops very soon so it will not help us much. These kids will get back to
their old ways soon,” she said.  Another resident Vusumzi Mpikampi(38) said “On Christmas day
and on Reconciliation Day, young kids were drinking booze, I think the move by
the government is great. I don't mind if he is to shut the booze forever,” he
said. He told Daily Sun that he doesn’t drink alcohol. However, one beer lover Bongani Mthiya (33) said he was
disappointed to hear about the ban. “I came from work late only to discover
that Ramaphosa banned booze. Today is
the off day I had to spent all day sleeping because I planned to drink beer
today,” said Mthiya.
