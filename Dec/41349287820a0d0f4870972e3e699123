INSTEAD of saying cheers to the weekend like US singer Rihanna once sang, we are almost saying cheers to the year 2020. A year that can best be described as an abnormal year. With Covid-19 ravishing the entire globe, many of us resorted to stress relieving mechanisms such as alcohol. This industry, like many others, went through a financial crisis which saw some brands struggle to make a decent turnover. According to the Spirit Business global platform, popular alcohol brands were ranked in terms of their overall performance during the 2020 financial year. We take a look at some of the popular brands we are fond of in Mzansi that made the top list: 1. Smirnoff Coming in at number 4, the Diageo-owned Smirnoff dropped down two places on our top list to become the sixth biggest-selling spirit brand in the world. 2. Johnnie Walker Walking in at number 9, the only Scotch brand to make the list despite seeing a drop from its 2019 numbers per case sold by 2,8%. 3. Bacardi Coming in at number 10 the Rum Brand Champion 2020 for the second year in a row is Bacardi, which grew by 3,9% to 17,8m cases
