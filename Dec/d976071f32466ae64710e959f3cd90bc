MOST matrics the SunTeam spoke to enjoyed their last English paper, 3, they wrote yesterday. Grade 12 pupils at JM Ntsime High School in Mogwase, outside Rustenburg in the North West, said they were excited to have come so far. Blessing Mokwena (20) said he enjoyed the paper and was excited to see what the future held for him. He said he ended high school on a high note. Karabo Molefe (18) said she couldn’t wait to study further. She said the exam paper was straight forward and she couldn’t wait for the results. “I’m ready for the opportunity and all the rejections that will come my way. I’m happy today was my last paper and I’m confident I will do well.” Neo Modimakwane (19) said the paper was fair, but he was stressed as he still needed to rewrite maths and physical science. He said it wasn’t fair on pupils who didn’t cheat. “I prepared for my exams and I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise my future,” he said. Rachel Mvhubela (19), Memory Khoza (18), Rivoningo Nyathi (22), Sabelo Madlalose (18) and Themba Mankgele (21) of Phundulani High School in Cottondale outside Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, said the paper was fair. Rivoningo said: “The paper was good and I was well prepared.”
