CONTROVERSIAL song John Vul’igate has been released yet
again, this time by members of Scara and Chilli Ya Baba, claiming to be the
original artists of the song. Tsokotla “Chilli Yababa” Moatshe, Dominic “Matanta” Baloyi
and Ndivhuwo “Scaraboy” Nephawe told Daily Sun they decided to release the
original song because they owned the master and rights to it. The song has been causing tension between the alleged
original artists and Mapara A Jazz members Mc Millan “Man Malaya” Nephawe and
Leonard “Lenny Sbechu” Malatji, who released a version of the track in
September. Matanta said their version was available on YouTube,
Facebook and the music video would be on TV soon. “The reason we released the song is that we are the legal
owners. We have waited for Mapara A Jazz to prove their case, but they
haven’t,” he said. Matanta said Mapara A Jazz was not willing to meet to
resolve the conflict. “Mapara A Jazz don’t have masters of the song and they will
not dare come to us,” he said. “I feel we gave them enough time to resolve the matter. “We will not beg them because they are the ones who stole
the song.” An angry Matanta said no one would stop them from performing
the song and their legal team was dealing with the matter. Scaraboy told Daily Sun he was happy people would finally
know the truth. “This is our song and we own the rights to it. I’m ready to
face my brother Man Malaya,” he said. Man Malaya from Mapara A Jazz said they were aware another
version of the song was released.
