TEN zama zamas are expected to appear in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday, 28 December. The illegal miners, aged between 18 and 37, include five illegal immigrants from Zimbabwe and two minors aged 15 and 16. Mpumalanga Hawks, along with various law enforcement units, clamped down on Brown’s Farm in Barberton on Friday, 25 December. Hammers, generators, cellphones, gold bearing material, chemicals and gas cylinders containing mercury were seized. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the intelligence investigation led to the discovery of the illegal laboratory, which was operating on the farm where a gang of illegal miners were employed to process the gold. “During interviews the suspects confirmed they were employed by different bosses, both foreigners and locals. Upon searching nearby two houses on the farm, crush gold bearing materials, 22 unlicensed hunting rifles, telescope and live rounds of ammunition and a double cab silver Ford Ranger were found and confiscated,” she said.
