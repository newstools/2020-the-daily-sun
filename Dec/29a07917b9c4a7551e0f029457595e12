 A DENTIST and a dental therapist have been arrested for practising illegally. The dentist was practising while suspended and the other was using the suspended licence of the dentist. The two, who are friends, were bust for contravening the Health Professions Act. They were arrested on Tuesday, 8 December in Springs, Ekurhuleni. Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs police said the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) visited the practice, which was operating while the licence to practice was suspended. “On arrival the HPCSA found a dental therapist who is supposed to work under supervision of a qualified dentist, but he was working by himself and was using the suspended licence of his friend. “The dentist, whose licence is suspended, was not around at the time. The HPCSA was told he only comes in the afternoon.” After investigations, it was found the suspended dentist was working at another practice in Roodekop as a dental therapist under the supervision of another dentist. “He confirmed to the HPCSA that he is the owner of the practice in Springs.” The two suspects were arrested and detained at Springs Police Station and will appear in court soon.
