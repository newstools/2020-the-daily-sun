A PROMISE made to a 91-year-old gogo was fulfilled by the DD Mabuza Foundation yesterday. Gogo Amela Fulane from Kanyamazane, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, received a four-bedroom, fully-furnished house. This came after deputy president, David Mabuza, earlier promised to build the gogo’s family a decent house. The family of five had been living in a run-down house for years. Gogo Amela’s grandson, Michael (31), told Daily Sun they tried to fix the house but he lost his job in 2018. “It was difficult for me to continue as I had no other income. I believe everything happens for a reason and Mabuza came to save the family.” The gogo said she’d be able to die peacefully knowing her children had a home. “This is my children’s life. I’m glad I’ll leave them a beautiful and safe house,” she said. Florah Mbatha (59), whose home burnt down in June, also received a four-bedroom house. She said her family couldn’t afford to rebuild after the fire. The foundation has been donating houses to poor families for years. Social Development MEC Thandi Shongwe, speaking on behalf of Mabuza, said: “It’s our responsibility to look after the poor and we learned this from our deputy president. When he was premier, he built more than 100 houses through his foundation and he’s continuing.” ” she said.
