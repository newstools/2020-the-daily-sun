CIA wants to help with Orange Farm community in the fight
against covid-19 as the second wave of the virus sweeps through Mzansi. The Communities In Action (CIA) will be embarking on a
covid-19 campaign, hoping to get the residents in the area to adhere to
coronavirus regulations through this festive season to avoid hasher lockdown. Speaking to Daily Sun, CIA leader Linda Ndebele said, “We
started this initiative because we have seen because this area is neglected. “We decided that start up something like this because people
are not wearing masks, they, not social distancing they just seem to leave
normal lives, they don't understand what is happening.” “We want to do the door to door, going to the houses talking
to people telling them to wear their masks.” He said they also hope to have masks that they will be
handing over to people during their covid-19 campaign. He said he is hopeful that the people of Orange Farm will
listen to them when they come knocking at their doors and also those they meet
in the streets. Ndebele said another reason to get people to behave is so
that there won’t be a need for harsher lockdown, which has seen people
struggling to end meet as they lost their jobs. “We want covid-19 to come to an end, if it doesn’t end we
going to see level five and we are going to suffer people are going not going
to have food. CIA member Charlotte Modibedi said social distancing in the
Orange Farm area is a huge problem, even in public transport. “Even in the taxis, people are not wearing masks. When we
tell them to wear a mask they make excuses that the mask is suffocating them.
Even the taxi drivers are not putting on their masks. “People don’t wear a mask, they convinced themselves that
corona is over. They gather in groups, smoke, and drink,” she said. The group said all they need to kick-start the campaign,
they would need masks, sanitizers, speaker systems, and sample soaps and
pamphlets in local languages.
