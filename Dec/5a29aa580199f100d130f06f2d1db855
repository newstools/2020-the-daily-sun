Many women start looking for products to slow down the visibility of aging, but it turns out all they need to do is eat mangoes. A study done by researchers at the University of California, claims that eating mangoes reduces facial wrinkles in older women. In the study done by the researchers, 28 postmenopausal women were divided into two groups. One group ate half-a-cup of mangoes four times a week for four months, while the other consumed 1,5 cups for the same period. The researchers used high-resolution cameras to evaluate the women’s facial wrinkles both before and after adding mangoes to their diet. The results revealed that the women who ate half-a-cup of mangoes four times a week saw a 23% decrease in deep wrinkles after two months, while those who ate 1,5 cups of mangoes saw an increase in wrinkles. “The system we used to analyse wrinkles allowed us to not to just visualise wrinkles, but quantify and measure wrinkles. This is extremely accurate and allowed us to capture more than just the appearance of wrinkles or what the eye might see,” Robert Hackmna, an author of the study, said. The researchers believe that the beta-carotene and antioxidants in mangoes may help delay cell damage.
