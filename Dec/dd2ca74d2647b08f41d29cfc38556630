WHEN they started the stokvel in January, they wanted to save money for Christmas. But little did they know they were saving for someone else. KC vs OP Social Club members will have a black Christmas because one of their members allegedly withdrew their money and fled with it. They were supposed to share the money this month. One of the members, Nancy Mabala (39), said when they went to the bank, they were told the money had already withdrawn by one of the members. “They said he came with affidavits so that he could withdraw the money alone,” she said. Nancy said they used the man’s details when they opened the account. “There were three of us when we opened the account and we were told we must come together if we want to withdraw the money, but it is shocking that he was able to do it on his own,” she said. The members said they lost about R20 000. “That money was supposed to help us and now it’s all gone. We all had plans for it,” they said. They said they’ve been trying to call the man, but his phone goes to voicemail most of the time. “He told one of our members that he was in an accident, but we don’t believe him. All we want is for him to return the money,” said Nancy. The members said they couldn’t open a case. “We went to the police station and they said we don’t have enough documents to open a case,” she said. Daily Sun tried to call the man many times, but his phone was off.
