CIVIL rights organisations Right2Know, ReCreateSA, BlindSA, musicians and actors marched to the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday. They went there to deliver a memorandum of demands written in braille to the office of the presidency. They said they were marching on behalf of the millions of South Africans who demanded their constitutional rights. They said blind people were deprived of books as copyright laws made it difficult for written works to be produced in accessible formats. The protesters said township teachers and pupils were effectively being blocked from sharing and accessing knowledge, meaning their right to education was being deprived. The actors and musicians said people working in the creative industries were being starved of royalties and lived and died paupers. Film-makers, journalists and other media workers said the blocking of fair use rights meant they could not create new works. They said the new laws blocked the free flow of information provided for in the Constitution. They accused the government of ignoring their voices for too long. BlindSA CEO Jace Nair said they wanted the right to make braille copies of copyrighted materials and purchase braille materials from overseas. He said they also wanted the right to access and share educational materials according to internationally-recognised principles of fair use, which outlawed piracy but promoted access. “We want the right to be paid fair royalties for creative works, so that writers, musicians, artists, film-makers and performers can share in the income generated by their labours and live as valued members of the South African society.” Ntshavheni Netshituni from the presidency’s office accepted the memorandum.
