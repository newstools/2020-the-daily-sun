DIEGO Maradona's body could be dug up and displayed with his trophies. The 60-year-old Hand of God star’s dying wish was to be embalmed. He told lawyer Matias Morla in a letter that he wanted a similar tribute to Russian leader Vladimir Lenin, whose preserved body has been on show in Moscow’s Red Square since 1924. Maradona’s letter, signed on 13 October — weeks before his death from a heart attack — says: “After a deep analysis I want to express my wish that after my death my body be embalmed and exhibited in said museum, surrounded by my maximum trophies, personal objects and beloved memories to continue receiving the affection of the people from that place.’’ Mario Baudry, lawyer for the 1986 World Cup winning skipper’s last partner Veronica Ojeda, outlined the idea of exhuming the body from Bella Vista cemetery near Buenos Aires. He added: “The plan is to create a mausoleum somewhere for fans to visit. “It was something Maradona had also discussed with his brothers." The proposal we have is serious, concrete and with the expenses covered but ultimately it would be the responsibility of the football federation.” Prosecutors in Argentina are investigating the possibility that medical negligence played a role in Maradona’s death. – THE SUN
