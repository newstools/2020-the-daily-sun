Three traffic cops charged with corruption have been granted bail. Gubhela Mkhize (59), Johannes Tlou (53) and Xolani Nkosi (38) appeared in the Emalahleni Magistrates Court on Monday, 28 December. They were arrested earlier in the day on allegations of corruption during a sting operation conducted by the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation unit and the Road Traffic Management Corporation at the Emalahleni Municipality. Hawks spokeswoman, Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, said complaints were received from motorists about traffic cops who were allegedly demanding tjotjo from motorists. “An intelligence-driven investigation was initiated in 2019, targeting the same perpetrators. “In January 2020, an undercover operation was conducted by the team and the suspects received gratification for not issuing traffic fines for traffic violations during the operation. “After finalisation of investigations, the suspects were arrested for the transactions in the early hours on Monday while reporting for duty. “They were released on R2 000 bail each. Their case was postponed to 10 March 2021 for further investigation.”
