RESIDENTS of Browns Farm in Philippi, Cape Town, are shocked by the death of their community leader, Nontuthuzelo Arosi. The 51-year-old died in Cala, Eastern Cape on Monday, 21 December. According to her daughter Neliswa, Nontuthuzelo had gone to the Eastern Cape for a visit and was supposed to spend Christmas in Cape Town. But she received a call that her mother was sick and a few hours later she was told she was dead. “She had travelled with my two children and the oldest one sent me a WhatsApp message telling me to call my stepfather to hurry to the house because my mother was lying down unable to do anything. My child is heartbroken because she saw everything happen,” she said. She said her mum died after she was rushed to hospital. Nontuthuzelo was the ANC secretary in Ward 80 in Philippi and an active community leader who helped her kasi people. “Earlier this year, she demanded transparency in the handling of food parcels. “She will be dearly missed and the gap she left will not be filled easily,” said resident Sekela Ratazayo. ANC Ward 80 chairman, Nkululeko Mgolombane, said her death was a blow to the organisation. “We worked with her for three years. She was the first female branch secretary in Ward 80. We are shocked by her sudden death and it will be hard to have another leader like her,” said Mgolobane. Neliswa said her mother will be buried in Cape Town, but they were still making arrangements.
