FORMER World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African middleweight champion, Walter “Black Mamba” Dlamini, has vowed to avenge his defeat against Nkululeko “Bulldog” Mhlongo when they meet in a grudge rematch on 20 December in KZN. Dlamini lost both his SA and WBA regional titles via a fourth-round stoppage at Mhlongo’s hands. The Mzansi gladiators will battle it out for the WBA Pan African middleweight title and that has disappointed Dlamini as he was expecting to fight for both crowns. “I’m glad I got the opportunity to fight to avenge the defeat,” said Dlamini. “However, I’m disappointed that the champion didn’t put both titles online, I put my SA and WBA Pan African belts against him but when he had the belts he only brought one. “Anyway, I’m prepared to do whatever it takes to get my belts back one-by-one from Mhlongo. “My preparations have been going well and I’m ready to beat Mhlongo in front of his home crowd.” The 40-year-old pugilist, who lost his trainer Lionel Hunter last month, said he’ll dedicate the fight to him. Hunter guided the seasoned campaigner to both national and continental titles. “I’m heartbroken by his passing. Hence I’ll dedicate this fight to him. Coach Hunter was my pillar of strength and despite my age, he always believed in my abilities,” he said. The Limpopo-born veteran boxer brutally knocked out Wade Groth to lift both SA and WBA Pan African titles two years ago at Emperors Palace. More than a year later, the former junior middleweight champion, Mhlongo moved up a division to dethrone Dlamini.
