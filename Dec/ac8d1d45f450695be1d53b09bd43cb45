WHEN she was told to live at home she refused as she felt she wanted her own space. But Nombongo Maputaputa now regrets that decision. This after she was caught in the crossfire on 24 November 2019 while she was having fun in Philippi, Cape Town. “The man they wanted to shoot ran towards where I was sitting and the shooters sprayed bullets at us. I was hit by four bullets, two hit my spinal cord,” said Nombongo. The 26-year-old from Siyanyanzela Squatter Camp in Philippi is now wheelchair-bound. “Four people died during the shooting. I could not accept that I would not walk anymore. I tried to kill myself many times while I was in hospital.” Nombongo now lives in a tiny shack with her sick mother, father, brother and her young sister. “Things are very hard. When my father wants to bath, I have to go out. “When I want to bath, my father and brother also have to go outside. We need help with a decent place to live.” Her mother, Nothayimile (53), has just been released from the hospital after she suffered a stroke. Nombongo’s sister, Sikelelwa, (23) takes care of her and her mum, and she said looking after two sick people and her own young child was not easy.
