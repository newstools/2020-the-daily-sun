Siphe Tywana (25) from Kraaifontein, Cape Town, has been living with HIV since 2015. Growing up, she loved attending church or being at home. “Being the last born and a born-again Christian wasn’t easy because we weren’t on the same page”, said Siphe. Returning from a church prayer meeting at night, Siphe would be shouted at. “I was on the right path but never got the support from home. Instead, I was asked so many questions and thought my parents didn’t like the fact that I was a Christian. So, I decided to have friends who took me out and we had fun,” she said. Siphe stopped going to church. She then met her ex-boyfriend. “People asked me why I chose him as he was a player. I didn’t take what they said seriously becaus I loved him.” After testing positive, Siphe told her ex-boyfriend about her results. To her surprise, the ex-boyfriend was polite and told her he knew a long time ago that he was positive. “I was shocked that he didn’t tell me or, at least, use protection. After that, we continued dating until 2016 and then we broke up. We didn’t fight or anything but our relationship just ended,” she said. Siphe said people, who just found out about their status, need to know that HIV/Aids is not a disease but a virus that is manageable. “I know it’s not easy to accept that you’re HIV-positive and going to the clinic to collect medication is the most difficult part, but once you’ve started treatment everything just falls into place.” Siphe has learnt to accept her HIV status. “And the more you talk about it, the easier the acceptance becomes.” Zusiphe Tutuse (38) describes Siphe as courageous. “Hearing and reading about her story gives me strength to go and get tested,” she said.
