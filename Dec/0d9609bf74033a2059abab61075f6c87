Paris Saint-Germain took a huge step towards avoiding an embarrassing early exit from the Champions League as Neymar scored twice in a 3-1 win away to Manchester United on Wednesday. Both sides still have work to do in their final group games to reach the last 16, but it is PSG who are now in the driving seat in Group H with the French champions, United and RB Leipzig all tied on nine points. PSG host Istanbul Basaksehir on Tuesday, while United need a point when they travel to Germany. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were left to rue a host of huge chances early in the second half with the match poised at 1-1 after Marcus Rashford cancelled out Neymar's early opener. But Solskjaer's decision not to replace Fred before he was sent off seconds after Marquinhos scored PSG's second was a naive mistake which cost his side. The Brazilian midfielder had twice been lucky to escape a red card before halftime. Leipzig's late winner in a 4-3 thrillier in Istanbul earlier on Wednesday piled the pressure on PSG to win and keep their fate in their own hands going into matchday six. The visitors started brightly in response and went in front after just six minutes. Neymar and Kylian Mbappe were predictably the danger men and when the latter's deflected shot fell kindly for the Brazilian, he drilled low past David de Gea. Fred had a first lucky escape on 24 minutes as Italian referee Daniele Orsato decided a yellow card for was sufficient for a headbutt on Leandro Paredes after reviewing the incident. United needed just eight more minutes after that reprieve to draw level. Anthony Martial's initial effort forced Keylor Navas into his first save of the match, but from the rebound, Aaron Wan-Bissaka fed Rashford, who was credited with his third goal in four appearances against PSG despite his shot taking a huge deflection off Danilo to wrong-foot Navas.
