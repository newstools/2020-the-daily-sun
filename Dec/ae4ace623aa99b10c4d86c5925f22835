VETERAN defender Thabo Nthethe said he doesn’t have any regrets that his managerial career failed to get off the ground this year. The former Mamelodi Sundowns defender was announced as the new TS Galaxy team manager by club boss Tim Sukazi before the start of DStv Premiership season. However, Nthethe quit the Mpumalanga side before he could set his foot in office due to difficult working conditions he refused to divulge to the public. This was after he played for the Rockets in the GladAfrica Championship last season. Said Nthethe: “I don’t have any regrets that my career as team manager has yet to materialise. “I enjoyed myself as a player at Galaxy. Being a manager is one of the things I’d love to do to benefit any team. I was looking forward to the job that Sukazi offered me. “But things never worked out the way I had planned and I decided to move on with my life. I still believe that it will eventually happen when the timing is right.” But Nthethe has ruled out the possibility of being in the coaching hot seat of a professional club one day. “I don’t see myself on the bench as coach in the PSL. If it happens it will be with development structures. I can only advice the first team coach while being in a role of manager, but not become the man at the helm.” Although Nthethe believes that he can still play for another two seasons in the top flight, he has enjoyed a fruitful career that saw him lift the Caf Champions League trophy with Downs in 2016. “I have won a lot of trophies, but winning the Champions League was definitely the icing on the cake in my career. It was a great moment, not only for me and Sundowns fans, but for the football fraternity in South Africa.”
