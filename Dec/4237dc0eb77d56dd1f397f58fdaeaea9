MEDIA personality Nandi Madida is set to present a Christmas Day music extravaganza. Nandi, together with KZN artists and Durban Tourism, will be celebrating the beauty of their province in a show called Durban Festive Special on Christmas Day. The show, that’ll air on BET, is about Durban opening up its tourism and showing Mzansi what the province has to offer, tourism wise. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Nasty C, Dladla Mshunqisi, the KZN Philharmonic Orchestra and songstress Thandeka Ndlovu will be performing at the show. “Durban is open and rolling out the red carpet this festive season as Durban Tourism gives viewers an experience like no other. “Experience the sights and sounds of the city with exclusive music performances from South Africa’s most loved artists and your host Nandi Madida,” read a press statement released by DNA Brand Architects on behalf of BET Africa. “Viewers can expect an exciting half-hour of explosive sounds, incredible scenery and a glimpse of how Durban is giving back to the local community.” Catch the Durban Festive Special on BET Africa (DStv channel 129) on Friday at 8.30pm.
