This week of reconciliation saw amapiano hitmaker Sicelo “Miano” Skhosana making amends with fellow vocalists Kamohelo “Kammu Dee” Duma and Tumelo “Semi Tee” Ramaila. Daily Sun has learnt that Miano has secretly gone back to working with his “friends”. This comes after he announced earlier this year that he has left the trio following his unhappiness with the management, Jozi Entertainment. A reliable source close to the vocalists told Daily Sun: “Miano has since fired most of the people he was working with and has learnt the hard lesson of trying to build his brand with people who did not have his best interest at heart,” said the source.

When contacted by Daily Sun, Miano’s manager Gontse Tlhalogang declined to comment on the latest developments. “I really have no comment towards the claims,” said Tlhalogang. Jozi Entertainment management founder Lebo Mlangeni confirmed that the vocalists were back in the studio, making music together. He said they were in a better space. “Way forward [was that] we didn't have a problem with him. If he wants to work we can work. We did a song with him, Kammu Dee, Simi Tee and AKA,” he said. The single titled Hurry Up was recorded last month. He said there was no awkwardness in the studio and that the road to making hit singles continued. “No there was not, we were all happy. Maybe next year [there will be more music together] but there is a project we will be working on that I can't disclose as it is still confidential,” said Mlangeni.
