It seems like social media users can't get enough of
Duduzani Zuma. From his dress code, his smile, and even his walk. Images of the sexy
young Zuma have been doing the rounds online, with some men even saying they'll
end up crushing on him. Ladies said even though the challenge is now over, they
still love and adore this man. Been watching Duduzane interviews. He’s so calm, gathered and well-spoken. There was an eNCA interview where they were trying to chukuluza him but he stayed calm and eloquent, never became defensive. Clear in his exprsssion. A man! #Duduzane  They said they don't have to personally know him
to see that he's an amazing man who carries himself with love and respect. "One thing about Duduzane is that he never trends for Mjolo drama, he just
trends for being a handsome man that he is," Lerato Mahobe tweeted. Senele on twitter said she's been watching Duduzane
interviews. "He’s so calm, gathered, and well-spoken. There was an
interview where they were trying to chukuluza (give him a hard time) but he
stayed calm and eloquent, never became defensive. Clear in his
expression," she said. I remember this one, the guy really thought he'd rattle him but nah, he was unfazed by the questions  Sandisiwe Maleka said whoever is in a relationship with this
man is the luckiest woman alive."Duduzane is our dream man, he's just
everything a girl wants hey. I hope to meet him one day," said Sandisiwe.  "Imagine Duduzane (As President) inspiring a whole
generation of Entrepreneurs and DJ Sbu as Leader of Government business. Wow,
they can change the future of this country through young, inspiring, and
energetic Leadership not these tired old men and women with colonial
ties," Siyabonga Ndlela tweeted.
