GASTON Sirino’s dream move to Al Ahly remains just that... a dream. This is after Mamelodi Sundowns announced they have terminated discussions with the Egyptian side over the transfer of the Uruguayan “as the two clubs are too far from each other on the transfer fee”. “The good relations between the President of Al Ahly, Mr Mahmoud El Khatib and the President of Mamelodi Sundowns, Dr Patrice Motsepe will continue as well as the good relations between Mamelodi Sundowns and Al Ahly but there is no point or purpose in continuing the discussions on Gaston Sirino, ” said the club. “Mamelodi Sundowns will continue releasing players to European, African and other football countries like it did for Percy Tau, Keagan Dolly, Bongani Zungu, Ivorian International Siaka Tiéné and other players but the transfer fee must be competitive as Mamelodi Sundowns is consistently paying high and internationally competitive transfer fees for the players that it acquires. "Gaston Sirino must now focus on his football and compete for a starting position at Mamelodi Sundowns.”Sirino has been sidelined through injury and has only played one match so far this season.
