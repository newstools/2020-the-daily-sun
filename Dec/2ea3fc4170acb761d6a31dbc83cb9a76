THE high rate of Covid-19 infections in the Eastern Cape has delivered a knockout blow to Rumble Africa Promotions’ (RAP) boxing tournament. The showdown that was scheduled for Sunday at East London's famous Orient Theatre has been cancelled due to a resurgence of coronavirus cases. This has left boxing enthusiasts in the province disappointed. The mouth-watering showpiece would have seen Mzansi boxing darling Azinga Fuzile makes ring return after his first loss at the hands of Russian prospect Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov last September. According to a statement issued by award-winning outfit, they said are committed to a healthy boxing community of South Africa and therefore support all efforts that ensure the safety of their people. “It is with regret that we now have to inform the boxing community of the cancellation of our tournament scheduled for Sunday. “Due to the resurgence of the Covid-19 infections across the province and particularly the Buffalo  City Metropolitan Municipality vocational facilities have been closed down. “The decision by the municipality has affected our operations as the promotion (company),  however, we fully understand the rationale which puts the lives of our people first,” the statement reads. All the boxers who were to participate in the tournament will be paid 10% of their purses.
