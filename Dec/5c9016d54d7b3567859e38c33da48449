NOBODY knows for sure why he did it, but the peace at the Diepkloof Police Station in Soweto was shattered when a man with a knife rushed in and threatened to stab everybody! While everybody ran for their lives, the man vandalised the police station, breaking doors and windows, shattering the lights and anything else he could get his hands on. Rumours immediately started circulating that the person was unhappy because he had reported a case and nothing was done about it. Diepkloof residents said they understood the man’s anger, because they knew how slow the police station could be. They even told Daily Sun they were happy that it had happened. “The police at this station are tired. They don’t do their work. They never resolve any cases,” said resident Nokuthula Zwane (35). She said she once reported a house robbery case at the station, but nothing happened.  “No one was ever arrested and the case just faded away,” she said. Another resident, Ledwaba Mkhize (40), said repairing the station would be a waste of money. “They don’t have to waste our tax money. They should just close this police station. It is good for nothing.” Mlungwana Hlatshwayo said: “The only thing the Diepkloof cop shop is good for is shuffling documents and nothing else.” Diepkloof police spokeswoman Captain Phephi Motlou told Daily Sun people were spreading false rumors about the station.  She said the incident happened on Friday, 4 December and the man was a mentally challenged person. “He injured himself during the attack. He was taken to hospital,” said Motlou. However, residents also questioned why a mentally disturbed person would decide to attack a police station and not some other random place.
