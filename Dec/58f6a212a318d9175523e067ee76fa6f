A 37-YEAR-OLD police sergeant has been hospitalised after he was accidentally shot in the leg on Friday evening. The alleged shooter, who’s said to be a 40-year-old constable, is apparently a colleague! The two male officers were on duty when the shooting happened at nearby Rolle Village. And, according to reports, they’re both stationed at the Mhala Police Station in Thulamahashe kasi, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. Police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdhluli, said no one was killed and that the injured sergeant was immediately rushed to hospital. Mdhluli told the People’s Paper: “According to reports, the two police members were on duty at Rolle Village when a firearm that was being handled by one of them went off.” The firearm then injured the police sergeant. Mdhluli told Daily Sun that police were investigating circumstances that led to the apparent accidental shooting. “No arrest has been made,” said Mdhluli. Police are also investigating a case of attempted murder.
