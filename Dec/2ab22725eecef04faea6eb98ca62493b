Cape Town soup kitchen mother Naazneen Karriem's Christmas
wish for this year is to create a memorable Christmas lunch for homeless
people. The festive season is a time to give to those who are less
fortunate and, with the Covid-19 pandemic, more people have been affected
financially. However, Karriem, who founded Naazneen's Soup Kitchen, wants to
fill that gap for the homeless this Christmas. Karriem, who has been cooking for the homeless for the past
10 years, says she wants to remind people about what it feels like to enjoy a
Christmas lunch with people they love. "They don't have anyone, so I want to be there for
them," said Karriem. "This year, I want to set out tables and chairs at the
back of my house, and serve them a warm decadent meal." The 52-year-old said cooking was always her passion, and
added that it warmed heart when she was able to lend a helping hand to people
who were less fortunate. She said that she started the soup kitchen from her own
pocket, cooking under a gazebo, until she met Margolita Williams and her
husband Brian Williams, who offered to buy her a wendy house. "My husband and I once saw Naazneen cooking in rain
inside a small hokkie (hut) and decided that we should get her a wendy
house," Margolita Williams said. She described Naazneen as a strong woman with a fighting
spirit. "She doesn't come from a wealthy family, so one would
wonder why she keeps on giving even when she's not supposed to," Williams
added. Three weeks ago, the City of Cape Town awarded Karriem with
a certificate of gratitude for working hard in her community. "My wish is to make this Christmas memorable, but I am
also worried that there might not be enough food for my people", she said. Karriem welcomes any donations from people who would like to
give toward her Christmas lunch. She can be contacted on 060 384 5946. SOURCE: NEWS24
