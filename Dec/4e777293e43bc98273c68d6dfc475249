PRODUCER and sound engineer of popular amapiano hit Obani Labantu, Sphe Khanyile, has referred to late singer GeeSixFive as Jesus Christ. Speaking during her funeral, held at Majuba TVET in Newcastle in northern KZN, Sphe said Gee Six Five – whose real name was Olpha Selepe – was a lot like Jesus Christ. He said in the Bible Jesus built and finished the temple in three days and GeeSixFive recorded her debut hit single within three days. “It was all over the world and in one day it became number one on Mzansi’s top charts and number six across the globe. “When she called me she was sure her song would shake the world. She asked me to help her record a song that would make people sit up and listen.

When she came to the studio she said she wanted me to make her famous and I did just that, and she made me famous, too. “She was like Christ, who went on preaching without telling His family and His parents what He was up to.” Sphe described GeeSixFive as a person who knew her story but listened to her producer. “When she arrived she was Olpha Selepe, but when we started recording her song she called herself GeeSixFive. “We created a team to promote her song on all digital platforms, including YouTube. In a week the song received 50 000 views on YouTube alone.”
