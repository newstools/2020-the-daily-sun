KAIZER Chiefs have finally acquired the piece of land on which the club was founded. The 1.3ha of land is situated just across the street from the Motaung family home in Phefeni, the birthplace of Amakhosi. There have been disputes in the past regarding the land which features a soccer pitch and a church. The community of Phefeni and nearby school use the land for recreational purposes and they refused to allow the land to be developed for any other purposes. Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung said it means a lot to the club to have bought the sacred piece of land and it was their way of giving back to the community. “We are grateful about the acquisition of this important piece of land,” said Motaung in a statement. “It's our way of making a contribution in the community from which we come. It is a historic and proud moment for us to announce this milestone. “This did not come easy, it took a long haul of observing the on-goings with the other attempted transactions to acquire this land. At the end of the day, we are happy to eventually secure this land as our way of giving back to the community of Phefeni.” Chiefs Marketing Director Jessica Motaung said it took a tireless effort of negotiations to reach this landmark moment. “It has gone back and forth with exchanges of propositions,” said Jessica. “We are glad we never gave up and, eventually, after many attempts, we succeeded to reach finality. “This is history in the making, above all because this is happening in the 50th anniversary of our club. “We are looking forward to making further announcements about the plans we have to develop this into a community sports facility. We will announce all that in due course.”
