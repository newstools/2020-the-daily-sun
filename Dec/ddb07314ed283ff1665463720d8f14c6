Singer Shado M has come back to the music industry after a two-year break. The Inhliziyo Yam Ithi Hey, whose real name is Nomshado Mthombeni, took a break from singing due to problems with recording companies. Shado said she has overcome her problems and is ready to get back to her calling. She told SunBuzz: “After Inhliziyo Yam Ithi Hey in 2018, I got an offer from a label that wanted to work with me. But that didn’t work out and I left. Another recording company came and asked to work with me, but they weren’t serious. It wasn’t just the two companies, there were many others that offered me deals, but didn’t deliver on their promises. “It’s been an exhausting and tough journey, with companies playing me. So, I ended up going back home to Newcastle in KZN to regroup. “I’m back and ready to work.” ALSO READ |LINDIWE TAKES THE REIGNS ON THE RIVER The songstress is back with her single titled Amagama, which was released last week. Shado said: “A producer friend of mine, Triple S, sent me a beat and asked me to put together a song. What came to mind was my situation and experiences. So, this song explains why I went quiet for two years. I want my fans to know where I’ve been. “But this is not just a sad song. It’s motivational too. I want people to see that I was able to stand up and continue, although I was down. I broke free from all the tough situations with the labels,” said Shado. The songstress is working on an EP, which will be released in February. “I’m back and can confidently say I’m not going anywhere again. I’m independent and doing everything myself this time around,” she said.
