AFTER 10 years of living in hell, Sergeant Pertunia Moyana accepted her ancestral calling. She graduated as a healer in Lillydale Village near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Sunday, 13 December. The 37-year-old cop, who is stationed at OR Tambo International Airport cop shop, said she had been ignoring her calling. She became seriously sick and was admitted to Glenwood Hospital in Benoni in August, but doctors said there was nothing wrong. But she could not sleep. “I would find myself in a river with herds of cattle and my ancestors in healing traditional clothing. They showed me muthi to heal the sick. “I started hating people for no apparent reason and self-isolated. One of my colleagues saw I was troubled and advised me to heed the calling. Today I’m proudly a healer cop. I will heal people when I’m off duty.” Her happy husband Aaron Nukeri (45) said she’d sometime become angry, but he always supported her. “I knew her problem. Her grandparents were powerful healers. We consulted healers and prophets who told us she would be fine if she goes to thwasa,” said Aaron. Pertunia’s uncle, Ramosi Shiluvane (55), said: “My mum Nettie Mkhabela was terminally ill and bedridden. “But she got healed when Pertunia accepted her calling and now walks on her own.” Her gobela Josephine Ndlovu said: “Her ancestors were bigger than mine. Both of us have inzunza. “That’s why we did most of her ceremonial work in the Sabie River. “I am happy all ancestors opened their arms and the ceremony went well. She can read the bones and make muthi under my mentorship.”
