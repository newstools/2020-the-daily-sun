He moves to Delinkani Hostel in Joburg, where he joyously reunites with his old buddies 2Litre and Vovo, but this soon reminds him he’s alone and without family,” read the release from Mzansi Magic. “He comes to town and finds himself caught between a rock and a hard place – he has to decide whether to rejoin the notorious hostel gang as an ally or as a police informant,” it continued.
