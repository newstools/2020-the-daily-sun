WHEN they began sitting on the mourning mattress on 9 August this year, they thought it wouldn’t take more than a week before they could receive their loved one’s body from the mortuary. But the Masondo family from eNkunzi in Lady­smith, KZN is still waiting for the police’s forensic department to release Philani Mhlongo’s body. The 25-year-old man was killed along with another person on 9 August when their car collided with another vehicle on the N11 near Mawelawela. The two burnt to death. Philani’s sister, Hlengiwe Masondo (28), told Daily Sun they sit on the mattress from the moment they discover a family member has died until the coffin goes into the grave. “When we heard Philani had died, we did the same thing, not knowing that it was going to take this long,” said Hlengiwe. “Neighbours and friends used to come and mourn with us offering money so we could buy candles and other things before the burial, but no one comes anymore.” She said each time they contacted the cops to check if the body was ready, they’re told the DNA test results haven’t come back from Cape Town. “We plead with the authorities to help. We want to get done with mourning and continue to honour our brother when we know he’s resting in his grave,” said Hlengiwe. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of culpable homicide was opened for investigation by Elandslaagte cop shop. The matter is still under investigation pending DNA results.”
