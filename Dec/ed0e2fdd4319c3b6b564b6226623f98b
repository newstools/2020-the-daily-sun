ENGLAND have appointed legendary South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis as batting coach for their tour of Sri Lanka. Kallis will work on a consultancy basis and there are currently no plans for the 45-year-old to work with England on the tour to India which follows Sri Lanka. ”Jacques was happy to join us on a consultancy basis for the trip to Sri Lanka. The negotiations were very quick and simple,” said a source. Kallis joins a coaching set-up that includes head coach Chris Silverwood and assistant-coach Paul Collingwood, wicketkeeping consultant James Foster, fielding coach Carl Hopkinson, bowling coach Jon Lewis and spin bowling consultant Jeetan Patel. Kallis is one of the all-time great batsmen, scoring 13,289 runs in 166 Tests at an average of 55.37, including 45 centuries, although he never scored a Test hundred in Sri Lanka. He was renowned for his technical skill and patience. He worked as a batting coach for South Africa against England last year.
