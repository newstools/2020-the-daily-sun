CHIPPA United have appointed coach number 23 since the club was promoted since June 2012 when Chippa were promoted to the Premiership. The club released a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming that they have parted ways with Lehlohonolo Seema and appointed Eymael. "Chippa United Football Club have appointed Belgian Luc Eymael as senior head coach until the end of the season," said the statement. "Eymael first match in charge will be the DSTV Premiership fixture against SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium when the season resumes in the New Year on 6 January 2021. "The Club confirms that it met with former coach Lehlohonolo Seema on Wednesday, where the consensus from both parties was to part ways with immediate effect. "This decision comes after an indifferent start to this season with the team currently in 14th place on the league standings after eight matches. The team has won once and lost five matches in the campaign so far - including successive defeats from the last three matches. "Eymael joins the Chilli Boys with a wealth of experience having coached in Belgium, Oman and across the African continent. In South Africa, he coached Free State Stars to Nedbank Cup success in 2018." Chippa chairman Siviwe Mpengesi said they would like to wish Seema well on his future endeavours. Mpengesi stated: "Our ambition was to have an improved season in comparison to how the team has been fighting relegation in the past few campaigns. "One of Mr Eymael responsibilities is a top eight finish for this season. This where the Club Board can also decide on his longer term contract with the team. “We would like to wish Mr Seema well with his future endeavours, and thank him for his contribution towards the Chippa United brand.”
