MORE than 280 suspects were arrested during the safer festive season operation in Mpumalanga. They were bust for allegedly being involved in various criminal activities including robbery, murder, rape and assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm as well as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This comes after multidisciplinary security forces were in full force to protect citizens during the festive season and beyond. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has called on the community to respect the law, and not commit crime or drive their vehicles while under the influence of alcohol, as 57 suspects were arrested for drunk driving. “There were various simultaneous activities that were executed in this regard by these astute members throughout the province to guarantee that they have a tight grip on crime and criminals. “The collective also recovered 27 firearms, 24 revolvers and three rifles, with 45 rounds of ammunition. The arrested suspects are expected to appear in various magistrates courts across the province while others were issued with summons to pay fines,” said Zuma. Zuma commended the joint forces for their resilience during this period which saw perpetrators being put behind bars.
