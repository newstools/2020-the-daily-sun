Covid 19s second wave has hit Mzanzi. This was confirmed by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize. He was
addressed the nation through a virtual media briefing this evening. Mkhize said, “We are now in a second wave. Four provinces
are the key drivers of this new wave.” The four provinces which are behind the second wave are
Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Kwa-Zulu Natal, and Gauteng. “Up to the last week, the increase was mainly in Eastern
Cape and Western Cape in specific districts, but now we have numbers that
indicate we are in a second wave.” On Wednesday evening, Mkhize said the over 6000 covid-19
cases have been reported in South Africa in the past 24 hours “We look at the number of tests done, the positivity rate,
the number of positive cases, the numbers of people who are admitted, and the
number of fatalities. “The age distribution has also shown a different pattern
from the norm. The age group 15-19 years showed the highest number of cases
over the past two days.” The rage festivals, which are attended mostly by
matriculants as part of their pens down celebrations, have also been fingered
as a contributor in the second wave. Nelson Mandela Bay is the only area which has localised
lockdown strict restrictions after it was classified as the covid-19 hotspot.
