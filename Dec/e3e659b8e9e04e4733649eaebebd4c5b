ACTING ANC chairman in Mpumalanga, Mandla Ndlovu, has confirmed that a rape accused Provincial Executive Committee member will no longer take part in committee activities. “The people have spoken. We heard you. We were insensitive,” he said. “The PEC member’s participation in all activities is suspended until his rape case is finalised. “We have to do everything possible, including sacrificing ourselves, to silence the weeping of our mothers and girl children.” The Nelspruit Magistrates Court relaxed the bail condition of the 48-year-old former MEC and PEC member, arrested along with his stepson – aged 27 – for raping his twin minor daughters in September. They’re expected to appear again in the same court in January. The accused received a hero’s welcome from ANC members after he was granted R20 000 bail. However, last week the ANC in the province revoked its decision to reinstate him. On Wednesday, 25 November, the ANC had defended its decision to reinstate him into the PEC.
