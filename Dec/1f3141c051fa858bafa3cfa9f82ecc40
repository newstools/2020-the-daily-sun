BISHOP Stephen Zondo has lost the appeal to stop the CRL
Rights Commission from holding its public hearing, which began last month,
looking into allegations of sexual assault and financial misconduct against his
church. Yesterday, the church leader of the Rivers of Living Waters
Ministry and Pastor Lydia Malete appealed the ruling made on Friday, 11
December that rejected an urgent interdict against the commission. The appeal was heard in the South Gauteng High Court a few
hours before Malete was due to appear before the commission. Commission chairman David Masona said: “The outcome of the
court is in favour of the CRL. “The applicants failed to present convincing arguments for
their appeal. “There’s no reasonable chance for this appeal to succeed in
any other court. The application is dismissed with cost.” This meant Malete had to give her testimony. But Advocate Vusamanqwe Magqweni shortly joined the hearing
and told the commission he has been instructed by Malete’s attorneys to inform
the commission that she was ill and requested a postponement to early next
year. He said: “Malete can’t be here because she is ill. She will
appear with the necessary medical certificate, indicating that she was taken by
circumstances beyond her control.” But the commission argued that they had already received
communication from Malete’s attorney requesting for a postponement, not based
on medical reasons but because the court had ruled against her. In closing, Masona postponed Malete’s appearance to Tuesday,
15 December.
