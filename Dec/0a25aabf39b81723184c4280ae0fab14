COULD the return of Dumisani Zuma help Kaizer Chiefs end the
year with a win? Well, that will be seen on Saturday when Amakhosi host his
former team Bloemfontein Celtic at FNB Stadium at 6pm. Zuma has been battling with a hamstring injury early in the
season. In Chiefs 12 games of all competitions this season, Zuma has
only featured once when he came in as a sub against SuperSport United on
Tuesday evening. However, the 25-year-old is now back and looking forward to
helping the team turn their fortunes around. “It’s good to be back. I would like to thank the coaches
that have been patient with me through injuries and other things that I have
been going through.,” Zuma said on Thursday. Amakhosi have had a horror start to the season. They have
not won a league match since beating Chippa United 1-0 in October. A victory this weekend against Celtic would be similar to a
Christmas miracle. Zuma admitted that Celtic who have been to two finals this
year will be a hard nut to crack since they are eager to return to winning
ways. He said: “It will be a tough game as last season they gave
us a tough time in both games. They were in the Nedbank Cup final and MTN8
final recently. “It will be a tough, but we also need to bounce back. Our
performance is slowly improving.” Zuma who was one of the most influential players for Amakhosi
last season promised fans that they will turn the corner. He said: “All I can tell our supporters is that it is still
early. New coach (Gavin Hunt), we are still trying to understand his style of
play. But our performance in the last two games has been improving.” Chiefs are in a lowly 12th place on the Premiership
standings, with just five points ahead of bottom placed Maritzburg United.
