AS MUCH as money makes the world go round, many share the same sentiment about sex. Besides it being an act for human creation, itâ€™s also a mood enhancer and a recreational activity. Men at times are often deemed to be lovers of sex, but according to a recent development, having more sex and masturbating can limit your chances of having prostate cancer. Research suggests that the more often men ejaculate, the less likely they are to have the disease. In research conducted in 2016, researchers asked men to answer questions about how often they ejaculated. The researchers found that guys who did it the most (at least 21 times a month) had about a 20% lower chance of prostate cancer, compared with those who did it less (four to seven times a month). That was true in several age groups. Some experts believe that ejaculation flushes out harmful chemicals that might build up in semen. Now, who said too much fun is not good for you?
