 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said that Mohamed Salah is in a "good moment" and is happy at Liverpool, dismissing media speculation the Egyptian wants to leave the club. Salah told Madrid-based newspaper AS in an interview last weekend that he admired Real Madrid and Barcelona, fuelling talk in the British press that the forward was looking to move on. "We never speak (about contracts)," Klopp told reporters ahead of the visit of struggling West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. "Mo is in a good mood and moment, and that is most important. "You would have seen him laughing a lot (today, in training). The rest is nice for you to write but internally, nothing really (to say)." Salah was left on the bench for last weekend's 7-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace, but still scored two goals when he came on to help the Premier League leaders maintain their fine form. Champions Liverpool are unbeaten in 10 league games while conceding just eight goals since losing 7-2 at Aston Villa in October â€“ winning three of the last four.  They are the first side to spend three straight Christmases leading the English top-flight since they also achieved the feat between 1978 and 1980, but Klopp is not getting carried away.
