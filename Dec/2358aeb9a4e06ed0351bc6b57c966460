CAPE Town Mayor Dan Plato recently visited fire victims in Masiphumelele to hand over food parcels, mattresses and blankets. The residents were left homeless after their shacks burnt down on 16 December. Since then, the victims have been struggling, some were housed at a church while others stay with unaffected residents. Plato told Daily Sun he knew people didn’t even have beds. “We understand that staying with other people, especially during this time, is difficult, which is why we’ve brought food parcels,” he said. “We want them to have something to eat while waiting to get back to their area.” Mongezi Ntondini (56) said he was grateful but needed more. “We want to go back to our own homes. We can’t keep invading other people’s spaces,” he said. “Yes, we need food, clothes and blankets and we’re grateful for that.” Another resident said it was good to see the mayor handing out donations himself and not getting committee members to do it. “There are a lot of donations that never reach the fire victims. People are taking donations for themselves, and for some people this is the first time they’re receiving something,” said the resident. Monwabisi Saweni (40) said some people were collecting donations and keeping them. “Some people are evil. There are those who’re using us to get donations and those who benefit although they’re not victims,” he said. “They want everything for themselves.” Monwabisi said if people wanted to make donations, they needed to do as the mayor did. “We’re asking opportunists to have a heart and stop using our situation to fulfil their needs,” he said. “We’ll forever be grateful to the mayor for doing this for us.”
