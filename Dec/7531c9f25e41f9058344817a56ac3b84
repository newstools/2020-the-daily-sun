EVER since Boity released Bakae last year, she’s cemented herself in the music scene. Now the talented media personality is broadening her music catalogue and is set to release an EP, 4436. The much-anticipated EP comprises nine tracks and the bonus track Wuz Dat, which largely launched Boity’s rap career. The talented rapper said: “I’m beyond excited, nervous and even more excited to release this body of work. It has been a long time coming. “I want to thank my fans for their patience and my producer for the same patience and work they put in. I honestly can’t wait for fans to hear this.” The project – which was named after the rapper’s grandmother’s house in Potchefstroom in North West – was produced by PH Raw, Reason and Bash Jameson and features multi-talented stars Riky Rick, Yanga Chief, Maggz, Ginger Trill and Malgera Doe Boy. Her EP will be available on Friday, 4 November. A post shared by Boity Thulo (@boity)
