THE Zulus blame government for the death of their loved ones. Sisters Pretty (45) and Morrin (40) were washed away while trying to cross the Thekwane River in Muden, KZN Midlands on Tuesday. Their bodies were found on Wednesday, 16 December several kilometers from where they were washed off. Their brother, Nkululeko (26), said residents had been asking for years that a bridge be built in the area. He said residents had always feared the river would wash away pupils as there’s a school close by. “We didn’t know it would be my sisters who’d be killed by this river,” he told Daily Sun. Nkululeko said a neighbour notified them that Pretty and Morrin had been washed away. “We confirmed with the taxi driver, who dropped them off a few minutes before they were washed off.   “He confirmed that he dropped them off at the taxi stop, where they normally jump off when they return from work.  Meanwhile, in Bhumaneni in Mooi River, one person was struck and killed by lightning. Two family members were injured. Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka said they’d deployed disaster management teams to provide support to the affected families.
