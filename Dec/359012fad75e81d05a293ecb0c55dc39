THE Khoisan this week commemorated the second anniversary of camping at the Union Buildings. This week, they did a ritual and said they won’t leave until President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed them. They burnt herbs and muthi to remind the president they were still waiting for him to talk to them. TThey erected a sacred site in September. Khoisan chief, Francisco MacKenzie from the Northern Cape, said the sacred kraal was important to them and no one had the power to remove it. MacKenzie said it would stand at the Union Buildings forever, even after they’d left.  “When we sit around the fire, we speak with each other,” he said. “The circle is sacred and mustn’t be broken. We look at each other, speak and understand each other.” MacKenzie said other people were welcome to celebrate with them.  “We can’t speak of a great spiritual creator without the ancestors. We follow in their footsteps. There, we honour and respect them and worship God only “I’ll write to the president, Home Affairs and other ministries to make them understand the secret of this sacred kraal. “When the Khoisan leave, no one should touch this. They can remove the tents but this whole place is sacred and the kraal will remain.  “This is the sacred living memory of our people. We were hunted like animals in the 17th century. It’s beautiful to do rituals in the evening, under the full moon.” They demanded recognition of their identity and language.  “We want the land and the scrapping of the ugly word ‘coloured’. We’re not coloured but the first nation,” he said. Public works spokeswoman, Bukiwe Cimela, said: “We’re aware of the illegal occupation of the Union Buildings grounds.”
