THE rules are stricter, but people are still ignoring them. People are caught in the festive spirit and only interested in the “groove”. On Saturday night, a multidisciplinary operation by various law enforcement departments led to the arrest of about 50 drunk drivers. According to police provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, they started the operation on the busy N17 road where they arrested drunk drivers, people in possession of unlicensed firearms and drugs. “It is sad to see that people aren’t taking the pandemic seriously. They don’t respect the curfew and still party in crowded spaces,” said Mawela. He said he was shocked to see crowded street bashes way after the curfew happening in so many places.  He blamed liquor outlets for adding to the mischief of the night and possible spread of the virus. “They sell liquor to people, even though they know what the cut-off time is. People won’t be all over the place if they didn’t have alcohol. They’ll be bored and go home to sleep,” he said. Among those but for selling liquor after the curfew was the manager of the famous kasi establishment Lichaba. His arrest had social media users talking. Some were happy about his arrest, while others claimed some kasis have never been on lockdown since it started. Resident Sandile Duma said: “Kasis like Braam Fischer have never taken the lockdown seriously. We hardly see the cops or the military. We know that they are just making an example, but soon they will be tired.” Another resident said: “I hope the police continue doing their job and arrest whoever doesn’t comply, so that people can understand how serious this pandemic is.”
