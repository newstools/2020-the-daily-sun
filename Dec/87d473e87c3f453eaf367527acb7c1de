Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced the discovery of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on Friday which appears to be spreading fast across South Africa. But he said while they were concerned, people should keep calm and carry on wearing masks, cleaning hands with soap and sanitiser, and maintaining social distancing. "It is important to reiterate that while this mutation is a cause for concern, there is no reason to panic," Mkhize added. During a virtual briefing,Â Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) co-chairperson Professor Salim Adbool Karim said the severity of the virus in the second wave was still not clear and it was too early to tell. The discovery comes as the country recently breached the 10 000 mark for new daily cases on Wednesday. "Our current case management is guided by clinical manifestations of the pandemic and this has still been effective irrespective of the mutation that has been identified," said Mkhize. "There is no evidence to suggest a need to change in clinical treatment and patient management of Covid-19 in the second wave to date. "Scientists do not want to speculate on the discovery as research is still ongoing." Here is what we do not yet know: - Where it came from. The variant emerged in Nelson Mandela Bay and then spread to other areas, however, scientists do not know its origin. - How severe it is.  - Its implications on individuals who were previously infected and recovered. Researchers still need to ascertain if they would be re-infected by the variant.
