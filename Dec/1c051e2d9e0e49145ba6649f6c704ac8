EASTERN Cape districts will not participate in this year’s Spar Netball Championship. This was confirmed by Netball South Africa president Cecilia Molokwane on Sunday afternoon during a press conference. The move comes after the president of the country Cyril Ramaphosa declared the Nelson Mandela Bay as a coronavirus hotspot. ”The districts are here, even though we do not have all the 52 districts because Eastern Cape and some of the Western Cape teams withdrew from coming to the tournament,” said Molokwane. “However, we understand the situations because people's lives matter more than Netball. “We have to be very careful and very cautious about what we are doing. It is so exciting. The girls have been looking so much to this and tomorrow the games will begin. “We got a very efficient team. As I tell you now the fixtures have been already re-arranged. We were waiting for the family meeting (president speech), we know that some provinces might close.” Twenty-nine senior teams will compete for the right to be crowned the best netball region in the country, while 24 teams will compete in the under-21 section. Tshwane won both the A and B divisions at UJ in the last tournament, and all eyes will be on them to see if they can successfully defend their crown this year. Senior Tshwane coach Jenny Van Dyk said it could take the time to be at their level best. She said: “Everybody is so hungry to play Netball but if you think of that first two-three rounds of Telkom Netball it was a hard mess, everybody was excited to play. “But you actually have to spend quite a time on court before you really see a solid performance. "Probably a little bit messy in the beginning but a lot of positive vibes. As the season progress I think everybody will settle into the combinations we will set good standards.”
