AS FAR as actor, Martin Ziqubu is concerned, age is just a number and he’ll continue acting until he dies. The 63-year-old from Ntuzuma, Durban, got his TV breakthrough in 2018 after being a teaching for 40 years. Martin has been performing lead roles on Ukhozi FM radio drama series since 1991 and is well-known for his bold and unique voice. But he said at first he was scared to be on TV. To date, Martin has played in eHostela, Isibaya, Imbewu and Nomthawelanga. He told Daily Sun while he was a teacher he acted in many radio drama. “Many people recall me playing Ngqongqo in Kusa Kusa and everywhere I go they call by that name,” he said. “Earlier this year, I played on Ukhozi FM’s drama, Buchitheka Bugayiwe. I’ve taken a break from radio to focus more on TV acting.” Martin, who has two grandkids, has worked for three schools during his teaching days. He said he knows that he is old as he is already on pension but while he is able to act he will carry on. “As long as I’m still alive, have a voice, I won’t stop acting. It’s part my life. And I’m happy there’re many TV productions here in Durban. As I get older, it’ll be difficult for me to go to other places looking for acting jobs. It’s good to be in Durban,” he said.
