Police
Minister Bheki Cele, his deputy Cassel Mathele and the South African Police
Service top management are conducting a festive season inspection tour to
assess Covid-19 safety in KwaZulu-Natal. The aim of
the inspection is to raise awareness about increasing Covid-19 cases in the
province. And the
minister warned that South Africa's rising infections numbers were only the
beginning. "The
Minister of Health assured me that these are the shots. We haven't seen
anything yet," Cele said in Duma in Ladysmith. "He
said wait for January, after Christmas and after New Year's," he added. "South
Africans are just not behaving." This
inspection tour is the first leg of the KZN ministerial #SaferFestiveSeason. On
Wednesday, Cele and his team were in the Eastern Cape in Port Elizabeth,
claiming that the Covid-19 numbers were alarming and that the public needed to
work together to fight the virus. SOURCE: NEWS24
