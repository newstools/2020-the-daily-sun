NOT all beer lovers are happy after President Cyril Ramaphosa banned alcohol. Seven men in Nyanga came together and brought all the Christmas booze leftovers to de-stress. They even brought beer they’d saved for the New Year to the table. “When booze was banned I was shocked and disappointed,” said one miserable boozer. “I cried because I hadn’t stocked up. “The boys said they had something in their fridges, so we came together to drink and discuss the way forward. “This is more like an after-tears party. “It’s illegal to gather around like this, but we had to for the last time because we didn’t expect this ban. “We came together to finish the booze stock we had in the fridge.” The group said they appreciated efforts to fight Covid-19 but should have been given notice. “This thing of making rules with immediate effect isn’t funny,” said another drinker. “He should have given us a day or two to stock up.” On Monday night, the contry’s president addressed the nation and banned the sale of alcohol. He said reckless behaviour by drinkers contributed to the spike in Covid-19 cases. Said Ramaphosa at the time: “Reckless behaviour due to alcohol intoxication has contributed to increased transmission. “Alcohol-related accidents and violence are putting pressure on our hospitals’ emergency units. “The healthcare system is under strain due to casualties from drunk driving and drunken fights.”
