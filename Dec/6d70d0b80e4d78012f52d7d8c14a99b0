THE first time a car crashed into Dennis’ house, it was an accident. The second time it was strange – but now it has happened a number of years in a row – and on Friday last week, he had the worst crash yet! Dennis Dibeso (55) told Daily Sun a car crashes into their house in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, at least once a year. He said no family members have ben injured yet, but when it happened the fourth time, they started getting very nervous. A truck crashed into his house and damaged it. “I received a call from my neighbour telling me to come home. When I got home I found my house in pieces. My kitchen and dining room were crushed,” said Dennis. He said he was supposed to be at home that day, but his boss called him to work. “If I was in my dining room, God knows what could’ve happened.” Dennis said he was scared of going back into the house. SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANOTHER MANS CHILD! “There have been accidents before, but this was the worst,” he said. “I have nightmares thinking about what could’ve happened. I won’t be able to sleep in this house again.” He said he has been sleeping on the street since the incident happened. “I was scared the building would collapse on me and I wanted to guard my remaining furniture,” he said. The owner of the truck told Daily Sun that he didn’t want to talk because he also suffered losses as a result of the crash. Dennis said police attended the scene, but he didn’t open a case, only an accident report was filed. He said the owner of the truck came to the scene and promised to replace the things that the insurance didn’t cover.
