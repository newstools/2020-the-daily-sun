WHEN President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on government’s fight against the spread of Covid-19 on 24 May, he concluded by saying: “It’s now in your hands.” With that, he also lowered the lockdown alert level from 5 to 3. Mzansi was relieved as that meant a lot of the freedoms that were taken away when lockdown was introduced in March would be restored. This also signalled the reopening of certain sectors of the economy. Some, who’d been unable to work and earn a living for two months, were allowed to return to work. For most, the biggest joy was to be able to legally buy liquor again. It had been two months of hell that saw bootleggers rule the roost. Some resorted to home-made brews, often with deadly consequences. But it seems we’ve failed to contain our excitement while enjoying our poisons. At the time of the address, Mzansi had over 22 500 positive cases of Covid-19 and 429 deaths. We started seeing people gathering in big numbers and having illegal parties all over the place, despite the clear regulations. Others dared the president and Police Minister Bheki Cele through video clips made while they were drunk. The chaos has been escalating ever since. Despite the deployment of soldiers to help the cops maintain law and order, Mzansi continued to misbehave. Some have even been resorting to drinking in the bushes instead of following the rules. This has come back to haunt us. It has come back to bite us on our backside: we’ve just reached the ONE MILLION infection mark! The president did, after all ask us to be responsible and with 26 735 deaths thus far, we can’t complain if we find ourselves with stricter lockdown levels. It was in our hands to enjoy ourselves responsibly but we threw it away. If the president puts a damper on the New Year’s Eve celebrations, let’s not complain. We deserve it. We were mamparas in our behaviour, especially since the beginning of the festive season.
