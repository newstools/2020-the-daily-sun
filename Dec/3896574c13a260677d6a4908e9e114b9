TSHWANE coach Jenny van Dyk says setting their standards high is one of the key factors that helped them dominate the Spar Netball National Championship. On Saturday, Tshwane were crowned champions of the annual championship in Bela Bela, Limpopo for the third time in a row. In what was a repeat of last year’s final‚ Tshwane registered a clinical 44-39 victory over Dr Kenneth Kaunda. “We set ourselves high standards. Hence we’re achieving so much,” said victorious Tshwane coach Jenny van Dyk. “I’m proud of the girls. We’ve won this competition for three consecutive years. We win because of the process, hard work and the standard we’re pushing.” Despite losing the final for the second time in a row, Dr KK coach Elsje Jordaan was proud of her young squad displays at the six days long tournament. Jordaan said: “It’s disappointing because you want to play in the final. I said to the players, you win a silver medal but lose a gold medal. “I’m pleased with the way we played in the final. But compliments should go to Tshwane. Congratulations to them on winning the gold medal.” Earlier, Tshwane’s Under-21 side also defended their title when they defeated Mangaung 50-48 after extra time.
