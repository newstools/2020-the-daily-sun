SUPERSPORT United have announced the contract termination of long serving defender Clayton Daniels with immediate effect. The club has agreed to release the player as they couldn’t agree on a new contract length. Early this season SuperSport Kaitano Tembo indicated that the club will be promoting more young blood from their Multichoice Diski Challenge team to the first team. With Daniels leaving, Tembo will now give chance to players such as Luke Fleurs and TT Dithlokwe. The 36-year-old joined Matsatsantsa in the 2014-15 season and has played over 200 games and has won five trophies, which include one Telkom-Knock-Out, two back-to-back Nedbank Cup trophies and two MTN 8 trophies. "The club would like to wish him all the best in his future endeavours," the club said in a statement. SuperSport United CEO Stanley Matthews said:“Clayton has been a great player and a warrior for our club helping us win all three domestic Cups and compete in many Cup finals including the CAF Confederation Cup. "We understand his desire to play regularly, but as a club we have to also have an eye for the future and like Clayton was given a chance at a young age, we have players like Luke Fleurs and TT Dithlokwe who need to have regular game time. "So we have agreed to release Clayton with immediate effect and wish him well in his future both on and off the field.” On his departure the player said he still has milage in his legs that can carry him for two seasons. He was quoted by the club website saying: "I feel I have two good years left in me so I don’t want to spend those years watching others play, but that doesn’t change the amazing time I have had at the club and how they been good to me and trusted me with the captaincy in 2014. "So I wish all my SuperSport family the best and no one can take away the history we made together, it’s part of football and now I will be looking forward to finding a new club to finish my career.”
