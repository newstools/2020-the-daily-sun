TRUCK drivers spent the Christmas weekend nursing their wounds after they were allegedly beaten by private security hired by their boss on Christmas Eve. The 19 drivers at River North Carriers in Klerksdorp, North West, said they had had salary disputes with their employers for quite some time. When they didn’t get their 13th cheques, this caused a problem. The drivers said the bargaining council ordered the company to pay them. But when they went to park their trucks at the depot a day before Christmas, they found security guards on the premises. They said the security men told them to take their possessions off the trucks and vacate the depot. The drivers’ spokesman, David Soetsang, said when they asked what was going on, the guards pushed them around.  I HATE POKING PASTORS! “They told us we needed to take our belonging and leave immediately,” he said. He said as they were demanding answers the guards began to hit them with batons. “This happened in front of our bosses and they didn’t do anything,” he claimed. He said they still don’t know why they were assaulted because they thought everything was okay. “We don’t even know whether we still have our jobs or not. But we still want our bonuses,” he said. David said they have different salaries depending on the number of the years they’d been working there.  They’re not affiliated to a union. Rivers North Carriers co-owner Sone Du Bruyn said the drivers were employees of Plh Placement CC, therefore they will not comment on the incident. She referred Daily Sun to the agency, but their representatives also refused to comment. The drivers said they wanted to fix the matter internally with their employer before they involved the police. No case has been opened. Yet.
