SDUDLAS are tired of being winter stock. They want true love and to be respected during all seasons. They even created a group on Facebook called, Sdudlas Who Need True Love. Sdudlas told Daily Sun Mzansi men don’t take them seriously after winter and they’re tired of this. Gcinile Sthebe (37) from Durban said she hasn’t been in a stable relationship for the past three years. She said even her last relationship wasn’t that nice. “After that, the only men I meet are ones who start ghosting you when winter ends. Some even call you only when it’s raining,” she said. “This clearly showed I was nothing but a winter stock. We’re not getting any younger and I don’t want to end up alone and miserable.” Anele Mbatha (32) from Newcastle in KZN said she has two kids with different baby daddies and she’s starting to think they were with her to keep them warm in winter. “I don’t understand what went wrong. Both those relationships ended like nothing ever happened,” said Anele. “Men must look our way as well. We’re good in bed, we can cook, clean and do all the things that a wife can do,” she said. Amahle Mthiya (29) from Newcastle said it’s not nice being single during the festive season. “I don’t think men understand the impact they have on us. We question ourselves, wondering if we’ll ever be good enough for anyone,” she said. Nomalanga Dlamini (33) from Mthatha said last year she hit the gym to see if her relationship will last. She dated a man for almost a year, but recently he started ignoring her. “I don’t wish this on my enemies. This makes me feel worthless. “I hope I’ll still have strength for my next relationship,” she said. Lydia Sithole (33) from Springs in Ekurhuleni said she’s been in a relationship with a man for three years, but when summer comes he’s hardly at home.
