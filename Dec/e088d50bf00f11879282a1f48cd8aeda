CHIPPA United’s reserves are ready to take the rebranded DStv Diski Challenge by storm this season. The Premier Soccer League (PSL) reserve league, formerly known as the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC), is back after a 10-month absence. The league, which couldn’t be completed last season due to the Covid-19 outbreak, has undergone a rebranding with a new logo and name-change ahead of the 2020-21 season. The season opener will see the Chilli Boys host Black Leopards at the Giant Stadium in Soshanguve on Saturday (11am). Chippa’s Diski Challenge coach, Siya Gwambi, said his team are excited to get back on the pitch after a lengthy spell. He insisted his side, who were 11th last season when the season was halted, will challenge this season, if they have 16 players from the last season who still eligible to play this season. “We only started to prepare for the match two weeks ago when we got the green light but can’t complain. We’re happy to be back,” said Gwambi. “The players are really excited and looking forward to getting back onto the pitch. This has been long overdue because we last played in February, so you can imagine how fired up the boys are. This is also a live game so they’re really up to the challenge. “But we have to challenge this season. We have not done that in this competition and I feel this could be the season when we raise our hand. We have continuity with 16 of our players from last season still eligible to play and the experience they have gained should be evident.” The match between Chippa and Leopards will be followed by SuperSport United against Orlando Pirates at the same venue.
