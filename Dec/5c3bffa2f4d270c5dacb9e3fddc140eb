Christmas traditionally is a time we spend with those we love. With a year marred by Covid-19 and constant revising of lockdown regulations. This year’s Christmas might be taken to the outdoors to help limit spread of this deadly virus. With visitation allowed to certain degree, partners visiting their in-laws for Christmas lunch might expect a slightly new normal to this year’s proceedings. Besides the usual screening, sanitizing and social distancing. How should you handle visiting your partner’s parents this year? 1.	Have a gift in hand and kind words on your lips. No matter what you’re doing, where, when, what time of day, in what season. Never arrive empty handed. It also helps to bring a bag of compliments with you. 2.	Relax, and enjoy the moment The point of meeting the parents is that you care about your partner, and you could see them in your life for a while to come. Make the most of it. 3.	Be open minded Whether you meet the parents in their home or in a public space, you are guaranteed to learn something about your partner during the meeting.
