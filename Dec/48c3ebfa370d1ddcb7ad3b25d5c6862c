Some call it Siyavana, Xhosa for getting along. Many South Africans seem to be enjoying the cider, which has been causing a lot of chaos on social media. So, what is in this potent cider which drives people into a frenzy? Savanna Dry is produced from crushed apples grown in the Elgin Valley of the fertile Western Cape, and it is described as a clear, refreshing and dry tasting cider. The production of the cider takes place in the apple cider plant in Paarl, Western Cape. While the making of this cider is considered dry, its social impact has been likened to massive thunder showers. In the year 2020 alone, there have been hundreds of images and hashtags of the cider. Many believe yesterday’s (28 December) presidential announcement of moving the country to alert level 3 lockdown was due to the damage caused by this beverage on social media. With its range including dry, lemon, light, loco and jean flavours. It’s definitely dry but do drink it responsibly.
