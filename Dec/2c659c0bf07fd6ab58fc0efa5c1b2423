Actor Sandile Mahlangu has scored himself an acting role. The talented actor plays Sbu Thwala on the Netflix series, How to Ruin Christmas: The Wedding. Speaking to SunBuzz, Sandile said: “When I got the call that I got the role on the series, I was going through a lot. “It was right after lockdown started and I hadn’t had a job in months. I was in a very depressive state. “And immediately after I heard the good news the shell around me sort of broke and I started becoming happier and lighter.” ALSO READ | GENERATIONS STAR HOSPITALISED Sandile described his character as the black sheep of the family. “Sbu is the black sheep of the family because he comes from a very political family that had just stumbled upon money before he was born,” he said. “Because of that, he and his parents have a different take on money. “He was born into money and it’s not something that’s special to him.” The young actor said stepping out of his shoes and portraying Sbu has been a great journey. “Because of the space I was in when I got this role, portraying Sbu has been a great journey. Sandile shared with SunBuzz that lockdown really changed how they brought their characters to life. “We’re all in the bubble. We were tested before we could go on set and we were not allowed to see other people outside. All we had was each other,” he said. “Because of that we started becoming a family and that allowed us to bring the chemistry together, and the characters became more genuine and believable. ” The much-anticipated series has been available on Netflix since Wednesday, 16 December.
