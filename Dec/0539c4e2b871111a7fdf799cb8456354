BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic’s fearless approach under coach John Maduka is set to unsettle Orlando Pirates in the MTN8 final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (6pm). The Mangaung-based club are tight and the inter-changing movements of captain Ndumiso Mabena, Siphelele Luthuli and Victor Letsoalo will tear Bucs apart if they give them space. This was on show when they, without fuss, beat Mamelodi Sundowns in the quarter-final of this competition when this season started in October. While it will be argued that Sundowns at that stage were yet to find their feet after coach Pitso Mosimane left the club in September and replaced by the trio of coaches – Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela – Celtic were undaunted by their star-studded opponents and credit should go to them. Against SuperSport United in the semi-finals in both legs, Celtic completely matched Kaitano Tembo’s side. In the first leg in Tshwane, they moved the ball swiftly in dangerous areas. When Mabena got hold of the ball, he cleverly played a disguised pass to Victor Letsoalo, the unsung hero of this side, and SuperSport did not know what hit them. The 33-year-old classy Mabena, who has won this competition twice with Pirates, scored the vital goal. In the second leg in Bloemfontein, SuperSport, looked to score early and take the game away from Celtic, but their game plan was all over the place. They were duly punished as Celtic caught them unaware. What Celtic have mastered is they have learnt to stick to their game plan and style of play, no matter who their opponents are. If Pirates, unbeaten against Celtic in the last four matches, structurally get it wrong and don’t take care of Mabena and Letsoalo, their six-year trophy search will be extended. Pirates go to this game having lost their last five cup finals since the 2014-15 season, with the recent one being the Telkom Knockout in 2018 against Baroka FC.
