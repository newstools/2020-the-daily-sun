DJ Tira has been praised for opening his heart and helping a family in need. Mthobisi Nombhedu (29) from Verulam, north of Durban, approached him on Facebook asking for help. In his post, the young man mentioned how he and his brothers were struggling to raise their little sister. “My mother passed away in July. I live with my three siblings and I’m the oldest. The youngest is a girl. “I’d like to help her continue with her studies and help her with everything, but I’m already struggling. “We didn’t enjoy Christmas at all. We only ate rice and fish with beans.

Maybe he might come up with a solution.” In a matter of hours the DJ had responded and contacted Mthobisi. He later wrote: “We’re going to meet tomorrow.” His fans soon flooded his Facebook page and praised him for the good deed. Malibongwe Chili thanked DJ Tira and wrote: “Lord bless you, DJ Tira. I wish you could help more people because thousands of people are poor but need little assistance to change their lives #black_child_you’re_on_your_own” Phumlani Ndlovu applauded DJ Tira for being a good example and helping out whenever he’s asked. He wrote: “The only musician who’s always wanted or needed by people in need and never disappoints. You’re a good example in society and the rest of Mzansi. There are other artists who do similar, but malume people are pinning their hopes on you merely because you always come up with a plan. May bless you abundantly.” Angel Silindile wrote: “DJ Tira, may God bless you and your family as you help this family. May God also fulfil your wishes and keep you under his wing.”
