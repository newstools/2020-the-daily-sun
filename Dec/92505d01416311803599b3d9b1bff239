In August, the Marikana community in Philippi East illegally occupied the Lower Crossroads Community Hall after their shacks were damaged by heavy rain. More than 100 community members are now staying there with no masks, sanitisers or social distancing. Community leader Vuyiswa Nondala said they want to go back to their shacks but the situation is still the same. “Our shacks are floating. We can’t go back there. But our fear now is the second wave might attack us because there is no social distancing, no sanitisers and most of us don’t even have masks. We need help,” said Nondala. According to her, the City of Cape Town has promised to assist them with groceries. “We are struggling here. Some don’t even have shacks anymore. They were stolen. We need food and clothes from anyone who can assist us,” said Nondala. They use toilets when taking a bath. “We share the place with men and kids. Everyone is here and we are afraid that we will have Covid-19,” said Nondala. Another resident said: “We are tired of staying in a community hall. Some people here are sick but they don’t have any other place to go and the city doesn’t even care, while they are the ones who refused to assist us by using their trucks to suck the water out of our area.” When Daily Sun visited the hall on Friday, 11 December, some people were busy cooking while others were watching TV but none of them had a masks on. Nobathembu Mrhweqane said they don’t even have clothes. “I am one of the residents whose shack was stolen. I went back and didn’t find anything. The criminals took everything. We need help,” said Nobathembu. Richard Bosman, executive director for safety and security in the city, said they have made no promises to the community that is illegally occupying the hall. “There were offers to relocate them to alternative space by our Disaster Risk Management centre, however they refused the relocation offer,” said Bosman.
