 ELVIS PROPOSED and Lebohang said yes. But a few minutes after signing the register, Lebohang was left standing at the gates of Home Affairs. AND HER NEW HUSBAND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE ROAD! After five years of living together, Lebohang Mashiloane and Elvis Qobondwane got married. Shortly after signing the papers at Brakpan Home Affairs in Ekurhuleni in 2007, Elvis hit the road and disappeared for another five years! “I remember after we signed at Home Affairs, he told me to go home and wait for him there. But he never came!” Lebohang told Daily Sun. “He walked away without even once sleeping in our marital bed.” Forty-six-year-old street vendor Lebohang, who stays in Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, believes Elvis Qobondwane, who’s now 57, took her for a long ride. “There were no celebrations. We parted at the gate of Home Affairs,” she said. When he came back five years later, it was only to demand their marriage certificate, saying he wanted to use it to borrow money from the bank. “I asked why he left and he told me he’d come back. He took the certificate but never came back.  “I think he’s living with a woman and she’s benefitting from whatever he organised with our papers. “He used me and our marriage for his own selfish interests. I don’t even know where he stays.” Lebohang said she wants to get out of the marriage. “I’m just married to a piece of paper. As a married person you sometimes need the signature of the other spouse. I want a divorce but don’t know where to find him.” Just like Lebohang, Daily Sun couldn’t locate the runaway groom. Serame Kgosi of Nkosi Attorneys said Lebohang can use substituted service if she doesn’t know the whereabouts of her husband. He said as for her husband borrowing money without giving her anything, that can be used against him.
