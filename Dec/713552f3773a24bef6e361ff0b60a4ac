THE festive season is upon us and nothing gets us in the mood like having festive decor, fashion and beauty trends. As everyone is gearing up for a jolly time and getting their hair and nails done, a photo of a festively decorated 4-5 on a manicure surfaced on social media. “OK, these are objectively terrible but the TALENT. My God, look at that shading,” one user said while marvelling at the beauty of the art. Most of the commenters didn’t like it but one suggested it would be great to get it as a Christmas present for someone. The 4-5 nail trend isn’t new. The trend was viral at the beginning of this year, and it is still unclear what inspired this bizarre trend.
