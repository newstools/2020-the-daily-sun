ESTHER Ntsilo (31) of Madras outside Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge has been reported missing after allegedly being kidnapped by people in a blue VW Polo in Hazyview on Saturday morning. Her worried husband, Buti Vuma (35), told Daily Sun Ntsilo was on her way to visit her mum at her workplace in Joburg that morning when he received a SMS from her that she’d been kidnapped. “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. The first message said: “Baby I suspect that I have boarded the wrong car.” The second said: “Baby please, a blue VW Polo gave me a lift.  “There were two occupants and a woman was driving. Now the man is driving and they’ve changed direction.” She said when she asked where they were going, they said they were avoiding the toll gates. Vuma said his wife messaged that they were taking her phone and then her phone went dead. Realising that his wife was in trouble, he reported the matter to Hazyview police, who opened a file of a missing person. Police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said: “Police are appealing to anyone with information that can assist in a case of kidnapping where Esther is said to have been given a lift by a female driver of a blue VW Polo on Saturday in Hazyview. The report indicates that the driver was with a male accomplice. Ntsilo managed to alert her husband before her cell phone went off.” Anyone with information should contact Detective Captain Eurence Sibuyi on 082 4490 231 or Detective Sergeant Amon Mahlangu on 079 7355 949, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
