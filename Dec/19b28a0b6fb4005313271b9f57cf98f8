Sex is often about great performance and exceptional timing skills. With greater emphasis on timing, great sex is often subject to when it takes. From your morning glory, afternoon quickie and the night marathon. Time plays an important role in sex. Speaking of time, we have twelve months in a year which form part of the four seasons. The kinky and sensual question that one will ask is: Which month is best to have sex? According to a global British survey, people were asked about which month is best to have sex. Over 80% of the survey revealed that men preferred to have sex during the months of June, July and August. This made sexual sense because testosterones are more potent during the winter cold season. The same survey revealed that that over 90% of women preferred December and January months. This was attributed to women preferring the summer season to get their freak on because this is when they feel the sexiest. From not wearing underwear to keeping things short and wearing sexy bikinis. Women love the double heated action. Talk about opposite attracts, right?
