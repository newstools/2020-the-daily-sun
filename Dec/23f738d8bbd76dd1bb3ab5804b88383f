RESIDENTS from Masiphumelele in Cape Town, who were affected by a fire, said they hoped to get material from the City of Cape Town soon. Nangamso Magobiyane (40) said they used to live in a community hall whenever there was a fire, but things were different this year. “We cannot do things normally because there’s nothing normal about this year. We hope to get material soon to build our shacks,” said Nangamso. Another resident, Anele Ntabeni, said they understood that it would take time to rebuild their shacks, but they were not ready to risk their lives by living in one place. “We’re afraid of Covid-19. How are we going to practise social distancing? We need to build our shacks quickly,” said Anele. Community leader Lungisa Mnqwazi said many people lived in the community hall. “This is a problem in this area. It is not something new. Why can’t government build flats for these people instead of coming here each year for the same thing?” He told Daily Sun service delivery in that ward was very poor. “We demand equality. If the city says they cannot live in the community hall, then what other option are they giving them? People need a place to live while they are waiting to rebuild their shacks.” Richard Bosman, the City of Cape Town’s executive director for safety and security, said the allegations that they told residents to use the community hall were false. “No emergency shelter was activated due to Covid-19 regulations,” he said.
