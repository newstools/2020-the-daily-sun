Generations: The Legacy actress Letoya Makhene was hospitalised. The talented actress, who plays the role of Tshidi on the popular SABC 1 soapie, recently spent a few days in hospital after she pushed her body to its limits. "Our bodies talk to us, we either choose to listen or not and I chose not to," she said. "I pushed myself to the max until my body couldn’t carry me anymore." Although she spent a few days in a hospital bed, the actress also revealed that she's doing well. "I’m alive, I’m well and I’m out of hospital," she added. She further said that when she was in hospital, her fiance Lebohang Kwesa did not want to leave her sight. "She refused to leave my side," she captioned a photo of her and Lebo laying on her hospital bed. Letoya's hospitalisation follows after she revealed that she's shopping for the in-laws. Lebo recently paid lobola for her. "Makoti has been given her list of gifts for the in-laws and I just wanted to spoil my new family with nothing but the best double-ply, mink blankets," she wrote. Our bodies talk to us. We either choose to listen or not. I chose not to. I pushed myself to the max until my body couldn’t carry me anymore. I’m alive. I’m well.
