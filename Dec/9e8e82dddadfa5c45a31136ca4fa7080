PEOPLE often realise their potential when they’re pushed to the edge. This was Mlamlile “Hlombe” Mtotywa’s experience. He became an imbongi at his brother’s funeral. The 28-year-old from Philippi, Cape Town, said he grew up in the Eastern Cape but later moved to the Western Cape. “I loved my elder brother Lonwabo, who died in 2013, so much. I was in pain and didn’t have a way to express my loss, ” he said. “My pain was too much to bear, so I burst into a praise song to honour him,” he said. “As a young boy growing up, I could tell I had this gift, but my brother’s death pushed me to become an imbongi.” Hlombe performs at events around Cape Town. When asked how he comes up with his lyrics, he said he often doesn’t prepare. Instead, they come naturally. “I observe what people’s reactions. When people speak about a certain person, that sets the tone for my lyrics right there. “I don’t sit down and do research or anything,” he said. Hlombe aims to take his gift to a new level. He said his gift is central to African culture. He told the People’s Paper: “I want to be a well-known imbongi and help young people from ekasi to do this. “It’s important to have praise singers among us. “They were there emandulo and we should work to keep this culture alive.”
