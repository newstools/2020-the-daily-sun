Workers at the Mkhuhlu poultry farm near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, are breathing a sigh of relief after months of being troubled by giant snake. The python has been eating the faem’s chickens since last year. When workers visited the kraals in the morning they found chickens missing. Upon investigating, they saw a giant path of a snake pointing torward the bushes. When the workers were about to feed the chickens they found the giant python inside the kraal on Wednesday, 2 December. Supervisor, Adrian Khoza, told Daily Sun they were about to feed the chickens when they spotted the giant snake but it quickly ran into hiding. “We’re glad we found the troublesome snake. Our chickens had disappeared mysteriously and our boss was accusing us of stealing them. We also had goats at the farm during the day. We heard the python crying like it from the bushes, so we were scared but we will be watching that another one doesn’t return to eat the chicken,” said Adrain. Bushbuckridge local municipality worker, Cockroach Mdluli, said the 5m long python was found inside the kraal. It was rescued and taken to the Kruger National Park. “This type of a snake might be coming from a nearby river to look for food, especially chickens. We urge workers to always be on the lookout for these giant snakes.”
