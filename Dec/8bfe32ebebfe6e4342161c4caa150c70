THE rise in Covid-19 infections in rural areas of the Eastern Cape is causing great concern as the country heads into the festive season. The second wave has already claimed nine lives in the OR Tambo District Municipality in the past three weeks. Eight of the deceased are from the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality, and one from the Port St John’s Municipality. According to acting senior manager for medical services, Dr Simthandile Toni of the Mthatha Regional Hospital in Mthatha, seven of the patients were admitted to the hospital. “The numbers are increasing every day and are worrrying. People are losing their lives,” he said. Dr Toni said the second wave started in the Mthatha hospitals in early November and was increasing. “Negligence in super-spreader events like funerals is one of the reasons for the dangerous second wave,” he said. “The hospital will shut down the outpatients department on Friday, 5 December. Patients are urged to take their medication with them to their local health centres as clinics and hospitals battle the second wave. According to the OR Tambo health department report, there are about 488 active cases in the OR Tambo District Municipality.
