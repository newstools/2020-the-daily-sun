BAROKA goalkeeper and captain Elvis Chipezeze says he does not have a problem with Oscarine Masuluke been preferred in goal ahead of him and stressed he is fully behind his teammate. The Zimbabwean international has lost his number one spot to Masuluke and the 30-year-old told SunSport that it is not about him, but the whole team. “It is the decision of the coach and as a player, you have to respect it,” said Chipezeze. “We are a team here at Baroka and we support whoever is playing because it’s about teamwork. I work together with Oscarine and we support each other. At the end of the day, we want what is best for the team.” Baroka new coach Matsimela Thoka started the season with the Bakgaga number one goalie, but dropped him after he played three of their opening DStv Premiership matches. In those three matches against Maritzburg United, Black Leopards and Golden Arrows, the Ga-Mphahlele based side won two and drew one with Chipezeze in goal. But after the 1-1 draw with Arrows, Chipezeze was demoted to the bench, with Thoka preferring Masuluke. Masuluke, who was dismissed by club chairman Khurishi Mphahlele for allegations of drinking in the bus after the game against Free State Stars in 2018, rejoined Baroka on a three-year contract this season. Masuluke has so far played four consecutive games, with Chipezeze watching from the bench. In those matches, Baroka suffered two defeats, drew one and won one.
