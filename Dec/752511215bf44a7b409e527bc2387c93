MATRICS across the country said they were happy with the second history exam, which they wrote yesterday. Itumeleng Mashishi (18) from Rosina Sedibane Modiba Sport School in Centurion, Tshwane, said it was one of the easiest exams she’d written. However, she said, preparing for her exams hadn’t been easy. “It was difficult to adjust to the new normal of wearing masks and social distancing because we were used to studying in groups,” she said. Boitumelo Sithole (17) from Boitshepo Secondary School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said he also wrote well. “I gained a lot from the pandemic because it helped me to focus more on my studies as we were home most of the time,” he said. David Zitha (19), Precious Machabe (18) and Sipho Sithole (19) of Sokisi High School in Clare Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said the paper went well and they were looking forward to getting high marks. Matrics at Mohlakaneng Senior Secondary School in Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said they enjoyed the paper. Maite Ramalepe said: “I used previous exam papers and some textbooks to prepare and I feel good about it.” Evans Mabato (18) said the paper was easy. They both said they were confident they’ pass with a level 7. Mboni Khumalo (18) from Khayalethu High School in Phatsima, outside Rustenburg in North West, said the paper was fair. He said he downloaded past papers and hoped to pass with a level 6. “I don’t think I’d have been able to get through the paper had it not been for my teachers.”
