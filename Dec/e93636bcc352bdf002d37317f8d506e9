SHE’S dancing and grooving and boozing – and she has a toddler on her back! A shocking video of the woman at a tavern or club has gone viral. In the 40-second video, the unknown woman is carrying the child on her back in a crowded venue. While she drinks her booze in the background people can be heard singing, “oh baby mama” but the woman seems unbothered. Later, the same child can be seen dancing on the counter with people cheering him on. One of the patrons goes as far as giving the toddler a bottle of booze to hold in his hand while he dances. On social media, people called for the arrest of the woman and the venue to be closed. Some people said this kind of behaviour would make the government move Mzansi back to level 5 lockdown. VusiCossa tweeted: “This one deserves jail” twenty7d said: “I laughed at the baby mama song. But this is child abuse. She must lose custody of the child.” Ntsako2001 said: “At least she’s responsible. “Some mothers leave kids at that age alone and go drinking.”  Meanwhile, police are warning negligent mothers to stop putting fun before their children. During this festive season many mothers leave their kids alone to go jiving. A 30-year-old mother was bust last week at Rietvallei after she allegedly left her two children, aged two and nine, alone in a locked room which allegedly led to the nine-year-old girl being raped. “Police attended to a complaint of rape of a nine-year-old minor at Rietvallei,” said Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso Police Station. “Police were informed that the mother of the rape victim had locked her kids in a room the previous night and never returned.” Sibiya said police found the mother at the tavern and arrested.
