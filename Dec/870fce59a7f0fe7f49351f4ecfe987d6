Gavin Hunt says it is vital that centre-back Erick Mathoho finds his form quickly after a stop-start 2020-21 season so far. ‘Tower’ is an integral part of the Chiefs backline, but after returning from injury, was sent-off in the 2-0 MTN8 semifinal loss to Orlando Pirates early last month. It means he has made just four appearances this season in all competitions, but bounced back with a goal in Chiefs’ 1-0 away victory over PWD Bameda in the CAF Champions League preliminary round, first leg, on Sunday. “He scored a great goal like a striker should score, but you can see he is rusty. His general play was a bit slow and you can see he needs games to get up to speed,” Hunt says. “That suspension hit us badly. He was out for a long time, then he came back and played and got suspended. He would have had a good many more games by now. But he has enough experience to help us.” Chiefs returned from Cameroon early on Tuesday morning, and are next in action on Friday when they host PWD again, hoping to complete the job and set up a first round tie with Primeiro de Agosto from Angola. -SuperSport
