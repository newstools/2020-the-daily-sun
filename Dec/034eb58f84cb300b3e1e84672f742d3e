CLEAN, see-through public toilets have been built in Tokyo Park. The toilets are made of coloured see-through glass that lights up the park like a beautiful lantern at night.  This new design is meant to ensure that users can inspect the stall for cleanliness and check if there is no one inside. The concept is not new as it has been tried by a few London nightclubs and people find it intriguing. “There are two things we worry about when entering a public restroom, especially those located in a park,” according to architect Shigeru Ban’s firm. “The first is cleanliness, and the second is whether anyone is inside.” Even though the toilets are transparent, they still offer privacy to the users. After users enter the toilet and lock the door, the powder room’s walls turn a powdery pastel shade – and are no longer see-through.  “Using a new technology, we made the outer walls with glass that becomes opaque when the lock is closed, so that a person can check inside before entering,” the Nippon Foundation said. The project was undertaken by 16 architects who are re-imagining public toilets and are some of the brightest names in Japanese architecture. The list includes four Pritzker Prize winners – Ban, Toyo Ito, Tadao Ando and Fumihiko Maki along with international stars Kengo Kuma and Sou Fujimoto. The fashion designer Nigo also contributed.
