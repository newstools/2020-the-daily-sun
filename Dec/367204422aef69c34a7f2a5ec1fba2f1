SWALLOWS FC missed an opportunity to go top of the DStv Premiership twhen they were held to a 1-1 draw by Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday afternoon. With log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, now two points clear at the top as they visit Maritzburg United on Saturday night (8:15pm) This was a chance for the Soweto giants to stake their claim and put pressure on Tshwane giants. However, it wasn’t to be as they shared the spoils with Abafana Bes’Thende. To be fair, it was not going to be easy to face Arrows side in Durban. At this early stage of the season, the Durban-based side are a tough nut to crack under Mandla Ncikazi. The Dube Birds though showed their intentions of the game in the first half. They went ahead when Zeph Mbokoma rifled home in the 20th minute after the defensive mix up between Arrows goalie Sifiso Mlungwana and Velemseni Ndwandwe. However, Arrows didn’t lie down without a fight. They responded well and it wasn’t surprising when they evened up the numbers. Nduduzo Sibiya equalized in the 31st minute when his curving free beat Virgil Vries. This was the second time Sibiya has come to the rescue for Arrows this season at the same venue. When Arrows were staring to their first league loss of the season at the hands of Kaizer Chiefs last month, Sibiya curled another brilliant ball outside the box to leave the game 2-2 draw. This means Ncikazi and Swallows counterparts Brandon Truter, novices in the PSL top flight, remain unbeaten so far in the DSTV Premiership. Prior to the game, coach Ncikazi conceded that Swallows will have their tails up after beating Chiefs in their previous game. And he got that with Mbokoma putting Swallows ahead and looking to continue where Dube Birds left it off when the two sides last time met. Swallows beat Abafana Bes’Thende 1-0 in March 2014 when Vuyisile Wana scored on the day. But this lead didn’t last long as Sibiya ensured Arrows’ form this season remains untainted.
