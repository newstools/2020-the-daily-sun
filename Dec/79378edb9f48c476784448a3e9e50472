THEY were tired of corruption regarding RDP houses in their area. So the group called Amavosho forcibly occupied newly built RDP houses in Chief Albert Luthuli in Cloverdene, Ekurhuleni. Amavosho was formed by backroom dwellers from Daveyton. But their leader Popo Mnguni is now dead. He was shot on Saturday night, 5 December, after he received threats at a meeting held over the same RDP houses. Popo was shot dead at a house he had occupied. His wife, Lebo Segwathi (36), said three suspects knocked on the door just after 10pm. “He went to check who was knocking and I heard gunshots when he opened the door,” she said. Lebo said the three gunmen then jumped into their car and sped off. She said her husband was her pillar of strength and breadwinner. Popo’s sister, Nompumelelo, said her brother died a hero as he was fighting for people to get houses.  “There was a lot of corruption in the allocation of houses in Daveyton and Mayfield and he has been fighting this.” She said during the meeting on Saturday, her brother received threats but didn’t take them seriously. “He thought it was people who were just bitter. The following day my brother was shot at his RDP house. “We suspect it was a planned hit because the perpetrator did not take his wallet, only his cellphone was missing,” she said. “We suspect the cellphone might have conversations that might link them to murder.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mopeli said a murder case was opened at Crystal Park Police Station and cops were investigating. No suspects have been arrested yet.
