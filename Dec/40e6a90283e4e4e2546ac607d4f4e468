After lifting weights, running on the treadmill or doing a cardio workout, most men’s fitness regimes are complete, right? So, why don’t men include yoga to their workout regime? According to fitness stats, a lot of men tend to shy away from doing yoga. Many of them see yoga as an activity for women. Despite yoga becoming a booming business all over the world, with millions of active practitioners on- and offline, men still don’t see what the fuss is all about. So, why should men do yoga? 1. Good for sex A 2010 study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine said yoga improves all sexual functions in men, including desire, performance, erection and ejaculation control. 2. Builds muscles Yoga uses natural body weight and resistance to build lean muscle mass. Yoga lengthens muscles and tissue, which improves blood flow. 3. Improves productivity Yoga doesn’t only help men in the bedroom and the gym, it also improves productivity in the workplace.
