MATRICULANTS said they enjoyed writing their second accounting paper yesterday. Basetsana Rankoko (19) from Itumeleng Secondary School in Ledig Village, near Rustenburg, North West, said the exam was easy-peasy. “I’m grateful for the study camp we had. The revision we did helped me a lot,” she said. “I enjoyed writing accounting. I believe I did well. I’m looking forward to getting my results.” Merry Ndlovu (20) said the paper was a walk in the park. She said she found just one question a bit challenging. She said she learnt the importance of preparing and studyng smart, as it meant there was less chances of panic. “I urge other pupils to prepare as it’ll produce good results,” she said. Light Thobela (18) and Creation Mnisi (17) from Dayimani High School in Gottenburg, Mpumalanga, said the paper was excellent. “We wrote well. We believe we got a level six pass,” said Light. Tshepo Rubo (18) from Mmakgetsi High School said he felt positive about his Accounting exam. He said most of the chapters he studied were there on the paper. “I believe I did well. Only a few questions were difficult, but the rest was smooth sailing,” he said. Tshepo said he didn’t have any problems during his exam preparation because nothing much changed for him. “We studied on our own because of the pandemic but that wasn’t a problem for me because I’m used to studying alone,” he said
