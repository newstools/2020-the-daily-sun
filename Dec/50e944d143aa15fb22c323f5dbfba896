We often hear of nail-biting action or nailing an exam or interview. We also hear of a team laying the final nail in the other team’s coffin. The underlining theme here is the role that nails play in our daily lives. The same sentiments can be shared with human nails. Formed within the nail bed just beneath where the U-shaped cuticles begin, human nails play an important role in the genetic make-up of the human hand. While modern research shows that biting your nails enables one’s nails to grow faster, there are some health risks to biting your nails. Besides the usual damaging of the skin in and around the finger area, biting your nails makes you susceptible to infections. From colds to common flu, bitten nails open the door to such viral and contagious viruses. Research also suggests that biting your nails can also damage your teeth. Health experts advise that constant exercise and keeping preoccupied can help with this common habit.
