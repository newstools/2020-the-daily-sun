THERE will be lots of inconsistencies in the GladAfrica Championship this season because the games are played within a short space of time, said Cape Town Spurs coach Vladislav Heric. Heric said this will also see players suffer more muscular injuries because there’s no time in between games to recover, and this will have a huge effect on teams challenging for the title. He added that this season, having started so soon after the past campaign had just finished, gave clubs little time to prepare and rest players. However, he said there’s nothing they can do because this is the situation not only faced by the PSL, but clubs around the world. The congested season was caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that forced the suspension of football worldwide in March. The Championship, along with the Absa Premiership, had to be finished in a bio-bubble in Gauteng in September. Worse for Spurs is that, when the club was known as Ajax Cape Town last season, they went through the heartache of losing promotion via the playoffs, giving them less time to put a team together and give players time to relax. “This season I think there will be a lot of ups and downs because none of us as coaches can prepare or rectify mistakes, because we are having one or two training session and that is not enough to change things,” Heric told SunSport. Despite these concerns, Heric, who has a lot of experience in the Championship, said the mandate from his management is that he should win promotion. “The mandate for me is to promote this club to the DStv Premiership,” said Heric, who helped to promote Chippa United in the 2013-14 season with the late Roger Sikhakhane. “And this is achievable. The only problem I’m having is that I don’t have time for training sessions because this season is very short. “But I still believe my players can do the job for me.” @duke_robin
