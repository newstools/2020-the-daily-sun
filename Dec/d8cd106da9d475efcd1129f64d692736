MZANSI has lost yet another great actor. Babsy Selela succumbed to diabetes on Tuesday, 22 December. The 57-year-old was known for his many roles on South African productions such as Skwizas, Sgud ’Snaysi, Ses’ Top La, Tsha Tsha and Shaka. Babsy was also loved for his charcater of Malume Zulu on SABC1’s Thandeka’s Diary, alongside Skhumba Hlophe and Busi Mtshali. His nephew, Zola told Daily Sun that Babsy was taken to hospital two days before his death. “He had been diabetic for about 10 years. On Sunday, his sugar and BP levels went up and I took him to the hospital. It got worse on Tuesday and that’s when he died,” said Zola. He said Babsy was like a mother and father to him. “I am his sister’s son. We were left alone, all his sisters died and it was just the two of us. “He was everything to me and was my only parent. I’ve lost my parent,” he said. “I’ve placed it all on God. He knows why this happened and He knows the plans He has. It hurts, but the Lord will take care of it and take care of me.” According to Zola, Babsy still worked as an actor. “He stayed in Gauteng, but he came home to Umlazi, KZN two weeks back. He was working on something here and had planned to go back to Gauteng because he had another acting gig waiting for him. Unfortunately, this happened,” he said. Zola doesn’t have any funeral details yet. “I’m still looking for a grave. As soon as I get that, I will bury him the following day. I haven’t been getting lucky because the past few days have been busy with the holidays and all.”
