TWO leading Mzansi boxers Mziwoxolo Ndwayana and Thulani Mbenge will temporarily suspend their friendship when they go to battle for the national welterweight championship. The former stablemates at Fourways’ Smith Gym will oppose each other for Ndwayana’s crown on 18 December at Kagiso Memorial Hall. The pair will cross swords for the second time after Mbenge registered a points victory over his boxing friend. According to the defending champion, since the announcement of their fight they have not spoken. “There is no love lost between us. We are still friends but once we step into the ring, everything changes. Our rivalry starts and end inside the ring and after the fight, we pick up on our friendship,” said Ndwayana. This will be a second SA title defence for Ndwayana, who hails from Makhanda in Grahamstown. He scored a seventh round stoppage victory to against Shaun Ness to annex the vacant title two years ago, and went on to successfully defend it against Odwa Gaxa. Although the former WBF International title holder was outpointed by Mbenge in their previous encounter, he is optimistic about this fight. Ndwayana said he was given that fight on short notice. “We put in a challenge for this title which was held by Mbenge, his camp said they will defend against the sixth rated boxer whereas I was the number one contender. So we left our guard down, then three weeks before the bout they offered us the fight. I was coming out of a long layoff that is how I lost the fight,” he said. “I guess that was their strategy to catch me off guard. This time I will bring my A-game. I’m more than ready to retain my crown. “I know the challenger like the back of my hand. He is not bringing anything special.” Meanwhile, Mbenge who is motivated after he outclassed Congolese fighter Katembo Kuvesa last month, will be out to reclaim the national welterweight belt.
