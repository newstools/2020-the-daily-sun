NETBALL World Cup Project Manager Reabetswe Mpete says preparations for the 2023 Netball World Cup are on track despite the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. The newly appointed project manager stated that there are no concerns at this stage Mzansi is exactly where it needs to be in its preparations for the Netball World Cup. Mpete was previously at the SASCOC High-Performance Centre, where she was the coordinator of Operation Excellence, which groomed athletes for the Olympic and Commonwealth Games as well as the Youth Olympics. Mpete said: “We are all getting used to Zoom meetings, and we have a strong partnership with the three tiers of government involved in the City of Cape Town, the government of the Western Cape, and the national government. “I am very excited to be involved in this opportunity for women to shine and for netball to get the prominence it deserves. Mpete admitted that it is a huge task but they are looking forward to welcoming the World to Mzansi. She stated: “It’s a huge task, but we have a great vision for the tournament and we look forward to welcoming the world to sunny South Africa.” Next year a Netball World Cup Board will be appointed to manage the preparations and the International Netball Federation (INF) will appoint their own Project Manager to oversee preparations.Mpete said there were targets to be met at regular intervals in the run-up to the NWC. She added: “Our first task is to report to the INF in July on the progress made so far. “Our partners in this venture are all very enthusiastic about the opportunities the project offers. One of our advantages is that it is in a single centre, in a city renowned for its beauty."
