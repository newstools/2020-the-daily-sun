THEY were planning to celebrate the birthday of one of their brothers but it ended in blood shed. Five people were killed and three were injured on Friday night in Inanda, KZN. Relatives Mthokozisi Zubane, Buyisani Ntuli, Sthe Dlamini, Skhumbuzo Mandonsela (neighbour) died on the scene, while Tho Dlamini died on the way to hospital. The dead are between the ages of four and 35. It is allegedly that they were at Zubane general dealer store when three armed men arrived and opened fire. One of the suspects was arrested later. Tho’s brother Pito (29) said they came to celebrate the birthday of Tho when they were shot. “Two of my brothers were busy talking outside when I heard gun shots. I went outside to check, the gunshots continued I saw my leg bleeding. I realised that I had been shot. I crawled to run away,” said Pito. He said he only came back when it was quiet and took his brother Tho to hospital, but he died on the way.  “I was admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital and discharged today (Sunday). I really don’t know why we were shot,” said Pito. He said other people didn’t hear anything as they were playing music loud. Their elder brother Lindelani Zubane said he was at their family home in Maphumulo when he got a call to rush back home. “My mum called me saying they are being attacked I must come back home. I rushed there and found four bodies lying dead waiting for a mortuary van,” said Lindelani. He said four people were already sent to hospital, but one died on the way. “Two of them are still in hospital including my daughter Alinde (7). I am scared to go to hospital to see her,” said Lindelani. He added they were still confused why they were shot. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. She said the motive will be investigated.
