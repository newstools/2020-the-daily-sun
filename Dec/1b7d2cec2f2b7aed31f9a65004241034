A 46-year-old prison warden has been arrested after he allegedly shot his manager in the head, at the Tshwane Correctional Services Headquarters on Thursday. The Department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said it is understood that a security breach resulted in the shooting, but further details are unclear. "The used firearm was confiscated, and the South African Police Service took over the crime scene. An internal investigation into the incident will also be launched by Correctional Services," he said. Nxumalo said the injured senior manager is in hospital receiving medical treatment and trauma counselling was given to the other employees who witness the shooting. He told the SunTeam that the matter has been transferred to the South African Police Service. "What's critical at this stage is for the department to restore normalcy in the building and trauma treatment is being made available to the other officials," he said. Tshwane Police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe said at this stage they do not know the motive for the shooting. She said the 46year-old man is facing charges of attempted murder and is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon.
