A second, even more infectious coronavirus variant
originating from South Africa has been found in the UK, British health
secretary Matt Hancock has announced. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Hancock said
that scientists had identified two cases of a new coronavirus variant which he
said was even more transmissible than another variant which is currently
spreading rapidly through England. Both cases of the second variant were close contacts of
people who had recently returned from South Africa. "We've detected two cases of another new variant of
coronavirus here in the UK," Hancock said. "This new variant is highly concerning because it is
yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new
variant that has been discovered in the UK," he added. It is typical for viruses to mutate, and variants are not
necessarily more harmful or deadly. Those in the UK who have visited the country in the past two
weeks must quarantine for two weeks. The UK has also placed immediate
restrictions on travel from South Africa.
