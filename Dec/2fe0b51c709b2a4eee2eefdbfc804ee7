ROBBERS made off with huge amounts of cash after robbing cash in transit van in Gugulethu, Cape Town this afternoon. It is alleged that a group of thugs pounced on a security guard who had just loaded an ATM at KwaDuma filling station, about 800 meters from Gugulethu cop shop. Shocked residents said the incident happened very fast. “It was done very fast, it did not even take four minutes, they fired few gunshots and the next thing I saw the gunmen carrying bags of money running to their getaway car,” said a resident who stays opposite the filling station. When cops arrived at the scene the robbers had already left. Another witness said they saw an ambulance carrying the security guard who was shot during the robbery. “He was alive when they took him to the hospital but his head and clothes were full of blood. I don’t know if he will survive because he looked serious,” said Nomsa Jelele who stays in the area. National police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili confirmed the incident. “It is alleged that as a security guard had just loaded an ATM at a Petrol Station, C/O NY1 and NY 132, returned to the vehicle when he was surprised by unknown gunmen who attacked him. The victim was assaulted and numerous gunshots were fired from the suspects. In the process, he and his colleague sustained gunshot wounds one on his head and the other to his left leg,” said Muridili. She said the amount of cash which the robbers made off with is unknown. “ The unknown suspects then fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. The injured guards were transported to a nearby hospital for medical attention. The suspects are still unknown and yet to be arrested. The investigation has been taken over by members of the Department for Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI),” she added.
