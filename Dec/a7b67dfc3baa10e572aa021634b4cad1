The bail ruling of the third accused implicated in the
murder of Nateniel Julies is expected to be heard at Protea Magistrate Court
today. Sergeant, Voster Netshiongolo is facing charges of
accessory, defeating the ends of justice, and possession of ammunition. Last week, his defense lawyer, Onke Maseti brought Netshiongolo's
bail application on new evidence before the court. However, the State argued
that the evidence wasn't new and it lacked the basics of the law. The State said the court has already dealt with the matter
in Netshiongolo's previous bail application which saw him and his two
co-accused Sergeant Simon "Scorpion" Ndyalvana and Warrant Officer,
Caylene Whiteboy denied bail in September. The State Prosecutor, Mzwandile Mrwabe told Magistrate,
David Mhango that it will be the saddest day in the legal jurisprudence if the
court would say these were facts. Meanwhile, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate
(IPID) said it is opposing bail. In a statement, acting spokesman Sontag a Seisa said:
"IPID's position is that there are no new facts that justify the accused
to be approaching the court with new facts. All the facts that the accused are
trying to put before the court were actual dealt with previously. On that
basis, IPID is opposing the intended bail. Our investigation is ongoing." Nathaniel who had down syndrome was shot and killed a few
meters away from home in Eldorado Park, South of Joburg, in August.
