Kaizer Chiefs’ DStv Premiership clash with Black Leopards has been moved from Tuesday to Wednesday to give the Soweto side additional time to prepare. It follows the switch of Chiefs’ CAF Champions League clash with Cameroon side PWD Bamenda from Friday to Saturday after the late arrival in the country of their opponents. The AmaKhosi were held to a 0-0 draw in that game, but advanced 1-0 on aggregate and will now meet Angolan side Primeiro de Agosto in the next round. They have been given an extra 24 hours by the Premier Soccer League to get ready for Leopards, where they will hope to claim just a second victory of the season in what has been a tough start to the league campaign. Clashes between these two have been tight affairs of late, though Leopards will be seeking their first league win over Chiefs since 2012. The last two home meetings for the AmaKhosi with Leopards have been won 1-0 by Chiefs, while matches in Limpopo in the past two seasons have ended 1-1. New Leopards coach Dylan Kerr was in charge of Baroka FC last season as they broke Chiefs hearts on the final day of the campaign with a 1-1 draw that handed the league title to Mamelodi Sundowns. - SuperSport
