HAS-BEEN musician Mercy Pakela has criticised lockdown regulations, calling them stupid and nonsensical. In a heated Facebook post, she accuses the country’s president of being inconsiderate. She pleads with Joy Mbewana, president of the Cultural and Creative Industries Federation of South Africa, to intervene. “President of the federation, we put our trust in you. The president of the country is inconsiderate,” says the Ayashisa Amateki hitmaker. “These restrictions are stupid. The only thing he’s supposed to do is to teach people to play safe, not to dictate to us. ALSO READ: SKEEM SAAM ACTOR PAUL RAPETSOA HAS DIED! “We need you to intervene. Write a letter to him and tell him some event organisers had already spent money prior to restrictions. The 9pm curfew is utter nonsense.” She said if nothing is done to help artists, they’d take over Parliament. In another post, she says: “On 31 December God changes another year to the other year. If you’re sleeping at that time, God’s blessings pass you by. “Please, leader, speak to this man to consider constructive restrictions and not shut down New Year’s celebrations. “He must just beef up security in hot spots and let us connect with the universal power to have a brighter future for the coming year.” Mbewana responded to Mercy by saying she’d noted her plea. On Monday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a number of restrictions. Events and parties were banned with immediate effect. A week ago, a bill banning loud music in the hospitality industry was passed. The restrictions have seen artists struggling to make a living.
