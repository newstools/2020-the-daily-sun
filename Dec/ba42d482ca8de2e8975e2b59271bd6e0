A woman who allegedly stabbed her boyfriend to death is out on bail. The 29-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly stabbing dead the father of her three-year-old daughter on 1 November. On Friday 4 December she appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court and was granted R2 500 bail with the condition that she must not interfere with witnesses. But the family of the dead man, S’fiso Mabaso (30), and the community are not happy. The woman was arrested after allegedly killing Mabaso during a brawl over his bank cards in Teka Mahala Village outside Mkhuhlu. Mabaso worked as a security guard at a local clinic in nearby Oakley Village. His saddened nephew Prophet Musa (29) said: “We are very shocked that the court granted the killer bail. We had confidence that justice will take its course. She should have been kept in jail.” The angry residents said they were disgusted when they heard the suspect was released on bail. “This is absolute nonsense. We can’t allow a killer to come back to the village. She is not a suspect but a killer. We saw her kill S’fiso. We are going to hunt her down and she must follow him soon,” said one the residents.
