THE ANC and EFF were united in song bidding farewell to baby Nyiko Mthimkhulu. The two-year-old baby from Diepkloof, Soweto, was finally laid to rest on Tuesday, 1 December, after battles ensued when the two political parties treated her death like a rally. Nyiko’s grandmother, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun that she allowed the baby’s paternal family to organise the funeral because she couldn’t afford it. She said the paternal family had not paid damages and that’s why they had to continue with the funeral service at her home.

She later died at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. Her 17-year-old mother told the police that she was not around when the incidents happened. She said she had left her daughter in the care of her boyfriend and only noticed that something was wrong when her baby started crying in the middle of the night. Both the mother and her boyfriend were arrested and will make their second appearances in the Protea Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 2 December.
