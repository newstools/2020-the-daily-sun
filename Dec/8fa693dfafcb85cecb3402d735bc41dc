Four people were killed and five others serious injured
after two vehicles were involved in a head-on collision on the N2 between East
London and Butterworth in the Eastern Cape on Thursday morning. The four deceased were burnt beyond recognition, Eastern
Cape transport department spokesperson Unathi Binqose said. He said the accident occurred at 06:15 near the Nciba area. "A Toyota Etios with four occupants from East London
collided with [an] Isuzu bakkie with five males believed to be brothers,
travelling from Butterworth. The vehicles caught fire on impact. Sadly, all
four occupants from Etios got trapped in the vehicle as the fire engulfed their
vehicle." Bingose said rescue personnel managed to rescue all five
Isuzu occupants from the fire. "They escaped with severe injuries and were taken to
Frere Hospital [East London] for further medical treatment." The suspected cause for the accident is still unclear at
this stage as emergency services still gathering evidence and providing help to
the injured, said Binqose. A case of culpable homicide has been opened at Komga police
station for further investigation. SOURCE: NEWS24
