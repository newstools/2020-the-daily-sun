Khayelitsha Hospital in Cape Town is experiencing pressure in the emergency centre. Sithembiso Magubane, provincial health spokesman, said they are currently facing pressure with beds running at 120% occupancy on average. “The past week has seen the emergency centre bed occupancy reaching between 100% and 200% occupancy,” said Magubane. He said the Covid-19 cases have created a pressure in the health service with around 40% of cases. “Trauma and other non-Covid-19 cases accounting for around 40% and psyche cases going up to around 20% and the hospital. The hospital’s working with Tygerberg Hospital and Lentegeur Hospital as well as Brackengate to alleviate the pressure that it’s currently facing,” he said. Magubane said to alleviate this pressure, non-emergency cases should be attended to at surrounding health facilities as they can’t be prioritised at the hospital given the current pressure. “We responsible alcohol consumption to reduce trauma cases that end up in the hospital. Covid-19 regulations must be adhered to all times by avoiding crowded spaces, close contact with other people where you can’t maintain a 1,5m distance and confined and enclosed spaces where there is poor ventilation,” said Magubane. Resident Manelisi Nakani (34) said: “As residents, we have been blaming the hospital but in this case, we are the ones that are not following the rules and we are going to die.” He told Daily Sun people don’t care about Covid-19 even though they are seeing the numbers increasing every day. “I agree with the saying that alcohol is a problem. Most accidents and stabbing incidents that land people in the emergency room are caused by alcohol,” said Manelisi. Another resident said if people don’t change how they do things then a lot of lives will be lost. “The government has done all it can, it is up to us to play our part,” said the resident.
