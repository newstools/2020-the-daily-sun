IF two is company and three is a crowd, what is 20? That’s exactly how the winners of the recent Powerball jackpot feel. This after 20 of them won a share of the R120 million jackpot, with each walking away with over R5 million. But not all of them are happy. One of the winners (61) told Daily Sun he was happy but disappointed at the same time. The father of 23 said he knew the winning numbers were only his. The winning numbers were 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, while the bonus number was 10. “I’ve been playing these numbers for a long time. I knew that one day they’ll win,” he said. He said he knew he had hit the real jackpot when the numbers popped up on the TV screen. “I thought I’d be more than R100 million richer. I was so disappointed when I heard that 19 other people had won,” he said. “I spent so much money playing the Lotto since it started. I expected to win big when my day finally arrived. I don’t want to lie, I’m heartbroken.” He said he was retrenched at work due old age illnesses. “I was happy this money would be my retirement. It came at the right time but it was supposed to be more than this.” Another winner was also not pleased. The 36-year-old father of one said he also played these numbers repeatedly. “I spend about R250 on every draw and my numbers are always the same,” he said. “I wasn’t watching TV when the results came in. My mum saw it and told me to check my ticket because I might have won. “When I checked, I was shocked. I couldn’t sleep after finding out I had won.” But his mood soon changed when he realised there were 20 winners. “I never expected to share with so many people. I’ve never heard of it. But I’m grateful, R5 million is better than nothing. I’ll continue playing with the hope of getting more next time. “I’ll fix my mum’s house and also buy my own. I won’t quit work though.” Busisiwe Msizi, head of corporate relations at Ithuba congratulated all the winners and said Ithuba offered free financial advice to all its new millionaires
