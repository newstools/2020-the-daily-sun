IT has become inevitable in no time that Owen da Gama will become the GladAfrica Championship side Royal AM head coach. The system has been put together for Da Gama to join the club after Highlands Park sold their DStv Premiership status to TS Galaxy the off season. As reported by SunSport a few days ago, the club has appointed Simone Conley as a conditioning and fitness coach having previously worked with da Gama at Highlands. When the former Orlando Pirates coach was appointed as Highlands coach just after 2017-18 had started, he brought in Conley to be the fitness coach. Together, they quickly underlined their intentions as the now-defunct Tembisa club won the PSL top-flight promotion in the same season with the record of 69 points without losing a game at home under da Gama. The 59-year-old coach then credited her for managing Highlands players to be one of the fittest and less with injuries. This was not the first the duo have worked together. When ODG was the Under-23s coach that qualified for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil, Conley was the fitness coach. She also worked with ODG on an interim basis when Bafana Bafana had fired Ephraim Shakes Mashaba in 2016. At the Royal AM, which the KZN club bought the status of Real Kings during the off season, will see da Gama reunited with also Sinky Mnisi, who is the club CEO. Mnisi is the former Highlands Park director. Currently, Floyd Mogale is the head coach of AM after he replaced Michael Lukhubeni over the weekend. The former Steenberg United coach was fired after AM was humiliated 4-0 by Sekhukhune United on Saturday in the opening game of the 2020-21 season. However, SunSport sources have learned that Mogale, who was the Mamelodi Sundowns scout and previously the head coach of Chippa United, is given the job on an interim basis, although the club has strongly denied that.
