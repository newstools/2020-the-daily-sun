NOMSA Baloyi wants the man who bumped into her with his car to rot in jail. This after a man driving a white Toyota Fortuner with a black bumper and no number plate bumped into her white Ford Eco Sport. But the man allegedly sped off after the crash. Now Nomsa from Letlhakaneng in the North West wants justice. She told Daily Sun the incident happened on 2 November in Maboloka, North West. “The Fortuner was speeding and overtook me. The car then hit my car on the passenger door and hit an electrical pole before speeding off,” she said. She said she went to the police station the following day for an accident report. “I gave the police my statement and the description of the car, but they were not helpful. I know the person who bumped into me and even told the cops, but nothing has been done. “I asked police to open a case, but they said there was no case as it’s a hit and run,” said Nomsa. She said that when she asked to see the Letlhabile station commander, they didn’t let her. Nomsa said she later contacted the police to find out if the accident report was completed, they told her the owner said he wasn’t driving the car. “The police told me the car was driven by the owner’s cousin. The man also gave police the wrong residential address,” said Nomsa. “At the moment no one has been arrested. I will continue to fight until I win,” she said. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh confirmed that a case of reckless or negligent driving was opened on 3 November after two vehicles were involved in a crash. She said the case was still under investigation. Myburgh said the complainant was advised to call acting station commander Captain Ernest Mpolokeng on his cellphone to make an appointment. “Police management is committed to rendering a professional service to the community,” she said.
