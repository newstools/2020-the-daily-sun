VERY hectic week for Kaizer Chiefs as they now take on Black Leopards in the DStv Premiership following their Caf Champions League clash against Bamenda FC whom they knocked out of Africa's premier club competition. Samir Nurkovic is back to bolster the side while also Njabulo Blom and Daniel Cardoso shares with us how ready they are for the match.
