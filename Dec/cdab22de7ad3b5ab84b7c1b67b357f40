AWARD-WINNING designer Thula Sindi is launching his third AfricaRise store on Tuesday, 1 December. He opened the first in Sandton last year and the second in Marshalltown in the Joburg city centre in August. The new one is at Menlyn Park Shopping Centre in Tshwane. Thula said he’s bringing art to the people of Tshwane. “The third AfricaRise store is about bringing African-made garments and fine art to the people in and around Tshwane,” said Thula. “It’s very important to have spaces of beauty in commercial retail centres, and AfricaRise is the vehicle to bring African fashion, crafts, jewellery, accessories and fine art under one roof,” he said.

AfricaRise will sell products by other designers, not just Thula’s work. “The Menlyn store will feature an exclusive collection by South African fashion legend Clive Rundle, along with collections by Erre, Loincloth and Ashes, Malondie, Ephymol, Naked Ape and Relevance For Men, among many others.” It will also feature art and limited edition-signed prints by multidisciplinary South African artist Baba Tjeko. Thula said new designers will benefit from the opening of the Menlyn branch. “I’ll be introducing emerging designer brands to AfricaRise Menlyn, offering young designers a vibrant and supportive environment for six months in which to learn from me and each other about how best to maximise their talents and business skills,” said Thula.
