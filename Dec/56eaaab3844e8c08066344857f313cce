THE car was pulled over at a roadblock in Soweto. When cops opened the boot, they found sealed bottles of whisky, neatly packed in their original boxes. But it turned out the bottles were filled with tea! The naughty driver, caught at a roadblock on Impala Road, insisted the bottles were for a promotion. But the cops didn’t buy it, so to speak. The big question is how many bottles of fake whisky had already been sold? And to whom? So far the mystery hasn’t been solved.
