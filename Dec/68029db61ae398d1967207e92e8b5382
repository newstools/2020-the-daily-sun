Gospel artist Yolanda Vuthela has landed a big TV gig. On Sunday, she started presenting the show Ezokholo on Mpuma Kapa TV, which airs on DStv’s Bay TV (channel 260). She co-hosts the show alongside Bishop Bongs Xhalabile. Speaking to SunBuzz, Yolanda said it had always been her dream to present a TV show. “I’ve never presented a show, so this is my first time,” she said. “As a result, I have no experience as a TV presenter or talk show host.

I’d see myself presenting a show. I even announced it on my social media pages that one day I’d present a TV show. “At the time I was only speaking out of passion. There was no indication or anything that points in that direction. “But as a Christian I was merely using my faith to bring the TV show into existence. “Today I’m glad that I’ve reaped what I sowed. I believed in my heart and I spoke it into existence.” Yolanda didn’t go for auditions. Instead, she was headhunted by the producers. “They tracked me down and offered me the job. At first I was nervous, but managed to calm down. As a new presenter, I wanted no mistakes. Now that we’ve done a few episodes, I’m felling a bit comfortable and relaxed.” The show aims to give a platform to up-and-coming gospel artists. “My role is to present, share my experiences with the artists and guide them. For me, this is the greatest honour. It gives me an opportunity to serve,” she said. She said this new platform would enhance her music career. “I take this opportunity seriously because, generally, I’m known as Butho Vuthela’s wife. “But now people will also see that I do this separately from my husband. “For me, this is growth in my music career and social space.”
