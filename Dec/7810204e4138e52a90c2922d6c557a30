AMAZULU have postponed their announcement of their new head coach. The appointment of the new coach, which Benni McCarthy is the man, was set to be announced by the club’s president Sandile Zungu in Sandton yesterday. However, the club released a statement that the new date of the press conference will now take place in Joburg on Monday. It is not clear whether McCarthy, who won the race ahead of Stuart Baxter, Gordon Igesund, Eric Tinkler, Owen da Gama after president Zungu was advised to go for the former Bafana Bafana star striker, has arrived in the country. McCarthy resides in Scotland. But SunSport has learnt that everything has been agreed with the former FC Porto striker to become the club's new coach. Usuthu are looking for a new coach after coach Ayanda Dlamini “voluntarily” decided to step down from the head coaching position last week to go back to the club’s development structures. In the interim, Dlamini’s assistant coach Allan Freese was placed in charge of the squad until the club appoints the new coach. It is likely that the former Highlands Park coach will be on the bench when Usuthu host provincial rivals – Golden Arrows in a DStv Premiership match at Jonsson King Spark Stadium on Wednesday.
