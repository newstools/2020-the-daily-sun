IDOLS SA 2018 winner Yanga Sobetwa dreams of becoming a lawyer. But circumstances seem to block her way and she had to drop out of school again. Yanga’s school work was first disrupted when she auditioned for Idols in 2018. Last year, she attended classes for six months as a full-time pupil, but missed a lot of lessons as she was working on her album, Promised Land. When she thought she would proceed with her studies, Covid-19 emerged. “I paid for my own fees. But I was not earning anymore due to the pandemic and had to drop out again. “I was very sad about it. I was supposed to finish my matric,” she said. But the star from Delft, Cape Town said she won’t give up. She said the disruptions did not only cost her time, but also cost her money. “It is important for me to have my matric because I want to study entertainment law. I had high hopes to finish my matric this year and the private college is extremely expensive. School fees were close to R100 000.” She said she loves music, but she will do everything to write and pass her matric.
