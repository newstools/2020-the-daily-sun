TEBOGO Motlanthe will wait until next month to find out whether or not he has the SA Football Association (Safa) CEO position on a permanent basis. Motlanthe, who has been acting in the position, is understood to be a shoo-in for the plum job, having done a commendable job so far. But he is not alone in the running, the selection panel has narrowed the list of candidates to three. The other two candidates are Happy Ntshingila and Lydia Monyepao. “The NEC confirmed, after a series of interviews, three candidates – Advocate Tebogo Motlanthe, Happy Ntshingila and Lydia Monyepao – on the final list for the CEO’s position. “Safa is hoping to finalise the appointment of the CEO by mid-January and taking into consideration the Covid-19 regulations, this might stretch to the end of January,” said the football association. Monyepao holds a B Com (Wits), a B Com Honours in Accounting (UKZN) and a Masters in Sport Management (Loughborough, UK), earned during her playing career. Monyepao is passionate about the mentorship of young women in football and enhancing the leadership of women in sport. She attended the Fifa Women in Football Leadership Programme held in Zurich in November last year, as recommended by Safa. Safa has also announced the renovations and enhancement of Fun Valley, having been completed and that they are now in a position to officially launch the National Technical Centre for the national teams. “The centre has already proved its value with Banyana Banyana, Under-17 and other national teams camping there in preparation for various tournaments,” Safa’s statement read. “March will also see the Elective Congress in Morocco where our candidate, Dr Patrice Motsepe, will contest the position of the Caf Presidency and vice-presidency of Fifa. This remains a focus in the campaign led by our candidate.”
