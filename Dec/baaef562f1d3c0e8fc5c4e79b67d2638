Rapper AKA has explained to fans why the long-awaited boxing match between himself and his arch nemesis Cassper Nyovest is taking long to materialise. The star said while he was training in preparation for the boxing match, Cassper was “busy eating amagwinya”. He explained on his Twitter account that the delay was caused by negotiations, among other things. “Boxing negotiations take time. When I was training this past year, he was busy eating amagwinya. Now we must scramble and jump into line. Doesn’t work like that. The fight will happen next year. That’s all there is to say about that. Happy holidays,” tweeted AKA. He also said neither of them have signed the contract and he had to look for someone to invest R2 million. “Here’s where we are, the contract hasn’t been signed by either of us. Why? Because I had to find someone to invest R2 million because they wanted to pay me R500k. Now that I have my money, we should be concluding soon,” he told his fans, whom he refers to as the Megacy. On the other hand, Cassper hasn’t said anything about the boxing match.
