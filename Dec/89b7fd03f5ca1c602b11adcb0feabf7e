THIS time last year, Glenrose Xaba was out in the streets, on top of her game and confident. This time around, she’s confined to the four walls, like many South Africans under the Covid-19 lockdown. But she’ll be part of the annual Mandela Remembrance Run and Walk, an event with a difference, mainly due to the Covid-19 regulations. Along with elite and social runners, she will take part in the event honouring late elder statesman virtually Saturday and Sunday. “I want to do it for Madiba. I can’t wait to run and will use this as part of my preparation for the Olympic Games,” said Xaba, who will compete in the 42,2km marathon at the Tokyo Olympics next year. “The year 2020 didn’t quite go as planned because of the coronavirus. It’s been the same for athletes all over the world and for sport in general. “But I’ve been keeping fit and am looking forward to next year.” She usually trains at the University of Pretoria and will do her race at the Union Buildings. The elite road runner is unfazed by strange times for road races and is looking forward to the half-marathon (21,1km). The Mandela race will also take place in other parts of the world, with the organisers receiving entries from the UK, Canada, Nigeria and the US. Runners will receive unique virtual medals and certificates to confirm their participation. And this means participants, who entered the races (10km and 21,1km) and walk (5km) online, will run the stipulated distances wherever they are, email evidence of their participation and finish times to the organisers, and get the medal by mail. Wheelchair tennis star Kgothatso Montjane said she will be take part in the 5km fun walk. “I wish I could walk with you, but this year it’s a virtual event. Let’s make Madiba proud by celebrating his life,” said Montjane.
