ZODWA Wabantu is looking forward to opening her new salon. She said she wants to make people look beautiful and more comfortable with themselves! Zodwa told Daily Sun the Zodwa Wabantu Salon will be opened in Mbombela, Mpumalanga next year, depending on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcements regarding the second wave of Covid-19 and the curfew. “I want to start a beautiful and posh salon. The salon will be suitable for both men and women,” she said. “My aim is to make an income while I help people look their very best.” She said her products, such as her petroleum jelly and lipstick, will fit nicely into the salon. The famous celebrity and dancer, whose real name is Zodwa Libram, said she chose Mbombela over Joburg because Joburg has many salons compared to Mbombela. “It’s a city that is still growing and it has many business opportunities. I’m excited about my new venture. Making women look beautiful makes me happy,” she said. She said on Christmas Day, she performed at Sernie in Mbombela. The entertainer described this year as a year of challenges because of Covid-19. She encouraged people to keep fighting for their dreams and never let anything discourage them. Zodwa said she couldn’t wait for her reality show Zodwa Wabantu: Uncensored season 3, to hit the screens. It airs on Moja Love, DStv channel 157. She said the show will be out in the new year.
