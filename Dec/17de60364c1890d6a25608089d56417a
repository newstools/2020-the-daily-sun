Actor Khojane “Nolo” Morai, along with his manager Given Mashego, have started a radio tour campaign. Through their NGO The Safe House, they conduct interviews and reach out to aspiring actors and filmmakers. The actor on SABC2’s Lithapo telenovela shares his acting background and how one should carry oneself on set and as a public figure. He’s doing this as part of giving back to the community and to equip future actors. He told SunBuzz they started their campaign in August. “During the interviews I speak with followers who want to follow in my footsteps,” Nolo said. “I advise them on how to become professional actors and give them tips.

That’s why I plan to give back.” Given said they’ve had interviews on TUT FM, Thabantsho Community Radio Station, Mabopane FM, SK FM, Turf FM, Tshepo FM, Heita FM and Lesedi FM. They plan to visit more radio stations. They’re also doing mentorship for free at schools and on social media. “We’ve managed to get amazing support from many radio stations,” said Given. “We’ve also visited some schools in Mthatha and the feedback was great. “We’re planning to visit more schools across the country once we get sponsors because we’re doing this from our own pockets.”
