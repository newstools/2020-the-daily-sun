THEY say the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach, and the way to a woman’s heart is through affection. This simply indicates the delicacy of the heart. The organ needs to be treated and made to feel special through diet, exercise and yes, lots of sex. Just when we thought that only our happiness and sexual appetite benefits from great sex, the heart has also put its hand up as a beneficiary of lots of sex. Studies suggest that men who have sex at least twice a week and women who report having satisfying sex lives are less likely to have a heart attack. Sex is a form of exercise and helps strengthen your heart, lower your blood pressure, reduce stress and improve sleep. According to Dr Michael Joseph Blaha, intimacy in a relationship can increase bonding. Strong social connections, said Blaha, can lower feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety, which have been linked to higher heart disease risk. Now who said matters of the heart can’t be stimulating and daring?
