MOGAKANEGI Lebepe’s life has been turned upside down by what appears to be a pimple that won’t stop growing. The 43-year-old from Sebayeng Village in Ga-Dikgale, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said when the pimple first appeared on her shoulder in 2009, she thought it would soon go away. When it continued growing, she started looking for help and in 2011, she ended up in hospital. Doctors told her she had cancer, but she didn’t believe them. “They removed it but a few weeks later, it grew again on my leg,” she said. It was removed again but it re-appeared on the top of her left eye. She went back to hospital in 2017 and they cut it off and did a skin graft. But it soon came back in the same spot. This led Mogakanegi to believe she had been bewitched. “The pimple is slowing me down as it drains my energy every day,” she said. Mogakanegi said she had gone as far away as Durban in KZN and Zimbabwe to look for help, but with no luck. “I’ve seen different pastors, prophets and izangoma across Mzansi and spent more than R30 000, but no one was able to help. My husband also left because of this situation,” she said. Mogakanegi said she believed something was moving inside her and sucking her blood. “I sometimes faint and when I get to hospital, I’m told I need blood. I’ve lost hope and am only trying to hang on for my three kids.” Optometrist Dr Eddie Machuba recommended that Mogakanegi see an ophthalmologist and dermatologist. “I believe her skin has a serious allergic condition,” he said.
