GAUTENG lightweight champion Khaya “The Destroyer” Busakwe says he is ready to challenge for the South African title held by Tshifhiwa “Atomic Spider” Munyai. The up-and-coming fighter from Jabavu in Soweto has successfully defended his provincial crown twice. His promoter Joyce Kungwane believes her charge is ready to step to the next level of his boxing career. “We are planning to challenge for the SA title as we feel he is ready now. It is one of our objectives to make Khaya a national champion and push him beyond that. Soweto has produced formidable champion such as Dingaan Thobela, Lehlohonolo Ledwaba and Takalani Ndlovu to mention a few, so we want to continue with that legacy,” said Kungwane. According to Kungwane, Busakwe’s trainer Norman Hlabane has been doing a great job fine tuning his ring craft for the mammoth task ahead. Meanwhile, veteran trainer Hlabane said although Busakwe is still in a learning curve, if the opportunity presents itself they will take it. Hlabane also honed the skills of the Mzansi’s boxing greats Ledwaba and Thobela. “We have time to work on Khaya. It is our aim to give every youngster a chance to reach for stardom and we have to have faith and belief in their abilities. “If you get a chance in this business, grab it with both hands. Preparing for Munyai we have to be ready for 12 full rounds because he is one of the very good fighters we have,” said Hlabane. The lanky Busakwe has an impressive record of seven victories and a single defeat. He suffered his loss at the hands of an equally talented South African based Malawian fighter, Dennis Mwale.
