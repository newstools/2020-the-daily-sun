STUDENTS at the University of Mpumalanga’s Mbombela and Siyabuswa campuses started a protest on Tuesday, 1 December. They blocked entrances with burning tyres and stones. They said the varsity and the Department of Higher Education extended the academic year but failed to provide accommodation allowances.  Some have already been removed from residences due to non-payment. Others were allegedly shot at by police. SRC president Carol Magagula said: “As we speak, more than 80 students have been evicted.” Magagula said varsity management told them the exam timetable won’t change. “We can’t allow students who have nowhere to sleep to be expected to write exams the next morning.”  Mbongiseni Ntimba (23), who stays off campus, told Daily Sun since the academic year was extended there was no allowance for accommodation, and that led to evictions. “We’ve resorted to sleeping in any office we can find on campus,” he said. Dean of students, Paul Maminza, said varsity management met the SRC on Monday, 30 November. He said students who stay on campus won’t have to pay extra for accommodation. “We’ve received communication from Nsfas that the living expenses allowance will continue to be paid for students for the extended period.” Exams have been suspended and the protest is continuing.  Mpumalanga police confirmed that five students were arrested and charged with public violence and malicious damage to property. They’re expected to appear in the Siyabuswa Magistrates Court soon.
