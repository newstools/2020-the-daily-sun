THE decision to have matrics rewrite two exams is reasonable. This was what Advocate Chris Erasmus, representing the Department of Basic Education, argued in the North Gauteng High Court yesterday. Erasmus was responding to an urgent application to set aside Minister Angie Motshekga’s decision to have matrics rewrite maths paper two and physical science paper two after the question papers were leaked last month. Erasmus asked the court to dismiss the four applications brought forward by AfriForum, Sadtu and other education organisations. He said if there was no rewrite, the academic year would be lost. Erasmus said 195 pupils from all over the country were in the WhatsApp group where the maths paper was leaked. “Only 71 pupils have been contacted. “Many of their cellphones don’t comply with the Rica Act, so we can’t get hold of them,” said Erasmus. Advocate Wisani Sibuyi, representing Sadtu, said the leaks in 2016 were on a larger scale, but there was no rewrite. He said the Council of Education Ministers’ first decision was not to have a rewrite. Advocate Dennis Fine, representing accreditation body Umalusi, said the question papers had gone viral.  He said Umalusi would rather act sooner than later to protect the validity of the exams. “It would be unfair to announce to pupils in February that their certificates could not be approved,” he said. Advocate Quintus Pelser, representing AfriForum, said Umalusi should have taken its time making the decision. He claimed the decision to rewrite was forced on the body by the minister. He said the department had options other than following the leak trail. “They could have audited the distribution chain or appointed a private investigation company to follow the trail of the leak,” he said. “If the irregularity was not caused by hundreds of thousands of people, the examination answer script must be marked and results released.” Judge Norman Davis said he would hand down judgment today.
