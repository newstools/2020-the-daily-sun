Performance artist Albert “Ibokwe” Khoza is glad to be returning to theatre. He’ll host a two-night performance of TheRed Femicycle at the Soweto Theatre in Soweto on Tuesday and Wednesday (1 and 2 December). Ibokwe said he took a break from theatre because it didn’t align with his line of work. “Theatre is a space that declined and rejected my work for years. “After studying I performed abroad. Local theatres didn’t accept my work. There’s too much politics. “I decided to stop performing and moved to galleries and warehouses. I could manipulate those spaces and be free.” ALSO READ: ZODWA: ANGITHWELE MINA T he Red Femicycle addresses femicide and kickstarts the Soweto Theatre’s 16 Days of Activism theme. “I created The Red Femicycle two to three years ago,” he said. “For me, it was a comment on what’s happening in the country and world. “The show is a narrative that aims to raise awareness on the daily bloodshed against women and children.” Ibokwe thanked the Soweto Theatre for giving him this opportunity. “I didn’t know the show would be shown again. It was shown at the theatre almost a month ago. “I didn’t expect it to run again, especially because of my previous experiences with theatre. “But I’m happy I get to perform in my country and my home, Soweto. It’s a beautiful thing.
