ADVOCATE Sampson Tshikovhele has walked a long road. The 51-year-old from Lufule 2, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, urged people to learn from his example and stay dedicated to their dreams. He started work as a language teacher at Ratshikhwekhwete Secondary School in Vuwani in 1993 after completing a degree at the University of Venda. “I was a teacher for almost 22 years, but entering the law profession was my dream. During my time, parents wanted their children to become teachers,” he said. “I decided to register for an LLB part-time with the University of Venda and completed it in 2013. “This gave me the courage to decide I’d become an advocate one day.” Sampson went on an exchange programme in England in the same year he completed his law degree. This was because of a partnership between the University of Warwick and the University of Venda. In 2015, he quit his job as a teacher to start his articles as a candidate attorney at Mvundlela and Associates Attorneys in Thohoyandu. “I also registered for the Polokwane bar for pupilage programme and was admitted as an advocate in 2017,” he said.
