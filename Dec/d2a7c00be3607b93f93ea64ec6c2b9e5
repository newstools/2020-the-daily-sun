THE Human Rights Commission conducted an inspection of a wastewater treatment plant in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. Manager Buang Jones wanted to assess progress made by the City of Tshwane in providing safe drinking water. This comes after the commission received a complaint in March 2018 from a resident about water quality in the area. The resident had apparently told the commission the water had a strange colour and bad smell, and that it had been muddied by water treatment plant pollution. The commission conducted an inspection in July 2019 at the Rooiwal Wastewater Treatment Works to find out how true the claims was. The long-standing water crisis in Hammanskraal has caused violent protests by locals calling on government to intervene. Jones told the People’s Paper: the visit forms part of the commission’s week-long cross-border road shows which seek to improve the visibility and accessibility of the commission and to strengthen public participation in human rights issues.  “We were there to ascertain whether water supplied to communities met drinking water quality standards.” It was compare with progress made by the City of Tshwane in implementing remedial action plans at Rooiwal and Temba Water Treatment Plant. The commissioner said he’d ensure residents’ rights to have clean drinking water were realised.
