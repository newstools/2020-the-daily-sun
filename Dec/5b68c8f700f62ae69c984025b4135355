SHE had a vision that something bad was going to happen. But she ignored the fiery vision, hoping it was not for her. Little did she know that her ancestors were warning her. Now sangoma Elizabeth Sithole is without a home and her indumba also burnt to ashes. Her six-roomed shack and indumba burnt down last Friday. The deaf mum of three children, who trained as a sangoma in 2007, also lost her earpieces, identity documents, amadlozi outfits, traditional medicine and R3 800 in cash. The 55-year-old from Phomolong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane told Daily Sun she had a vision that a fire will burn everything. She said a candle started the fire as there was no one in the other room. “We are lucky to be alive, although we lost everything. I also lost my earpieces and it will be hard to do consultations as I won’t be able to hear my clients properly,” she said. But she said this was not vutha, but a message from the ancestors for her not to relax. Sangoma Elizabeth said she didn’t have money to replace what she lost. “I don’t know where to start because everything is gone. I appeal for help with a shack, clothes, food and earpieces. Everything is gone,” she said. Her sister Anna (51) said her medication also perished in the fire. “This is a dark cloud for the family as we lost our home and belongings just a week before Christmas,” she said. Sangoma Aleck Mashigo (58) said losing belongings and a home to fire was a bad thing. “Elizabeth should consult a powerful sangoma to perform some rituals as the ancestors might be angry,” he said. City of Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman deputy chief Charles Mabaso said they were not aware of the fire.
