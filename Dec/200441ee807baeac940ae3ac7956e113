ALMOST 100 members of the Mhala Community Policing Forum have raised serious challenges that affect their work. Forum leader Alberto Mandlati said recently: “We need equipment such as reflector jackets, torches and boots.”. Mandlati complained about a spike in business burglaries and non-compliance by liquor licence holders. He said CPF members were demotivated because they didn’t get support. Mhala acting police station commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Brian Mnisi, told the People’s Paper: “Statistics show that crime such as hijacking, robberies and rape has declined. “You’re doing all this work voluntarily and risking your lives during this year of Covid-19. “May God protect your families so that you can continue helping us with information and beat GBV and rape, as well as the drug problem that’s mushrooming and ruining the youth of Thulamahashe.” Meanwhile, Benjamin Mthembu of the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety and Security told Daily Sun: “I promise to investigate the challenges presented by the CPF. “Covid-19 has disadvantaged every department, so whatever we intended for the CPF didn’t go according to plan. “We’ll make sure that, bit by bit, we get there.”
