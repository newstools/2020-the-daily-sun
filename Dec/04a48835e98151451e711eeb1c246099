AN unknown mum has been slammed on social media after a photo of her small baby’s “manicure” surfaced on the internet. In the photo, the mum is showing off the baby’s almond- shaped long nails that have just been filed. The photo also made rounds on Reddit, where it provoked major outraged from parents who expressed their concern for the baby’s safety. “Would this count as child abuse or endangerment if the child hurt itself with these nails?” one of the users commented. Another user agreed that this was exactly like giving a child sharp objects. “That baby could poke its eyes out, terrible parent,” said the user. The baby’s manicure depicts a current beauty trend and some of the parents categorised it as trashy.
