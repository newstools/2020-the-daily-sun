A GOOD Samaritan donated a tombstone valued at R20 000 to the late taxi driver Jabu Baloyi’s family. Jabu’s family unveiled the tombstone in Soshanguve, Tshwane on Saturday. Jabu was killed on 27 August last year by drug peddlers for preventing the sale of drugs to pupils next to the Dr Savage Taxi Rank in Pretoria. He and other taxi operators had taken a stand against the scourge of drugs. He was shot during a confrontation with a suspected drug dealer. Businessman Tsogo Poo said after reading Jabu’s story, he thought he should do something for the slain hero. “His story hit home. I have a family member who was affected by nyaope,” he told the People’s Paper. “When I read the story about Jabu dying while trying to fight the selling of drugs, I decided to do something to honour him,” said Tsogo. He said he wanted to show the family that they were not alone. “We are also fighting against drugs and this is to honour the man,” he said. The family said they were happy with the donation and some family members were at the graveyard to see it. The family said they still wanted justice for Jabu’s death. One of the family members, Mishack Nthane (38), said something could have been done about the murder of their brother. “What we want and what would bring satisfaction to the family is that those who were responsible for this crime be arrested and justice be served,” he said.
