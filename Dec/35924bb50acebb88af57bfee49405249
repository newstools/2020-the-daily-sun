 WESTERN Cape Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela on Sunday, visited Joe Gqabi, the busiest long-distance transport interchange in the province. He’s already gearing up for an influx of holidaymakers. “We know that many people travel from here to various destinations, particularly in the Eastern Cape,” he said, They were concerned about Covid-19 infections. “I’m here to make sure people comply and remind them about the dangers of not following rules. We don’t want to take drastic measures. That’s why we’re urging them to follow the rules,” said Madikizela. He’s been fighting a suggestion to close the borders between the Eastern and Western Cape. “I’m opposed to that, but I want people to take personal responsibility. They must help me for that not to happen.” According to him, traffic cops will be very strict, and anyone who’s found not following the rules will be turned back to where they came from. He spoke to taximen and passengers about the importance of following the rules. Mandisi Mntuyedwa, a 45-year-old taxi driver, said they’ll follow all the rules because they don’t want ]borders to be closed. “We can’t afford to have borders closed because the money we’re making here feeds our families, and we’re paying instalments,” said Mandisi. Some taximen and passengers only wore masks when they saw the MEC. “Our people need to take this seriously. If they only wear them when they see government officials, it’s going to be a huge problem. We’re going to die.” Another taximan said: “I’m happy the minister came here because our passengers sometimes are stubborn.”
