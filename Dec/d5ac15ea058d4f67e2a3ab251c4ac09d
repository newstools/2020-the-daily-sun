EIGHT soccer teams will battle it out this weekend in a bid to win a cow. The Baloyi Cow Tournament was started by community builder July Baloyi. The tournament – taking place at the defence force sports ground in Wallmansthal, Tshwane – will see teams from Hammanskraal, Soshanguve, Ga-Rankuwa, Hercules, East Lynne and Wallmansthal taking part. All eight teams will play on Saturday, 5 November and on Sunday, 6 November in the morning. And four teams will battle it out for the final spot and championship. The final will be at 3pm and the winning team will walk away with a cow worth R10 000. “It’s up to them what they’ll do with it. They can either slaughter it, braai it or give the meat to team members to take home,” said July. “We normally host the tournament in May and November, but we decided to move it because of lockdown. “The purpose of the tournament is to keep the youth away from drugs and crime.” Because of Covid-19 regulations, July had to scrap his plan to bring talent scouts to the tournament this year. He said he’d only invite them next year. “I want to leave a legacy when I’m gone,” he said. “I love football and I’ve played in goat tournaments while growing up.” Residents said they loved the tournament because it gave their kids a platform to play soccer. July said pap, meat and soft drinks will be sold and entry is free. Regulations will be followed.
