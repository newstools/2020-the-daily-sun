ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has played down winning the MTN8 trophy which fans hope is the first of many trophies for the club this season. The German-born coach, who was appointed by Pirates last December, said there’s a long way to go if they hope to emulate the class of 2010 and 2012 the teams that won the double treble including two MTN8 trophies. Pirates finally ended their six-year trophy drought after beating Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 in the Wafa Wafa Cup final at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. “I know supporters expect us to fight for the next trophy and we can do it,” said Zinnbauer. “We have opportunities, but it is long, long way and long fight. Yes, we have made the first step to win this title and then we’ll see what happens in the next days, in the next weeks, in the next months. We are not in the right position at the moment to fight for the league title.” The last time Bucs won the major trophy was the Nedbank Cup in 2014 at the same Durban venue. This victory also sees Pirates put their miserable losing streak to an end after losing the last five cup finals. While this was Pirates' fifth final in this competition (more than any other team), they become the second side to enter double digits to have won this cup (10). Kaizer Chiefs are record winners of this cup (15). However, Zinnbauer, based on how they have started this season and unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions, said chances are there for them to win other trophies. “But if we play very well and others struggle, then we have a chance,” said the Zinnbauer. “But we don’t speak about the titles now.”
