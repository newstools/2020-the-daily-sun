AL AHLY have launched a fresh bid to prise away Gaston Sirino from Mamelodi Sundowns! The Egyptian giants have sent a $2.5million (About R40m) offer to the PSL giants for the Uruguayan winger, almost doubling their initial offer. And this time a move to the Red Castleseems closer than ever for the want-away midfielder. According to reports in Cairo, Al Ahly are waiting for Sundowns to respond to their offer, as they are very keen to sign Sirino ahead of the Fifa Club World Cup in February. The Red Devils will be Caf’s representative in the Club World Cup kicking off on 1 February in Qatar. This is not the first offer Caf’s “Club of the Century” have made for the twinkled-toed midfielder, who has made it clear he wants to reunite with his former chief coach Pitso Mosimane in Cairo. The initial attempt to lure Sirino hit a snag as Sundowns held out for a bigger offer. But the latest offer is understood to be part of the bilateral cooperation between Al Ahly and Sundowns, besides the strong ties between the two clubs’ presidents. Sirino has been sidelined by injury at Sundowns, yet to play a game since he last featured against Bloemfontein Celtic in the MTN8 fixture in October. The club have kept mum on Sirino, who signed a long-term contract in June. But relations between the two parties are understood to be at a low point. “Sirino has always been a transfer target for Al Ahly. There has been contacting before, and if anything happens, the club will officially announce it,” said Ahly’s head of transfers Amir Tawfik. “We are talking to the Sundowns officials, and if any serious development occurs, we will begin negotiations with the player then.” Sirino has been at Sundowns since January 2018, where he made over 100 appearances, scoring 24 goals and providing 29 assists. However, he has increasingly become a peripheral figure this season.
