DJ Maphorisa is mourning the death of his father, who is understood to have passed away on Sunday. The popular amapiano musician, whose real name is Themba Sekowe, is from Soshanguve in the north of Tshwane. Evidently, this will be a sad festive for the talented DJ, who’s taken Mzansi music by storm and put the amapiano genre on another level. The SunTeam visited the DJ’s home this morning, but the family were not ready to talk about their loss. Maphorisa has worked with some of the most sought-after DJs and artists such as locals Black Coffee and Kabza De Small, as well as Nigerian Wizkid and American Drake, among others. He’s known for having great music talent, and he and record producer Kabza De Small make a formidable team. Maphorisa, who’s known for his songs Emcimbini, Phoyisa and Nana Thula, has inspired many artists who want to use music as a lanchpad. Funeral details have not yet been made public.
