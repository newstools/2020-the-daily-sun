 A feeling of uncertainty is brewing amongst people in Mzansi in anticipation of yet another announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa tomorrow night. The President is expected to brief the nation on South Africa’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Mzansi has seen a resurgence in cases as the anticipated second wave of the Pandemic kicks in, which is now seeing cases of Covid 19 infections being reported increasing and the number of death escalating. Consumers have come out with a plea to the President not to touch alcohol during the upcoming festive.  While those working in places where alcohol is sold have pleaded for the same due to fear of job losses. Smokers and boozers told Daily Sun that the festive will never be the same without alcohol and smoke. Daily Sun went to taverns to hear what patrons had to say and what would the President is likely to announce. However, some said they will rejoice if there will be a ban on booze. "People are behaving badly, they crowd taverns and shebeens, come the morning we meet them in the malls and shops. Imagine if they got covid-19 from an overcrowded place and infect those of us who don’t even go out boozing," said a concerned resident. A 40-year-old woman said she will be happy if booze is taken away. "My husband is a drunkard; he was fine with the booze ban levels but now since its back, he sits at the tavern the whole day. I wish Cyril takes booze away," said a woman from block GG in Soshanguve, Tshwane. But other people said should the sale of booze be closed, they will spend extra money on it and that they don’t like home-brewed beers like pineapple and other ones because it puts their lives at risk.
