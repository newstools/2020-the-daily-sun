A man has been found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for brutally stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death after she dumped him. Titus Thabo (28) from Vaalbank near KwaMhlanga appeared before Judge Thando Mankge when he was handed down a life sentence in the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court, sitting in Middelburg on Thursday 3 December. The court heard that the accused brutally stabbed his ex-girlfriend Phindile Mahlangu (27) inside a moving bus while travelling from Pretoria to KwaMhlanga in January. The stabbing happened after an argument about Mahlanguâ€™s decision to end their relationship. After most commuters got off the bus, the couple remained with a few commuters as well as the bus driver. Thabo moved to the seat where Mahlangu was seated and stabbed her with a knife several times in full view of terrified commuters who were screaming in fear. Thabo instructed the driver to keep driving while he continued to stab Mahlangu. Once he was done, he told the driver to stop the bus and he got off and went home. The wounded Mahlangu was taken to the nearest clinic, where she died. After hearing that he was wanted by police concerning the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Thabo asked his brother to accompany him to hand himself over to the police in Vaalbank and he was arrested. Thabo was sentenced into direct life imprisonment and was further declared unfit to possess a firearm by Mankge. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said the sentence would bring hope to victims of gender-based violence and send a strong message to perpetrators of all forms of crime, especially when such crime is directed towards women and children, that severe punishment exists for such offenders.
