I draw my strength from him. I’m able to do everything because of him,” she said. Gugu told SunBuzz her single is doing well on social media. She’s busy in studio working on a 10-track album, which she hopes to release before Easter next year. “I do feel that the time for me has come and being a backing singer has nurtured my singing talent,” she said. “It also offered me a lot of experience and to know what to expect ahead. I already have one leg in the industry. “I’m ready to jump every hurdle I may come across along the way. I know problems will form part of the journey but with the Almighty next to me I fear nothing.s”
