It's always about taking risks, whether or not they will
score is not a given. Criminals were at it again this afternoon after attempting a
cash-in-transit robbery on the N12/M1 near Southgate Mall earlier this afternoon. According to SAPS spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo, a
multidisciplinary team is currently working on the scene of the crime trying to
establish whether money was taken from the robbery or not. "What’s concerning is that we are noticing similar
tactics which were used in Tuesday's CIT in Pretoria, where a Mercedes Benz SUV
rammed into the cash van forcing it to come to a stop. Today’s incident the
same thing transpired where a Mercedes Benz rammed into the cash van,"
said Masondo. He further explained that the cash van guards were ordered
out of the vehicle and were disarmed. The cash van and SUV were also bombed. "We are on a manhunt for a group of suspects who fled
the scene in a black Range Rover and white Nissan X-Trail. We are appealing to
members of the public that may have information to come forward and assist the
work of our members," he said.
