Kaya FM’s managing director Greg Maloka has resigned with immediate effect. This comes after the station launched investigations into various allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against him. A few months ago it was reported that four employees at the station laid complaints of sexual misconduct against Greg through an anonymous letter. The station revealed in a statement that it has welcomed the resignation. “You will all agree that this matter remains one of the most sensitive and testing issues the board has ever dealt with, and as such the board is quite acutely aware of the impact this matter has had on our own employees and other affected individuals alike,” the statement reads in part.
