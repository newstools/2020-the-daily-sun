FOR two years, Samuel Mdau (65) and his girlfriend lived happily together. But then, his girlfriend, Disebo Makintlane (43), cheated on him at a local tavern and the new boyfriend didn’t want to let go of her. The tavern lover, Sechaba Mokoena, even forced his way into Samuel’s house in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni and took Disebo away by force. A few days ago, he came and the two men almost came to blows, but Samuel decided not to fight. Sechaba took Disebo to his place. When she came back the next day, an angry Samuel told her to go back to Sechaba, but she begged him to stay. Disebo said she didn’t like the man. The couple kissed and made up. But Sechaba won’t leave them alone. Disebo claimed the boyfriend took her by force from the tavern. “I told him I don’t want him anymore but he won’t listen,” said Disebo. She sought a protection order against Sechaba. Samuel and his woman are trying to mend their relationship and are appealing to Sechaba to back off. Disebo said when she met Sechaba at the tavern he declared his love for her and took her to his place. “I told him I have a man but that didn’t stop him. I thought it was only a one-night stand but he came to the house,” she said. “He found me cooking and forced me to leave the pots on the stove and go with him while ntate Mdau just stood there. I was angry and felt he was disrespecting my man.” Daily Sun spoke to Sechaba, who confirmed to have received the protection order. “I won’t bother them because Disebo has shown me her true feelings. I won’t harm them because I don’t want to get into trouble,” said Sechaba. He admitted that he went to Samuel’s house but claimed Disebo was aware he was coming.
