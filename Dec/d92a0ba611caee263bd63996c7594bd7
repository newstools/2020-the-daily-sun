Forum 4 Service Delivery in the North West is ready for the 2021 national elections. It held its provincial Imbizo at Manzini Game Farm outside Potchefstroom yesterday, 18 December. The gathering focused on the election of new provincial and regional leaders. Abiding by the Covid-19 regulations, only 131 delegates were allowed to be part of the gathering. Party leader Mbahare Kekana said it was important for the imbizo to take place so as to set a path for the elections next year.  “We are here as the Forum 4 Service Delivery. We are in the mood of electing leadership,” he said. He said they had already elected leaders in provinces, including Western Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng. “So we are here to elect the leadership of the North West at the regional level and provincial level. Come next year 2021, we are well organised. We are ready to move the organisation forward,” he said. During this time of the year, the party was expected to hold its national conference. But Mbahare said due to tight Covid-19 regulations, the gathering has been postponed. “In terms of regulations, we were clear that people of more than 250 must not converge in one place. So we are expecting roughly 400 delegates for our national conference. That’s why we have to wait for those lockdown regulations to be taken down before we proceed. “Hence we ensured that our national imbizo is postponed until March 2021,” Kekana said. The party is represented in most North West municipalities. One of its strong hold areas was Mamusa in Schweizer-Reneke. The party had three seats in the Mamusa Municipality. Due to malfunctioning and lack of basic service delivery, the municipality was put under administration. Consequently, the party lost its three seats when re-election took place.
