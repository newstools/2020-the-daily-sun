A COP has been arrested for selling alcohol using a state car. According to reports, law enforcement officers were informed by a member of the public that a person was selling liquor out of the boot of a white VW Polo that was parked next to the Durbanville taxi rank. When the three officers arrived at the taxi rank, there was nobody by the vehicle and they patrolled the area. When they returned to where the vehicle was parked, they saw the boot open and about seven people standing by the boot. They then started running where when they saw the officials. Police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili said a 44-year-old warrant officer attached to the protection and security services VIP protection in Cape Town was arrested for selling alcohol. “It’s reported that the law enforcement was patrolling the area and they were told about a person selling alcohol. They went to investigate and they found and arrested the person who was later identified as a warrant officer attached to PSS in Cape Town,” said Muridili. She told Daily Sun that the officers seized alcohol and a vehicle that belongs to the state. “The warrant officer was charged with dealing in liquor without a licence,” she said. According to Murilidi, the cop was released on a warning to appear in court on Monday 21 December. Before the police officer was arrested, he refused to acknowledge that he is the owner or driver of the vehicle. He claimed the actual driver had run away. But they saw he had a car key and when they took him back to the vehicle, they opened the boot using the key. Inside the boot were various 750ml beer bottles, 10 Hansa Pilseners, eight Lion Largers, eight Castle largers, 10 Castle Milk Stouts and also an amount R1127. Zilungile Jizana (45) said cops are the most corrupt individuals. “They find behind their uniform. If they are the ones who break the laws, then how are we suppose to trust them?” said Jizana.
