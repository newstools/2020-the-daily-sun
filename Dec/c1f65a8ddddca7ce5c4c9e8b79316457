FORMER president Jacob Zuma and his wife Sizakele MaKhumalo Zuma have reportedly been admitted at a Richards Bay hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. The details around the story are a bit sketchy but according to the Sunday World, the Zumas have been admitted at Netcare’s The Bay hospital. The report of the Zumas' admission to hospital due to Covid complications comes just under 24 hours after the country moved back to level 3 lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Springboks captain Siya Kolisi’s wife Rachel has also tested positive for Coronavirus. Rachel made it public on her Instagram page, saying that she never had any symptoms. A post shared by Rachel Kolisi (@rachel_kolisi)  “I spent the day in the pool and assumed I had a sinus infection. I realized I couldn’t smell anything so went straight into isolation until I received my positive result. “It’s been so rough and scary at times especially when you have small kids who don’t understand why they can’t touch you. My heart breaks for those in hospital having to fight this alone, not knowing if they’ll see their loved ones again. “Equally my heart breaks for the healthcare workers working tirelessly and understaffed while others are not taking the safety precautions seriously at all.” She added on her post, “COVID is not like flu. It’s so much worse and if my posting can encourage someone to take one extra step of precaution that will be great, also if you know of people not taking Covid seriously please have a conversation with them about it, people are dying.” With the country back at level 3, the President warned that people should wear their masks in public or face arrest. He also emphasised the existence of a new variant of Covid-19 which is said to be more contagious and advanced than the one seen during the first wave.
