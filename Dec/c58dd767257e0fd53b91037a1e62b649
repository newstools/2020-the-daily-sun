MAMELODI Sundowns’ new acquisitions Peter Shalulile and Kermit Erasmus have managed to hit the ground running. But it has not been the same with Grant Margeman, who also joined the star-studded Sundowns during the pre-season. The 22-year-old South Africa international was unfortunate as he got injured just before making his debut and that disturbed his integration. He only managed to make his debut when Sundowns defeated TS Galaxy 2-0 in a DStv Premiership match. “It felt good being on the pitch for the first time for the club,” the former Cape Town Spurs player said. “The coaches have been giving me some positive feedback from the friendlies I’ve played in so far with the team. “I’d say the injury affected me a bit because no player wants to join a new club and gets injured, but at the moment I’m working to get my full fitness and sharpness back.” The player revealed that the coaches require a lot of hard work but that is not an issue as he is one of the most dedicated players. Last season, Margeman was the heartbeat of Spurs, formally known as Ajax Cape Town, when they failed to gain automatic promotion on the last day of the season. He said: “It’s a process. I need to take it one game at a time and have picked up a few things from the coaches. “They want discipline, punctuality, make everyone feel part of the team. They also demand hard work and a lot of focus from all of us. “It’s been amazing since joining the Masandawana family. Most of the guys have helped me settle in nicely. Everyone has the same goal and I’ve been learning a lot from the senior guys in the team,” concluded Margeman. Mothobi Mvala is another player who recently made his debut since joining Sundowns. Mvala started when they drew 1-1 with Golden Arrows in their last league match of the year. He scored on his debut and was on the scoresheet again when they defeated Jwaneng Galaxy 2-0 in a Caf Champions League match. Mvala said: “I feel happy that I played my first game and I scored a goal.
