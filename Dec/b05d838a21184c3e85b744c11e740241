THE four worst provinces for crime are also hot spots for the coronavirus in Mzansi. This was revealed by Police Minister Bheki Cele, who was in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday as part of his nationwide Safer Festive Season Operations inspection tour under the theme #OperationTightGrip. Cele was accompanied by his deputy Cassel Mathale, deputy national commissioner Lieutenant-General Fannie Masemola and the provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga. He said: “It remains concerning that the four provinces that contribute largely to crime are also the same provinces where Covid-19 infections are also highest. These provinces are, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, KZN and Gauteng.  “It pains me to see that people wait for the police to tell them what to do to combat Covid-19. Instead people should be responsible for themselves. Last night 9 441 infections were recorded and we recorded 339 deaths and 107 infections in the Eastern Cape,” said Cele. “Gender-based violence on the other side continues to cause havoc in our communities and sometimes parents encourage their daughters to be abused. “Let’s stop telling our daughters to tolerate abusive husbands and boyfriends. The day he starts putting a finger on your forehead, the next day that will be the barrel of a firearm and he will kill you.” The minister also visited problematic shebeens in KwaZakhele, Zwide and Motherwell. These areas have been identified as hot spots in Nelson Mandela Bay.
