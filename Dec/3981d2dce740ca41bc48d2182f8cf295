LEHLOHONOLO Seema has joined Black Leopards. Seema who was fired by Chippa United last week will be assistant to Dylan Kerr at Leopards alongside Morgan Shivhambu. The trio will be now hoping to change Leopards fortunes as the club has been flirting with relegation for the past two season. Even this year, they seem to be struggling as they finished the year with only five points from eight matches. The club confirmed the new on Twitter in a brief statement which said: "Big boost for ?@lidodaduvha?Â  technical team with the addition of Lehlohonolo Seema." Seema left Bloemfontein Celtic in July to take over the reins at Chippa towards the end of the past 2019-20 season. He helped the Port Elizabeth based outfit finish in position 11 last season. After eight games of the new 2020-21 campaign Seema was shown the exit doot following a string of poor results. Welcome @LehlohonoloSee1 #hashamulilo #lidodaduvha pic.twitter.com/H9izyxxqV8
