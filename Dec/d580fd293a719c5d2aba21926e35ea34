RAPPER Nadia Nakai has had quite a banging year. She was named the most stylish performing artist at the 2020 SA Style Awards recently – and now she has her own show, The Naked Room. According to the award-winning star, the show was inspired by the coronavirus pandemic, which she says made her push herself more. She recently announced the first guest on her show, which airs on Channel O, would be hip hop mega star Khuli Chana.
