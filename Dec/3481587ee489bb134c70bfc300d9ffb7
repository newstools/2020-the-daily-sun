Limpopo police are on the hunt for gunmen who allegedly shot and killed a businessman on Christmas Eve. In a statement on Friday, police said Doctor Matea was gunned down at Ntoane village in Dennilton. "The
 police were alerted about the discovery of the lifeless body of a man 
in this area at about 06:00 and responded swiftly together with the 
medical emergency services. Upon arrival, the deceased was found with 
multiple gunshot wounds," said police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela 
Mojapelo. Mojapelo said preliminary investigations showed that 
Matea and his family were asleep in their home in the early hours of 
Thursday when three unknown men allegedly entered their home. "They
 then demanded cash and in the process ransacked the house and took an 
undisclosed amount of money. The suspects allegedly tied up the 
deceased's wife and three children and forced the deceased to his Toyota
 bakkie and drove away with him," said Mojapelo. The vehicle was found abandoned at Thambo View. News24
