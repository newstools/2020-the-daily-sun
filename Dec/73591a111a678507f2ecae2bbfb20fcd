ONE person has been arrested in connection with a matric exam paper leak. Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said the arrest involving the physics paper was made in Gauteng. “The paper didn’t go far, so we’ve not made the link with the maths and business economics papers,” she said. Motshekga said the fact that they lost three papers showed there was a hole in the system. Department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the Council of Education Ministers held a special meeting on Tuesday, 1 Decdember to receive the preliminary report into the leaked matric exam question papers. He said the council deliberated on the report and noted that the investigation had not yet been completed and that more work still needed to be done. Mhlanga said the report would be processed internally and Motshekga would hold a media briefing later this week to make an announcement.
