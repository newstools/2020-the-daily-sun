A 39-year-old truck driver who lost control of his vehicle
which plunged into several others, was arrested after Gauteng traffic officials
allegedly found that his alcohol level was 12 times over the legal limit. The male driver was arrested yesterday at around 13:00 on
the R21 next to Pomona off-ramp and was immediately tested for alcohol
consumption. He was charged and detained at the Kempton Park police
station and is expected to appear at the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on
Tuesday. "We condemn this kind of irresponsible and reckless
behaviour by road users, especially during the festive season where motorists
are expected to save lives. Law enforcement authorities will not rest until
ruthless and lawless behaviour is eradicated on our roads," Gauteng
traffic police spokesperson Sello Maremane said. "Anyone found driving a vehicle under the influence of
intoxicating liquor will be charged, arrested and convicted [and sentenced to
up to seven years' imprisonment. Drinking and driving is one of the major
contributors of fatal crashes resulting in loss of lives," Maremane added. SOURCE: NEWS24
