Kaizer Chiefs just can’t catch a break. Their woes continued as they suffered yet another defeat this season. They were beaten 2-1 by SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Tuesday. This was Chiefs’ third defeat in the DStv Premiership as they continue to struggle in the early stages of the season. The individual errors continue to be a problem for Gavin Hunt’s men with captain Itumeleng Khune committing yet another. His stray pass was pounced upon by Sipho Mbule who played through the lethal Bradley Grobler and he made no mistake to put SuperSport in the lead. Mbule, turned from creator to scorer in the second half as he ran onto a Grobler cross and blasted past a hapless Khune. Amakhosi did manage to pull a goal back through a Lebogang Manyama penalty but it was too little too late. Their bad day at the office was made even worse by a Philani Zulu red card after he made a reckless tackle on Ghampani Lungu. Chiefs continue to search for form under new coach Hunt who just can’t seem to get going in his new surroundings. He will be hoping for better luck in their final match of the year against Bloemfontein Celtic at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm) SuperSport on the other hand will face Baroka at Peter Mokaba Stadium on the same day (3.30pm). Kaitano Tembo’s charges will be eager to maintain consistency as they look to climb up the table and challenge for the title.
