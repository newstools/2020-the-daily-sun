IT IS not uncommon for girlfriends to get an allowance – but now men are getting one too! Daily Sun spoke to some men, who said they deserve allowances. They said not only are they loving and caring, they’re good at poking, too. Themba Madonsela (35) lost his job two years ago and his girlfriend started giving him a R3 000 monthly allowance. “At first, I was afraid of this. Ladies can become controlling,” said Themba. He said he accepted the allowance and his girlfriend hasn’t changed. “When I get a job, I’ll definitely marry her.” Mmeli Msibi (38) said he’s not ashamed to be receiving a R3 500 allowance from his girlfriend because he gave her money when he was working and used to pay for her nails and hair in addition to giving her a R3 000 allowance. “I honestly feel like my allowance is little,” said Mmeli. Lindokuhle Shongwe said he’d been looking for a job and he was worried she would leave him. “Instead, she started sending me money. I’ve been getting a R2 000 allowance for three years now,” said Lindokuhle. Teddy Mkhwanazi (27) said his girlfriend said he’s the best when it comes to poking and he’ll start getting an allowance. “I thought she was joking, but I’ve been getting a R2 500 allowance for four months now,” he said. Thandeka Masemula (29) said her boyfriend is unemployed and felt it was the right thing to do. “I hope he’s not sending my money to his nyatsis,” she said. Cindi Hlatshwayo (33) said:  her boyfriend used to send her money when he was working and now she feels the need to send him an allowance.“I love spoiling him. I pay the bill when we go out. It’s only fair.” Sex expert, Simon Mhlongo, said it’s not strange for a woman to want to spoil her man. “If you date someone, who gives you an allowance, it’s important to understand that it’s a gift and is not compulsory,”“If a monthly allowance is one of the ways she chooses to show her appreciation, no one should criticise her,” said Simon.
