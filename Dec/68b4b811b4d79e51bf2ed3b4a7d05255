BLACK Leopards have become one of the most predictable teams in the Premier Soccer League in the past few seasons. The Venda-based outfit are on their third season in the top-flight since their return via promotion/relegation play-offs at the end of the 2017-18 season. But in the past two campaigns, they have failed to impress, finding themselves among relegation candidates in both seasons. On their return, they finished in position 13 in the 2018-19 season, just three points away from the drop zone. Last season, it was a similar story as they survived the axe in the play-offs to maintain their top-flight status. In the current season, Leopards find themselves in the same position as they are second from bottom after eight matches. But one of the club’s strikers Ovidy Karuru has come out to say they are tired of fighting relegation and are aiming for a top-eight finish this season. Karuru said they need to manage their games better in order to get results. “If you saw our last three games, we played well but unfortunately lack of concentration or fatigue took its toll (and saw them not getting maximum points). “We would lead at half-time, but teams would come back to equalise,” lamented Karuru. “What we’ve said as a group is that we’re tired of fighting relegation and want to finish in a respectable position, hopefully, the top eight.” Karuru joined Leopards as a free agent after he was released by Stellenbosch FC. He scored a brace on his debut against Kaizer Chiefs early this month. He added: “I’ve managed to fit in well into the team. As you can see, it’s quite a good group. I’ve settled in and am enjoying myself. “But it’s not only about me, it’s about the group. “I just want the team to do well. If I could score more goals, then great. That would help the team achieve its set goals.” Lidoda Duvha will resume their league campaign with an away fixture against Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium next Tuesday.
