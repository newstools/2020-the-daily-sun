Cape Town Spurs were left with broken hearts after they were beaten by Jomo Cosmos at the death. They were leading Jomo Cosmos by a goal to nil until the 80th minute when the game turned on Itâ€™s head. Seun Ledwaba brought Ezenkosi level ten minutes before the end of the game but that was only the beginning of the drama. Cosmos were able to find the winning goal at the death, leaving Spurs with little chance to recover. Spurs had led for the better part of the match through an early Lerato Manzini goal only for them to lose the match at the end. It was reminiscent of how they lost the GladAfrica Championship title to Swallows FC at the end of last season. The Mother City outfit had led the charge for the title for almost the entire season before Swallows swooped in and clinched the title, as well as automatic promotion to the top-flight. This has seen Spurs, formerly Ajax Cape Town, having to endure a third season in the second division But they will hope to make it their last. And the best way for Spurs to return to the land of milk and honey, would be to win the Championship this season. They have given Vladislav Heric the responsibility to get the team back to the top-flight and have given him the necessary resources. Players such as Manzini, Riyaad Norodien, Buyani Sali, Thobani Mncwango and more have been brought in to strengthen the team.
