Covid-19
has brought pain to families around Mzansi and the world at large. For
Thuliswa Maketa (35) from Block 6 in Philippi, the virus took her brother who
loved her like his own child. Thuliswa
who lives with a disability told Daily Sun that her Christmas will never be the
same without Phumlani (42) who died of Covid-19 on 21 November. She said
his brother had a fever and tested positive for Covid-19. He was kept at a
hospital in Mitchel’s Plain for three weeks where he died. “He was
like a father to me, he did everything to make sure that I’m happy. He provided
everything that I needed since I live with a disability. On our previous
Christmas days, he would buy meat for us and we'd braai, he would take care of
everyone including neighbours,” said Thuliswa. Thuliswa
said their father died when he was still young but Phumlani assumed the father
figure role in their family. He was running a spaza shop and had managed to
look after her sister.  Their mother is
alive but stays in the Eastern Cape. “I struggle
to sleep thinking about him and Christmas day has made it even worse because
the thought of having this special day without him is depressing. I’m not
looking forward to Christmas,” she said. Among other things, Thuliswa said his
brother had promised to build a disability-friendly house made of bricks. She
said all the dreams have all gone into flames and she is still trying to come
to terms with that. Resident
Andiswa Nikelo (45) said Phumlani looked not only after his sibling but the
community. “He will be missed, he would braai and give meat to residents who
did not have enough for Christmas, it will be a different day without him.
Residents without fridges would bring their meat to his fridge,” said Nikelo.
