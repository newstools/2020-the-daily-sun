OWEN Ndlovu has come out guns blazing by serving the SABC with a letter of demand. The letter, served on Tuesday, orders Ukhozi FM to withdraw all arrangements of Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyakano later than 27 December. Ndlovu of Michael Owen Productions (MOP) said if the SABC fails to do so he will go to court to bring an urgent application to stop them from continuing to run his concept without rights. Ndlovu, who also stopped Ukhozi FM from announcing the New Year’s Eve song of the year last year, said he didn’t sell his concept of Summer Song to the SABC. Ukhozi FM announced Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka top 10 on Saturday despite Ndlovu’s legal threats and they said they bought the rights. Ndlovu told Daily Sun that everything that is requiring Ukhozi FM listeners to vote for the New Year’s Eve Song of the Year Top Ten is his concept. He said it included adaptations of Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyakainclusive of the SMS to 33665 or using the word Ingoma. BLONDIE MAKHENE: MEN ARE TRASH! Ndlovu said that he withdrew his court matter earlier this year because the SABC asked him to settle out of court. “But the SABC was nowhere to be found and now they are continuing to use my idea to exploit their listeners. The winner of the competition won nothing. When I was part of the competition artists like Mroza Fakude won cars. Ndlovu added that he is fighting for artists who are being used by Ukhozi FM. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said the SABC can confirm that the contract for Summer Song of the Year campaigns the SABC once had with MOP ran its course and was not renewed when it lapsed in 2018. “All the rights and title MOP had in the Summer Song were sold and bought in sale in execution, which left MOP without any rights to sue or to be sued,” she said. “The SABC was instructed by the sheriff of the high court to withhold monies paid over to a known musician that MOP owed.”
