The decision by Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga on 4 December that leaked Maths and Physical Science paper 2 matric exams should be rewritten on 15 December and 17 December was set aside by the North Gauteng High Court yesterday, 11 December. Judge Norman Davis ordered the Department Basic Education and Umalusi to take the neccessary steps to ensure the exam answer scripts of the pupils found to have not been found involved in the irregularities to be marked in accordance with the management plan for the said exam. He lastly ordered  the pair to pay the cost of all four applicants, AfriForum, Sadtu and two other educational organisations. The Department of Basic Education’s spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said they are still studying the judgment and will respond to it after. Meanwhile, pupils on Twitter shared their relief on the judgment. @bolohousemusic tweeted: “#lol I’m so happy I didn’t start studying.” @Sumo73066612 said : “Matriculants might be excited right now  more especially those who cheated the exam but varsity will show where you stand next. Let me tool.” @blaquestoep said :”Angie Motshega and her inept department made villains like SADTU and Afriforum look like heroes.”
