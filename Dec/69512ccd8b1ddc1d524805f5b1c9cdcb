Fact Durban Rocks organiser DJ Tira has welcomed the news that all major events in Durban will not take place due to health concerns. However, the DJ has revealed that the event will continue as planned but without a live audience In a statement, DJ Tira told Daily Sun: “We are working on a virtual concert that will make sure people have something to stay home for this festive. We call on the government to support us as this ban on events will not only affect the livelihoods of artists who are already struggling but small businesses who depend on events.” On the day of the event there’ll be performances by DJ Tira, Sjava, Simmy, Nomcebo Zikode, Blaq Diamond, Shimza and Dlala Thukzin. The popular event will take place on 31 December. ALSO READ | LIGHTS OUT FOR KZN EVENTS A post shared by djtira (@djtira)
