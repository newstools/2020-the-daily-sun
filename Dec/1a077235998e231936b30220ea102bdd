THE SA Football Association (Safa) is expected to appoint a new CEO on Friday. This follows the interviews process which was conducted on Saturday, where five candidates were grilled by an independent panel. The panel has wrapped up its work and handed the report to the football association, who will then name the new chief executive. Among those vying for the position is Advocate Tebogo Motlanthe, the acting CEO, who is believed to be a shoo-in to land the plum job. He has diligently held the fort during the turbulent times and steered the administrative ship in the right direction. But he is facing stiff competition from Happy Ntshingila, a renowned marketing guru and Mxolisi Bam, a Safa NEC, who is also a qualified chartered accountant. 'BISHOP ZONDO RAPED US' Mzwandile Maforvane, the current Safa general manager and a long-serving NEC member, is also a hopeful candidate, while Lydia Monyepao would not only tick the gender equality boxes. The former Banyana Banyana player is the TuksSport deputy director at the University of Pretoria and boasts a wealth of experience in sports administration. She holds a BCom (Wits), a BCom Honours in Accounting (UKZN) and a Masters in Sport Management (Loughborough, UK), earned during her playing career. Monyepao is passionate about the mentorship of young women in football and enhancing the leadership of women in sport. She attended the Fifa Women in Football Leadership Programme held in Zurich in November last year, as recommended by Safa.
