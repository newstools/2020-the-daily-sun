FAMILY and friends of Anele Ngcongca are unhappy the Western Cape government didn’t give him a provincial official funeral. “We’ve been begging the Department of Cultural Affairs and Safa to do something about Anele’s funeral,” said Councillor Sharon Manata of Gugulethu. “We’re talking about a star who represented Bafana Bafana more than 50 times. It feels as if he’s being disrespected, now that he’s dead.” Family member Mcebisi Mgobozi said black players aren’t treated with respect in the Western Cape.  “We saw discrimination against Thami Tsolekile. Now we see it with Anele.” Thobela “King” Bikwani said: “He’s our legend and should be treated as such.” Director in the Western Cape Department of Cultural Affairs and Sports, Thabo Tutu, said: “I’ve had meetings with the family and with the councillor. “The department just signed a submission now and R40 000 will be made available for Anele’s funeral as soon as the paperwork is done.” Safa representative Bayanda Sikiti said they’re in touch with the family.
