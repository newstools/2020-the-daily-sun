THE 2020-21 DStv Diski Challenge season is promising to be one of the best since the introduction of the PSL reserve league six years ago. There have only been three rounds played so far, but there has been plenty of entertainment and an avalanche of goals scored. The dominant team has undoubtedly been Kaizer Chiefs. While their senior side have been struggling in the DStv Premiership, Arthur Zwane’s Young Glamour Boys have had no such troubles. They have made a blistering start to the season, scoring a total of nine goals in three games and are currently sitting pretty at the top of the Diski Challenge table with a perfect record. This has sent a clear statement to the rest of the competition, with Amakhosi eager to clinch their maiden Diski Challenge title. But the likes of SuperSport United, Stellenbosch FC, Orlando Pirates and Maritzburg United have so far shown that they cannot be discounted as they form part of the early title challengers. They have all won twice and drawn once in their three matches, and are level on seven points. Meanwhile, Mamelodi Sundowns, who have previously tasted success in this competition, have had a modest start to the season and currently sit eighth on the log, with four points from three matches. Coach Surprise Moriri will be hoping the Christmas break does his boys the world of good and they return with new vigour. He was happy with his side’s showing last time out as they got their first win of the season against two-time champions Golden Arrows. “I’m happy we managed to take our first three points and overall it was a good game from the boys,” said Moriri. Arrows, on the other hand, are finding it tough to regain the mojo that saw them become the most successful team in the history of the competition as they currently languish in 12th spot. The Diski Challenge will resume again next month with a lot of thrilling action and more goals expected.
