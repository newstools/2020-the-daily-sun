DJ and music producer Mncedisi Mnguni has a new anthem for VW Polo drivers. The talented club DJ, who is popularly known as DJ Big Sky, has released a new song titled Polo featuring Robot Boii and Sbhanga. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “The song is a Polo driver’s anthem. “It’s a celebratory song about buying a new car, a Polo. “As we all know that there is a lot of stigma attached to owning a Polo. The song is here to assure people that there is nothing wrong with owning one and not all Polo drivers are the same as they say, some are genuine and loving.” The Soweto-born star said working on the track was amazing. “Working on the song was fun. I really enjoyed myself. I worked with two amazing artists that made creating a song seem like a walk in the park. “I have put in a lot of thought and effort into the song and I hope it will be well received by the public as I’ve made this tune for them,” he said. The talented producer also shared that he has a new album out. “The album was released on 4 December. It is an amapiano album that is inspired by my everyday experiences, things that I go through and things that people share with me,” he said. “It is a fire album and I have experimented a lot with the sound as when you listen to it you will hear some infusion of soul, jazz and maskandi. “I decided to title it It’s Time because I believe that after almost two decades in the music industry, my time has arrived and I am here to claim the top spot that I have been working very hard for.’ He said he was looking forward to next year. “This year has been a tough one and the music industry took a hard knock, and I can’t wait for it to end. “But it was not all gloom and doom, I must say. I am planning to work even harder than I did this year,” he said. His single and album are available on all digital platforms.
