Chief
Nicholas Tiya (52) from the Joe Gqabi Initiation Forum in Philippi Cape Town
said people proceeding with initiation regardless of the government’s ban must
be arrested. This comes
after initiation schools have mushroomed around Cape Town. This week cops
closed down some illegal initiation schools in Khayelitsha. He said from
parents who allow their kids to join illegal initiation and izingcibi involved
must face the wrath of the law. “That’s the
way to go but cops must bust everyone involved in that process. The law is
clear, the government decided to suspend initiation till further notice and as
amakhosi, we agreed to that. This is because of safety concerns. It is too
dangerous. “The second
wave is dangerous and when the government says the process should be put on
hold people must listen. It is for their benefit, it is not like the government
is closing the initiation schools forever. These are desperate times, we have
to stay safe,” said Tiya. Recently
some residents told SunTeam that they would rather take their kids to the
Eastern Cape than postpone. Somagwaza
Institute chairperson Sikelela Zokufa told the SunTeam that some parents
invited him to an illegal initiation at some farms outside Cape Town. “There
are people who are saying they are going to proceed with the initiation this
coming weekend. They are saying whether the government agrees or not they are
going ahead anyway. I received a call from a person asking me to be with them
to a certain farm where they will do their initiation. These kinds of things
are unsafe because if anything wrong happens to these boys at these farms areas
nobody will know about it,” said Zokufa. Tiya cops
must rain hard on those who are risking the lives of young people.
