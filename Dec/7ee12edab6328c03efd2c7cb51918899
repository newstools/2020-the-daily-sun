THEY were on their way to a Christmas lunch when they got stuck on the highway. Luckily for the couple, a Joburg Metro cop came to their rescue. They want Mzansi to know not all cops are bad and that some are God-sent and love their job. Boitumelo Mathuloe (36) from Joburg told Daily Sun they got stuck on the highway to Soweto. She said a police truck stopped and two officers told them to stand behind the car so that other cars could notice them. “We thought they were inconsiderate because they didn’t even offer any help,” she said. Boitumelo said that three other police cars passed them. “An officer stopped while we waited for our insurance company to send us a tow truck. He asked if we were alright. A JPMD tow truck stopped in front of us, only to find out that officer Manda Tshokororo called it before we even asked for his help,” Boitumelo told the People’s Paper. “We were stunned by this officer. He was so humble and down to earth with a very warm personality.” The couple thanked the officer, but he told them he was just doing his job. Boitumelo said she’s had several bad encounters with cops on a few occasions, but it took only one officer to change that. Her partner Quenton Sibeko (43) said being stuck on the highway could be scary and stressful. “I was worried when I saw a JMPD car park behind me. I expected to be harassed by them as they are known for being that way. But the way the gentleman was so humble and down to earth blew me away,” he said. He described Tshokororo as a true reflection of Batho Pele. Tshokororo was unavailable for comment as he’s on duty, but he said he’ll always go above and beyond to help people. Metro police spokesman Xoli Fihla said JMPD officers always did their best to ensure everyone was safe. “It’s unfortunate that people view the department in a bad light, but our officers are not deterred. They’ll continue to protect residents and visitors of the city,” said Fihla.
