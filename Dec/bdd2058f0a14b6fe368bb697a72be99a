CHELSEA manager Frank Lampard said there is nothing wrong with supporters dreaming – they can win the Premier League title – but stressed his players can’t afford to get complacent. Two thousand fans in Stamford Bridge, the first attendance in nine months due to Covid-19 restrictions, watched Chelsea come from behind to secure a 3-1 victory over Leeds United on Saturday. Chelsea finished the day at the top of the league table for the first time since September 2018. Asked if Chelsea fans were right to consider them title contenders, Lampard told reporters: “There’s certainly nothing wrong with the fans thinking that. “It’s great to have them back, their input was huge, the noise huge. You can see how excited they are at the end that we’re top of the league,” he said. “My job and our job is to know that it’s a long season and the next question is how consistent can we be in this form, how much we can improve, because I believe there’s a lot more we can do and there’ll be a lot of challenges ahead.” Lampard faces a nervous wait to learn the extent of an injury picked up by Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech in the first half. “It’s a hamstring injury, whose severity will be determined in the couple of days,” he said. “Obviously, it’s a disappointment going into this busy period.”
