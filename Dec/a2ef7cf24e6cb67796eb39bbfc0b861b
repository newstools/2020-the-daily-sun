The family of a Mpumalanga woman wants answers after the body of a stillborn baby went missing. Cynthia Sibanyoni (34) was admitted to Witbank General Hospital last week Friday. She gave birth to a stillborn after her baby’s heartbeat stopped. A family member, Matilda Mahlangu (45) told Daily Sun the baby’s body was kept in the hospital for the weekend and on Monday (14 December) when the family went to the hospital to request the body for burial, they weren’t assisted. She said instead of being given the baby they were sent from pillar to post. “We demanded the body but no one was willing to assist us. They kept on taking us from one room to another and we didn’t understand what was going on,” she said Matilda said they realised later that the body was missing as they couldn’t locate it. “They took us to another room which looks like a storeroom. They opened a deep freezer which was not working and took out buckets with decomposing bodies. One body had Cynthia’s tag but it didn’t look like a 35-week-old baby,” she said Mahlangu said Cynthia was looking forward to having the baby. “Cynthia was excited and ready for her baby but what happened is painful. Instead of dealing with the loss of the baby, we are dealing with getting the right body. It hurts as no one wants to give us answers,” she said. Mahlangu said health MEC, Sasekani Manzini visited the family on Wednesday but her visit was not helpful. “We were hoping she would come and give us our baby. All we want is to know how our baby ended up in a non-functional fridge. We want answers and the right body,” she said The department of health has since suspended two nurses. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said they are conducting an internal investigation and the outcomes will help the department decide the next course of action.
