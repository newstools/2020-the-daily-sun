MORE than 20 shacks in Khayelitsha site B’s VE section, Cape Town, were destroyed by a fire on Sunday, 6 December. Community leader Thanduxolo Mfihlo said the fire happened at midnight. “I was fast asleep when I heard people screaming. At first I thought they were being robbed until I heard someone saying there’s a fire,” said Thanduxolo. He said no one knows what started the fire. “Some people are saying it was caused by someone who was cooking and forgot to switch off the stove. We don’t know if it’s true or not.” He said no one ever takes the blame when such incidents happen. “I don’t know if people are afraid of getting moered for causing the fire, which is why you’ll never find anyone admitting the fire started in their shacks.” Khanyisa Seyisi (36) said they didn’t even get a chance to take their belongings out. “We lost everything in that fire, including our kids’ Christmas clothes, and we don’t know how we’re going to get through this,” she said. Her neighbour helped her get out as she’d been fast asleep. “What I heard was that the fire started in one of the shacks when the owner left the stove on, but he’s denying everything. He told us he doesn’t even have a stove,” said Seyisi. She said they needed all the help they could get. “We don’t have food. We need SunReaders to assist us,” said Khanyisa. Another resident was planning to go home since it’s December. “We wanted to go home and enjoy our Christmas that side after having a difficult year, but after this year we won’t be able to go home,” said the resident. When the SunTeam arrived in the area, residents were searching to see if they could use some of the material. “We know the material we’re going to get from the city won’t be enough. That’s why we’re trying to see if we can’t get anything,” said the resident.
