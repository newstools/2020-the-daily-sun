A MPUMALANGA transport inspector escaped injury when his work vehicle, a Ford Focus sedan, burst into flames on Monday, 7 December. He was alone in the car and travelling towards Mbombela from Nkomazi when the accident happened. Mpumalanga Transport MEC Gillion Mashego said: “We’ve lost a valuable tool of trade to maximise our operations, especially during this festive season.” He was referring to the Ford Focus. “This will impact negatively our bid to ensure public transport compliance,” he said. He thanked God no one was injured! It was a normal maintenance routine service. The car had never experienced serious problems. The driver, now safe and at work, stopped the car when smoke came out of the bonnet.  He pulled over to check what the problem was and the car immediately burst into flames. He was on duty over the weekend using the same vehicle.  Investigations are under way. The department received 20 brand new cars last Thursday during the launch of Transport Month in Limpopo.
