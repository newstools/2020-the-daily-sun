POSSIBILITY of harsher lockdown has sparked fears throughout Mzansi, especially in the alcohol industry. Liquor traders have pleaded with government not to impose an alcohol ban, saying that will cripple their businesses. The Southern African Alcohol Policy Alliance, in response to the Liquor Traders plea with government, has called for public health before profits. The second wave of Covid-19 has pushed the number of infections over the one million mark in Mzansi. There’s also concern over hospitals beds running out fast and the depletion of oxygen supplies as Covid-19 patients stream in. Added to this deadly burden is the surge hospitals are facing in the admission of patients with alcohol-induced injuries. Medical associations and nursing unions have also called for increased controls on alcohol to allow hospitals and health resources to focus on managing Covid-19 cases. The association said the liquor industry hasn’t delivered on its pledge to ensure outlets observe Covid-19 protocols and thereby contribute to the containment of the virus. “We believe their approach, like their long-standing and equally unsuccessful ‘drink responsibly’ campaign, is designed more to protect their profits than to address the fundamental drivers of the harmful use of alcohol – that it is too affordable, too easily available and aggressively marketed.” The association recommended outlets maintain current restrictions on off-consumption liquor sales and suspend all on-premises sales and consumption of alcohol. It further recommended reducing indoor gatherings to 50 people and maintain less than 50% capacity in indoor venues. Lucky Ntimane of the Liquor Traders Formations said in a TV interview with eNCA: “Should government consider a total ban on alcohol, an issue to look at would be allowing taverns to operate as off-premise outlets over a seven-day period. We feel there are solutions apart from total lockdown.”
