AZWINDINI Netshimboni wants to keep Mzansi safe. The 25-year-old from Alexandra, north of Joburg, has created a male condom called Raw Pleasure. “I did research and asked young people what should be added to a male condom so they may use them,” he said. But he experienced some challenges. Resources and funding were a challenge, but I was able to pull through at the end of the day,” he said. He told Daily Sun the name, Raw, came from the lightness of the condom, which makes it seem like one is not wearing one at all. Azwindini sells a pack of six plus lubricant for R30. He wants to see his brand in retail stores across South Africa and the rest of the continent. He said feedback has been great. Lindelwa Mathe (31) tried out the condoms.  “You’ll feel like you’re having raw sex. You have no reason not to condomise,” she said. Sbusiso Sibiya (37) said he’ll make it a point that he always condomises. “You’ll have the best sexual pleasure. We love them and I hope they’ll be available in every store one day,” he said. Azwindini assured Daily Sun his rubbers are South African Bureau of Standards approved.
