TSAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila came from behind to secure a ;point against Black leopards in the Limpopo derby on Wednesday afternoon. The two sides played to a 1-1 draw in a match that took place at Thohoyandou Stadium. It was their first time meeting in the top flight since TTM bought the frenchise of Bidvest Wits early this year. The draw saw TTM extending their unbeaten run to four matches. Leopards giant goalkeeper King Ndlovu could not finish the match after sustaining an injury in the early minutes of the first half. The lanky goalkeeper was in the thick of things in the tenth minute after he came out of his area to clear a through ball for Nicholus Lukhubeni but he sustained an injury and just before the half-hour mark, he was eventually replaced by Jonas Mendes. Thabo Rakhale fouled Tebogo Makobela inside the box, and Leopards were awarded an penalty which was converted by Roderick Kabwe just before half time. However, Rhulani Manzini eventually levelled matters for TTM in the 69 minutes with a brilliant free-kick that found the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Manzini almost snatched the winner for TTM in the last nine minutes with another free-kick from a long way out that curled slightly wide of the top corner. However, the two sides ended up sharing the spoils as no one managed to get a winner until the final whistle. Leopards were unchanged from the impressive 2-2 draw against Kaizer Chiefs, whereas Tshakhuma came with three changes in Thabo Rakhale, Miguel Timm and Mogakolodi Ngele.
