The year 2020 will be remembered as the year in which the heavily-bankrolled Royal Eagles reached its sell-by date. The club, previously owned by what was known as a Durban’s power couple Sbu Mpisane and Shauwn Mkhize, was relegated from the GladAfrica Championship to the ABC Motsepe League last season. No one had imagined this was going to happen so soon, given the investment made between the couple when they bought then Mpumalanga side Sivutsa Stars’ GAC status in 2014. The aim was to turn the club into a force that would dominate the first division and eventually win promotion to the PSL. But they never came close to challenge for the promotion, despite signing players the likes of Katlego Mphela, Mbulelo Mabizela, Dominic Isaac and Thulanisizwe Mbuyane. They had also appointed top coaches the likes of Khabo Zondo, Kosta Papic and Vladislav Heric. But nothing worked in their favour. In the 2018/19 season when they came close as they finished second. Going to the PSL Play-offs, they found things tough against Maritzburg United (finished 15th on the DStv Premiership table) and Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila (finished third in the GAC). Maritzburg proved strong as they retained their PSL top flight status, winning all four games and becoming the first side in the PSL era to do so. That meant, despite Mpisane saying they were giving themselves three years in the first division,  remaining in the second tier for another year. But things turned sour for Eagles when Sbu and Shauwn started their divorce battle at the beginning of last season. Shauwn and her son Andile resigned from the club. Mpisane retained the club and kept on running its affairs. But he struggled to pay players and coaches’ salaries. When the PSL suspended both Absa Premiership and GAC in March, it was clear Eagles wouldn’t survive with eight games to go. Eagles were relegated. But they bowed out in style in the Championship with a 1-0 victory over Steenberg United.
