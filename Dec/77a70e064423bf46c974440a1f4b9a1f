HAVE fun but don’t forget to follow lockdown regulations. This is a clear message from Joburg Metro cops to the public. The cops said they were ready to arrest anyone who broke the law and warned people to remember that the country was still facing the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun as the country was facing a second wave of infections, cops would closely monitor all gatherings in Joburg, including religious services. Indoor gatherings may not have more than 100 people and outdoor functions were capped at 250. “You won’t carry this virus on your own. You will spread it and some people might end up losing their lives,” said Minnaar. He said a lot of people were not taking the curfew seriously and this would get them into trouble. “We’d like to remind SunReaders the curfew is between 11pm and 4am, and bars and restaurants must be closed by 10pm.” The police have also warned Jozi residents against public drinking. Captain Xolu Mbele of Joburg Central cop shop said drinking in public was a criminal offence and people would be prosecuted, even during the festive season. “Family and friends come together to have a great time but let’s not break the law.” Mbele said people thought they could get away with drinking in public, but ended up with criminal records. “Don’t let temporary fun ruin your future.” He said if you’re bust, your fingerprints will be taken and you’ll have to pay a fine of R300. “Drink at home or in taverns and don’t forget the curfew. We wish everyone a safe festive season.”
