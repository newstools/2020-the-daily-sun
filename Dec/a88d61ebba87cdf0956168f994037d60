POLICE are investigating electoral fraud in the Nkomazi Municipality in Mpumalanga. A party agent raised the alarm, claiming two voters had been allowed to vote in the ward 15 by-elections despite not being in the relevant segment of the voters’ roll and not residing in the ward. Party agents check and verify ballot box seals to ensure they’re intact Immediately after receiving the complaint, the Independent Electoral Commission opened a case with police and three election officials were dismissed. The ANC, EFF and DA were contesting for ward 15 councillorship, which was eventually won by the ANC. EFF provincial chairman, Collen Sedibe, said: “We’re thankful to the party agent who raised the alarm. Police were involved and arrested the election officers for vote rigging.” Spokeswoman Kate Bapela said: “The alleged electoral fraud had no material impact on the outcome of the election in the ward, where the winning candidate received 85,67% of the valid votes cast. “The electoral commission views any allegations of electoral fraud in the most serious light and will not hesitate to take the strongest possible action against any voters or officials who contravene the law. “The Local Government Municipal Electoral Act 27 of 2 000 and its associated regulations make it an offence to vote in a ward in which a voter isn’t registered or a resident. “It’s also an offence for any person to assist a person to vote where they’re not entitled to. “Penalties for conviction of electoral fraud range from a fine to up to 10 years’ imprisonment. “The commission appreciates the vigilance of party agents, observers and other voters in monitoring the election process and raising any problems and potential irregularities including electoral fraud.” Colonel Donald Mdhluli said police are investigating. No arrests had been made. The ANC won all five wards: two in Nkomazi and three previously represented by the Better Residents Association in the Bushbuckridge Municipality.
