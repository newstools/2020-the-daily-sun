MAMELODI Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi believes that if Hlompho Kekana can win the Fifa Puskas award, it can change the landscape of SA football. Kekana’s goal against Cape Town City on 20 August last year has been nominated for the Puskas award along with 10 other stunning efforts. This is the second time Kekana has been nominated for the coveted award after being nominated for the 2016 edition alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, although he ultimately lost out to Malaysian striker Mohd Faiz Subri on that occasion. The winner for this year will be announced at the awards ceremony in Zurich on 17 December. “When it comes to our captain, he’s one boy that deserves everything that comes his way because he is a true professional,” Mngqithi said. “The guy works very hard, he is committed to the game I don’t know any life that Hlompho Kekana lives except football and it will be very sad of me if Hlompho does not get such recognition. “If you were to look at the goals that he scored, goals that are of the same magnitude are the goals that have taken him to the Puskas Award. “When he gets this recognition to me it feels very good, it sends a good message to everyone that when you are committed to the game the game will also reward you. I just wish Hlompho win one of these awards more especially the Puska Award.” Mngqithi added: “It is not the first time he gets this nomination, it will also speak volumes to the landscape of the South African game if he can win this award. "He deserves it, he has been very instrumental.”
