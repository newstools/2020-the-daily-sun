EDDIE Hearn has hit back at Tyson Fury after the Gypsy King said Anthony Joshua had “s*** himself” on live TV after his world heavyweight title fight against Kubrat Pulev. Fury was unimpressed by Joshua’s performance, also calling him a “Dosser” as well as his comments about a potential fight between the pair. But Hearn jumped to the defence of his client, insisting AJ is not the sort of personality to scream and shout, as well as revealing his desire is to ensure the feuding pair meet in the ring. Hearn retorted in an interview with iFLTV: “We’ll see who is s******* themselves. Ultimately, AJ is not the kind of guy who’s going to scream and shout on TV and call people ‘Dossers’, that’s not his style. “So we’ll let Tyson do that. We’ll sign the fight and get it done. We’ll start the talks tomorrow. There are about 19 people who claim to work on that side – we know who we’ve got to deal with and we will get it done. “We’re all for it. I honestly can’t tell you there’s not one person who doesn’t want to move forward with that fight. “Rather than just talk about it all the time, let’s just keep it low-key, keep it under the radar and get it done. “Because shouting and screaming doesn’t really solve anything. That’s why you ain’t gonna hear AJ shouting and screaming. All I can tell you, from our side, is that we’re all in.” AJ delivered a stunning ninth round knockout to Pulev to successfully defend his WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO titles at Wembley Arena on Saturday. Afterwards, he was asked whether he wanted to face the WBC titleholder Fury next. Joshua declared his desire to make the unification showdown happen next year, stating he wants all the belts. But the Gypsy King was unimpressed by his fellow Brit’s answer, and instantly took to social media to post his response. In a video clip, Fury said: “There you go everyone, Anthony Joshua just s*** himself on live television.” – THE SUN
