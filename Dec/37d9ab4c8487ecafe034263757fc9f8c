A 36-year-old SARS official and his two accomplices, aged 19 and 64, were arrested for corruption and defeating the ends of justice. This comes after police from Makhado and Tshilwavhusiku outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo confiscated a truck with about R10 million worth of illicit cigarettes on Thursday 3 December. Makhado police were out on patrol duties when they noticed a truck driving at a high speed along the N1. They tried to stop it but the driver sped off and the members called for back-up from Tshilwavhusiku Police Station. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said in the process, police received information from a tracking company about a hijacked truck matching the same description, heading towards Tshilwavhusiku area. Mojapelo said the truck was later found abandoned at Magau area. It was searched and boxes of illicit cigarettes with an estimated street value of R9,9 million were confiscated. “Police then started with their initial investigations, which were soon followed by a manhunt for the suspects involved. Later in the afternoon, the SARS custom official came to Tshilwavhusiku Police Station alleging that he was on duty and the truck including the luggage had been cleared at the Beitbridge border gate. The other two suspects also came in and informed the police that they are the owners of the truck. They were all apprehended on the spot. The concerted efforts by our members in Limpopo to fight the smuggling and dealing in illicit cigarettes are paying off,” he said. Mojapelo told Daily Sun the origin and destination of the recovered items would be determined by the ongoing police investigations and the suspects would appear in the Tshilwavhusiku Magistrates Court soon for corruption and defeating the ends of justice. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has commended the members for the recovery of the illicit cigarettes and for acting promptly in arresting the suspects involved.
