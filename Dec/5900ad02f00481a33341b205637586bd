It is problematic that the public relies on government for statistical data. There is apparently no transparency on how the health department and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases arrive at the numbers shared with the public. Right now the public depends on Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize’s daily statistics on twitter. It’s about time they give the public a detailed and raw statistical data. Accuracy is critical.
