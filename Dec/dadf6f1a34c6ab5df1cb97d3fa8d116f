Now that Christmas has come and gone, it’s time to prepare for the New Year. With just under a week to go before we bid farewell to the year 2020. One now needs to prepare for the year 2021. With many deeming 2020 a year to forget, life coaches agree that now is the time to look forward to a new year and here’s how: 1.	Reflect Those in retail call it stocktaking. The process of checking what one has done over a period of time. From the gains and losses, it is important to be honest with yourself during this process. 2.	Get rid of the old habits In order to mentally be ready to embrace the New Year, one needs to take stock of their habitual behaviour. From procrastination to spending habits. Work on letting that go in 2020. 3.	Forgive yourself Psychologists agree that one of the hardest things to do in life is to forgive ourselves. 2020 has been an eye opener for many of us, and whilst a lot has happened. Let it go and start again.
