THE Mpumalanga health department has suspended festive season celebrations at all its facilities. It’s always been tradition for families and organisations to gather at various health facilities to celebrate with loved ones. Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has confirmed that due to the increasing Covid-19 second wave infections, there won’t be parties this year. “It’s our duty to keep patients safe from infections and prevent the spread of the virus,” said Manzini. “That’s why we’ve decided that no festive season gatherings in any facilities will be allowed. “Even the department won’t be visiting Christmas and New Year babies because we want to ensure the infants are well-protected. We’d like to apologise for any inconvenience caused, as a result.” Private companies, families and organisations are welcome to hand in their gifts to the healthcare facilities for the patients’ attention. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule confirmed that Mpumalanga reported 32 341 positive Covid-19 cases for December and for week 50, a daily average of 74 cases have been recorded – a massive increase from the 51 daily average for week 49. “The highest reported number of new cases occurred on 12 December, with 110 cases reported,” said Malamule. “Over 31 000 patients have recovered in the province, with 1 092 patients still to recover. “Regrettably, 624 Covid-19 deaths have been reported.”
