LEGENDARY maskandi artist Zibokwakhe “Phuzekhemisi” Mnyandu deserves a doctorate degree in music. This was the sentiment from maskandi artist, Mxolisi Inyonemhlophe Jali. He took to Facebook on Tuesday, 22 December and publicly thanked Phuzekhemisi for showing him the ropes. “I receive so much joy when people tell me I sing just like Phuzekhemisi. BLONDIE MAKHENE: MEN ARE TRASH! “He taught me to value my worth and respect other artists. With him, we achieved seven gold discs, two platinum discs and 22 awards. I wish him all the best and I really wish academic institutions award him with a doctorate in this field,” he wrote. He said he started working with Phuzekhemisi from an early age. “He took me under his wing and guided me. I’ve built my name because I listened to him.” Phuzekhemisi said he trained Inyonemhlophe out of the goodness of his heart. He said he was grateful someone he taught recognised his work. “I am actually lost for words. This is because artists rarely get recognition while they are still alive. Inyonemhlophe is like a son to me, both of us never thought we’d travel this far,” said Phuzekhemisi.
