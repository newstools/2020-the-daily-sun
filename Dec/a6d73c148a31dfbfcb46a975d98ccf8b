THE family of the late Sihle Nkondlo need help to bury him. Relative Xhasumzi Nkondlo (48) said the family from Samora Machel in Cape Town was told Sihle had been asked by a neighbour to come help him offload bricks from a truck. “A worker noticed the bricks Sihle was taking down from the top of the truck had blood on them,” said Xhasumzi. “They told him to get down, but 10 minutes later his mouth started bleeding.” Sihle died a few minutes later. Xhasumzi said Sihle was staying with his unemployed mum and other six family members. “They don’t have insurance. “It’s difficult to bury him,” said Xhasumzi. Faniswa Nkondlo (46), another relative, said they were still shocked. “One moment he was fine and the next minute he’s no more,” she said. Faniswa said their wish was to bury him in the Eastern Cape at Nkalweni Village in Ugie. “We’re asking anyone who can help to come forward. “We don’t expect his mum to carry this burden alone, especially as she’s not working,” she said. She said they read stories about people getting help after their stories appeared in Daily Sun. “We hope we’ll also be fortunate,” she said. Accroding to Faniswa, they need to pay R7 000 before the body can be moved to a funeral parlour. “We need money for the coffin.”
