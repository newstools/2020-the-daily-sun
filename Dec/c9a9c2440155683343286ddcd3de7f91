ELDOS cops have dodged the sheriff – claiming Covid-19 as its excuse! Last week Daily Sun published an article of Warrant Officer Bafana Dube who was caught up in a bribe scandal in 2010. In 2012, the court found that he was falsely implicated as he knew nothing about collecting a bribe, but was just accompanying a colleague to go to his friend. Advocate Malesela Teffo told Daily Sun that the SAPS dismissed Dube although he was wrongfully charged with fraud and extortion. He said the SAPS then allegedly refused to reinstate him, even though the court ruled in his favour.  Teffo said his client was unfairly dismissed and the court ordered the repossession of furniture and a fleet of six vehicles from the police in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, to compensate Dube. On Thursday, 17 December when the sheriff went to the cop shop, the station commander said that he had just taken over the position and asked to be given until today, to speak to his superiors. Teffo said when they got to the station today, the station commander was nowhere to be found and the station had allegedly reported a Covid-19 case. “We are not impressed by this at all, especially because the station commander failed to honour our appointment. “We will respect that there’s a case of Covid-19 and fumigation has to be done, but this could be an excuse,” said Teffo. He said the would reschedule the appointment and behave because they didn’t want to risk Dube losing out on getting justice.
