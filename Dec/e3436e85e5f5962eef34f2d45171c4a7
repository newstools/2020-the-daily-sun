Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi has advised Anele Ngcongca’s family to resist the temptation to fight over his money as this would affect his child. He said this during Anele’s funeral in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Thursday, 11 December. Mngqithi said usually when a breadwinner dies, the family would fight over the control of the estate which leaves the children in the cold. “It is very difficult to lose a breadwinner. I know this because I grew up in a family that was not easy. I know this because usually in moments like this, instead of honouring and celebrating the life of your own, your family normally becomes a battlefield. And you are fighting over something that was never yours,” said Mngqithi. He urged Ngcongca’s widow Linda Racaza and mother Nomahamba Magadlela to resist the temptation to tussle for control over his properties. “I’m just urging you Linda and Ngcongca’s mum to understand one very important phrase. ‘When two elephants fight, the grass suffers’. If you two do not get along, you are not going to struggle. You are old and have seen it all but this will affect Anele’s child. “I beg you. I know how trying this moment is and I know how difficult this moment is for all of you. Anele’s worked very hard for his child so that this child would have a bright future.” He said Ngcongca’s daughter needs compassion from the family to grow and be like her father. He said from what he has observed from the family members who spoke during the funeral, the family is warm. He said this warmth must continue even after Ngcongca is buried. “The speeches that came from all the cousins and everyone suggest that you are a very warm family. Please be that warm family. It is very important that you are not doing it for yourselves now, do it for the child,” said Mngqithi.
