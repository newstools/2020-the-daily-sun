The leaking of the maths and physics papers is the result of irresponsible behaviour. Responsibility requires that one have integrity. When bestowed with such an honour, one must execute it exceptionally. Who leaked those papers, anyway? Do they realise how much damage is inflicted on pupils? Moreover, I doubt the culprits are parents? How will pupils performance, after having passed through cooked results, be vetted at tertiary institutions? Harsh punitive measures must be taken against the perpetrators. Universal, as well as our countryâ€™s laws, clearly state that one must not buy stolen goods.
