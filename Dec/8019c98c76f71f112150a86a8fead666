A kasi businesswoman says the government should consider reducing the provision of social grants and support small businesses instead. Award-winning businesswoman Ntomboxolo Nonxuba said if people had jobs and business opportunities, they would take pride in looking after their families than to wait for the government to give them money every month through grants. “I’m worried that there is more spending on grants that do not change people’s lives at the end of the day. This is because if you give me R350 today I will be waiting for you to give me another one tomorrow. But if you teach me a skill then I can earn my own living,” she said. Nonxuba, who runs Rise Uniforms in Luzuko in Philippi Cape Town, received the Best Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2020 from the Western Cape government. She told Daily Sun that despite Covid-19 challenges, she managed to expand her business and created more jobs. Many of her employees are from her kasi and they walk to work every day saving them transport money. She said if the government could support more small businesses from ekasi, unemployment in townships would end. She said those small businesses should be properly registered so that they could contribute to the economy. “For a change, let us walk away from grants. Let us have a government that supports the SMMEs by procuring from them. We must make sure our communities play an active role in the economy.We want our people to build their own homes. This can only happen when government supports small businesses. People cannot do that with grant money,” said Nonxuba.
