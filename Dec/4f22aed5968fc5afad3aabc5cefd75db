RELATIVES of the preacher who allegedly hacked to death his lover and grandkids are still reeling in shock. This after Themba Mkhize (73) allegedly hacked to death Thule Sibiya (46) and her grandkids, Nomcebo (8) and Asemahle (4), with a bush knife on Monday, 7 December. READ: PASTOR HACKS LOVER AND KIDS His relatives from the Hopewell area in Thornville, KZN, said they were shocked as they only knew Themba’s soft side. His daughter Ntombikayise (51) said: “He left our home after my mother’s death to build another home with our stepmum, where he lived for several years. Things turned sour between them last year and he chose to move back to our home. He didn’t say much about what they disagreed on. He only told us that he chose to leave because he didn’t want trouble.” She said she still has many unanswered questions. Themba’s sister, Thembisile (59), who was friends with Thule, said they had been drinking on the day of the incident as their neighbour had a ceremony in his home. “We ended up taking the alcohol home and continued drinking. We then decided to sleep in separate houses. I was woken by him saying he was seeing a number of dead people and when I came to him, I saw the kids lying in a pool of blood,” she said. Doris Sibiya (65), a member at Uniting Presbyterian Church in SA: Hopewell Branch where Mkhize was a preacher, said: “To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement.” Ward councillor Vincent Maphumulo said: “People loved him and valued his word. We’re still shocked.” The SunTeam visited the victims’ family, but they were told that people who could speak to the media were unavailable.
