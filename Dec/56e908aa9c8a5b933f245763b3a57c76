LEHLOHONOLO Seema is set to depart as head coach of Chippa United! The club management are busy deciding Seema's fate. Chippa have won only once in eight DStv Premiership matches this season. “We are in the meeting and please phone me later,” club COO Lukhanyo Mzizi told SunSport. This means Seema’s future will be sealed soon as Chippa are flirting in the relegation zone. Seema, has been summoned to the meeting, but he was handed a letter of suspension yesterday following a poor run of results. Not only they have won only once this season, the club has lost the last three matches, lying third from bottom with five points from eight league matches. In fact, they have lost four of their five matches, with their last victory coming against bottom side Maritzburg United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on 3 November. While Seema’s future is in the balance, it does not come as a surprise. Club chairman Siviwe Mpengesi is renowned for firing coaches when results don’t come the club’s way. Rulani Mokwena, now part of Mamelodi Sundowns trio of coaches who Seema replaced on 6 July, was fired after just one game in charge in which he drew against now defunct Bidvest Wits. Dan Malesela was fired after only three games in charge in the 2018-19 season. Seema has won three, lost seven and drawn four of 14 games in charge of the Chilli Boys. If the former Lesotho international is fired, he’ll become the 22nd coach to be shown the door since June 2012 when Chippa were promoted to the Premiership.
