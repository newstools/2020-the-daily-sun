LIFE has not been good for DStv Premiership newbies TS Galaxy. After seven games that have been played thus far, the Mpumalanga outfit has struggled to get desired results. And that has put a lot of pressure on coach Dan “Dance”’ Malesela. The Rockets have not tasted a win in consecutive matches. The stressful part for Malesela is that in three home matches they have only managed to get four points. “It is a lot of pressure,” Malesela admitted after a 2-0 loss against Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday. “We don’t want to get to a situation of desperation. We don’t want to be desperate,” Malesela stated. When the season started Malesela said they are targeting double figures of points in the first five games. However, they have only managed to gather eight points. “We’ve set ourselves the standard, and we should be somewhere with points, and we are not there yet, so it puts a lot of pressure, I can tell you that,” Malesela said. This weekend, The Rockets travel to Cape Town where they will face Cape Town City in their last match of the year at Cape Town Stadium. The former Chippa United mentor said it is mandatory that they get maximum points to ease the vastly growing pressure. He said: “We have to get maximum points on the last day of the year.” Lack of killer instinct has been one of their main concerns as they have only scored three goals this season and they have conceded five.
