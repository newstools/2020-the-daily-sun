Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor Nqaba
Bhanga said he is cautiously optimistic as a slight decline in the average
daily coronavirus infection rate is evident since the beginning of December. Between 4 and 10 December an average of 416 positive
cases were recorded, and 227 between 11 and 17 December. “Although it is a good sign, it does not mean that we
can now rest on our laurels as we are still firmly in the steely grip of a
second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. “However, we should applaud and show our gratitude
towards those residents who diligently comply with the COVID-19 regulations
currently in place, and encourage others to comply in the interest of the
wellbeing of our fellow citizens. “Please continue to wear your masks, wash your hands
regularly with water and soap, sanitize and ensure physical distancing. “We are in this together and a decline in new
infections is a step in the right direction to address the coronavirus scourge
and lighten the load on our public health system. “Our law enforcement personnel are out in full force
on a daily basis to ensure compliance with the Disaster Management Act. Their
tireless efforts should also be recognised as we enter a busy period of the
year where not only coronavirus regulation enforcement, but road safety
campaigns and general law enforcement are also priorities,” Mayor Bhanga said. Nelson Mandela Bay currently has 2 058 active cases, 2 133 recorded deaths and 45 719 cumulative recoveries out of 49 910 positive cases since the beginning of the pandemic.
