ALLAN Freese has found a new home in the GladAfrica Championship. The former Platinum Stars, Highlands Park and AmaZulu mentor has been appointed as the new head coach of Free State Stars. The KZN-born coach takes this job just less than two weeks after he was released by AmaZulu. “Yes, I have been appointed as Free State Stars head coach," Freese confirmed. Freese’s departure at AmaZulu came after Benni McCarthy was appointed as their head coach and he wasn’t retained as one of the former FC Porto’s striker’s technical staff. Freese, who joined Usuthu on the 12 September, was in charge of only one game – a 2-0 loss at the hands of Golden Arrows after Ayanda Dlamini stepped down “voluntarily” on 7 December. However, when McCarthy was appointed earlier this month, the Bafana all time goal scorer opted for Siyabonga Nomvethe as part of his technical team. Bhele was on the bench in McCarthy’s first game when Usuthu won 3-1 over Chippa United at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on 20 December. Freese dropping down to GAC, it is the division that it is familiar to him. He promoted Highlands Park to the PSL top flight in 2015-16 season via the play-offs. The 64-year-old, who also coached Royal Eagles in the GAC previously, made his name at now defunct Dikwena whom he guided to the double in the 2013-14 season with Telkom Knockout and the MTN trophies.
