THE Estina Dairy Farm Project was allegedly used to launder R880 million. This is according to evidence from Paul Holden, a researcher employed by Shadow World Investigations in London. He said at the Zondo Commission yesterday that the farm was used by the Guptas to launder money a year before the dairy project. Holden said according to his research, the money was laundered through a complex money washing system. The inquiry also heard how the Free State government paid double the price for laptops it bought for needy students from the Gupta company, Sahara. He said they used a third party company, Sunbay Trading, to source the items. Holden said government was the biggest loser in this transaction as it paid more than what it could have paid if it had bought the computers directly from Sahara. “And the beneficiary here is Sunbay Trading, although we know from the #Guptaleaks that the majority of the profits earned from this transaction were transferred back to Sahara,” said Holden. He also told the inquiry how the Estina Dairy Farm, in Vrede, was used to enrich the Guptas. He mentioned Tony Gupta as the central figure in the scheme. “He was central to the entire Gupta enterprise. He was closely involved in meeting with Free State officials to discuss Estina,” said Holden. The commission has heard previously that the dairy project was not budgeted for when it was implemented in 2012. The project was meant to help emerging farmers in Vrede.
