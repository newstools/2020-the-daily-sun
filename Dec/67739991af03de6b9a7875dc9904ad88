GOLDEN Arrows proved to be too sharp for AmaZulu in their KwaZulu Natal derby. They pierced through Usuthu and walked away 2-0 winners their DStv Premiership encounter played at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium yesterday. Nduduzo Sibiya and Velemseni Ndwandwe were both on target for Abafana Bes'thende as they ensured that the bragging rights in the KZN derby would go to Lamontville. Mandla Ncikazi’s charges have had a decent start to the season and were determined to maintain the momentum they had built. They were not prepared to let go of their unbeaten record having won once and drawn five times. Arrows, who were victorious the last time the two sides met in the league, continued their recent dominance over their rivals. AmaZulu, on the other hand, have had a rather difficult start to the season as they are closer to the bottom than they are to the top. And based on their ambitions under the new ownership of Sandile Zungu, this is nowhere near where they intend to be. Hence they have enlisted the services of the equally ambitious Benni McCarthy as their new coach replacing the out of sorts Ayanda Dlamini. But McCarthy’s presence in the stands, was not enough to inspire Usuthu to victory as they recorded their third loss of the season. The former Cape Town City coach, however, will be looking to change a few things ahead of his side’s next match against Chippa United at the same venue on Sunday (3.30 pm). But he could do nothing except watch as Sibiya’s first-half penalty and Ndwandwe’s second-half strike sunk his new side. McCarthy’s biggest task will be getting some of the big-name players Usuthu have bought to gel with the rest of the team and play as one. Meanwhile, Ncikazi will be hoping for more of the same against Mamelodi Sundowns at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm).
