FREE State Stars have booked their place in the Last 32 of the Nedbank Cup after a 2-0 home win over Uthongathi in a rescheduled preliminary round tie at Goble Park on Wednesday. The 2018 champions secured their victory via goals from Benin forward Abdel Fadel Suanon and veteran midfielder Paulus Masehe and will now enter the competition proper along with the seven other qualifiers from the GladAfrica Championship. Stars secured the title in 2018 when they defeated Maritzburg United 1-0 in the final in Cape Town, but have seen their fortunes plummet since then as they were relegated from the DStv Premiership in the following season. Stars were also regular visitors to the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup over the years, including in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2016 before they finally managed to lift the trophy. Here is a quick look at the other seven second-tier qualifiers for 2021. CAPE TOWN SPURS Spurs is the new name of Ajax Cape Town but they remain essentially the same club and so have a rich history in the Nedbank Cup, including lifting the trophy in 2007. Those were heady days for the club, and they will hope a new name and a fresh outlook sees them restored. Aside from a runner-up finish in 2015, when they lost on penalties to Mamelodi Sundowns, the club have exited in the first round of the Nedbank Cup in each of their last eight appearances dating back to 2010. JDR STARS Stars will debut in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 having missed out in the preliminaries last season. They defeated Cape Umoya United 3-2 in the qualifier stage this time round. RICHARDS BAY The KwaZulu-Natal club have now qualified for the Last 32 in three of the last four seasons and on each previous occasion made it to the second round. Coincidentally, there they have clashed with Bloemfontein Celtic on both occasions and lost out twice, 1-3 in 2018 and 0-1 in 2019. ROYAL AM Royal AM played previously as Real Kings and they debuted in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 in 2020, where they made it all the way to the quarterfinals. A 3-2 win over Passion FC was followed by a 2-1 victory over Mbombela United, before the side were hammered 4-0 by BidVest Wits in the quarters. SEKHUKHUNE UNITED Sekhukhune are in their debut season in the GladAfrica Championship and defeated Jomo Cosmos 2-1 at home in their preliminary round tie. The team is coached by veteran Johnny Ferreira, who won this competition with Witbank Aces in 1993. STEENBERG UNITED Steenberg will be making a third appearance in the Nedbank Cup Last 32, but their first as a second-tier side. Both previous entries in 2016 and 2018 were when they campaigned in the third-tier of South African football. They lost on penalties to then top-flight side Platinum Stars in 2016, but two years later defeated fellow third-tier side Orbit College to book a place in the second round. There they were ousted 0-2 by Baroka FC. TS SPORTING Sporting made their debut in the Nedbank Cup in 2020 and made it through the quarterfinals, where they were eventually beaten on penalties by Bloemfontein Celtic. They managed away wins at Ajax Cape Town (2-2, 4-3 on pens) and Happy Wanderers (4-3) along the way and this time qualified via a preliminary win over Polokwane City. -SuperSport.com
