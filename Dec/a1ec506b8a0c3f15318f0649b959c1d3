TS Galaxy will be hoping to keep their unbeaten run in the 2020-21 DStv Premiership season when they host Stellenbosch FC at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday afternoon (3.30 pm). However, as much as they are yet to taste a defeat, the club coach Dan Malesela says they need to start winning having drawn four times and won once in their opening five games. “Fortunately or unfortunately for us is that we need to win so that we can decrease the number of draws," Malesela said. In the five games, The Rockets have scored only three goals and conceded two. It might be still early in the season but they are lacking killer instinct as they need to score goals and win home games to make their home venue Mbombela Stadium a fortress as Malesela has suggested ahead of their clash against Golden Arrows. Malesela added: "The interesting thing about football is that as long as you don't win, you then target the next game,” Stellenboosch are traveling to Mbombela limping after they were thumped 3-0 by defending Champions Mamelodi Sundowns last weekend. Malesela believes it will be a tricky affair as both teams need to get maximum points. "They (Stellenbosch) just came from a 3-0 loss. It’s both sides that need to get points, you know. Our home games are important,” Malesela implied. “I'm not saying the other games are not important. It is much more crucial for us to get points at home. We don't want to start falling behind and stuff like that.” "Truth be told, I know that there are teams who come here and they are very worried about us. If we let them off the hook or we give them hope, they gain confidence. We shouldn't do that." Stellies have taken just one point from three away matches this season as they drew 1-1 with Orlando Pirates and lost against Tshwane giants SuperSport and Sundowns.
