SWALLOWS FC’s bright start to life back in the top-flight continues. The Dube Birds are flying high since their return to the land of milk and honey and seem to have no intentions of coming down. They solidified their position among the top teams in the division with an impressive come from behind 2-1 win over Black Leopards at the Thohoyandou Stadium. The scorching heat in Venda did little to deter the Birds who were by far the dominant team on the day and walked away as deserved winners. The result saw Brandon Truter’s charges go level on points with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who remain at the top of the standings on goal difference. This has been a season to remember so far for Swallows who have made the best-ever start to a season by a newly promoted team in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). They have picked up an impressive 18 points from their eight matches so far with four wins and as many draws. The Dube Birds are one of only four teams yet to lose a match in the DStv Premiership this season. But they were given a scare early on when they went down to an Onyedikachi Ononogbu goal as Lidoda Duvha looked to bring the high-flying Birds back down to earth. But as they have shown on numerous occasions already this season, Swallows are a tough nut to crack and they flew back into the tie thanks to their top scorer Ruzaigh Gamildien. It was then the turn of super-sub Joseph Mhlongo who netted a contender for goal of the month to hand his side the lead and eventually, all three points. The Birds will hope the upcoming Christmas break does not break their momentum. The Premiership will resume on the 2nd of January with a titanic clash between Sundowns and Orlando Pirates.
