THE congestion that brought the Beitbridge Border post to a standstill has apparently being cleared after days of chaos, according to the Department of Home Affairs. Several people, including four truck drivers, reportedly died after being stuck at the border for days. The queues of vehicles travelling to Zimbabwe from South Africa for the December holidays stretched for as far as 20km. Some desperate people who tried to cross the border through the river allegedly drowned or were mauled by crocodiles. In a statement, Home Affairs announced that all lanes around the border were cleared from the afternoon of 24 December. “This means all travellers through Beitbridge have been processed and cleared,” said the statement. The department said it worked with the Department of Health, the South African National Defence Force, the police, Sars and the Limpopo government to resolve the problem. The Musina Municipality provided holding areas, which enabled vehicles going to the border, to be released to travel in manageable numbers. The municipality also provided ablution facilities and water along the route from the town of Musina to the port of entry. The department urged travellers to continue observing traffic and immigration laws, as well as health protocols to curb the spread of Covid-19. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has previously blamed truck drivers for the congestion, alleging that some of them had incorrect documentation. However, the Road Freight Association has denied that truck drivers were to blame for the traffic build-up. Incredible Happenings Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng called for prayer for the people who were stuck at the border. “This has led to deaths caused by dehydration, lack of food, while others died from fatigue,” said Mboro.
