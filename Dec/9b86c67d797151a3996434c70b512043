The Pan African Bar Association of SA has slammed claims doing the rounds on social media that former president Jacob Zuma’s lawyer, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, has died and was poisoned. The association’s chairwoman, Nasreen Rajab-Budlender, said Sikhakhane was infected with Covid-19 a few weeks ago and experienced severe symptoms. “He’s still in hospital but recovering well. His doctors are happy with his recovery,” she said. A few days ago Zuma was reportedly admitted to a Richards Bay hospital with his wife Sizakele after testing positive for Covid-19. Rajab-Budlender said: “Advocate Sikhakhane has asked me to convey deep and sincere gratitude to all frontline workers, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and hospital staff who’re working tirelessly to save lives during this pandemic. “We ask the media and others to respect the privacy of Advocate Sikhakhane and his family as he recovers.” Rajab-Budlender urged the public to act responsibly. More than 27 000 people have died of Covid-19 in South Africa, with over 9 500 new cases reported over the past 24 hours as of Tuesday night, 29 December.
