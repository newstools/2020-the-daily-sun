NAMES of Benni McCarthy and Clinton Larsen’s have been bandied about as possible replacement for Ayanda Dlamini who “voluntarily” stepped aside from his role as AmaZulu head coach. The club officially announced yesterday that Dlamini, who ascended to the coaching role in February this year to hold the fort for Jozef Vukusic, will be moving to the club’s development ranks. Assistant coach Allan Freese will step in as interim head coach of Usuthu while “the club’s management evaluate a way forward”. But word out in the streets is that the club’s president Sandile Zungu has been a great admirer of McCarthy. “Coach Ayanda has done a phenomenal job since assuming the coaching role. The passion and zeal the players have demonstrated during his tenure demonstrates that he’s one of the prospects for the future,” said Zungu. “We’ll continue to trust him with the advancement of our development structures as he’s fully committed to Vision 2032. His role is integral in ensuring that AmaZulu have a solid base of young players coming through the ranks.” AmaZulu next take on Golden Arrows in a KZN derby on 16 December, which gives Freese enough time to get his ducks in a row.
