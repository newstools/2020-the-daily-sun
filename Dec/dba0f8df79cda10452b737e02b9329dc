THE Municipal Demarcation Board has handed over 4 468 final ward boundaries to the IEC in preparation for the 2021 local government elections. During a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday, board chairman Thabo Manyoni said they launched the public consultation process in February in Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Gauteng. But because of Covid-19 and the declaration of a national state of disaster, the public consultation process had to be cancelled. He said at the time only 109 out of 213 municipalities had been visited. “The revised end of the ward delimitation process was changed from August to November 2020,” said Manyoni. He said the board had to give more time for members of the public that couldn’t be consulted through physical contact meetings to submit proposals on how their wards should be configured. “The board received and considered a total of 1 206 submissions from 213 municipalities.” Manyoni said 70% of these were accepted and wards determined and published in provincial gazettes inviting anyone aggrieved by the wards to submit objections within 14 days. He said at the end of the objection period, 1 465 objections were received. Manyoni said the board considered all objections and confirmed and varied wards for all municipalities in the country. “Ninety percent of 4 468 wards were confirmed as published and 10% of those were varied,” he said. “The ward delimitation process is regarded as a crucial step toward deepening local democracy.”
