KZN’S transgender entertainer Nomalizwi Mhlongo has opened up about her rape ordeal. The revelation came after Gomora’s latest episode on Friday where Teddy’s secret came out after Langa shared Teddy’s letter with the principal. It is this episode that got Nomalizwi to open up about her ordeal. “If only I got this love from my elders when my rapist repeatedly had his way,” she wrote on Facebook. Nomalizwi was allegedly at primary school when the sexual assault by a male family member started. “I was seven or eight years old when he started raping me. I didn’t know what he was doing until I was older,’ she said. “Women and younger girls would sleep in one room. The set-up was such that young boys would sleep with older men. I was made to sleep with him. Every day he’d come home drunk and rape me. My family never suspected anything until I reported him.” But the family swept the matter under the carpet. “I was hurt and emotionally destroyed.When I grew older I confronted him and he apologised. By that time I’d developed so much hate for men. I developed anger issues and I grew up depressed.” Nomalizwi said in 2015 she started seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist. “I was put on antidepressants and only stopped taking antidepressants two years ago. I haven’t completely healed, but I’m coping. As I was watching that episode I saw myself in Teddy and I instantly had flashbacks.” Facebook friends comforted her. Kgomotso Thobejane said: “I’m so sorry, sis Nomalizwi.”
