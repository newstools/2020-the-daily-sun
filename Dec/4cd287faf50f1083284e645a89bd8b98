The funeral of soccer star Anele Ngcongca is underway at JL Zwane church in Gugulethu. Ngcongca who died in a car accident in the north of KwaZulu-Natal last month was supposed to have been buried last week but the funeral was postponed after his mother fell ill. Yesterday, Minister of Arts, Sports and Culture Nathi Mthethwa visited the family. This happened after the family had, last week complained about the government not respecting Anele’s contribution. Last week Mthethwa’s spokeswoman Masechaba Ndlovu highlighted that there has been a disagreement with the family regarding the number of people who can attend the funeral.  “The family is of the view that there must be 20, 000 people at the event. They were told that it must be confined to 100 people as per the COVID-19 health protocol,” said Masechaba. Furthermore, he advises that the above funds will be sufficient to cover costs of the funeral.The family is of the view that there must be 20, 000 people at the event.
