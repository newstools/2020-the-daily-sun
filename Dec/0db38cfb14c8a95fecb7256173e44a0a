FOR years Mzi Ngindu and his crew stole phones and other items of value. After being hit on the forehead and spending three months in hospital earlier this year, the 35-year-old decided to turn his life around. Mzi from Gugulethu, Cape Town, now washes takkies outside the Gugulethu Day Hospital. This is where he used to rob people. “I decided that since God and my ancestors gave me a second chance, I should use it by making an honest living,” he said. “I don’t rob anymore. Instead I make sure no one is robbed on this street.” Mzi charges R20 a pair and takes home around R100 a day. He uses the money to take care of his sick mum. “She’s on her deathbed. I make sure I provide her with what she needs. Mzi said after surviving the assault, which left him with a huge scar on his forehead, he decided he didn’t want his mother to bury him. “Many young people are dying because of crime, which means they must be buried by their parents “Our mothers bury us. But I told myself this won’t happen to me.” Mzi said on the day he was attacked, he tried to rob someone of their phone and the next thing he remembered he was in hospital. Residents Nokuzola Siko (44) said the streets are safe since Mzi started his business. “Mzi used to rob people, but now protects them,” said resident Nokuzola Siko (44).
