DR KENNETH Kaunda breezed into the final of the 2020 Spar Netball National Championships without tasting defeat. The team teeming with Under-21 players won all their five matches leading to the final. Dr KK, hammered Cape Town 54-16 to book a spot in the final of the tournament where they will face reigning champions Tshwane. The final of the six-day tournament will take place at the Zwartkloof Private Game Reserve in Bela Bela on Saturday (11am). Tshwane, who lost one match in the process to Dr KK, defeated Johannesburg 55-23 to set up a repeat of last year's final. Dr KK coach Elsje Jordaan said they have nothing to lose, but a gold medal to win. She stated: “It will be very disappointing (to lose this year again), but having six under-21 in a squad of 10 I think it’s massive to reach the final for them, and what a great opportunity for these youngsters to put up their hand and show that they can play. Jordaan said they will be equal to the task in the court so anything is possible. “Once you step over that white line it's 14 bodies, one ball, it’s the same posts same height and that is how we see it. We have absolutely nothing to lose and we have a gold medal to win. "That is how we going to approach it, positive strong-minded and what will be will be, we cannot control the results but we will fight until the last second.” On the other hand, Tshwane are the favourites having won the tournament in the past two years. Their coach Jenny van Dyk said they are not going to underestimate their opponents. “We are looking forward to the game, they are hungry but we are also hungry and we want to keep our title,” Van Dyk said. “To us, it’s about who can be most clinical and who can setup a right game plan for the right time during the match and secure the win. “It is going to be a tough one but we are good with tough. We like it when it’s tough and that is where we grow out of the comfort zone more than in the comfort zone."
