Singer and songwriter Vusi Nova has released a single, Ntandane. On the cover version track, the talented musician has featured media personality Somizi Mhlongo, who’s gradually making a comeback. Speaking to SunBuzz, Vusi said: “The song is about celebrating and showing gratitude to our mothers, who raised us. “It’s also my rendition of a song by legendary Busi Mhlongo, who happens to be Somizi’s aunt. “The aim of the song is to show women that we appreciate them, especially given what’s been happening around GBV.” ALSO READ: LEGENDARY SOUL BROTHERS LEFT HEARTBROKEN BY COVID-19 The 36-year-old singer said: “I was working with my friend Somizi. I’m glad we finally got in studio. “We always sing when we’re together, and the idea of doing a song together started out as a joke a while ago. We created good memories while working on the song, and who knows what can happen in the future?” The Port Elizabeth-born star said he’d hoped to release an album this year. “I had planned to release an album before the year ended, but due to the pandemic I couldn’t,” he said. “I postponed it to January next year. I’m really excited and can’t wait for Mzansi to hear it and hopefully relate to it. “It will come with a lot of surprises and special features.” The talented singer also shared with SunBuzz what kept him going. He said: “This year was a tough and a lot of unexpected things happened, but creating music, being around my family and friends and those who genuinely care about me kept me going. Hopefully, next year will be a better year.” Ntandane is available on all digital platforms.
