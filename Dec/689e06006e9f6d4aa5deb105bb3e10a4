The MEC of Health in Western Cape Dr Nomafrench Mbombo
visited the graveyard of a little girl Tazne Van Wyk who was killed earlier
this year. Mbombo together with the family and community leaders lit
some candles at the grave and comforted the family earlier today. Tazne from Elsies River in Cape Town was eight years old at
the time of her death. She was kidnapped and killed allegedly by a 54-year-old
neighbour Pangkaeker Moyhdian. Her body was discovered in a decomposed state in a storm
waterpipe in Worcester outside Cape Town after two weeks of searching. Mbombo said the fight against women and children must not be
something that is done during the 16 days of activism against gender-based
violence but something that must be done all year round.  She said the 16 days must be regarded as 16 of 365 days of
activism against the killing of women and children which is regarded as the
first pandemic Mzansi has faced. “The most pandemic has always been
gender-based violence and femicide, COVID-19 came and added another layer,”
said Mbombo. Tayzne mother Carmen 
Van Wyk(28) said she was not happy with the state of the grave of her
daughter. She is unable to put a tombstone at this stage but she would love it
to look different. “We have been here in July month and we have come back here
again today and what we have seen was not nice but we have tried to make it
look a bit decent again,” she said. She said having Mbombo and other leaders around her at the
grave of her daughter made her feel better. “I’m feeling very grateful for the
opportunity to be here with the Minister, she called me yesterday telling me
that she wanted us to go to Tazne’s grave, I said yes,” she said. Beverly Van Reenen the ward councillor from the area where
Tazne lived at the time of her death pleaded with the public to assist the
family. “I really would like to request any donor to please assist
with a tombstone to be placed at the grave of the little Tazne at Belhar
cemetry,” said Van Reenen.
