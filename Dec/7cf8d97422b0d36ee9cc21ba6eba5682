PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on the latest developments in government’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic on the evening of Thursday, 3 December. The Presidency said the president’s address follows recommendations from the National Coronavirus Command Council as the country continues to see a resurgence in the spread of the virus. Ramaphosa is expected to address the nation at 8pm amid calls for restrictions, especially on alcohol, to be tightened. There are calls to restrict the sale on alcohol in bars and pubs, which in some quarters are said to be super spreaders. There are fears infections could rise during the festive season if restrictions are not tightened around the sale of alcohol, but it’s still not clear if there will be a total ban during the festive season. The Presidency has since dismissed as fake news information circulating that there’ll be a total ban on alcohol from December 15 to January 3. Some associations are in support of a ban in hot spots only. In the Eastern Cape, for instance, acting mayor Thosnono Buyeye has fingered bars and taverns as super spreaders and pledged that the city will train owners of such establishments to stick to health protocols. It remains to be seen if the president will ring changes to alcohol sales when he addresses the nation tonight. The address comes as the country recorded over 4 000 new cases in the past 24 hours for the first time in months.
