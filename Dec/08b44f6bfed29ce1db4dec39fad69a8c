THE year 2020 has indeed been one for the history books! With Covid-19 and our inability to follow the stipulated guidelines, the president has had to clamp down hard on the festivities that normally usher us into the New Year. With the curfew being introduced much earlier and the booze supply closed, this year will see many of us go into the New Year in the comfort of our own homes. So, how can we make lemonade of the situation? 1. Pray This has been an extraordinary year marred by pain, loss and depression. Social media has been trending with the idea of lighting a candle at midnight to pray for our country. Why not join in? 2. Host a virtual party and countdown This might sound like deja vu, but like earlier in the year, this is the time to go back to the virtual way of doing things. 3. Cook up a storm While you wait for the final countdown to the end of 2020, fire up the stove with some delicious appetisers to make the wait worthwhile.
