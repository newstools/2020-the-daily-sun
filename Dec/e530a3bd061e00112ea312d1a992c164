HE’S been dead for 10 years. But that’s only according to Home Affairs. Lucky Ntimane from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said his nightmare started in 2005 after he lost his ID. He told Daily Sun he applied for a new one in 2006, but only got it in 2010. “I discovered in 2010 that I’m dead when I applied for a loan at a bank. “They kept looking at me wondering what was wrong,” said Lucky. He said when he asked what the hold up was, they told him they couldn’t help a dead man. “They could see from my photo that it was me, so I had to explain I once lost my ID and this was a new one. “They then advised me to go back to Home Affairs to rectify the error,” he said.  Lucky said he went back to Home Affairs and they promised to fix the mistake, but he’s still a dead man 10 years later. “I’m fortunate because I held on to the same job. I’m stuck and can’t do other important things.” He pleaded with the SunTeam to help him because one day this will close some opportunities for him. Lucky said Home Affairs investigated him after they made a mistake. “They asked for my parents’ identity and where I originate from. I gave it to them, but still no luck. If I’m not the original owner of this ID, why am I not criminally charged?” Lucky said he’s supposed to be getting money from the Department of Labour, but it’s being held because of his ID. Home Affairs’ Thabo Makgola said: “The matter has been referred to the relevant unit for investigation. We’ll contact the client for more information.”
