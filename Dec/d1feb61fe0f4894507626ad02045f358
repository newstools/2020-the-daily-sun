THE newly crowned Miss K-Shining Modelling Agency, Esther Theko, wants to start an organisation. Its aim will be to promote women empowerment and teach the community about gender-based violence. The 18-year-old from Matsikitsane Village outside Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was crowned the second Miss K-Shining Modelling Agency at Tladishi High School in Buffelshoek on Saturday, 26 December. She told Daily Sun she was excited to be the face of K-Shining Modelling Agency and was ready for the responsibility. “I didn’t believe it when they announced my name. I’m so grateful because the dream I was pursuing is now reality.” She said she took part in her first pageant last year.
