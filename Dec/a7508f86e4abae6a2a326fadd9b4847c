spokesman for the African Restoration Alliance, Sakhele Kula, said they decided to start a new political party after they were let down by a party they supported. “We were following a party we thought would fight for us, but they didn’t do what we wanted even though we supported them,” said Kula at the launch of the party at Community House in Salt River End, Cape Town. “We’ve suffered so much and we’re tired of corruption.” Dr Jerome Swartz, national chairman of the party, said they’re happy about the response they’re getting from people across South Africa. “Our country is led by gangsters in suits and ties. We’ll end that,” said Swartz. He told Daily Sun their vision is African restoration and they welcome any unregistered party to be with them. “We’re with anyone who wants to see change to come and join us. “We’re all tired of being fed lies. The time for our people to get what they deserve is now,” he said. There were also members from other provinces. Mncedisi Klass from Port Elizabeth said EC is hungry for change. “We have been working underground and they didn’t see us coming,” said Klass. According to him, they have gained a lot of support in the Eastern Cape. He said the party will be contesting in all municipalities and are a registered political party. Resident Siyolise Dukashe (45) asked why they didn’t just join an existing party. Said Siyolise: “I don’t believe any new political party will bring change. Siyolise said she won’t be voting for anyone next year. “I’m afraid there are many new political parties who make the same promises but none kept their promises.”
