HLOMPHO
Kekana broke down while giving a speech at the funeral service of Anele
Ngcongca. The
Mamelodi Sundowns skipper, who was standing next to coach Manqoba Mngqithi,
said he was devastated by Anele’s death. He
described him as a humble guy who always wanted people to be happy. He said
Anele’s experience made his job as a captain much easier. “He had a
good smile, a very welcoming guy. Who is going to buy hot dogs for me? He would
always ask me,  ‘Are you okay skipper,
are you okay, tata?’ He always wanted people to be happy around him,” said
Hlompho. He became
teary at the end of his speech and went to sit down by himself while other
players and officials were standing around Anele’s coffin. He said
Anele loved kids and would mentor those from the academy. Coach
Manqoba praised the humbleness of his veteran defender. “He
achieved so much. If you were to check how many trophies he won and matches he
played, I was told that he played over 37 942 minutes,” he said. “But the
youth that we have now, if they play one match and they are shown in Soccer
Laduma, they want to be carried by bus alone because the whole world must now
bow down because ‘here is the new Messi’. Anele was surely not one of those,”
said the coach. He added
that as a professional footballer, Anele was fair to other players, even when
they were competing for the same position. “Anele was
competing with Thapelo (Morena) but he would still want Thapelo to play ahead
of him. That’s how fair he was as a person. Indeed the people of Gugulethu were
blessed,” added Mngqithi.
