DRAMA takes place even offscreen at Moja Love. A man named Thomas Baloyi has come forward to accuse the popular TV channel of stealing the concept of a show called Nomayini, which he pitched. Thomas alleges two of the channel’s shows, Ready to Quit and Uyaphuza, were inspired by a proposal he sent to Bokani Moyo. The 34-year-old production company owner said he sent the proposal to Moyo in March. “She told me she saw my email but was busy and would get back to me. The next thing my ideas were being used,” he said. ALSO READ |ACTING PART OF MARTIN'S LIFE Thomas from Kagiso, west of Joburg, said the similarities were obvious. He said it broke his heart to see big companies do such things. “I won’t sugar-coat it. It’s painful to see such. We’d also like to see some of our shows on TV,” he said. “I’m at a loss for words. All I want is full ownership of my project. I was not planning to sell it to the channel. A lot of people were going to benefit from this production. What these TV channels are doing is wrong. They kill our spirit.”  Moyo told Daily Sun she wasn’t aware of the allegations and denied them. “We received an email on 17 March, which was forwarded to the proposals team. “The contents of the email haven’t been read yet due to the overwhelming number of proposals received. “We produced our first pilots for Uyaphuza before 31 July 2019 when the current format was agreed upon.”
