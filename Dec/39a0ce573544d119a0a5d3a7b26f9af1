HIGHER Education Minister Blade Nzimande said the Habitable Planet Workshop is a flagship education and training programme of the Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and Earth Systems Science. “The programme works from school to postgraduate level and aims to increase the number of students participating in science research nationally,” he said. “Its particular focus is on attracting more black and female students from poor backgrounds by creating a safe, supportive and nurturing learning environment. “By supporting students who have no internet access at home, the conference is making a social contribution to those who have felt cut off from academic institutions, research and studies by Covid-19.” Nzimande said since 2010, the programme has completed 31 undergraduate workshops for over 1 000 participants, trained several hundred students for leadership roles, and helped student leaders in delivering more than 20 school engagement programmes. He said they needed to grow their research capacity beyond current capacity with programmes such as Access. “The event also gives exposure to researchers’ work and is motivation to those watching to consider pursuing research in their fields of interest,” he said. He said the Access programme is about conducting scientific research to solve concrete and practical problems. They had identified 345 occupations that are in high demand out of a total of 1 500 registered in the Organising Framework for Occupations. “This list is updated every two years and marks an important step towards helping us understand better the needs of the labour market and signals opportunities where our students and graduates are likely to stand a better chance of finding employment,” he said.
