IT started as a small hole, but in the past six months it’s grown into a death trap right in front of their gate. And recent rains have made it worse! The family live in fear of being swallowed up by the water-filled sinkhole. Mathapelo Molefe (55), who stays with her grandkids, no longer uses the main gate as they’re scared of being eaten up by the big hole.  “We made a hole in the back fence to enable us to get in and out of the yard,” said the gogo from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg. Mathapelo said she asked the municipality to close the hole but her plea fell on deaf ears. “Maybe they’ll respond only when someone has fallen into that hole. “My grandkids no longer play freely. I keep an eye on them at all times. Residents don’t know how big the sinkhole is. “Maybe we’re sitting on top of our grave and we don’t know it. We’ll only know the day our houses get swallowed up with us inside.”  The gogo said she placed pieces of concrete over the hole after one of her grandkids nearly fell into it. “The municipality is waiting for a child to drown and then they’ll come and pretend they care,” said her neighbour, Lucky Moroge. Phillip Montshiwa, a spokesman for the Rand West municipality, said the matter will be referred to the relevant department.
