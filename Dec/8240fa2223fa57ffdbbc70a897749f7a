THE Solidary Fund is asking South Africans not to be mamparas this festive season. As the second wave is upon us, the organisation is asking Mzansi to keep safe to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The Solidarity Fund’s behavioural change pillar executive head, Wendy Tlou, told Daily Sun: “It’s human nature that we are going to let our guard down as the holidays begin. “But we are appealing to and reminding everyone to keep up with the basics to stop the spread of coronavirus.” She said we must learn to co-exist with the virus. “My responsibility is to protect you, your responsibility is to protect me and together we protect our country.” “Let’s learn to co-exist with this virus safely. Whether we are on an plane or in a taxi, shopping in an exclusive boutique or back home with our grandparents.” She added that people should take responsibility for their own behaviour by following these three precautions: “They should keep wearing a mask properly. The mask should cover your nose and mouth, avoid large indoor gatherings as ventilation is key and keep practicing social distancing,” she said. In addition to the three main precautions, she added that, “People should not forget to regularly wash their hands with soap and water and use sanitiser. Stay home when sick, and most importantly, companies must continue to take care of staff,” she said,
