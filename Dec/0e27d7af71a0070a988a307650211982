PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on the evening of Monday, 14 December on government’s response to the coronavirus second wave. This follows a special cabinet sitting, as well as the meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council, as the number of new cases and deaths continue to soar. The presidency hasn’t revealed the time of Ramaphosa’s address, but said it will be broadcast live on platforms that are accessible locally and internationally. The number of new cases has been hovering at about 8 000 a day, with many deaths across the country. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced the country was officially in the second wave, saying four provinces – Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng and KZN – were showing massive increases in new cases. It’s not clear whether Ramaphosa will reintroduce hard lockdown amid concerns that will further hurt the economy, which has already taken a hard beating during months of lockdown. However, there are concerns that people are not adhering to protocols, especially as the festive season is kicking in. Videos have been circulating on social media, showing people partying without wearing masks or practising social distancing. The business sector has appealed to the president not to impose a hard lockdown, but it’s likely Ramaphosa will introduce stricter regulations. Some reports suggest restrictions are set to be introduced at a localised level in the country’s coronavirus hot spots, as Ramaphosa did with the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality recently. It’s speculated stricter regulations might include curfew times, earlier closing times for restaurants, further limitations on gatherings such as funerals, and a likely ban on beaches.
