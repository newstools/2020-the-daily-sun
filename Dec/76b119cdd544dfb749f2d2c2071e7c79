FUNERAL parlours have warned Mzansi of a second Covid-19 wave. Owners of funeral parlours said people seem to have forgotten about Covid-19 and are spotted without masks and social distancing. Bishop Israel Makamu, a presenter on Moja Love’s Rea Tsotella and owner of Makamu Funerals, said: “I want to get out of the car and tell them I’ve just buried a person who had Covid. Maybe this could make them behave.” Makamu was referring to people he often seen not wearing masks and failing to keep a distance. Makamu, who said he’s had Covid-19 at one point, warned people to stay safe. “Wearing masks, sanitising and social distancing is the new normal,” he said. His parlour now treats all funerals as Covid-related because some results come back positive after the burial. Katlego Mokgadi of Baroka Funerals said they were already busy before the second wave. “But now we bury from Monday to Sunday,” said Mokgadi. “Our staff works longer hours and the running costs are getting higher as we need more PPEs. “Since November, funerals have doubled weekly.” She said some families don’t know much about regulations while some choose to ignore them. “People are dying. We need everyone to play their part in fighting the virus and in saving lives.” Executive chairman of the Funeral Industry Reformed Association, Johan Rousseau, told Daily Sun the water that’s used to clean corpses often goes down the drain. He said someone, as a result, will end up getting infected from it. “Inadequate infrastructure is also a problem, and laws in the funeral industry need to be implemented,” said Rousseau. He said only then will Mzansi see a difference.
