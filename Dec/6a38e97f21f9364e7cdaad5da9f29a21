THE office of the Bakubung Ba Ratheo kgosi has said no to the appointment of an administrator. The tribe leadership applied for a court interdict in the North West High Court to stop the process. This after the tribe in Ledig outside Rustenburg was put under administration by the provincial government. An administrator was appointed at the beginning of the month to deal with traditional council malfunctions. Kgosi spokesman, Disele Phologane, said correct processes needed to be followed before an administrator could be appointed. They believed the decision to put the traditional council under administration did not only violate the Constitution, but was also improper, invalid and inappropriate. “Act 41 of 2003 and Act 02 of 2005, as amended in the North West, clarify the reasons a premier can appoint an administrator. It states it’s his prerogative, but he does that after consultation. We were not consulted. “We are not saying no to the appointment of an administrator. We are saying the decision to bring an administrator to Ledig needs to be halted,” said Phologane. “Administrators to traditional council are like administrators to municipalities. Areas of weakness are identified and resolutions are identified to assist with that weakness. “We were told the administration is a result of a malfunctioning traditional council, when we have not had one since the inauguration of Kgosi Solomon Monnakgotla. “We have sent numerous communications to the premier requesting the process to elect the traditional council to begin, but we have received no response.” The village has had three administrators and Phologane claimed none of their reports were ever presented to the community or leadership. The appointment was made by cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Mmoloki Cwaile.
