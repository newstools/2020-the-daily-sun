ANGRY residents marched to the Rustenburg municipal offices yesterday to hand over a memorandum of demands. And roads were blocked throughout the day with the police monitoring the situation. A cop was seen attacking homeless people during the march and pointed a gun at three of them. Resident Jeff Putu said the mining industry in Rustenburg, North West, and government failed them for a long time. Jeff said Rustenburg local business owners were always sidelined and opportunities only benefitted outsiders. “We want the unfairness to stop. The municipality must give solutions to issues such as lack of service delivery and job creation. “Companies from other provinces must stop coming with their own workers while the people of Rustenburg are excluded,” Jeff said. He said the shutdown would continue until they were addressed and given solutions. Meanwhile, the residents in support of Rustenburg mayor Mpho Khunou blocked the protesting residents from handing over the memorandum. Municipal spokesman David Magae said the municipality noted messages circulating on social media calling for the “shutdown” of Rustenburg. He said the municipality would take action to defend all municipal assets. North West Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Mmoloki Cwaile signed the memorandum. He said they would engage with other stakeholders and find solutions to issues raised by the residents.
