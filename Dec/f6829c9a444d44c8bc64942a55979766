THE sky is the limit for former Isibaya and Imbewu actor, Mxolisi Zulu (34). Mxolisi is now behind the scenes, directing and casting. The KZN-born star is the brains behind the screenplay, Power of Genuine Love. The 31-episode drama series is aired on two TV channels, Mzansi Magic and 1KZN. “This is my first screenplay. The last episode will take place early next year,” he said. According to Mxolisi, the play was shot in September on location in Lovu and Umbumbulu, south of Durban. “The drama is about a young lady who has a child with an abusive South African man,” he said. “Eventually, they break up. The young woman finds love in the arms of a Nigerian man. “This causes tension in her family and in the community, who feel betrayed. “The relationship gets stronger, regardless. And they eventually get married. “Their wedding is a colourful celebration of South African and Nigerian cultures. And they live happilly ever after. “Local and tribal authorities use the occasion to teach their subjects about xenophobia.” According to Mxolisi, Power of Genuine Love is based on a true story. “I started writing the story in 2016 and finished it in 2018. I took breaks in-between as I was also doing other theatre work.” Otherwise I never experienced any challenges because the play is based on a true story coupled with my own observations. The cast comprises Nigerian producer, Mr Abubaka, Mondli Nkomo, Raymond Mkhize and Mr Mahlobo, among others. He said his aim was to address gender-based violence and xenophobia. “I believe I’ve told the story well,” he said.
