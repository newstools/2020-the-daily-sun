 AWARD-WINNING musician Candy Mokoena walked away with the Best Sepedi Kwaito Song award at the Sepedi Music Awards. The award ceremony was held in Polokwane, Limpopo last Friday. Candy, who is popularly known as Candy Tsamandebele, told Daily Sun she was late to the award ceremony because of a horrible accident she encountered on the way. “I was about to get on stage to perform when someone told me I had just won an award. I did not believe them until I saw the award with my name written on it,” she said. She said the award meant a lot to her. “It shows that I am still relevant after so many years in the music industry. It also encouraged me to keep working hard so that I can win more awards.

I was thanking my mum for that one time when I needed help during lockdown. “As we all know the pandemic is a global thing and it affected everyone, I was just sharing my story that it does not choose whether you’re a musician, actor or own a catering company.” She released a new album, Still Here, right before lockdown and shared that sales were good. Although Candy hasn’t received a call about the second season of the show Giyani: Land of Blood, which she was part of, she said she was excited about it. “I recently heard that the show is making a comeback, but I can’t confirm whether is true or not because I haven’t received the casting call. “If it’s true, I look forward to the second season as it was my first acting gig and it groomed me a lot,” she said.
