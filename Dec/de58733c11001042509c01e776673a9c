 Zimbabwean Praise singer and poet, Obert Dube, is Africa’s Best Pan African poet of the year. The announcement was made on Saturday at the 9th PANAFES Excellence Awards. The event was held in Cameroon at DK Hotel Douala. The poem that made him win is called, Africa and it talks about Africa conquering the world. “The poem addresses all African issues without fear or favour,” he said. “This is my biggest achievement and I am hoping to get even more awards. I am grateful to both the public and the judges. While I believe that anyone could’ve won I also believe that this award sets me apart from the rest. It means my work is starting to get recognised internationally which is what I’ve been praying for. I also believe that this is a start of greater things for me. I am therefore inspired to write and recite more poems,” he said. Obert described his poetry as a weapon of independence. “As a poet my role is to address issues as I see them. I define poetry as a form of entertainment and educating the Nation. For that reason I define my work as a tool to express issues that affect us as Africans and human race,” he said. He advised up-and-coming poets to be patient because “poetry is not an easy path, talent is only one part of the craft but one needs to be diligent and continuously work on the craft. Therefore, it is not for the faint hearted ones. My advise to the young poets is to be consistent and keep going until they make it,”
