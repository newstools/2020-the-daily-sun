THE Confederation of African Football (Caf) has made a raft of decisions in its executive meeting held in Cairo on Thursday. One of them was to remain at the Caf Super Cup in Doha, Qatar, next year February, instead of this year. The one-off event, which normally takes place at the home country of the Champions League winners, will see this year’s winners Al Ahly over face Confederation Cup winners RS Berkane of Morocco. This comes after Qatar signed an agreement to host the rights of the Super Cup in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The past two editions were held in Doha, with Raja Casablanca of Morocco and Zamalek winning the trophies respectively. However, the continent’s governing football body had announced earlier in November that the Super Cup would take place in Egypt instead of Qatar due to complications brought by Covid-19. But it was reported that Berkane refused that the game is held in Cairo (because Al Ahly are from there), asking for a neutral venue for the game. “Faced with the difficulty of finding an agreement with the Qatari Football Federation (QFA) for the organization of the 2019/2020 Super Cup, Al Ahly (Egypt) Vs. RS Berkane (Morocco), the Executive Committee decided that the Total CAF Super Cup will take place in the first half of 2021,” said Caf in a statement. Another decision CAF made was to open the bidding process for the Total CAF Champions League 2021, 2022, and 2023. The final of Total CAF Confederation Cup 2021, 2022, and 2023 and the 2021 Women's Champions League. The other competitions have already been allocated such as the 2021 AFCON (Cameroon), 2023 AFCON (Cote d’Ivoire), 2025 AFCON (Guinea), CHAN 2020 (Cameroon), CHAN 2022 (Algeria), U-17 AFCON 2021 (Morocco), U-20 AFCON 2021 (Mauritania). Caf is also finalising the appointment of their media liaison officer and SunSport has been informed that it’ll be a South African. However, this individual (his name known by SunSport), is set to be confirmed next week as he’s set to resign at his current organisation job.
