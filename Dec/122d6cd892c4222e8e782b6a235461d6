IN support of GBV victims, over 400 participants took part in a march against the abuse of women and children in Tshwane over the weekend. The marchers included People Opposing Women Abuse staff, abuse survivors, members of the public, as well as stakeholders from clinics, victim empowerment centres, women and children’s organisations, and other institutions POWA works with. The march was aimed at handing over a memorandum to Police Minister Bheki Cele at the Silverton Police Station, and proceed to the National Prosecuting Authority offices. POWA CEO Mary Makgaba said: “It really needs a collective effort and a holistic approach to deal with the scourge, and government alone cannot manage this second pandemic. Therefore, it’s important to join forces to achieve this goal.” She said the memorandum focuses on: Nomkhosi Xulu, a social worker at POWA’s Vosloorus office, said: “In some domestic violence cases, police tell survivor that it’s a family matter and that they should go home and sort it out.” Xulu said in some cases cops don’t take GBV cases seriously, claiming they could be GBV perpetrators themselves. Speaking at the handover of the memorandum, Cele highlighted the importance of families not forcing GBV survivors to withdraw cases. National director of public prosecutions, Advocate Shamila Batohi, told the marchers the NPA emphasises violence against women and children.
