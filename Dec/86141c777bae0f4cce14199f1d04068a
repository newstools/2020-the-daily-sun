AFTER a gruelling competition, the winner of Idols SA season sweet 16 was announced on Mzansi Magic. Zama Khumalo was crowned the winner on Sunday night. Zama, who was inspired by Idols SA season 14 winner Yanga Sobetwa to break out of her shell, walked away with a record deal from Kalawa Jazmee Records, R1 million rand in cash, a new Toyota Starlet 1.4 XR manual, Samsung products worth R150 000 and many more prizes. The 18-year-old from Witbank, Emalahleni in Mpumalanga, who auditioned in Joburg singing Best Part by H.E.R, said she wanted to go far and wanted to show the world her talent. She said nothing would make her happier than building a home for her parents. “It would bring me so much joy,” said Zama. “I would like to thank everyone who has been helping me by supporting and voting for me. You carried me through this journey,” she said. She was the first person to make judge Unathi cry in 2020 when she sang her heart out performing A Change is Gonna Come. Randall said she and the other finalist, Mr Music, both did well.  “You are still the same performer and if you can go this far, it means you can go beyond,” he said. Idols fans and supporters were treated to a spectacular final show. Opening the show was a performance by the Idols top 10 followed by Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode with their hit Xola Moya Wam’. The final two contestants performed alongside most loved Mzansi Gay Choir. Zama sang Sweet Dreams by Beyonce and Mr Music gave a rendition of Mbongeni Ngema’s Stimela sa se Zola. Somizi showed Mzansi he is one of the popular judges on Idols SA when he performed Ndizobizwa with his best friend, Vusi Nova.
