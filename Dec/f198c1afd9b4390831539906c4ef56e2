It’s the fourth year which Gugelethu backyarders have to spend their Christmas in Luyolo Community hall which they occupied in June 2017. A group of over 80 backyarders whose shacks were demolished occupied the hall in June 2017. Their shacks were demolished several times after they tried to rebuild them. Speaking to Sunteam on Christmas day, the group said they had to come together to make their big day come true as they have been doing in the past. “In the morning we wished one another Merry Christmas and then we prepared our breakfast. We are living as one huge family in this hall, those with bread bring it on the table. Others bring eggs, tomatoes, potatoes, anything that a person has then we cook and eat together,” said Nomaphelo Qunta (40).  She said as parents they had to sit their kids down and explain that there is no money to buy Christmas clothes for them. “They know the situation we are in, we explained to them but it is not nice for a parent to be explaining a lot to your children,” added Qunta. Mother of three Sindiswa Mninzi (34) said: “It’s not easy especially for our kids to see other kids having fun in new clothes when they are not. We made them understand and see the bigger picture of what we are fighting for. They are understanding and when things change we will make it up to them on these moments they are missing.”  When Sunteam arrived at the hall the group had just finished to eat Christmas breakfast and were planning for lunch. “The same way we did for breakfast is what we are going to do for lunch. Everyone will bring something on the table and then we decide, depending on what we have then we make our Christmas lunch,”  added Qunta.
