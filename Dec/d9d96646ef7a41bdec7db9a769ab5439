AS FORMER coach Pitso Mosimane would say, Mamelodi Sundowns fight against all odds. The Brazilians battled the odds to record an emphatic 2-0 league victory over TS Galaxy on Wednesday night. Sundowns played the match under a dark cloud as the team mourned the death of their key players, Motjeka Madisha, at the weekend. The 25-year-old from Tembisa reportedly died when the vehicle he was travelling in crashed into a steel pole in wet conditions and burst into flames near Kempton Park on Sunday morning. But the PSL could not accede to Sundowns' request for a postponement of their fixture against TS Galaxy. Madishaâ€™s death came just weeks after Sundowns lost another player Anele Ngcongca who also died in a horrific car accident. Goals from Peter Shalulile in the 32nd minute and Themba Zwane in the 76 minutes, ensured Downs get maximum points to honour Madisha and maintained their place at the top of the Premiership standings with 17 points after seven league matches. Sundowns bench was without coach Manqoba Mngqithi who was sent out in their last league match against Maritzburg United. Rhulani Mokoena was also not on the bench, Steve Komphela was running solo. Also in the line-up, The Brazilians made two changes from their draw with Maritzburg, as George Maluleka and Haashim Domingo got rare starts while the Rockets recalled Luckyboy Mokoena and Mlungisi Mbunjana.
