It has been reported that Moruti “Baby Face” Mthalane’s IBF flyweight title defence against his mandatory challenger Filipino Jayson “Smasher” Mama, scheduled to take place in Durban on Sunday has been cancelled. The Mama camp is already in the country. According to reports, the promoter of Tono Boxing Promotions, Nokwanda Mbatha, was unable to come up with required money for the tournament and Boxing SA had no option but to cancel the tournament. This is a tragedy for Mthalane who has spent two to three months preparing for the fight. This would have been the 38-year-old Mthalane’s fourth defence against the 23-year-old undefeated Mama who has 15 wins on his record. Mthalane (39-2; 26) has been fighting as a pro for close to 20 years and is considered unique, as it is against the odds that a flyweight can still be a world champion at well past 30 years old and winning against the top challengers in his division. In an illustrious career, Mthalane has won the South African, WBC International, IBF International, IBO and the IBF flyweight titles. He has won the IBF title on two occasions. The champion, who lives in Lindelani, Durban, would have been having his first fight in five years in his hometown. Nkululeko “Bull Dog” Mhlongo was scheduled to defend his WBA Pan African middleweight title against Walter “Black Mamba” Dlamini in the main supporting bout. WBO MINIMUMWEIGHT TITLE FIGHT ALSO POSTPONED The WBO minimumweight title fights scheduled to take place on Wednesday night between Wilfred “Bimbito” Mendez and challenger Alexis Diaz scheduled to take place on Wednesday night at the Hotel Catalonia Malecon Center in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was cancelled after Mendez became ill. -SuperSport.com
