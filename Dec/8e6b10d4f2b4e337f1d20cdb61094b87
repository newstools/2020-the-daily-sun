FORMER Big Brother auditor Steve Mabusela from Atteridgeville. Tshwane, has found his real calling in music. Last month, he released his third single called Bass Destroyer. The beat and production of this track was made by Kamogelo Phetla, famously known as Vigro Deep. Steve said the amapiano single is bound to take the music to another level. “For this reason I see myself as the real king of amapiano. By this I mean, everybody must step aside and make way for the king of amapiano. I’m confident like that. “I am about to change the tone of amapiano,” he told SunBuzz.

For the past few years I’ve been wanting to do music, but I had to wait for the right time. “This year I felt the urge to embark on my music career. I know I made the right choice because people are loving my song.” His exposure to various gigs made him fall in love with music. “My love of music actually started in 2014 when I was working as a competition verification and voting auditor at Mzansi Magic’s Big Brother season two. “This experience opened doors for me as I later became an auditor for Big Brother Xtremo (Namibia and Mozambique), Big Brother Nigeria season one and two, Clash of the Choirs season two, Vodacom Soccer Campaign season one and Vodacom NXL Level talent search season one. In 2016, I formally became a musician,” he said. Steve said it was mainly his involvement with Clash of the Choirs that motivated him to do music. “It was also at this point that I pursued a role in talent management as co-owner and partner at Digital Money. But it wasn’t long before I established my own company called Stev’La Productions.”
