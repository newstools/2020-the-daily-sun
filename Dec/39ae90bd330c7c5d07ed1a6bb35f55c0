JACOB Mamabolo has warned taxi associations intimidating and forcibly taking money from the public that they will be permanently closed if they continue. The Gauteng transport MEC issued the warning after a number of reports surfaced that taxi operators were removing people from private cars and demanding money. Mamabolo was addressing the Gauteng National Taxi Alliance as part of the department’s festive season road safety campaign in Hammanskraal, Tshwane on Tuesday. He also visited Bosman Station in Tshwane and Park Station in Joburg. “This follows the increasing number of complaints from people against taxi associations who continue to intimidate, rob and harass private operators and the public,” he said. “Taxi associations operating as paramilitary forces and taking the law into their own hands will face permanent closure and members will be barred from operating or forming a new association. “This practice is totally criminal and can’t be accepted. Once proven in the court of law that an association has been involved in these criminal activities, we will not hesitate to deregister and blacklist it from operating permanently.” Mamabolo said the taxi industry had gone overboard with its culture of violence. “We will not allow the industry to operate through armed gangs feeding criminally from the public,” he said. “We encourage the taxi industry to report incidents where people are found to be transporting commuters for cash without permits,” he said. He called on cops to protect people who open cases and to swiftly bring culprits to book. Sizani Mahlangu, a leader in the taxi industry in Tshwane, said they were working with cops and making sure vehicles were roadworthy and complying with Covid-19 regulations.
