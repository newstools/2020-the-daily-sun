THE race for the CEO position is currently underway at Safa House, south of Joburg. As many as five candidates, namely Mzwandile Maforvane, Mxolisi Sibam, Lydia Monyepao, Happy Ntshingila and Tebogo Matlanthe are going through the grill for the plum chief executive job. Maforvane, the incumbent Safa general manager, is the first in the list of interviewees while Motlanthe, who has been acting in the position for six months now, will be the last in the row. ”The NEC shortlisted five people for the CEO position. The five will be interviewed by an independent panel,” Motlanthe said weeks ago. The independent panel will hand the results to the football association to announce the successful candidate.
