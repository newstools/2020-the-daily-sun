HUNDREDS of residents came to bid farewell to former Bafana Bafana star Anele Ngcongca at JL Zwane Memorial Church in Cape Town Thursday. The funeral was attended by former Bafana Bafana players and Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa. Residents and Mamelodi Sundowns supporters sang, danced and jostled each other when they saw the hearse carrying Anele’s body on its way to the Maitland Cemetery. Anele’s sister, Nomonde Tshaka, said the quiet and peaceful little boy didn’t change when he grew up. “He remained the quiet, humble and respectful person.” She said his great passion was always soccer.  “You had to wake him up to go to school, but he was always awake for soccer training. We even hid his soccer boots so he would go to school, but he would wear takkies and still go play. In a message read by a family member, Anele’s mother, Nomahamba Magadlela, said: “I never thought this day would come, but here I am my child. “You always said God had a plan and we have to accept that.” In a message read in church, Anele’s daughter Siphosethu said: “The time we spent together means so much to me. “You shared your dreams with me and nobody understood why.” Mthethwa said they were meeting not only as the sporting fraternity of South Africa, but of the world. He said Anele was described by his peers as a gentle giant of the sport.  “He was described as a person full of the love of life,” said Mthethwa. Bafana star and friend, Thobela Bikwani, said Anele was one of the most dedicated players he ever knew. “He knew what he wanted in life. When he became a professional it was not a mistake. I knew that from the very first time he went to Arsenal for trials.” Gugulethu resident Mzimasi Mgwebi (44) said Anele put their kasi on the map. “I was proud of him every time he played especially for the national team. I told people this was my neighbour. “He made us proud and we will miss him,” he said.
