TRAIN services were suspended in Cape Town after a positive Covid-19 case was confirmed at the regional train traffic control and management centre. Commuters who were already waiting for trains on Monday, 28 December had to find alternative transport and many had to return home to fetch money. Metrorail said: “The suspension is necessary to permit the deep cleaning and sanitisation of the centre. “This is a precautionary step to protect staff and ensure the continuity of train services in the coming days. “Train services are expected to resume on Tuesday, 29 December.” A number of commuters were left stranded with no money for a taxi. Ngoni Mawere from Monte Visa in Cape Town told Daily Sun: “I had to ask my sister for money. I only had a train ticket. The suspension of trains caught me off-guard.” Sizwe Mguldwa (33), a security guard at Century City, was waiting at Belville Station for two hours before he heard the news. “I had to call my boss to say I was running late. At first I thought it was just a delay and the train would eventually come,” he said. According to the Western Cape Covid-19 dashboard, the province has 37 726 active cases, with 2 624 new ones having been registered over the weekend. Premier Alan Winde said the number of people infected in the second wave had overtaken the first one. “During this second wave, the Western Cape is seeing unprecedented high numbers of Covid-19 deaths,” he said. “During this holiday period, many families are mourning the deaths of the thousands of people who’ve died from Covid-19 in the past two weeks. “This is yet another reminder to our residents that Covid-19 is not on holiday, it is still here, and it still kills. We need to protect each other wherever we are by adhering to safe behaviour.”
