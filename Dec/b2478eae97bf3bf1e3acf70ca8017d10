Late former Genk defender Anele Ngcongca was honoured by the Belgium club at the weekend. Ngcongca, who passed away in a car accident two weeks ago, played over 200 appearances for Genk in a career spanning nine years. Players bowed their heads as a minute of silence was observed to remember Ngcongca prior to Genk’s home game against Antwerp. Without the fans, as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, a smattering of club personnel and both sets of players watched as the huge banner reading ”Forever our number 16” was unfurled. His career highlights reel was played in a video screen while a huge banner boring Ngcongca’s image was displayed in the centre of the pitch. Added to that, Genk will be retiring jersey no 16 in tribute to the Gugulethu-born club legend. Ngcongca’s spirit was very much alive inside the Cristal Arena as Genk went on to beat Antwerp 4-2 to go to of the Belgian Pro League. In the French Ligue 1, Keagan Dolly came on for Montpellier in the 63rd minute, but couldn't influence play in their favour as they went down 3-1 to log leaders PSG. Elsewhere, Bongani Zungu was a second half substitute as Glasgow Rangers thrashed Ross County 4-0 in the Scottish Premiership. Zungu is yet to start a league match for Steven Gerrard’s team, however, is yet to lose a match in the two he has featured in so far. Luther Singh could not add to his solitary for Paco Ferreira this season as his side lost 2-1 to Benfica in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. The Bafana Bafana striker has so far played in all the nine league matches, but has battled to find the back of the net with regularity. Meanwhile, Percy Tau has joined Lebo Mothiba and Lyle Foster in the injury list. The quicksilver Anderletch midfielder sustained a muscle injury in training and could not feature in the last two games, and he could be out until early next year.
