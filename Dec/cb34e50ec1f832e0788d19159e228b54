A FRUSTRATED wife hates the festive season. This is because a sexy tokoloshe in red shoes and a blue strip dress sleeps with her husband the whole night. She said this has been happening for three years and she has had enough. She said the tokoloshe came every festive season from mid December and left in the first week of January. The 38-year-old woman, who is a domestic worker, said the tokoloshe returned on Friday. She said at night her husband was moaning and moving like he was having sex and in the morning his pyjamas had semen. “The return of this creature is ruining my marriage because whenever it arrives, my husband can’t even poke me because he is tired,” she said. She said she thought her husband cheated on her as he always gave excuses for not wanting to poke her. He then came clean and told her a tokoloshe had sex with him every night. “It was hard to believe, but he showed me the sperm in the morning,” said the woman. She they performed some rituals around the yard hoping to get rid of the tokoloshe, but nothing helped. She said they even put coarse salt on their bed, but it still wouldn’t go away. “We went to a sangoma but she couldn’t help. She gave us muthi to bath with and sprinkle around the yard. We thought it would stop, but it was just getting started,” she said. The husband, who is a security guard in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni said he was scared he might lose his wife. “I know she understands, but I’m afraid she’ll get tired and leave me. I urgently need help.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said it won’t be a problem to get rid of the tokoloshe as he’s dealt with this kind of tokoloshe before. “They are seasonal. Some of them terrorise couples on their anniversaries. We’ll get rid of it in no time.”
