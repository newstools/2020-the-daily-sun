WHILE this will be the first time Angolan side Primero De Agosto meet Kaizer Chiefs in the Caf Champions League first round first leg when these two sides clash at FNB Stadium on Wednesday evening (6pm), the club is not a closed book to Amakhosi coach Gavin Hunt. Hunt faced the same opposition when he was in charge of Bidvest Wits in the same competition in March 2018. On that occasion, Wits lost 3-2 on penalties after the game finished 1-1 on aggregate score. Hunt watched the game in horror at Bidvest Stadium as then his experienced attackers such as Lehlohonolo Majoro, Elias Pelembe and Daine Klate misses proved too costly to be knocked out. Interestingly, it was also in the first round of the CAF Champions League before reaching the group phase. Chiefs, who have never reached the group stages in the history before, reached this stage of the competition after beating Cameroon champions PWD Bamenda 1-0 on aggregate score in the preliminary round. For Agosto, they received a bye to come to this stage With this game being the home match for Chiefs and their 30th game in the competition having lost twice at home, Amakhosi will be expected to build a healthy lead and follow Mamelodi Sundowns who won 2-0 in their game against Jwaneng Galaxy of Botswana yesterday. Agosto have also not played since 14 March when they beat Bravos Do Marquis in Girobola League match and they have got fitness issues coming to this game. Not only that they have not played since then, their record in the Champions League in their last matches doesn’t look good either. In their last seven games in Africa’s premier’s club competition, they have lost three and drew four.
