THE City of Joburg has expressed concern regarding the rise in the number of vandalism cases. The mayor’s spokesman, Rich Hlatshwayo, said such acts are not only illegal but hamper service delivery and cost millions in repairs and maintenance. MMC for public safety, Mally Mokoena, said the department’s aim was to ensure the city’s infrastructure and facilities were safe and secure and easily accessible to the residents and it’s important to report all acts of wrongdoing. “We’re committed to ensuring residents enjoy excellent services through these facilities,” she said. Mokoena said the facilities belong to residents and urged them to be vigilant and guard against criminality and vandalism. “We ask residents to work together with local government in making this commitment a reality.” MMC for community development, Margaret Arnolds, said such crime denies communities a chance to enjoy art galleries, libraries, museums, recreation centres, parks, swimming pools, theatres, zoos and sports facilities. Arnolds told Daily Sun: “So far we’ve seen an increase in damaged amenities, increased insurance claims, and endless repairs which take us backward and waste taxpayers’ money.” She called on residents to look after council infrastructure. “Let’s adopt public facilities and become friends of these facilities for the benefit of our children’s development,” she said.
