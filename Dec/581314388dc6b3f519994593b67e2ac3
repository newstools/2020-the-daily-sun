THE Hawks arrested more suspects yesterday in Joburg over the controversial Talana shacks temporary unit project fraud. The four members of the bid evaluation committee from Housing Development Agency will appear in the Tzaneen Magistrates Court on Monday. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said the suspects allegedly vouched for Aventino Group CC company to construct the housing units without thoroughly checking the validity of the documents that were submitted. “It is further alleged the temporary housing units do not adhere to the design and specifications,” said Maluleke. On Thursday Raymond Maoto (35), a project manager from the Housing Development Agency and Constance Mohlala (44), a director of Aventino Group CC company were arrested in Polokwane and have since appeared in the Tzaneen Magistrates Court. The two were remanded in custody until Tuesday, 22 December for a formal bail application. Forty shacks were officially handed over to destitute families by Premier Stanley Mathabatha accompanied by MEC Basikopo Makamu for the Department of Human Settlement in August this year.
