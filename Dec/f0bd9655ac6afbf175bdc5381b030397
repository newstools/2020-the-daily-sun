WHEN Nhlanhla ran out of money to try and fund his girlfriend’s lifestyle, she went behind his back to borrow money. Now the mashonisas knock on his door almost every day to demand their money. “My ex-girlfriend loves money,” said Nhlanhla Nxumalo (47) from Borwa in Westonaria, Gauteng. “I’m self-employed but whatever I bring home is not enough for her. Now I’m faced with paying money which didn’t even benefit me.” Nhlanhla said some of the mashonisas demanded thousands from him but he told them they must deal with his now ex-girlfriend, Nokubonga Kwetshube (40). “I don’t know how much she took from them. People knock on my door demanding money and threatening to take my belongings,” he said. “I couldn’t go on with her because she’s putting my life in danger.” He said Nokubonga has since run away leaving him with her problems. Nhlanhla said he has since found a new woman, but the ex-girlfriend was threatening him. “I’m living in fear,” he said. “She came here last month and broke the windows of my house and scratched my car with a knife.” Nhlanhla has applied for a protection order against her. The girlfriend was arrested but released on a warning last week, but he said she was still harassing him. “I just want her to leave me in peace. She’s nothing but trouble,” he said. Nhlanhla said Nokubonga also has a gambling problem. “She refused to go for counselling and became violent. She doesn’t want to admit she has a problem.” Nokubonga admitted to Daily Sun she borrowed money from mashonisa, but denied being a manipulator. Audrey Sefara, spokesman for Westonaria police, advised Nhlanhla to come to the police station to report Nokubonga if she was still harassing him.
