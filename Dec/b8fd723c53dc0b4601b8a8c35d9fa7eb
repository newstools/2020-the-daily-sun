Two 
Limpopo Home Affairs officials have been arrested for allegedly 
soliciting thousands of rands from a man who needed assistance with his 
documents. Vuyeya Rikhotso, 41, and Patricia Mgimeti, 44, 
appeared in the Tzaneen Magistrate's Court on Thursday where they face 
corruption charges after they allegedly continuously asked for cash from
 a foreign national in exchange for help with documents. "It is 
alleged that the duo constantly demanded money, which now reportedly 
runs into several thousands of rands, from this foreign national every 
time he wanted his documents fixed. He then apparently became tired and 
decided to report the two officials," said police spokesperson, 
Lieutenant Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi. Rikhotso and Mgimeti were expected back in court on 29 December. News24
