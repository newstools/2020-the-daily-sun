The Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services has confirmed that the extradition request for Mr and Mrs Bushiri has been duly served. This was done in terms of Article 6 of the SADC Protocol on extradition as well Article 10 of the Extradition Agreement Between the Government of Malawi and Republic of South Africa entered in terms of the Republic of South Africa Extradition Act No 67 of 1962 as amended. Self-proclaimed Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary fled the country to their native country Malawi, three weeks ago after being released on R200 000 bail each. The department said, as previously indicated, the law provides for this extradition request to be submitted within 30 days. However, this extradition request is been brought within a period of two weeks. It said the submission follows a request for a provisional arrest, which was sent through the International Criminal Police Organisation in terms of Article 10 of the SADC Protocol. Minister Ronald Lamola said they noted that this had been appealed by the fugitives. He said they were closely monitoring appeal processes by the Malawian authorities. “Given our sound and healthy diplomatic, strategic and political relationship, and our common citizenship of the SADC community, we are convinced that the Republic of Malawi will honour the letter and spirit of every provision of their international and regional obligations,” he said.
