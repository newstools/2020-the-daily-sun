KING Goodwill Zwelithini’s son, Prince Lethukuthula Zulu, allegedly died after a wild night of booze, sex and drugs. According to four accused in the Randburg Magistrates Court yesterday, Zulu and a friend bought drugs before they took the women to his place at Graceland Residential Complex in Northwold on 6 November from a News Cafe in Randburg. This was according to the accused Tshegofatso Moremane (30), Margaret Koaile (42), Portia Mmola (28), Gontshe Tlholoe (30) and Dakalo Mbedzi (32), who appeared in court in connection with Zulu’s murder. Through an affidavit read by the defence, Moremane said they were at the News Cafe when the deceased and a friend sent a waiter with beers to their table. They joined the prince at his table at his invitation. “The deceased told me he was interested in me. When the bill came the prince’s friend left with Margaret to collect money.” Tshegofatso’s affidavit revealed she was going to sexually entertain the deceased. “Me and the deceased disappeared into the bedroom but the door lock didn’t work.” The prince went to the toilet, and at one point he had white stuff on his nose, she said. “I told him and he said I must relax. I suspected he was sniffing drugs but didn’t see him doing it. “Gontshe joined us in the bedroom and oral sex occurred,” she said. Portia said while driving with the friend to get money, he was phoning someone and ordering drugs.
