PETER Shalulile loves scoring goals! Last season's joint-top goalscorer is continuing where he left off. Just before the beginning of the season, the Namibian forward left Highlands Park to join Mamelodi Sundowns. We have seen some players struggle a bit when they join new clubs but that was not the case with Shalulile as he managed to hit the ground running. He scored on his Sundowns debut when they defeated Kaizer Chiefs 3-0 in a DStv Premiership encounter. On Tuesday, Shalulile continued with his dream start. He made his debut in the Caf Champions League and scored when his side claimed a comfortable 2-0 victory in the first leg of their first round clash away at Botswana’s Jwaneng Galaxy. The goals saw the Namibian’s tally reach five goals in 10 starts since he joined the galaxy of stars at Sundowns. “It is things that I do in training, to keep on hunting (for goals) and they will come…and they are coming,” Shalulile told the club’s website. “I will keep on pushing for many more goals, but I must also say thank you to my teammates as they are the ones who believe in me. I'll keep on banging them in! “You have to have in your mind all the time that the goal will come. I anticipated the ball coming (to me) and I just put it into the back of the net.” Shalulile admitted that it was not an easy game, and the pitch was not up to standard as they struggled to play their normal game. He stated: “It wasn't an easy game, the pitch did not allow us to play our football, but we ground out the result and got the goals. “I am happy for my team and credit goes to the technical team. They believed in us and kept on pushing us.” Sundowns are seeking to make the group stages of the Champions League for the sixth season in a row. They will now host the Botswana club on 5-6 January. But before that, they have a crunch Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates on 2 January.
