THE dream lives on for Pitso "Jingles" Mosimane. In hardly two months, the Al Ahly coach could put to the table three trophies. Reaching the Egyptian Super Cup final on Tuesday is a feat that will score points for the 56-year-old having secured the Caf Champions League and the Egyptian Premier League. The experiences of his assistant Cavin Johnson is also rubbing off nicely for Mosimane who has been a strategist since his days at Mamelodi Sundowns. The Red Eagles reached the Egyptian Cup final with a 2-1 win against Al Ittihad to secure a final date against some little known Al Gaish on Saturday. Mosimane's team will return to the training grounds on Thursday as they prepare to complete what has been a great two months. Al Ahly’s Director of Football Sayed Abdelhafiz said their players fought hard for their win. "And this is despite conceding a goal," he said. "They dominated the game in the second half and stuck instructions. Talae’a El Gaish is a very tough opponent and succeeded in reaching this final because they have the great coaching staff headed by coach Tarek El Ashry. But we'll be fully prepared for this final.” He said Al Ahly’s spirit is driven by winning and they not show any mercy even on Saturday. “We have great ambitions to win the tournament, as we haven't won it for a while. But we want to clinch the title to please our beloved fans,” Abdelhafiz. Mosimane's other assistant, Samy Qomsan, reckons they deserved to be in the Cup final. “We've won this game despite the exhaustion from our game against Zamalek in the CAF Champions League final. They all showed a great spirit," Qomsan said. “Al Ahly’s President Captain Mahmoud El Khatib motivated the team after winning the African title, and stressed the importance of winning the Egyptian Cup and this encouraged us more to win.
