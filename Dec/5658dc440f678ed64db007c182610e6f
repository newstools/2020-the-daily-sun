Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have agreed to postpone the remaining matches in the current One-Day International (ODI) Series. The decision was taken jointly by the two Boards to ensure the mental and physical health and welfare of players from both teams. CSA and the ECB will now work together to determine when the three-match series, which forms part of the ICC Cricket Men’s Super League, can take place in the future. “The concern over the mental health impact of recent events on all involved is not one that we as CSA or the ECB take lightly and the decision to postpone the tour is the most responsible and reasonable course of action for us,” said acting CSA CEO Kugandrie Govender. “I would like to thank the ECB for the continued positive relations, and we look forward to hosting the England team soon.” Her ECB counterpart, Tom Harrison, said: ”We have always maintained that the welfare of our players and management is paramount. ”We were concerned about the potential impact that recent developments might have on the wellbeing of the touring party, and so after consultation with Cricket South Africa, we have jointly decided to postpone the remaining matches in this Series, in the best interest of the players’ welfare.
