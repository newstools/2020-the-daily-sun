The uMhlathuze Municipality urges residents and those who may know Mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo not to accept a Facebook invitation from him. This is because some people have opened a fake account using his name. The account’s profile picture, depicting Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli and the city’s municipal manager Lulamile Mapholoba as well as an inserted picture of Mhlongo conducting an interview, is fake. Municipal spokesman Mdu Ncalane said all the pictures used were downloaded from the municipality’s Facebook account and are not related to what is captioned under them on the fake account. He said they saw the account on Friday, 18 December, but they don’t know when it was created and how long it’s existed. “It has come to the attention of the mayor that the perpetrator is inviting friends claiming to be him. On one of the fake posts, he has called for 200 people with knowledge of electricity to apply for jobs. Another posts calls on 200 youths to inbox the account holder,” said Ncalane. He said Mhlongo doesn’t have any official social media accounts as the mayor. His only Facebook page is under his personal profile. “The city believes the hackers intend to tarnish the image of Mayor Mhlongo and defraud people,” said Ncalane.
