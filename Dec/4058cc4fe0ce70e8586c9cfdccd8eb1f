ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has explained the absence of club captain Happy Jele. The veteran defender has not played since early November when Pirates defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in a DStv Premiership clash. He has spent more time on the bench since the 2020-21 season started. However, his absence from their last two matches, the MTN8 final and league match against Chippa United which they won 2-1 and 1-0 respectively has raised eyebrows. His absence from the pre-final press conference was explained to have been due to illness, while coach Zinnbauer also wished him a speedy recovery after clinching the MTN8 title at Moses Mabhida Stadium last Saturday. On Wednesday he was again not part of the match day squad. When asked about his absence after the Chippa game, coach Zinnbauer said: “Happy was sick, I hope he comes back quick we need a defender. We need him as a captain, as a leader. “I'm no doctor. I have contact with him but I don't ask him what's happened. He said to me, he's sick. He was in a training session and he came and said, 'Coach, I'm not feeling good’. “I said, 'Go to the doctor', and the doctor said he has to go home, and then the next day he was sick. I don't know, I don't have 100 per cent of the information, but I think it's normal flu that he has.” @Mthokoziisi
