DESPITE age not being on his side, veteran defender Wayne Arendse says he can still play for a few more seasons in top flight football. Arendse (35) was released by Mamelodi Sundowns alongside Anthony Laffor a few days ago after eight seasons with the Tshwane giants. This didn’t come as a surprise as he and Laffor had not played a single match this season. Downs trio of coaches – Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela – felt it was time for him to go. But Arendse is not thinking of calling it quits yet. The former Santos defender has an impressive collection of gold medals, having won the league title five times, two Nedbank Cups, two Telkom Knockout trophies, the Caf Champions League and Caf Super Cup – all at Sundowns. The Cape Town-born defender said his motivation to carry on playing is to win the only domestic trophy that has eluded him – the MTN8. “I still feel there’re a few seasons left in me,” said Arendse. “I still want to play because there’s one trophy that’s missing in my cabinet and that’s the MTN8 and I’d love to clinch that one. “So, I’m still looking for a team. I’m still available and hoping to win some silverware and hopefully that’ll be the MTN8.” Arendse said he was proud of the contribution he made while he was wuth the Tshwane giants, that he joined at the beginning of 2012-13 season after Santos were relegated. He said playing in the Fifa Club World Cup in 2016 was his biggest career highlight. “How they organised everything and how smoothly it was run (was amazing).” The major disappointment for Arendse was missing the second leg of the Champions League final against Zamalek in Egypt after he was booked in the first leg in Pretoria. “But I’m happy I played in front of my own supporters (in the first leg). For me, that was the ultimate game because we scored three goals. I knew that, with a 3-0 lead going to Egypt, we had it in the bag,” he said.
