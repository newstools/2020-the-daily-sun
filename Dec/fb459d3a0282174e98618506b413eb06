POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has welcomed the arrest of a cop who was allegedly drunk on duty and driving a police vehicle. “The officer clearly decided to swap his blue uniform for an orange one the minute he reported to work while drunk,” said the minister. The cop was allegedly involved in a crash and had a fist fight with a motorist in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. A video was seen on social media of the cop in full uniform confronting a taxi driver and engaging in a violent altercation. Cele said: “You simply can’t have a police officer behaving like this without there being consequences.” The 33-year-old constable has been arrested and charged with driving under the influence as well as reckless and negligent driving. Cele has called on internal disciplinary processes against this member and all other police officers who go against their oath and constitutional mandate. Resident Zimbini Somhlahlo (45) said the taxi driver was provoked. “I don’t know what started the fight after the accident, but we all saws the police officer getting out of his car. The cop threw the first punch,” said Zimbini. “This cop showed his true colours. I don’t agree with those who say cops are under stress. We are all stressed. “He simply showed that they are lawbreakers.”
