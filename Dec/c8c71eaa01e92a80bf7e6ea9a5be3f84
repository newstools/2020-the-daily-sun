Christmas day is like any other day for the Ngxaza family from Philippi Brown’s farm. The family told Daily Sun they cannot afford to have a fancy meal different from what they eat every day. As for Christmas clothes for the children, gogo Nozukho Ngxaza (67) said her grandchildren are used to it. “I always tell them not to look at the clothes of other kids, and they understand that. For the past few years, they had grown to know that they do not get Christmas clothes so they have stopped asking and they don’t expect any new clothes,” she said. The family survive on grants and gogo’s son who brings an extra income works at a saloon where he does dreadlocks. “It depends on the days, sometimes he makes money but there are days he gets nothing. We have accepted our situation, I hope when my children get jobs the situation will change,” she added.  Gogo said the last time she had a special Christmas was over a decade ago when her husband was still alive. Ayakheka Ngxaza (10) told: “I do not have new clothes for Christmas but I will be at home with my family.” Athenkosi Ngxaza(17) the eldest grandchildren for gogo Nozukho said he understands that gogo and her mother do not have money. “When I finish studying and get a job I will make it up for my family for all these Christmas we spent without any different meal and clothes. Gogo always tells us to ignore those wearing fancy clothes and always remember our own situation at home,” said Athenkosi.
