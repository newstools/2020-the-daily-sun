DSTV Premiership early pace-setters Mamelodi Sundowns will have their unbeaten run tested on Saturday night when they face desperate Maritzburg United. The encounter is set to take place at Harry Gwala Stadium at 8:15 pm. Sundowns are leading the table standings with 13 points after five matches. Their counterparts Maritzburg are languishing at the foot of the table without a point having lost all their five matches. Sundowns will be tested as the Team of Choice are desparate for points and they will be under the new guidance of Ernst Middendorp who returned to the club for the fourth time replacing Eric Tinkler. According to Maritzburg assistant coach Delron Buckley, they are determined to get something out of this fixture, the arrival of a new coach has boosted players' morale. “The moral of the players have picked up and the players' response has been very good - as you know with coach Middendorp doesn’t beat around the bush,” Buckley said. "He wants players that want to work for him, he wants players that can do the job for him. If you are taking things easy at training he will let you know you are not in a comfortable position. You have got to work for your position no matter which player it is. Buckley continued: "It opened up the players’ eyes, they realise that we have to work hard. Training sessions this week were tight, getting the players to get stuck into tackles, duels, the players having to play out of tight positions. “And the players responded well to that, you could see also the fitness picking up, which is very good for us. “Coach Middendorp has his ideas, systems and his concepts on how he wants to present the team against Sundowns which I think is going to be appropriate for us.”
