A LIMPOPO sangoma has been arrested at his girlfriend’s home. This after a shoot-out with the police as he apparently tried to evade arrest. A 63-year-old sangoma was with another suspect when the police arrived at his house in Madimbo Village, outside Musina, Limpopo where he allegedly produced a machine gun and started shooting towards the police. Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Mamphaswa Seabi said the police were conducting the festive season joint operations in the Vhembe District, when the received information about illegal firearms at the sangoma’s house.  “The suspect managed to run away after a shoot-out with the police. No one was injured and a case of attempted murder was opened at Tshamutumbu Police Station. The suspect was subsequently traced and arrested at his girlfriend’s house in the same village. Further investigation led the team back to his home where he had hidden the firearm that was allegedly used during the shoot-out with the police. Upon arrival, a 9mm pistol with 9 live ammunition was recovered. The suspect was arrested on the spot for possession of illegal firearm and ammunition. We have further recovered one rifle and 21 live ammunition at Madimbo Village, hidden by the same suspect,” said Seabi. He said the suspect is still being profiled and the recovered firearms will also be sent for ballistic tests to ascertain whether they were used in the commission of other crimes. The suspects will appear in Tshamutumbu and Masisi magistrates court soon on charges of attempted murder and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition respectively. Police investigations are still continuing.
