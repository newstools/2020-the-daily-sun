A 25-YEAR-OLD woman is seeking justice following a horrible rape ordeal. She’d just dozed off in the room which she shares with her mum in Greytown, KZN Midlands, when she heard banging on their door. “I didn’t think much of it. We’re used to having visitors,” she saidrecently. “When the door was forcibly opened I realised something bad was about to happen. “Two men barged in and demanded phones and money. One had a gun and the other had a knife. “One stood by the door and the other walked in and raped me in front of my mum. I know my rapist. He’s a local.” The woman said a detective refused to give her feedback. “The last time I spoke to him all he was willing to say was that the case had been finalised,” she said. She said she was raped last month. Captain Nqobile Gwala said the Greytown family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit is investigating. “A 25-year-old suspect was arrested and charged with rape,” said Gwala. “He appeared in the Greytown Magistrates Court on 25 November and was remanded in custody. The next court date is 26 January.”
