PITSO Mosimane seems to gain more critics as much as fans with each success he achieves. No sooner had Mosimane guided Al Ahly to a 4-0 win against Ittihad than Egypt legend Ibrahim Hassan belittled him. Mosimane has enjoyed success since joining Al Ahly, yet to lose a game in 14 matches. But Hassan, Ittihad’s assistant coach, viewed the result differently and had some unflattering words to say post the 4-0 thumping, suggesting anyone would win trophies as Al Ahly head coach. “If Hareth (Al Ahly’s kit man) took charge of Al Ahly, he will win trophies, ” said Hassan. “If we (Hossam and Ibrahim Hassan) took charge of Al Ahly we will win trophies. If Pitso coached any other team in the league, he will get sacked after two games. “Al Ahly wasn’t good against us in the Egypt Cup nor their last games nor the CAF Champions League.” It wasn't the first time Ibrahim Hassan has been critical of Mosimane, having shared similar comments, following their Egypt Cup defeat against Ahly earlier this month.
