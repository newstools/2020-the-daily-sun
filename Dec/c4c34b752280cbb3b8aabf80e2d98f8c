BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga says more needs to be done in her sector. The department, along with the Human Sciences Research Council, released the Trends in International Mathematics and Science study report at her office in Tshwane yesterday. Deputy Minister Reginah Mhaule said the country participated in the study to find ways to upgrade education and not to compare itself with other countries. She said South Africa was one of two countries on the continent that took part. According to the report, 64 countries took part in the grade 4/5 study while 46 took part in the grade 8/9 study. The report found that in grade 5 and grade 9, girls outperformed boys in maths. For the grade 4/5 study, South African pupils scored 374 for maths and 324 for science, below the basic threshold of 400 which showed understanding of the subjects. The report found that only 37% of South African pupils demonstrated they had basic maths knowledge and only 28% had basic science knowledge. According to the department, this meant 64% of pupils had not acquired basic mathematical knowledge and 72% had not acquired basic science knowledge. The department said the explanation for the poor results could be that conditions in homes continued to be unequal, with some homes not being places where pupils could study comfortably. It stated that pupils from homes lacking basic amenities such as running tap water and flush toilets had the lowest educational outcomes. The department said the way to improve their results was by improving their home conditions.
