AMBITIOUS Durban based outfit, AmaZulu, are expected to unveil Phakamani Mahlambi on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns, as well as new goalkeeper Veli Mothwa, signed from Chippa United. Club boss Sandile Zungu will make the announcement in Bryanston, Sandton on Tuesday afternoon. The club will also announce their new general manager, Tshepiso Mofokeng, to take over from Lunga Sokhela, according to our source. Mofokeng is a lawyer by profession and it is believed that he has been behind Zungu's business operational obligations at the club. He has also been at the forefront of Usuthu's marathon signing of players such as Siphiwe Tshabalala, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Limbikani Mzava and plenty others in October this year. Tuesday's planned unveiling of players was set to include Anele Ngcongcaâ€™s signing on loan from Sundowns. But unfortunately the 33-year-old Gugulethu-born player, who will be buried in Cape Town this Thursday, died in a tragic car accident last week Monday in KwaZulu-Natal.
