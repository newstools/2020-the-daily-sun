SENZO Meyiwa’s tombstone will be restored after it was vandalised by unknown people. The desecration was the subject of social media discussions after pictures of the damaged tombstone circulated a few days ago. A criminal case was opened. The tombstone, at the Chesterville Cemetery west of Durban, was unveiled earlier last month. The SA Football Association has taken it upon itself to rebuild it. Safa NEC member and Bafana Bafana head of delegation Kwenza Ngwenya, who played a key role in the tombstone unveiling, was disappointed. Said Ngwenya: “We’re still discussing what to do. We’re communicating with head office.” The tombstone unveiling ceremony was attended by, among others, Safa president Danny Jordaan, Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, teammates Itumeleng Khune, Darren Keet and Ronwen Williams, as well as municipal officials. After the tombstone was unveiled, Jordaan said at the time Bafana should qualify for the Afcon finals in 2022 in Cameroon in memory of the late Meyiwa. He was shot and killed in October 2014. The former Orlando Pirates goalie’s death came after he’d just helped Bafana qualify for the 2015 Afcon finals in Equatorial Guinea. Five people appeared in court on 26 October in connection with Meyiwa’s death.
