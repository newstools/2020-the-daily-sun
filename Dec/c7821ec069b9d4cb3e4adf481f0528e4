Thousands of Khayelitsha residents have been without water since yesterday after a pipe that carries water into the kasi burst on Thursday. Several residents spent their day queuing for water at the at boreholes and tankers around ekasi. The city said the affected pipe is a 400mm diameter pipe at corner Lwandle and Pama roads in Khayelitsha. Residents blamed the city for failing to react quickly to fix the problem. “The city is not doing enough because how do they expect a big township to spend more than 24 hours without said resident Xolile Qgiba from Site B.  She said: “It’s better not to have electricity than water. What will we do as the toilets stink? Some people didn’t have water in their homes when it off. Old people are buying water to drink from the little grant money they get. The city must have fixed this problem much quicker. We are not happy.” Another resident Nomonde Mthalane(36) from the Graceland area said the water crisis may be the breeding ground for Covid-19 cases. “I have been in the queue for almost an hour but I have not got water. We are going to get Covid-19 in these queues. The city must deal with this immediately because we’ve seen people not wearing masks,” said Nomonde. MMC for Water and Waste Xanthea Limberg spent two hours at the scene on 18 December said the city’s plumbing technicians worked overnight to try and fix the pipe. She said measures have been taken to ensure residents get water. She said the city has temporarily restored water in some areas ekasi. “So far we have five water tanks providing water to residents, three are stationary, two others are roaming around the affected areas. At this point, we cannot tell when the water will be restored but there are some areas where water has been restored temporarily. The water may not have much pressure but residents will have some water to use,” said Limberg.
