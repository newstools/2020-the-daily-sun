MAMELODI Sundowns coach, Manqoba Mngqithi, has slammed the Western
Cape government for failing to honour the late Anele Ngcongca, calling them
dishonest and untrustworthy. A fuming Mngqithi pulled no punches as he blasted the
provincial government in his farewell speech to the ex-Sundowns defender, who
passed away in a car crash and was buried in Gugulethu, Cape Town on Thursday. ”There is saying that ‘a chance favours the prepared
mind‘.  To the government of Western Cape, know you played no role in
Anele’s success. You’ve deprived black people of Western Cape an opportunity to
celebrate the son of the soil. I wonder if it's because of race,” said
Mngqithi. “I’m very unhappy and I guess I’m nobody to be unhappy
because, if the leadership of Western Cape were honest, trustworthy and human,
they’d have seen the need to honour and respect the life of Anele. “I’ve seen so many people getting provincial funerals whom I
believe were not even worthy of them. But when I see Anele, I see a young boy
who left the province and went to shine the flag of Western Cape, representing
the province with pride, dignity and honour.” As an assistant to then coach Pitso Mosimane, Mngqithi saw
Ngcongca lift five major trophies with at Sundowns.
