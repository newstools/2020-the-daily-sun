POLICE fired tear gas to disperse angry residents when the man accused of butchering his family appeared in court today. The angry protesters stood outside Elliotdale Magistrates Court, Eastern Cape, and threatened to attack accused Nowa Makula. When Makula (32) took the stand, Baliswa Sikhundwana and members of the victims’ family collapsed and had to be taken to hospital. Makula is facing charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was arrested in Ginsberg, near King William’s Town, on Thursday 26 November. NPA spokesman Luxolo Tyali said more charges will possibly be added as police were checking whether the accused was legally in Mzansi or not. Makula allegedly killed his girlfriend Nomzamo Mhlanti (42) and her five kids Azakhiwe (10), Ibanathi (8), Wineka (5), Thoko (5) and Luphumlo (6 months) with an axe while they were sleeping in their shack on Tuesday, 24 November. During his brief appearance, Makula asked to be represented by a Legal Aid attorney after indicating he wanted to be assisted by a Shona interpreter. Protesters outside court included members of the ANC Women’s League and ATM members, led by party president Vuyolwethu Zungula. Addressing the media outside court, Zungula said he’d written to President Cyril Ramaphosa asking for the death penalty for those found guilty of killing innocent people. Members of churches around Elliotdale were also outside court. The matter was postponed to Monday, 7 December for a formal bail application and for an interpreter to be appointed.
