RUGBY World Cup-winner Cheslin Kolbe wants to add another feather in his cap with victory over the British and Irish Lions. Kolbe is well-known for scoring South Africa’s try in the Rugby World Cup 2019 final has a journey to success that defied the odds. At 1.72m and 80 kgs, he is a South African wing and fullback professional rugby player, currently playing for the South African national team and Toulouse in the Top 14 in France. Kolbe, the pocket-rocket winger who has just partnered with insurance company Momentum, achieved a dream very few could ever attain in their rugby careers, lifting the Webb Ellis trophy as well as the Rugby Championship. “I want to be part of the Lions series. I think every Springbok dreams of playing against them,” said Kolbe. “We haven’t played international matches, but we can look forward to the challenge next year. Kolbe expressed over the partnership with Momentum, saying: “I know what it feels like to be the underdog. I was always told that I was not tall and heavy enough to be a professional rugby player. Throughout my life, good advisers crossed my path and I have realised the value of partnering with the right people to reach my goals.  “That is why I chose Momentum. I want to make sure that I invest my earnings in the best possible way, that my family is provided for and that I leave a legacy for my children.”  Charlotte Nsubuga-Mukasa, Momentum’s head of marketing, explained that “Momentum was drawn to Cheslin because of how he has uniquely defined what success means for him, and how he achieves what he sets out to do – even though it seemed impossible at times. Momentum is a brand that firmly believes in the power of getting the right advice at the life-changing milestones in your life.”   -- tso
