KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed a further delay in their CAF Champions League preliminary round second leg fixture against PWD Bamenda. Chiefs were initially set to host the return leg encounter at FNB Stadium on Friday evening at 6pm, but logistical challenges experienced by the Bamenda, forced Caf to postpone the game to Saturday 6pm. However, Amakhosi have now announced further postponement of the match kick-off moved by another hour to 7pm on Saturday night. "After careful consideration, the Match Commissioner has moved the match kick-off to 19h00 this evening," the club said in a brief statement. "This is to allow PWD Bamenda to fulfill all the pre-match processes. In the spirit of Fair Play." Chiefs are heading to this clash leading 1-0 following their away victory last Sunday in Cameroon. A winner of this match will advance to the Champions League first round, where they will meet Angolan outfit Primeiro de Augusto in a two-legged tie to qualify for the group stage later this month.
