THE leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church, Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, has announced a crossover prayer meeting. And it won’t be a virtual get-together. It will be a live event at a stadium! On Wednesday, 2 December he went on social media and invited his followers to a 2021 crossover ceremony and prayer session at Bingu National Stadium in Malawi. Bushiri is a fugitive from South African justice with five warrants of arrest against him. “I know that we normally have the event at FNB Stadium, but looking at the pandemic and what has been happening with me, we’ll be having the crossover to 2021 at the Bingu Stadium in Lilongwe,” he said. “This is a great announcement after your prayers. Many were asking what was going to happen.” He said they’d have a reasonable number of people attending, in accordance with restrictions. “Therefore, this meeting is going to happen in line with strict measures which the church will obtain from stadium management,” he said. Followers across the continent have vowed to travel to Malawi. On Facebook, Chikomo Rafa said: “Distance and the hostile environment in South Africa hindered many of us from travelling there in past years. “Zambia and Malawi are almost like one country, with not many crooked people and disgruntled bishops.” Morakana Musa said: “May God of Major 1 give me another chance during the month so I can have enough finances to go to Malawi and end the year with my mum and dad.” Lily Mmoloki said: “We’re coming to Malawi and nobody can stop us, my father. “Thank you to the government of Malawi for this revelation. Malawi will never be the same again.”
