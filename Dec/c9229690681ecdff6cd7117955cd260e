TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula said the 5,7% decline in road fatalities for the first part of December was no reason to celebrate. “It’s still regrettable that 690 people lost their lives on our roads over the period to 20 December,” he said during the release of the preliminary festive season fatalities statistics at Panorama East, Tshwane yesterday. Over the same period last year, 732 fatalities were recorded. Mbalula said it was noteworthy that six provinces recorded a decline in fatalities. “We’re encouraged that these reductions make a positive contribution towards the realisation of reducing fatalities by 20% on our roads in 2020.” The Eastern Cape recorded 96 fatalities compared to 79 last year. Limpopo recorded 90 fatalities compared to 76 last year. Mpumalanga recorded 73 fatalities compared to 63. “The statistics demonstrate that our roads were fairly busy during the first peak, between 18 and 19 December despite the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Over this period, an average of 2 439 vehicles per hour were recorded on the N1 from Gauteng to Limpopo. The N3 from Joburg to Durban recorded an average of 1 547 vehicles per hour. “This was marginally lower than the same period in 2019,” said the minister. He said since the start of the festive season, traffic law enforcement kept a close eye on vehicle movements and transgressions of road rules, with 634 166 vehicles being stopped and checked. “A total of 109 529 motorists were issued with traffic fines for various offences. A total of 2 415 vehicles were discontinued while another 1 801 vehicles were impounded,” added Mbalula.
