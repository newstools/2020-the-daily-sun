AL AHLY head coach Pitso Mosimane has tested positive for the Covid-19. The Egyptian giants confirmed the news on Wednesday. “Al Ahly's head coach Pitso Mosimane tested positive for Covid-19‚” the club said on Wednesday. “Mosimane will follow the ministry of health’s protocol for Covid-19 and will be self-isolated at home.” As a result, Mosimane will now miss Friday's league clash against Ghazl El Mahalla which is set to take place at Cairo Stadium. Mosimane joined Ahly in September just after leading Mamelodi Sundowns to a historic treble. He became the first South African coach to coach the African Club of the Century.
