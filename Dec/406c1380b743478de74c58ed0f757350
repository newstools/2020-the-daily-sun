ONE man is dead and three others are injured after being shot at, allegedly by soldiers outside a tavern. Sandile Sbanyoni (27) of Betty’s Goed Village in Dundonald outside Elukwatini in Mpumalanga said he and his cousin Mthokozisi “Skoko” Shabangu (27) and other friends were sitting outside the tavern in Hartebeeskop after it had closed when two soldiers arrived in a Land Cruiser and started shooting at them on Saturday at about 12.15am. “We ran for our lives as the two soldiers shot at us, but Mthokozisi didn’t make it,” Sbanyoni said. “He was shot in the upper body and bled badly. The soldiers shot three more of our friends in their legs. “The other soldier kicked our cars before they left the scene.”  He said they rushed Mthokozisi, along with the other injured, to a nearby clinic. But he died before the ambulance arrived at the clinic. Skoko’s dad, David Shabangu ,(66) said: “We are so sad about the senseless murder of my son by soldiers. “We need justice for these barbaric acts. He was the sole bread winner for us and his child. They must bury him and ensure his child and his dependents can live.” Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed one man was dead and three others were wounded after they were shot by unidentified gunmen. “Police in Mpumalanga are investigating a case of murder and three counts of attempted murder following the killing of a 27-year-old man and the wounding of three others on Boxing Day. Of the three wounded victims, two have been treated and discharged while the third man is reportedly fighting for his life in hospital,” said Naidoo.  He said the investigation was underway under the direct supervision of the acting district commissioner, Brigadier Lizzy Mtungwa. “While no arrest has been made yet, people from local community have been very co-operative. “With the information provided thus far it seems arrests are imminent,” he said.
