HAWKERS have been told to use 20 stalls meant for trading and not to work in unapproved areas. King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal spokesman, Sonwabo Mampoza, accused the hawkers in Mthatha of being unreasonable. “It’s unfortunate that hawkers are refusing to use the business stalls meant for them. “They’re standing in the rain and heavy winds.” Mampoza said the municipality had an agreement with hawkers’ representatives before the stalls were put up. But they later rejected them. “All the representatives were consulted about these business shelters,” he said. Mampoza urged hawkers to come forward and raise their concerns with the relevant municipal officials. However, the hawkers have said the stalls are unsafe and have no water. They want the municipality to build a pavement next to the stalls. The hawkers accused the municipality of confiscating their belongings. Mampoza said the municipality was enforcing by-laws. Hawkers Association chairwoman, Thembeka Gawulekhaya, said: “These stalls are not appropriate. There is no safety and I can confirm we’re not going to use them until the municipality has provided safety measures.” Mampoza said the municipality erected 64 stalls and 44 had already been handed over. He said 20 hawkers were refusing to use the stalls. He said the municipality spent R4,6 million on the stalls. OR Tambo District Business Forum chairman, Lwazi Macingwana, said he was disappointed by the municipality’s response. “This municipal official cannot address people like this. He said if they don’t occupy the stalls he’ll give them to other people. That’s not fair,” he said. Macingwana said the business forum would protect hawkers against ill-treatment.
