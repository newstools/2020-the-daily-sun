THE body of a woman was found in a pit toilet in Alexandra, east of Joburg, on Wednesday, 16 December. The woman was allegedly raped before she was killed. Residents are now looking for the perpetrator. The woman’s boyfriend, who asked not to be named, said his 48-year-old girlfriend was drinking beer with a group of unknown men. “My neighbours alerted me about the gruesome discovery of my girlfriend’s half-naked body on the morning of Thursday, 17 December. Used condoms were also found at the scene,” he said. He told Daily Sun he was hurt and wouldn’t rest until the men who did this were found. “We’re always preaching about women not being safe, but it seems people are not getting the message,” he said. The residents said they wouldn’t rest until they found the suspect.  “Women must now fear drinking and having fun because of vultures waiting to have a piece of them. “This is so disgusting and we hope to find the perpetrator before the police do,” said Kholekile Mahlangu (41). Another resident said she was concerned about the regular killing and raping of women in Alexandra. “I live alone and I fear for my life when I walk out of my house. I ask myself if I’ll make it back home alive,” said the woman. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder was opened. He said neighbours called the police. The woman was declared dead at the scene. “It’s suspected she was strangled. Investigations are underway to determine if she was also raped,” said Masondo. “The motive for the murder is unknown and police appeal to anyone with information to call their nearest police station.”
