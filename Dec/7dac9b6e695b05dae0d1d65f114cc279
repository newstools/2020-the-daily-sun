DESPITE all the challenges she faced, Aluta Mafu finally graduated with a Bachelor of Education at the University of Fort Hare. She graduated on Thursday, 17 December and is now a qualified teacher majoring in agricultural science and life sciences. But Aluta’s journey has not always been easy. The 25-year-old from Sweetwaters in King Williams Town, Eastern Cape said her life changed for the worst when her mum, Yoliswa Kotsana, died in 2007. “Young as I was, I had to be mother to my two siblings. I was a bubbly child and my family thought I was naughty. As a result, I was taken away from my siblings and my dad moved me from a private school to a public school,” said Aluta. She said she didn’t have any hiccups in her first year at university in 2013. SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ANOTHER MANS CHILD! But she failed all her modules in 2014 after she had a bad encounter with someone close to her. Just when she thought her problems were over, she was raped by someone prominent the following year. “I never got a court date, which affected my academic year. I even tried to commit suicide, but I thank God I did not succeed,” she said. Aluta said as she was trying to pick up the pieces, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and she lost weight. “Being an active student in politics did no justice. I was rubbished on Facebook about being old without a qualification. I was diagnosed with depression,” she said. But that was not the end of her challenges as she needed to settle R120 954 before she could graduate. “The road to obtaining a qualification is not an easy one but if a person is determined, they can obtain their qualification no matter the circumstances,” she said.
