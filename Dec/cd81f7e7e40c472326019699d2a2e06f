KAIZER Chiefs’ struggles this season are showing no signs of letting up. This, after they were held to a goalless draw by Angolan giants C.D. Primeiro de Agosto in their Caf Champions League first-round clash, played at the FNB Stadium on Wednesday. Amakhosi, who have been struggling domestically and can’t buy a win, found the going in continental football as well. Gavin Hunt’s charges could not utilise their home advantage and now have to do it the hard way in the second leg which will take place on the 6th of January. They are hoping to reach the group stages of the Champions League but their opponents are after the same thing and will not lie down for the Glamour Boys. Chiefs dominated the clash and created numerous chances, however, they could not convert any of them with the Agosto’s defence remaining resolute. Agosto were the happier team with the result as they escaped Mzansi without any damage. They will now be hoping to punish Amakhosi in the second-leg. Chiefs were desperate to end the year on a bit of a high having ensured a tough year. But their demanding supporters will have no happy memories during the Christmas recess. Nevertheless, they will be hoping that their team turn the corner in the New Year.
