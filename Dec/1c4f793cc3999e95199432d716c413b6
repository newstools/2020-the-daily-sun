PARENTS can now groove in peace without worrying about their bundle of joy. Gertrude Nkongoane (27) from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni grew tired of hearing stories of mums leaving kids unattended, or with their gogos, to go party. “I started in September. It’s great,” she said. The cleaner lost her job in March. She then offered to clean houses, and that’s when the idea to babysit came about. “I started letting people know I can babysit kids at a low price,” she said. The money was good but not good enough, so she added night shift to her babysitting service. “I posted on Facebook and let parents ekasi know I also babysit at night,” she said. She has a six-year-old daughter. ALSO READ: BOOZING
PUPILS IN UNIFORM SHOCK MZANSI! “I’m not afraid of kids who cry all the time. I have the ability to calm a child down,” she said. She charges R80 during the day and R150 at night. Night shift is from 6pm to 8am. Day shift is from 6am to 4pm. Babysitting money helped her buy a small kota business. “People ask me when do I rest. I don’t. Money doesn’t rest,” she said. Thembelihle Dlamini (31) said: “A friend recommended her. I was a bit sceptical at first, but I loved her after one night away.” She came back home to find her daughter sleeping peacefully and smelling nice.
