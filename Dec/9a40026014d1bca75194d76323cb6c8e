ON MONDAY, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced harsher level one restrictions. These harsher restrictions include the sale of alcohol from retail outlets only being allowed between 10am and 6pm from Monday to Thursday. The president also announced that the current curfew hours will be extended. They will now start at 11pm and end at 4am. He said establishments such as restaurants and bars will from now on close at 10pm, making room for the boozers and staff to arrive home before the curfew starts. The strict lockdown restrictions come after the country was declared to have entered the second wave of coronavirus infections. Ramaphosa said given the rate at which new cases have grown over the last two weeks, there is every possibility that if no urgent action is taken, the second wave will be more severe than the first wave. “The daily average of new cases nationally over the last seven days is 74% higher than the previous seven days,” he said. The number of new cases increased from a daily average of around 3 800 to just over 6 600 a day. While the daily average of Covid-19 deaths has increased by nearly 50% over the same period from just over 100 deaths a day to just over 150 deaths.
