MARITZBURG United coach Ernst Middendorp has blasted his side, calling them naive in their defending against Swallows FC in their DStv Premiership clash in which they lost 2-0 in Dobsonville on Tuesday. The Dube Birds took full advantage as Ruzaigh Gamildien scored the first and the second from the penalty spot, leaving Middendorp pulling his hair out in frustration. However, the former Kaizer Chiefs coach hopes they will rectify such mistakes before their clash with Stellenbosch FC at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow night (7pm). Middendorp should feel hard done by his players, who went into this game after getting a deserved draw against Mamelodi Sundowns in the club’s previous game. But on Tuesday, despite starting on the front foot and also hitting the post through Rushine de Reuck, the Team of Choice completely fell apart as Swallows struck twice. “It was an insult for the technical team when a long kick was not sorted, no one was covering each other,” said Middendorp. “In this moment they get a penalty and as a result, we are losing 1-0. The second goal was similar to the first one, naive defending and no one was organising the defence and at that moment, of course, you are killing yourself against an experienced team. But we’ll continue to improve. From what we have seen in the last two games there is progress.” Not only are Maritzburg at the bottom of the table with one point and without a win this season, but it is 14 games without victory dating back to last season. The club’s last victory was against Polokwane City in March before last season was suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic. “We have to look into it and see what is possible and what is available for us against Stellenbosch,” added Middendorp. “Some players have not been available for different reasons.” Keagan Buchanan wasn’t part of the Dube Birds’ match as he as suspended and will be back for tomorrow’s match. @duke_robin
