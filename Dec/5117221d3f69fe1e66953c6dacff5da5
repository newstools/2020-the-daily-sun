I’d like to give the late amapiano gogo Olipha “GeeSixFive” Selepe a bow and compliment her for teaching us how to make it in life. Beside her academic background, she also taught us that life is full of possibilities. She showed us that nothing is impossible in life. If nothing is impossible, it means what people deem impossible is possible for you. The impossible became possible for GeeSixFive, who took social media by storm after recording her smash hit Obani labobantu. The song went viral and she is now the talk of the town. The gogo was a source of inspiration to our youth. She made me believe that indeed the word impossible is only found in the dictionary of fools. This should be a wake-up call for up-and-coming amapiano guys who always complain about record companies that don’t want to sign them. You can now follow gogo GeeSixFive’s route and start using social media platforms to sell your music or any other business. Let's follow the late gogo’s footsteps and we will become better people.
