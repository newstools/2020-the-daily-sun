Convicted pastor Boy Mkhomolo will spend his first Christmas in jail while awaiting his sentencing next month. The 62-year-old holy man from Allandale Village appeared before Magistrate Elmarie Theron in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Friday, 11 December. But his sentencing was postponed for the court to hear his pre-sentence report from a social worker. He pleaded guilty to rape charges last month. This was after he allegedly raped his 11-year-old relative and threatened to beat her with panga if she refused. The incident reportedly happened after he was left with the victim at their family house in Allandale Village in 2018. Magistrate Theron postponed the matter until 19 January and ordered that the accused be kept in police custody. Meanwhile in a separate incident, a 37-year-old suspect was kept in custody and is expected to appear in the Ogies Magistrates Court on Monday, 14 December. He was arrested and charged with theft of diesel in Ogies on Thursday, 10 December. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, it is alleged that Transnet experienced a drop in pressure on the pipeline. They sent a team who noticed a vehicle next to the pipeline and information was relayed to security. “On arrival, the security noticed a double cab bakkie which immediately drove away at high speed. The driver of the bakkie lost control and landed in a ditch and one suspect was arrested and others fled on foot”, she said
