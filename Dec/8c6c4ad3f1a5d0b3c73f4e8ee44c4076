HE has always been on the fringes, but now Zipho Dlangalala has a stage to audition for the TS Galaxy coaching job. The assistant coach has been put temporarily in charge of the Rockets after the club parted ways with coach Dan Malesela on Sunday. But he may not be the only one in Galaxy’s radar as Eric Tinkler has also been linked to the position. Club boss Tim Sukazi has made it clear that he is giving Dlangalala a chance to prove his credential as the right man for the job in the long term. “Fortunately for us, Dlangalala has a similar philosophy to that of coach Malesela, which will bring out continuity as opposed to starting from scratch,” said Sukazi. “We believe that if he can do the job well, nothing should stop him from assuming the role on a permanent basis. He is a very good coach whom I believe has the potential that is yet to be realised at the top level of the game. Coach Zipho will be assisted by coach Esau Mtsweni, who has been serving in the same role for quite some time. “We believe there is good synergy between the two coaches, which could bring success to our club.” Malesela was sacked following a string of poor results. He has become the third PSL coach to be fired so far this season after Patrick Aussems at Black Leopards and Eric Tinkler at Maritzburg United. Tinkler is without a job and he has so far proven to be a nomad. “The decision to part ways with coach Dan was not an easy one as he has a rich history with our club. Unfortunately, football is a result driven business and decisions such as this can only be based on results and not history,” said Sukazi.
