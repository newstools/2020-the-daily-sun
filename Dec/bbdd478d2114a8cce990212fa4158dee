Two men were seen running towards the bushes carrying a bag and a toy gun. Residents of Plastic View squatter camp, east of Tshwane, cornered them and asked if they’d just mugged anyone. The thugs denied it and claimed they were God-fearing Christians. But a resident asked to see a cellphone one of the men was holding, and the screensaver was that of another man.  A number stored as “wife” was called and the wife confirmed her husband had just been mugged near Woodlands Boulevard Shopping Complex. The couple rushed to Plastic View, where the thugs were being searched. They were beaten after being found with knives, pangas and scissors. They admitted committing other crimes in the area: stealing laptops and electric generators and selling them in Soshanguve, Tshwane. Community leaders pleaded with residents not to moer them. Instead, a resident suggested they pour water on the two so the sjambok could land easily on the thugs’ skins. During the hard beating, the two confessed to more crimes and offered to take residents to Soshanguve, where they’d sold what they stole. One resident told Daily Sun they were tired of reporting cases to the police. She said the best thing was to punish the thugs themselves. “Someone was killed earlier this year and the person confessed, but we’re still attending court cases where they postpone every day. It’s just useless to report these crimes,” she said.
