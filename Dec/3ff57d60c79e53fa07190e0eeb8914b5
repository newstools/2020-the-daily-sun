South
Africa's economic hub, Gauteng, is the latest province to officially find
itself in a second wave of infections, the SA Covid-19 Modelling Consortium
(SACMC) said on Tuesday. This was
revealed by the SACMC's Professor Gesine Meyer-Rath in a Zoom media briefing
during the launch of their dashboard for Covid-19 monitoring. The SACMC
and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) launched the
Epidemic Explorer dashboard, which has been developed to assist the public in
understanding Covid-19 risks "and make educated decisions". The
dashboard includes figures and analyses used to monitor the epidemic at
district and provincial level, and to identify second waves. Meyer-Rath
explained that the second wave was defined by the ministerial advisory
committee on Covid-19 at the beginning of November. A second
wave is when the seven-day average number of cases increases to 30% of the peak
of the first wave, she said, adding: "The
peak of the first wave was around 18 July, at which stage we had [over 12 000]
cases. The threshold since then has been defined as 30% [which is 3 680 cases].
That threshold was breached for the first time on 5 December when we had 3 683
new cases, so, again, this is the seven-day average. "At
that stage, we informed the minister of health and ministerial advisory
committee on Covid-19, and that information was broadcast widely." Meyer-Rath
said the 30% was a definition "that is not ours necessarily, but is based
on analysis to which we contributed". "As
you can see, the cases increased quite a lot. The latest case data we have from
13 December, for a seven-day average, is 6 845 new cases [nationally]." She added
that a seven-day average was not Monday to Sunday, but worked off a general
seven-day period. "The
reason for the second wave at a national level is a number of provinces have
gone into the same type of scenario in the second wave consecutively. We all
have heard of the Eastern Cape, which reached threshold towards the end of
September. Western Cape followed suit, but KZN has also reached that threshold
in the last couple of days. "In
the most recent data overnight… [it] shows that Gauteng is officially in the
second wave and is past that threshold. It is four provinces altogether that
have gone past the threshold, which means we no longer need a localised
response. As a country, we need to do things differently." Meyer-Rath
said they hoped the readily available information would assist the public in
making better decisions. "We
strongly believe, as a consortium, that the public needs this data to make
decisions, especially this time of the year, about travel and risk. We do not,
as a consortium, [say] that anyone changes travel plans - if they can, that is
entirely up to them. "What
is really important as people travel, [is that] they are aware of the risk
level that exists at the point they are going to." Vaccine,
second wave projections When asked
if they would be able to publish updated models with costing, cases and vaccine
distribution, Meyer-Rath said, "it's hard for us to make promises at the
moment". "We
will start on the vaccine model. We've done quite a bit of vaccine modelling.
We are part of the ministerial advisory committee modelling work stream and the
target population work stream. We will model as these decisions need to be
made. When decisions need to be made, we will have data to support them. "[But]
we cannot promise they will be fully in the eye of the public as soon as we are
done with the results." She said
models had to go through various processes before being made public. "That
is because there is a level of peer review within the structures of the
ministerial advisory committee and the health department. In order to be able
to make decisions in a timely manner, those outlets are the most important for
us and ones we need to prioritise. "We
will however endeavour to make that data public as soon as we can." She said
one of their main tasks was planning for the resurgence. "For
us, the main task going into the next year is to estimate the size of the
resurgence and the additional waves and distribution thereof, and have that
inform our vaccine modelling because it is gigantically important in terms of
estimating the effectiveness of the vaccine, especially different locales and
different populations." Dr Sheetal
Silal, also of the SACMC, said they give "a lot of thought and do a lot of
research when deciding to put out modelled projections and how robust those
projections are". "Are
they representative of the current situation [and] what is the known data at
the time? "Modelling
of the second wave and how long it lasts and how bad it would be are not just
problems we are grappling with in SA. In fact, it is a global phenomenon. These
are discussions happening worldwide." South
