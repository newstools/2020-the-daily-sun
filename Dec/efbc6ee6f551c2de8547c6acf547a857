WHEN they buried her in 2016, they thought her soul will rest in peace. But now her spirit haunts them every night and now they feel helpless. The Soko family at Phomolong in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun that their sister’s soul hasn’t rested. Agnes Soko (50) said when her sister Dimakatso died in 2016, she left her daughter (9) and immediately after the funeral Dimakatso’s boyfriend came to take the child. She said they never brought her back home and now Dimakatso is angry. “She visits us often telling us that she wants her daughter back home. She is angry and even threatens that she will take one of our children if we don’t bring back hers,” she said. Agnes said they tried to talk to the paternal grandmother, but she doesn’t want to bring the child back. “We don’t know where she stays. I heard she stays somewhere in Limpopo. I went there to search for her, but I couldn’t find her. When I call her sometimes, she doesn’t take my calls and other times when she answers, she gets rude on the phone,” she said. She said that they are not at peace and every night it’s a nightmare for them. “It has been years and this thing is stressing us. We can’t sleep because she is haunting us, and the other thing is that we are worried about the child too. We are not even sure if she is still alive or not,” she said. Agnes said they have tried to open a case with the police, but the cops apparently told them that was not possible. When Daily Sun called the woman who allegedly took the child, she said that everything was a lie. “She is lying. She doesn’t want us to talk and have a discussion. She is trying to ruin our names and if she continues, she will pay. “Daily Sun will also pay. She doesn’t even call the child to check how she’s doing,” she said. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said the family must do a ritual for them to have rest. “The child must come back home and they must do a ritual for her as well,” she said.
