Traffic piling up on the N4 toll road towards the Lebombo border post in Mpumalanga as many Mozambicans are heading home for the Christmas holidays. Frustrations were written all over the face of many passengers and taxi drivers who waited for many hours to cross the border into Mozambique. Antonio Chavangu (38) told Daily Sun he started queueing yesterday and he is almost losing patience. " I have been here since yesterday. I can't wait any longer, I am starting to lose patience," he said Meanwhile, Hilton Chauke (37) who left Johannesburg last night said he was expecting to be at the border by 10. "I was hoping that I would be done with all the procedures. I am frustrated and I regret being here," he said. Mpumalanga community safety spokesman, Moeti Mmusi said officials are on high alert however, they are still concerned with the slow movement of trucks. "There are many trucks as most companies will not be closing, they will continue to transport the goods throughout and only take a break tomorrow and on new yearâ€™s day. There is movement although not as quickly as we would have wanted to and we are once again appealing to motorists, those who will be coming to Lebombo port of entry to try to be as patient as possible because we anticipate a lot of delays because there are already delays," he said. He added that people who are coming through must ensure that they carry their proper documentation, Covid-19 certificates. A taxi driver was taken to quarantine after testing positive in one of the Covid-19 mobile testing stations.
