A CATFIGHT between former Rhythm City actress Samkelo Ndlovu and rapper Nomuzi “Moozlie” Mabena created a stir on social media yesterday. This after the two had a heated argument on Wednesday that almost turned physical. Samkelo, who recently launched her music career and now goes by the name of Samu, took to Instagram to share that she was performing at an establishment in Sandton and Moozlie got jealous of her. She also went on a rant on Twitter, resulting in the two entertainment personalities trending. Samu told Daily Sun about some of the events of the night. “We were both performing at the place. My performance was great and people asked that I sing again. People wanted to take pictures and I had a great time. “I think she got jealous because we don’t get along. It’s nothing hectic though, we just stay out of each other’s way when we see each other,” said Samu. ALSO READ | PROVERB BAGS TAX LAW CERTIFICATE! She said the fight started when she wanted to see her friends, who were in Moozlie’s section. “I asked her nicely to move out of the way, but she gave me a stank face. “I asked her why she looked at me like that and she took it to the top. “She started shouting and I told her she was forward and jealous. As soon as I said that, she threw her drink at me. After that, she threw the glass at me,” she said. “I’m lucky I have dreadlocks because it flew right next to my head. If that wasn’t the case, it would’ve injured me. I have footage of her giving me a stank face and other events.” Samu said she had the power to open a case because of the footage, but she’s busy with her music at the moment. “There’s no point in me shifting my attention to something that doesn’t matter and isn’t worth it. I’m letting it go, I’m mad, but I’m letting it go,” she said. Sbuda Motloung, Moozlie’s manager, promised to respond to Daily Sun’s calls, but had not reverted back at the time of going to print.
