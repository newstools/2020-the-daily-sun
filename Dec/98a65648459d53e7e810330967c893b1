Let cops arrest us! This was a plea from five young girls to their mothers. The girls who are members of a skhothane group called Italian Hlukumeza from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni are always away from homes on weekends. The girls who are between the ages of 13 and 15 told Daily Sun they leave home every Friday and come back after four days because they attend skhothane events in and around Katlehong. One of the girls said on Thursday 3 December outside the Katlehong North cop shop that they couldn’t miss the events because that’s where they met their peers. The girl said: “There are two big events today and tomorrow where skhothane groups will compete against each other. There’s no ways we can miss those events. The best solution is to be detained and be released on Monday.” One of the parents said their kids had become weekend specials. She said when her daughter started disappearing on weekends, she used to rush to the police station to report her missing. She said: “I would be worried looking for her everywhere. Then she would come back after three days. The worse part she wouldn’t tell me where she comes from. It’s clear they spend the weekend with boys.” Another parent said the past three weeks had been hell for her. She said her daughter ran away from home and didn’t write some of her exams. “I had to go to her school and beg them to give her another change to write. I had to escort her to ensure that she finished her exams. I spent the whole night going up and down the streets looking for her.” Another parent (36) said the girls were abusing them emotionally. “It’s hard to sleep not knowing where your daughter is. I’ve beaten my daughter many times, but she keeps doing the same thing.” Katlehong Police spokesman Lesetja Mathobela said: “The Constitution doesn’t allow us to arrested a person if there’s no case. The parents were advised to see social workers to get help for their children.”
