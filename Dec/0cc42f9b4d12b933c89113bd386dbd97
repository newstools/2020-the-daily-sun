IT’S not often that people get honoured while they’re still alive. Maskandi artist Thokozani Langa feels appreciated after getting a Lifetime Achievement Award. He was among more than 30 entertainment industry legends honoured at the Satmas on Saturday, 5 December. The ceremony was held in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Speaking to Daily Sun, Thokozani said: “This makes me very happy. But I’m disappointed when others are honoured after they’ve died. “It’s only luck that I’m being honoured while I’m still alive. I thank those who honoured me personally.” This year, winners were chosen in a new way as votes from the public were not considered. PJ Powers walked away with the Best Female Artist of All Time Award and was over the moon. “To be honoured as a lifetime achiever is a huge honour for me, probably one of the biggest I’ve ever received,” she said. PJ Powers said she’d seen the music industry change drastically over the past 40 years. “Sometimes I think it’s for the better. The whole digital thing makes me feel bewildered, but it’s wonderful that we have recognised indigenous culture,” she said. She said most South Africans who’d made it internationally were not trying to sound American. She said groups such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Soweto Gospel Choir stuck to their roots and flew the South African flag high. “You can’t live in South Africa and be in the arts and not talk about the wrongs and injustices of the past,” she said. Actor and musician Zuluboy jokingly said he could retire now, as he was being honoured alongside people who’d been in the industry for decades. “At the same time, it’s humbling to know there are people out there who acknowledge your work,” he said. Zulu Boy j “It’s what I have been crying for and this is the response I have been waiting for,” he said.
