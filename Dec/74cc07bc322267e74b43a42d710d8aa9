MASKANDI GROUP Izingane Zoma claim their song is about fighting GBV, but they’ve already set tongues wagging. “I was nearly raped,” the Zulu lyrics go. “NAUGHTY BOYS, BRING BACK MY PANTY YOU CUT OFF WITH YOUR KNIFE.” Izingane’s 28th album titled Iphenti Lami, which means,My Panty was released on Friday. The group said the song, featuring rising star Siphesihle Zulu, was aimed at raising awareness around gender-based violence. READ: IZINGANE ZOMA MEMBER FOUND DEAD Many of their sexual and political songs have over the years been banned by Ukhozi FM and other radio stations. The new track has been getting airplay, although some presenters have shied away from naming it. Founder, producer and songwriter Shobeni Khuzwayo told Daily Sun the group would never stop singing controversial songs. “This song is about a young woman who was nearly raped and her panty removed using a knife,” she said. “Through this song, we’re encouraging young women to be careful as rape cases are increasing by the day. “We’re conveying the message without fear and want people to hear it. Many women in rural areas are raped and even lose their virginity in this manner. “This happens while they’re asleep and, upon waking up, the perpetrator has already escaped.” ALSO READ: MASKANDI GREATS AT WAR OVER NEW HIT SONG Shobeni said it hurts to see their songs banned, but this didn’t deter them. “Many of our songs have been banned but later played on air. We sing about what we see and are not scared to do it,” she said. Shobeni said they featured Siphesihle Zulu on the new track as they wanted to teach the younger generation their unique style. “We’re grooming the youth who’ll keep this style alive after we’ve passed on. We’ll talk her into becoming a member.” Izingane Zoma is made up of Tholakele Ngobese, Thandoluni Phungula, Busani Khuzwayo and Falabo Khuzwayo.
