A 16-YEAR-OLD Free State girl, who faces charges of human trafficking, will spend Christmas and New Year in custody. She appeared for the second time in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court on Thursday, 9 December. NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping said the case has been postponed to 5 January 2021 for further investigations. He said the accused will remain in custody at place of safety until her next court appearance. She faces a charge of human trafficking after allegedly assisted two foreign men to kidnap two 15-year old girls from Mafube Intermediate School in Phuthaditjhaba, QwaQwa. Free State department of education condemn the incident. Department spokesperson Howard Ndaba told Daily Sun that they won’t tolerate such kind of behaviour in their schools. He said the department met the victim’s parents to discuss a way forward and both parties agreed that they will be given an opportunity to write exams after missing five subjects. “The parents must be vigilant to their children so that they will easily recognise when the kids are changed,” Ndaba said He welcome the postponement of the case and hope the law will take its course. However, the police are still looking for to foreign men who allegedly worked with the accused to kidnap the victims on November 20 at Setsing town, where they were run to errands for their families. The accused allegedly gave them something to drink. After drinking that substance, the two girls apparently felt tired. The accused allegedly asked them go to an unknown car. In that car there were two foreign men who allegedly left with them. The girls were found by the police outside a tavern in Sasolburg last Wednesday.
