Going to sleep can be a daunting task at times. From the heat wave to annoying insects, trying to fall asleep can very much be like solving for x. If that warm cup of milk doesn’t do the trick, it’s time to take matters into your own hands. It might be a good idea to take on some “self-service”, otherwise known as masturbation. According to experts, there are many positives to masturbating such as keeping in touch with your sexuality and boosting your sexual appetite. This self-service can be highly beneficial, especially if you’re looking for the perfect lullaby. The release of endorphins is a well-known way to help you relax. The act of having an orgasm also causes sleepiness. Furthermore, sleep experts say masturbation helps to bring on pleasant dreams and wet dreams are stimulated by the fantasies triggered by the subconscious mind. So if, like Beyonce, you want sweet dreams or beautiful nightmares, then masturbation is the way to go.
