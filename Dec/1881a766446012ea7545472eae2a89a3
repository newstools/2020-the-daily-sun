THE ANC NEC started its regular meeting on Sunday, 6 December. And it was expected to pit the party’s two factions against each other. The three-day virtual meeting was likely to finalise a statement on its outcomes on Tuesday, 8 December. Although the party said in a statement that organisational matters affecting the country would be discussed, it emerged that President Cyril Ramaphosa would go head-to-head with his rivals on whether secretary-general Ace Magashule should step aside as he has multiple corruption charges against him. During a by-election campaign last week, Magashule said he wasn’t bothered by rumours that the charges against him would be discussed at the NEC meeting.. “All of us have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a competent court of law. We’re discussing this matter and I leave it to the leadership of the ANC,” he told reporters during a campaign blitz in Ekurhuleni. The party has apparently been told by lawyer members that there were no legal grounds to ask any member to step aside. At its 54th national conference in 2017, the ANC resolved that any member facing serious corruption charges should step aside until cleared. But this is not in line with the Constitution. City Press reported that Magashule’s allies came out guns blazing at an NEC working committee meeting on Monday, 30 November. They allegedly said he should only step aside if all those implicated in wrongdoing, including Ramaphosa, did the same. The Magashule faction was apparently calling on individual NEC members to support him days leading up to the meeting.
