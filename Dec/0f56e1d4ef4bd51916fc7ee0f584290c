PASTOR Khumbulani “Mabalengwe” Ntombela has been chased out of Holy Mpumalanga Ministries. This came after the Durban church found out he was also practising as an inyanga and used snakes to make his clients rich and popular. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mabalengwe said: “The church has always been aware of my journey as a Christian and a healer. “When I joined the church, I already had this calling. It was never a secret. “I can also reveal I own several pythons and I often speak to them when I’m seeking special guidance at the river.” He said part of his calling included making people rich and popular, which was known as ukuthwala. “I am therefore confident to say I have helped a lot of South African celebrities get riches. For me, there’s nothing bad about this as it’s part of self-empowerment,” he said. Mabalengwe said the church had always supported his calling. “I’m not sure what changed their minds and I didn’t fight their decision. I opened my own church called God Has Done Prophetic Healing. I’m currently opening branches in KZN and Gauteng,” he said.  A source in the church told the SunTeam the calling didn’t gel with Christian values. “Holy Mpumalanga Ministries is a Christian church and we only believe in God,” said the source. “When people start doing things that are ungodly, the church would rather release them. “We knew Pastor Ntombela was an inyanga, but when he started using snakes everybody got confused.” Pastor Khaya Simelane of the church said Mabalengwe was with them for over 10 years. “There was no fight but his calling was starting to interfere with the church. He was no longer available for church matters,” he said. “We didn’t have an issues with his healing powers but the way he was doing it.”
