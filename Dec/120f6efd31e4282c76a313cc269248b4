THREE matric pupils from Rethusegile Secondary School in Lethabong Village outside Rustenburg, North West, lost their lives in an accident on Friday, 11 December. Ikageng Nkosi (18) Tshepiso Moagi (20) and Amogelang Diphoko (20) were among 42 pupils, who were travelling back home from a farewell trip in Brits, when the accident occurred. Eleven pupils were admitted at Brits Hospital. Ikageng’s dad, Joseph, (54) said his son was a respectful child. “He was my last born. I expected a lot from him. He was accepted at the University of Joburg to study teaching,” he said. Tshepiso’s sister, Boitumelo, said she tried to talk her little brother out of going on the trip, but he was excited about it. “He said he wanted to say goodbye to his fellow pupils,” she said. Amogelang’s aunt, Nelly, said Amogelang was excited from the day they received the letter from the school informing them about the trip. “He couldn’t wait for this day. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a tragedy,” she said. North West Education MEC Wendy Matsemela visited the three families on Saturday, 12 December. She said an investigation would be conducted to determine whether or not the trip was sanctioned. “It was indeed a year of challenges and we never anticipated any tragedy at this point. Instead of our pupils getting rewarded, they’ve lost their lives,’ she said.
