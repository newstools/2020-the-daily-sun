POLITICIANS come to the kasi and take pictures of the rundown houses for their profiles, but for the residents nothing changes. On Wednesday, 2 December, Cosatu and the SACP visited Jacob’s Farm kasi near Welgedacht in Springs, Gauteng to celebrate the organisation’s 35th birthday. They brought groceries and shared a cake, but residents said they’re tired of politicians who want to buy votes while they’re still living in battered asbestos houses. They have placed plastics over the asbestos roofs and a bed of rocks to keep the plastics in place. “We appreciate that they bring food and clothes, but we can’t carry on living like this,” said community leader, Lungile Nokhulane. “The politicians always promise us a better life but nothing changes.”  Resident Mahadi Bekwa said: “They bring us food parcels, clothes and blankets and then they disappear.” Residents said politicians from the Ekurhuleni Municipality and other politicians visited the kasi. Cosatu and the SACP gave more than 35 families bulk groceries including 5kg rice, 5kg sugar, 12,5kg mealie-meal, detergents, chicken braaipacks, dignity packs, cooking oil and vegetables and other items.  Cosatu second deputy president, Louise Thipe, said it was the first time they came to Jacob’s Farm and were appalled by the living conditions of the residents. “We’re going to pass the message to the relevant departments about what we saw at Jacob’s Farm,” said Thipe. “We’re now closer to ministers and we’re definitely going to tell them about these living conditions.” Cosatu general secretary, Louisa Modikwe, said they are going to suggest an agricultural project that will enable residents to grow their own food. “We’ve already organised a mobile clinic for certain days with the Gauteng Department of Health,” said Modikwe.
