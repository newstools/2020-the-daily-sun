LEBANI “Rasta” Sirenje has paid tribute to Anele Ngcongca with a huge painting that he was busy with as the soccer star’s funeral proceeding was underway. He told Daily Sun that he always makes it a point to ensure that fallen heroes of Mzansi are honoured. Rasta arrived from Gauteng on Wednesday, 9 December just to pay his last respects to Anele. “I respect Anele. He is our fallen hero. He served well for Bafana Bafana, and served his country with distinction. This is my own way to honour him. I had to come down to Cape Town just to pay my last respects to our legend,” said Rasta. Rasta, who is an ardent Kaizer Chiefs fan, said despite his club preferences, he respected Anele’s talent. “He played in the World Cup as a defender, one of the top tournaments in which a player can represent his country,” said Rasta. He told the SunTeam he’d been doing Anele’s portrait for the past six hours. “This is the only way I can pay respect to Anele,” he said. He is well-known for his paintings that leave Mzansi divided. Some think Rasta doesn’t do justice to the people he draws because of little resemblance between the actual person and the painting. Others argue that Rasta’s paintings are awesome.
