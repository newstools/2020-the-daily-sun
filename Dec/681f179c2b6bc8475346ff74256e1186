AL Ahly wants to reunite Gaston Sirino with former coach Pitso Mosimane, the latter has confirmed. Sirino has put in a transfer request at Mamelodi Sundowns as he hankers for a move to Al Ahly. Mosimane, the former Sundowns coach, now in charge of Al Ahly, has broken his silence on the transfer speculation. ”Al Ahly want Sirino. They have spoken to Sundowns officially. I don't want to tell you many things because there is a lot that's happening. But he (Sirino) has to do things the right way, ” Mosimane told Safja on Wednesday. ”Before I came here there was a talk about him because they played against him. They know him. That is why I've never said one word about him. ”It's just a perception that I was the one who wants Sirino at Ahly because I'm in the hotseat, and it will always point to me. But I'm not angry about.” --tso
