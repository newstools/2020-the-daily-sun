THE Women of South Africa Movement marched on Friday, 5 December in a bid to place women’s economic freedom at the top of the national agenda. Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, received a petition during the march at the Union Buildings in Tshwane.  The movement said the march is in line with this year’s campaign: women’s economic justice for a non-violent and non-sexist South Africa. The movement demanded decisive action to ensure that more women are involved in economic participation in both government and the private sector. Dr Sibongile Vilakazi from the movement called for the enactment of laws promoting gender equality and criminalising the current gender wage gap.  “Among other things, we call on government to make its implementation plan available to the South African public by 31 March,” she said. Nkoana-Mashabane said all the demands were aimed at ensuring South African women get 51,2% of economic transformation and the empowerment of women within the economy. She said these had been the stated goals of the democratic government since 1994, but women were yet to see this transformation. “As the country embarks on its economic recovery plan, government must ensure women are at the centre of development initiatives, and that plans are gender responsive,” Nkoana-Mashabane. She said government introduced a range of policies and programmes designed to facilitate women’s economic empowerment, but these hadn’t yet been implemented.
