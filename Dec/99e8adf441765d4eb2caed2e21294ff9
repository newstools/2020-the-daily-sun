THINGS are just not happening for Maritzburg United. The Team of Choice were held to a 2-2 draw by Stellenbisch FC at their home venue Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night. This means they will go to the Christmas recess without a win after eight matches of the 2020-21 DStv Premiership. Maritzburg were in the lead twice against coach Steve Barker’s charges, but they couldn't manage the game to secure their first win this season. They started the match like a house on fire with Judas Moseamedi putting them ahead in the third minute. However, his goal was cancelled out by Mark van Heerden in the 10th minute of the game. Again, Moseamedi put them on the lead in the 15th minutes. The two sides went to the half time break with Maritzburg leading 2-1. The second half proved to be a more evenly contested affair, with the first 15-minute spell producing very little in the way of goalmouth action. But Stellenbosch would eventually go on to level matters on 59 minutes as Stanley Dimgba prodded the ball home at the far post following some excellent work in the build-up by Du Preez. Maritzburg twice went close to reclaiming the lead but Kwanda Mngonyama headed over from the centre of the box before Rushine De Reuck sent his own header wide of the right-hand post. The hosts kept piling forward as they went in search of a third goal and they were again denied by the woodwork in the 69th minute as Keagan Buchanan struck the post with a curling free-kick. There were chances for both teams with time running out but Maritzburg's Bongokuhle Hlongwane saw his long-range shot saved while Stellenbosch's Du Preez was also denied by the goalkeeper. In the end, the two teams were forced to settle for a share of the spoils as the match ended in a stalemate.Maritzburg have yet to register their first win of the season and are bottom of the PSL log with two points to their name after eight games so far.
