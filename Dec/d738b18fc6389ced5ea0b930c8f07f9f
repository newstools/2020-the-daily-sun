IKWEKWEZI FM presenter Bongani “Bobo Da Beat” Mthomboti is back on air. This after he was taken off air last month when he apparently made remarks suggesting women got raped because of the way they dressed. He allegedly made the unsavoury remarks during his show Sizigedlile, a talk show that tackles finance, interfaith, social issues as well as moral regeneration topics. A well-placed source made Daily Sun aware of his comeback. “After the saga, where Bobo was unscheduled on Ikwekwezi due to a complaint laid against him at the BCCSA, he is back on air,” said the source. “He is very remorseful for what he said and he has realised what he said was out of line. He has appealed to the listeners to forgive him and put everything behind them."

"Due to the seriousness of the matter, Mr Mthomboti is subjected to an ongoing process of further learning and familiarising himself with the SABC’s editorial code of conduct and that of the BCCSA. “The application of both codes of conducts at all times will ensure that he does not make irresponsible remarks on-air in future.”
