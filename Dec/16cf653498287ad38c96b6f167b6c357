SANGOMAS HAVE rolled the bones, and they’re ready to share their vision for the New Year with SunReaders! Will the New Year be better? Gobelas Grace Ndlovu and Joseph Dungamanzi told Daily Sun things are looking good in the New Year. But gogo Rebone Tshabalala-Moloki, president of Abathwali Bemithi Traditional Healers Organisation, didn’t agree with them. “No!” said the gogo. She said riots, bloodshed, retrenchments as well as a spike in Covid-19 infections are on the cards. “I saw hospitals overcrowded because of the virus. There will be more lockdowns as the country battles corona,” said Tshabalala-Moloki. “I saw a very dark crossing over into the New Year. Many households that have electricity will be in darkness with only candles,” she said. She said government needed to start recognising the role of sangomas and traditional healers, and give them an opportunity to fight the virus and present traditional cures. I HATE POKING PASTORS! Gobela Grace Ndlovu said: “It’s a peaceful year filled with the good and only slightly bad. “The bad will mostly come from challenges brought on by the coronavirus, which will be with us for some time.” Grace said families will continue to mourn the deaths of loved ones. “Despite this, things are looking much better than in 2020. The year looks bright.” Said Dungamanzi: “It’s a peaceful year. We’ll experience heavy rains at the beginning of the year. “But the rains are there to wash away bad spirits and deaths of 2020.” He foresaw economic growth and favourable job creation. “More people will have jobs but corona is still there,” Dungamanzi told the SunTeam.
