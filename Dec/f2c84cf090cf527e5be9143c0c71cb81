LIMPOPO Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba handed over vehicles and uniform to Forensic Pathology Services recently. The handover was held at The Ranch Resort outside Polokwane, Limpopo. The department handed over eight body collection vehicles and three support vehicles, as well as uniforms.  Ramathuba told Daily Sun she was concerned by the state of some hospital mortuaries across the province. “Failure to look after our mortuaries with many unclaimed bodies makes it difficult for everyone,” said Ramathuba. “It’s crucial to have clean mortuaries and pathology vehicles.” She said each vehicle could carry four adults and they could respond to an emergency on time. Ramathuba said they could not turn a blind eye to forensic services whenever they got new vehicles for emergency medical services, as they provided a very important service. “Forensic officers are our department’s pillars which we indeed need to support,” Ramathuba said. The MEC said they also needed to appreciate the officers’ passion for their work. She also said the department would support the officers through the festive season. “We will work closely with them to ensure we serve our people in a proper way,” she said. Head of Clinical Department: Forensic Pathology, Dr Thakadu Mamashela, said the vehicles would boost their department. “It has always been difficult to run around with old cars which made it difficult for our officers,” said Mamashela.
