Media personality, Somizi Mhlongo, Barleader TV, and Multichoice were served a summons for Dinner With Somizi, on Wednesday. This follows months after Hastings Moeng accused Somizi and Legend Manqele, who owns Barleader TV, of stealing the idea of 'Dinner With Somizi' from him. Dinner With Somizi is a cooking show that Somizi hosted on 1Magic. The show saw him cooking for Mzansi celebs at his home. Hastings claimed that he sent the idea of the show to both Somizi and Legend in 2014 and 2016, via email. Former Radio 702 presenter, Eusebius McKaiser who broke the story back in September, shared the papers that they were served with on Wednesday, on Twitter. According to Eusebius, Hastings wants compensation from Somizi and the two entities.
