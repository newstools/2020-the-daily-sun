ONE of the stars of the reality TV show, uThando Nes’thembu, Mbali Mangwabe Mseleku, has launched a new business called Maqaqa Exclusive Lifestyle. The launch was held in Adams, south of Durban on Sunday, 6 November. The business includes a beauty salon, spa, car wash and shisa nyama. Mbali said she’s had the idea for sometime, but couldn’t put it together due to her studies. “I’ll have more time to focus on it now that I’m done studying. I’m passionate about this business and hope it attracts more customers. My initial idea was a beauty spa, but I then realised I had more space so I decided to add more features,” said Mbali. “As far as I’m concerned, this is the first of its kind business. We basically offer a full package for our clients. This means they’ll be able to wash their cars while dining and enjoying our spa. My goal is to add more features like board and conference rooms. The place will soon be able to host parties for companies and individuals..” She said her husband, Musa Mseleku, played a huge role in starting the business. “He consistently motivated and encouraged me to have a second source of income. “For now, the day-to-day operations of the business will be handled by my brother and I’ll oversee everything.” This means I will not necessarily be around all the time, but my brother will be running this business,” she said.
