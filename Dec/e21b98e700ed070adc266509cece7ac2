IT appears another maskandi war is brewing, and this time it’s taken an ugly turn. Abafana BakaMgqumeni have called Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele an uncontrollable little rabid dog which bites everyone. In their new song titled Inja Enamarabi, the duo attack Mthandeni, accusing him of trying to impersonate their late cousin, Mgqumeni Khumalo. Leader of Abafana BakaMgqumeni, Nelisani Mseleku, told Daily Sun Mthandeni should learn to respect other artists. “He attacks everyone, and when they respond he says they’re looking for fame,” said Nelisani. “He’s been attacking us ever since he came into the industry. We ignored him. “He named himself Igcokama Elisha but stole the name of our late father Mahawukela ‘Igcokama’ Mseleku, who was a popular maskandi artist.

He’s not creative.” Nelisani said Mthandeni should stop impersonating their cousin. “In 2012, Sibusiso Gcabashe impersonated Mgqumeni and was arrested. Now, Mthandeni is calling himself Mgqumeni.” They were surprised when Mthandeni called himself Unyazi Lwezulu on his new album. Unyazi is the Shembe church leader. “He takes chances and isn’t a maskandi artist. He doesn’t have a maskandi award. The only award he won was Best Stylish Musician. Therefore, he’s a model and not an artist.” Mthandeni told the SunTeam: “I’m the one with a maskandi remote and I control it, so anyone who wants fame attacks me. “They can’t fight for Mgqumeni because he’s not their father. Mgqumeni’s sons are still too young. “Those guys with sharp bums like cows must leave me alone. I don’t have time for them.”
