WE ARE officially in the festive season. Despite the pandemic, the festive cheer somewhat provides that much needed brightness after a very dark and grim 2020. Part of the many traditions and norms that come with the festive season are our spending patterns. From the usual Christmas shopping, vacations, and entertainment festivities, we often find ourselves overspending during this time of the year. So, how can we avoid festive overspending by being more financially savvy with our money? Economists recommend the following tips: 1. Decide on your budget Setting a holiday budget before you begin your festive shopping is always a smart move. Allocating a budget for the holidays will enable you to minimize overspending and avoid unnecessary purchases. 2. Spend your Christmas bonus wisely If youâ€™re lucky enough get a year-end bonus or a 13th cheque, you might elect to put that money towards your home loan or add it to your retirement fund. 3. Avoid using credit to get through the season The biggest financial killer for many people during the holidays is the reliance on credit cards to get through the festive season, especially when it comes to buying gifts. Avoid credit at all costs during the festive season.
