Standard Bank has donated R1 million to Gift of the Givers to assist the hundreds of Masiphumelele fire victims. Ali Sablay from the organisation said they were touched by the incident in Masiphumelele near Kommetjie where a devastating fire destroyed several shacks on 17 December. “We were first on the ground. We assisted all the affected victims with hot meals and we will be doing this for the next three days,” said Sablay. He said they would hand out nappies for kids as well as face masks, water, and all the necessities residents’ need. “With this contribution from Standard Bank and with many other corporates coming on board, we are hoping to make this festive season a happier one even though they are facing challenges of losing everything they had,” he said. Sablay He said most people had used their bonuses to buy what they needed but they had lost everything. “This year was very difficult for everyone, with Covid-19 making the lives of the citizens difficult. Some lost their jobs. We all need to play our part in making sure we support them,” said Sablay. Endinako Nkuhlu (37) said as a community they were happy and appreciative of the donations they had been receiving. “We are praying that the money that was donated will assist us. We are hoping it won’t be used for something else. But we trust the Gift of The Givers because they have been assisting a lot of communities,” she said. Endinako said they were going to be worried if the donation was given to a political party. “Politicians are just using us. We know some will use this fire to get votes. They will make promises as they usually do when they want people’s votes. We are grateful to the Gift of The Givers,” she said.
