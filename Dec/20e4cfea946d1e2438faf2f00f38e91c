BENNI McCarthy is set to be appointed as AmaZulu coach on Sunday. AmaZulu, who saw Ayanda Dlamini “voluntarily” resigned on Monday, have announced the new coach will be appointed by president Sandile Zungu in Bryanston, Sandton, tomorrow at 2 pm. McCarthy, the former Cape Town City coach, has been heavily linked to the post ever since it became vacant a few days ago. SunSport sources have learnt that McCarthy will indeed be appointed as Usuthu coach. “Yes, Benni will be the new coach when the club announces it tomorrow,” said the mole. President Zungu, who purchased Usuthu in October, wants to see the slipping giants wake up from the slumber of the previous years. During his October’s speech when he bought the club, he promised that he wants to take Usuthu to be number one in South Africa when the club turns a centenary in 2030. By then, they should have won three league titles. This season, Zungu’s mandate is to see AmaZulu finish in the top four and McCarthy is set to be entrusted with the same mandate when he’s unveiled. To compliment that, Usuthu made a lot of top signings during the offseason. They signed Makhehleni Makhaula, Sicelo Mkhize, Siphelele Nene, Thembela Sikhakhane, Limbikani Mzava, Samkelo Mgwazela, Siphelele Mthembu, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Xola Mlambo. Recently they added Veli Mothwa and Phamakani Mahlambi on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. The all-time- time Bafana Bafana top scorer with 31 goals will have to put this together to be a winning machine this season. The former FC Porto striker will have to hit the ground running and quickly know his players. Usuthu will play on Wednesday when they host city rivals – Golden Arrows at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium.
