EASTERN Cape former Health MEC, Dr Pumza Dyantyi, died on Monday, 7 December, the office of the chief whip in Parliament said. “It is with profound shock and sadness that the ANC caucus in Parliament has learnt of the passing of former MEC and Member of Parliament Dr Dyantyi,” Parliament chief whip Pemmy Majodina said. “We grieve this deep loss and have been rendered much poorer by her untimely departure. Our nation faces many challenges requiring her expertise, resilience and tenacity as well as experience in the movement. “Dyantyi departs at a time when we see a resurgence in both the Aids and Covid-19 pandemics. In her honour, as the ANC Parliamentary caucus, we pick up her fallen spear and redouble our efforts, with the same vigour and commitment that she demonstrated in the fight against HIV and Aids,” she said. Dyantyi, from Engcobo in the Chris Hani District, who was recently hospitalised, served in many government positions previously including as MEC for different departments. At the time of her departure, she served in the portfolio committee on health in Parliament. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said: “On behalf of the provincial government and the people of the province, we send our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family of Dyantyi. “The role she played in the fight for freedom and liberation of the people of Mzansi in the process of rebuilding our country post-apartheid, which includes her deployment to the provincial departments of health and that of social development, among many other leadership responsibilities, makes her a very special daughter of the people of our province. “As we mourn her passing, all of us, especially her family, friends and colleagues, must be comforted by the contribution she made in the development, reconstruction and transformation of our country in general, and province in particular,” said Mabuyane.
