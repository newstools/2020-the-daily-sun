TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) received a huge boost ahead of the Venda DStv Premiership derby against Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium this afternoon (3.30pm). Tshakhuma will be welcoming back their star midfielder Thabo Rakhale. The former Orlando Pirates player missed Vhadau VhaDamani’s last Premiership clash against AmaZulu which they drew 1-1 at the same venue. Since joining Tshakhuma this season from Chippa United, the 30-year-old Vanderbijlpark born midfielder has been one of the key players in Joel Masutha’s team. “We missed him (Rakhale) a lot in our last league game,” said Masutha. “Rakhale has been training well and the team doctor has given him the green light. We spoke with him and he is ready for this crucial clash. He has been doing well since he joined us. And we are happy to have him back.” On their clash with Leopards, Masutha said: “To be honest Leopards are like our big brother as they have been in the top flight for years. They are an experienced side and as for us we are still new in the PSL. "We have a lot of respect for them as our brother but today we are going to them to fight for three points and bragging rights. It will be a tough game but we are looking forward to this first DStv Premiership Venda derby and we aim to win it.” For victory, the former Leopards coach will put his trust on the likes of Rhulani Manzini, Justin Shonga, Rakhale and Alfred Ndengane. Leopards coach Dylan Kerr, on the other hand, will be hoping his Zimbabwean international Obvious Karuru continues with the form he displayed when he scored a brace in their 2-2 draw against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on the last Wednesday.
