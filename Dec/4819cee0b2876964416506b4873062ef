THE sooner Baroka FC realises they have a goal poacher in Richard Mbulu, the better it will be for their league title ambitions this season. Mbulu came off the bench to score his fourth goal of the season and lead Bakgaga to a 2-1 home DStv Premiership win against Chippa United at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. It’s still a mystery why Thoka Matsimela decided to bench Mbulu, only to unleash him when he sensed trouble. However, the Malawian marksman continued with his rich vein of form to secure the Limpopo side victory which moved them to third with 11 points on the log. Baroka went ahead in the 44th minute through Sandile Mthethwa, who bundled home from inside the box. Stunned, the home side came back stronger in the second half, equalising through Evidence Makgopa minutes after the hour mark. Buoyed by the equaliser, Bakgaga increased pressure and got reward as Mbulu headed in from a setpiece midway through the second half. Mbulu came off the bench and delivered for the home side. It got worse for Chippa as Mduduzi Sibeko received his marching orders for a second bookable offence with 10 minutes to go. A goal down and a man down, the contest suddenly became an uphill battle for the Port Elizabeth-based side. But as it is often said, there is no dangerous side like a team with one man shot, but the Chilli Boys couldn’t find a way back into the game as Baroka broke the three-year winless boogy against them with a third victory of the season. Whatever Matsimela do in the next match, he has to strongly consider putting Mbulu in the starting line. Nhlanhla Mgaga, the man of the match, explained their aggressive approach paid dividends.
