MINISTER Aaron Motsoaledi visited Home Affairs offices in the Tshwane CBD yesterday morning to assess compliance with Covid-19 regulations and monitor service delivery. He said the department experienced higher than normal volumes of visitors during the holidays. He expects this to continue despite the Covid-19 outbreak. The minister said the pandemic calls for additional vigilance at Home Affairs. Senior managers have been deployed to all provinces over the two days. Director-General Tommy Makhode will be in the Western Cape and Deputy Minister Njabulo Nzuza will be in KZN. According to the department, a service delivery plan was drawn at the start of lockdown. Motsoaledi said the visits are aimed at monitoring implementation of the plans and making interventions. “Each time there’s a positive Covid-19 case at one of our offices, services get disrupted,” he said. The minister found a long queue of people waiting to be let inside, but there were delays due to a systems failure. Motsoaledi urged people to wear masks, sanitise and observe social distancing. He said: “Visitors to Home Affairs offices are reminded to observe social distancing. People come in large numbers and don’t adhere to the regulations.”
