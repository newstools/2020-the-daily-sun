YOU probably thought the car was stolen in 30 seconds, right? Well, that’s not the case. The most unfortunate new car owner in the UK had just bought a Renault Megane and nearly crashed into a cop car. Cops quickly pulled the car over and the driver told them he’d just bought the car 30 seconds ago. The cops seized the car and towed it away. In the UK, it’s illegal to drive a car on a road or in a public place without insurance. If caught, it can lead to a penalty of £300 (about R6 000) and six points on your record. The government also states that police have the power to “seize, and in some cases, destroy the car”. This vehicle almost has a head on with our motor. The driver then told officers he brought the car 30 seconds ago and for once this was actually true. Unfortunately took his chances not insuring it. And well you all know what happens next.. #Seized #s3812BRANDHAM pic.twitter.com/O5XF3oboGO
