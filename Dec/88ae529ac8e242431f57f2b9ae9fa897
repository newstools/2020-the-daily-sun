MPUMALANGA Sassa has warned social grant beneficiaries to be extra vigilant this festive season. Sassa provincial spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni said: “As the festive season dawns, Sassa is urging all social grant beneficiaries to be vigilant when they collect their social grants and ensure that they don’t fall victims to fraudsters and criminals. “Frail pensioners, people living with disabilities and other beneficiaries are being targeted by thugs and scammers during the festive season. Some of these criminals visit pay points pretending to be offering assistance at the ATMs.” Ngubeni said all beneficiaries must ensure they keep their pin codes a secret and payment cards secure from everyone – like suspicious relatives, children or micro loan companies – because they can then withdraw their money without their consent. “If the beneficiaries suspect that the pin code has been exposed to the wrong person, they have the right to change it at the South African Post Offices or private banks. “If they encounter any challenges that their money has been withdrawn, they must ask for the statement from the teller to see the transactions where and when the money was withdrawn,” he said. He said this will ease the process of lodging a complaint and opening a criminal case at the nearest police station. Ngubeni said beneficiaries must remember the following: “After collecting money at the pay point, ATM and merchants, you must put it in a safe place and ensure that no one is watching. Don’t allow any strangers to assist you with carrying your bags or withdrawing money at the ATM.” Social Development MEC Thandi Shongwe has urged social beneficiaries to always maintain social distancing. The MEC said people must wash their hands with soap and water or sanitise their hands and wear masks.
