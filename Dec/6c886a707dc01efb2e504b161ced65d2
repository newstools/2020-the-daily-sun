Taraji P Henson is opening up about having suicidal thoughts amid the pandemic. The
 host of the Facebook Watch series Peace of Mind with Taraji recently 
interviewed Tamar BraxtonÂ about her attempted suicide earlier this year,
 and is now opening up about her own mental health. "For a couple 
of days, I couldn't get out of the bed, I didn't care. That's not me," 
she said, talking to co-host Tracie Jade and licensed psychologist, Dr 
LaShonda Green. "Then, I started having thoughts about ending it," the 
Empire star said, explaining she'd recently purchased a gun and thought:
 "'I could go in there right now, and just end it all.'" The actor added that she did consider her son, Marcell Johnson, and thought: "'He's grown, he'll get over it.'" Taraji said talking about it while opening up to one of her girlfriends is what helped her.  "For
 me, I'm no professional, but I felt like, if I don't say it, it becomes
 a plan," the Oscar nominee said. "And what scared me, is that I did it 
two nights in a row. And the thoughts kept coming. Now I started to 
think about how. At first, it was like, I don't want to be here. And 
then I started thinking about going and getting the gun. And that's why 
when I woke up the next morning, and I blurted it out. Because I felt 
like after a while, it was going to take over me, and it was going to 
become a plan because that's how strong my brain is."
