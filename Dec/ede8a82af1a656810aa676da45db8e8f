Gobelas must stop deceiving their thwasas by telling them they have to sleep with them so they can have certain powers. There’s a growing list of those revealing sexual violations in the sector. This is rubbish and absolutely disgusting behaviour from the gobelas! They do this evil deeds and threaten the thwasas. The initiation of thwasas is supposed to change the people’s lives and not bring abuse and pain. BLONDIE MAKHENE: MEN ARE TRASH! We are reading a lot of stories about the allegations of rape and abuse in the thwasa initiation schools and this hurts. These young girls trust these gobelas to train them to become better traditional healers. Women should be encouraged to speak up and help other women at initiation schools. Elders must stop encouraging people to cover up abuse in spaces of cultural practice. Abuse taints traditional healing. This sector used to lead to a smooth transition, but now it’s plagued with allegations of sexual abuse and mistreatment. Letter from Tembisa.
