THIS week SunPeople can expect yet another exciting episode of Umjolo and Sex. The festive season is upon us and everyone will be out and about, forgetting their phones and some claiming to their partners that their batteries went flat. Our hosts Mlungisi Mpela, Gomie Seabi, as well as sex expert Sanele Mbense will be discussing whether or not it’s the right thing to follow your partner on social media. Speaking to SunBuzz, Gomie said: “Often relationships end in tears because of social media, so in this week’s episode we will unpack how people can avoid conflict in their relationships due to social media. “People are who they post. When you decide to follow them, are you ready to find out who they really are?” Gomie said people should have a rule of thumb. “I’ve never found myself in a situation where I get a shock of my life after seeing my partner’s posts. “I don’t follow my partner on socials. I think it’s advisable not to for your own peace and sanity.” Co-host Mlungisi Mpela said it takes a certain amount of maturity to follow your partner on social media. “Social media is part and parcel of someone’s privacy, and when you fish around for something, almost all the time you get what you’re looking for. “So it takes a certain amount of maturity to follow your partner on social media. The interaction between your partner and other people will contribute to a lot of questions that will pop up in your head.” Mlungisi said working on the podcast has been amazing and the positive response has been overwhelming.
