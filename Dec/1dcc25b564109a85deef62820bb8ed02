DEPUTY environmental affairs minister Maggie Sotyu has praised communities living near the Kruger National Park’s Pafuri Gate for creating opportunities to better their lives. Speaking to residents of Ha-Mutele, Bileni and Tshikhuyu in Masisi, Limpopo, she said: “We want other communities to learn from them so that they can start up their own projects. “They can create jobs and the government can fund them further. “It’s not good that communities blame the government for not providing them with jobs when they can create jobs themselves.” She was speaking at the official opening of the three-star Awelani Eco Lodge in Ha-Mutele on Friday, 4 November. The lodge is 11km from the Kruger National Park and can accommodate 54 overnight guests. It also has 150-seater conference centre. Sotyu said the Vhembe District Municipality started funding the project in 2005 and the government injected another R10 million before the opening. To date, the government has invested R47 million into developing and maintaining the lodge. “A total number of 23 people from the Mutele community are permanently employed and casual staff are appointed on a contractual basis,” she said. “Local contractors are used for services such as repair and maintenance, plumbing and cultural activities such as performing traditional dances and preparing traditional food for international tourists,” she said. Lodge chairman Albert Ramufhi said he appreciated the government’s support and the extra money would be used to restock animals such as impalas and kudus. He said through government funding, they wanted to uplift villagers by helping them establish small projects involving things like bricklaying, poultry and goat farming. Vhembe Mayor Dowelani Nenguda said to celebrate the opening of the lodge, the municipality donated three cars and a tractor.
