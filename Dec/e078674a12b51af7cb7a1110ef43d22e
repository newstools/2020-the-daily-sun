ALL he wanted was to lobola the love of his life, but his dead gogo won’t allow it. The 38-year-old from Dalpark, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun his grandmum had never liked the girl from next door. The gogo, who died in 2011, would often tell him never to chat her up even if there were no women left on earth. “She used to party a lot and never hid the fact that she drank alcohol. My grandmother hated that,” he said. His grandmum hated her revealing clothes. He and the girl became friends two years after she died and gave things a try in the third year.

But he dreamt his gogo was saying she won’t allow the relationship. He started having bad luck, with two of his supermarkets, car wash and a buy-and-braai business shutting down. He went to see a sangoma, who confirmed his gogo was unhappy. “We did three ceremonies – in December, March and July – but things aren’t changing,” he said. The man’s mum said: “We’ve prayed for results in each of these ceremonies, but gogo won’t accept this relationship. We don’t know what to do.” The 35-year-old fiance said: “I don’t know what I did to her, but I’m not ending my relationship because of her. She needs to rest in peace.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi told Daily Sun nothing would go right and things would get worse for the man if they got married. “He’ll lose everything. But everything will go back to normal and his businesses will run again if he ends this relationship,” said Dungamanzi. According to Dungamanzi, no ceremony will ever change gogo’s mind. She had strong hatred for this woman and wanted to protect her grandsons.
