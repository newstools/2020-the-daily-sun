GOSPEL artist Sbu Banda is still aiming for the stars. “I want to reach a stage where my songs are sung by all race groups and everyone knows who Sbu Banda is,” said the multi award-winning artist. He said he hasn’t reached his peak. Sbu recently won the Best Male Gospel Artist award at the Crown Gospel Music Awards. The pre-recorded show was held on 13 November and broadcast on Sunday, 29 November. “This is my biggest award,” he told SunBuzz. “It’s been a long-awaited award and I’m humbled by this achievement. “I’m super-excited about this award because it was the judge’s decision, which meant the public didn’t have to vote in this category.” ALSO READ | CELEBS WHO'VE TIED THE KNOT IN 2020 He said he’d been entering the awards since 2011. “I only got nominated in 2013. I guess it wasn’t my time,” said Sbu. “However, I’ve received multiple awards since 2016, when I won Best Engineered Album. “In 2017, I won the Best Community Outreach, and in 2019 I won Best Video. So far this is my biggest award. “The advantage with this particular award is that I didn’t have to campaign much. The public didn’t have to vote as the final decision was to be made by the judges.” Although he’s not sure what made him win, he thinks his consistency and the quality of his music made him stand out. “I’m aware that I was competing with the cream of the crop including Benjamin Dube, but the judges felt I deserved it,” he said. “For me this award is also a fulfilment of Benjamin Dube’s dream. “He groomed and coached me. He used to say he wants me to reach his level. “Competing with him in the same category now proves that I’m slowly getting there.” He said not everyone was happy for him. “What I know is that a person can never be loved by or satisfy everybody,” he said. “Some people will genuinely love you and some will have their own agendas. “I’m putting all my energy to those who appreciate my work.”
