A HISTORIC landmark and international tourist attraction, The Mandela House in Vilakazi Street in Orlando West, is to be liquidated. The assets belonging to the museum will be sold to pay off debtors, and employees are facing the prospect of losing their jobs. “We will suffer big time if the museum is closed,” Dikengkeng Komane, who has been working at the museum for 22 years, told Daily Sun. “We are going to lose our jobs and we will starve.” Dikengkeng said they weren’t informed about this move. “On Tuesday, a private security guard came and changed the locks and told us the place was being liquidated and that we won’t work until further notice,” she said. “We’ve worked hard to make this place what it is and this is the thanks we get.” The employees said they wanted the Mandela Foundation to step in and rescue the museum.  If it’s liquidated, history will be forgotten,” said employee Jane Monakwane. Mandela left the house to the Soweto Heritage Trust of which he was the founder. The trust restored the house in 2008 to preserve its history through fund raising events. Thato Mothopeng, a member of Soweto Tourism, told Daily Sun they were surprised to learn about the closure. “We can’t let that happen. It will be to destroy everything Tata Nelson Mandela fought for,” said Thato. He said it will affect the economy of Soweto. Recently in the legislature, the Gauteng MEC for Arts and Culture, Mbali Hlophe, said her department was working with the premier’s office to save the museum. She said they will be meeting the liquidators to intervene. “Heritage routes are embedded in our history and are also linked to our tourism sector. Vilakazi Street, Pela Street and the Hector Pieterson Museum attract many international and local tourists to enjoy, not only the rich history of the area, but to also interact with its people and each other through food and dance,” she said. She said Soweto was considered to be one of South Africa’s top tourist sites.
