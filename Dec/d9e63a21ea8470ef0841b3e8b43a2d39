THE Mamelodi Sundowns players huddled at the end of a difficult training session on Monday, as they prepared for their league fixture against TS Galaxy. The Brazilians are reeling from the loss of yet another player, Motjeka Madisha, hot on the heels of a fellow defender Anele Ngcongca, who was buried on Thursday. The Sundowns players were still in a celebratory mood, following the club’s 50th anniversary gala on Saturday when the shocking news of Madisha’s passing broke in the early hours on Sunday. The fixture couldn't be any tougher for the defending league champions, with spirits in camp at their lowest. The dark cloud hovering above the Chloorkop base hasn't shown signs of dissipating, making this an increasingly tough in a year football battle with the Covid-19 pandemic. The club has kept mum on the devastating news, out of respect for the family. But co-coach Rulani Mokwena, who is expected to guide the team in the absence of suspended Manqoba Mngqithi, has expressed great sorrow at the loss of the defender. Mngqithi was red-carded as Sundowns were held 1-1 by struggling Maritzburg United last week. But the Tswane giants are still unbeaten in six games and top of the log on 14 points. Rookies Galaxy are ninth, having won one, lost one and drawn four. At 25, Madisha, who died in a car crash, still had the world at his feet, and Mokwena has paid an emotional tribute to the former Bafana Bafana defender. ”You did that without fail, I was your biggest critic but also one of your biggest believers, ” Mokwena wrote. ”I write this with tears in my eyes, head pounding because I’m in so much pain, my entire body feels like it’s carrying pieces of my broken heart with a piece of me torn abruptly out of my ribs. You were my son. My Ace. My Madisha. Rest In Peace my boy.”
