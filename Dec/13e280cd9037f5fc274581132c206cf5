THE human anatomy is one of the most interesting studies. From it, we learn a lot about how different and yet similar we all are in this ecosystem of life. For instance men, like women, do have breasts. And according to medical experts, men can also suffer from breast cancer. This is because men have breast tissue and can develop breast cancer. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer and can spread to other areas. Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. Other breast cancer types and disorders in men include gynecomastia, which is an enlargement or swelling of breast tissue in men. There are also benign breast tumours such as papillomas and fibroadenoma which are abnormal lumps or masses of tissues. The most common breast cancer among men is called carcinomas, which is a cancer that is birthed from the male glands.
