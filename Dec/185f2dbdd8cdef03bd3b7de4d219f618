December will always be the best month in the year. It’s the only month with the most holidays. One of those holidays falls on a 16th and it’s called Reconciliation Day. The holiday came into effect in 1995 after the end of apartheid. Its intention was to foster reconciliation and national unity for the country. In the same spirit, take this year as an opportunity to reconcile with your ex-lover and here’s how you can do it: 1.Don’t ask for a new relationship Although it may be tempting to try to wipe the slate clean and treat the reconciliation as a new relationship, you shouldn’t do it. It’s important to build on the past relationship instead of trying to ignore it. 2.Leave the past where it belongs Everyone makes mistakes, and if you are not willing to leave them in the past, you shouldn’t be trying to get back together with an ex. 3.Be honest Many relationships break up because many people are bad at communicating with each other. If you’re going to start dating an ex, you should both vow to improve your communication skills.
