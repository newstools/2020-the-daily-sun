THELMA Nomvela (50) was over the moon when she found love. But life was setting her up for a bitter blow. Thelma is now nursing a broken heart after she lost about R183 000. Her Ben 10, a William Walunsimbi, apparently disappeared with her money. Thelma said first the man in his 30s borrowed R10 000 and she gave it to him out of love. He asked for more until it totalled R33 000. According to Thelma, he promised to return it after he had done his rituals. Thelma, a teacher and a mother of three from Eziphunzini in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga, took the money from her savings account. Then her boyfriend asked her to take out a loan of R150 000 a few weeks ago and they locked the cash inside a metal trunk. She told Daily Sun the money is gone, so is William! She’s left with a huge debt to repay. “I was at home when I received a phone call from him,” said Thelma. “He said his name is William and that he loved me. He said I gave him my number but I didn’t know him. I listened as he continued proposing love to me. I gave in because I was lonely and needed someone to love me.” He came to her house and moved in with her. Thelma said every time he asked for money he would perform a ritual. “He used muthi, but I didn’t ask questions,” she said. She said he asked her to take out a loan of R150 000 last month. “In early December he took the money and disappeared,” she said. “I tried calling him but he didn’t answer. He sent me an SMS saying he will come back to pay me back and that he still loves me.” When the SunTeam contacted William, he denied knowing Thelma. He called later, admitting they had an affair. He said: “I didn’t steal the money. She paid for the good sex. She must find another man.” Thelma said she wants to open a case if he doesn’t come back.
