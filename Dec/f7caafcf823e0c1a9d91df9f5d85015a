Let’s be honest, there’s always been a perception that pink is a girly colour. The idea of a guy wearing anything pink was considered a fashion abomination and a total violation of the guy code. Thanks to the evolution of fashion, the perception has changed and women seem to gravitate more to men wearing outfits with a touch of pink. Why is this the case? History tells us pink wasn’t always a feminine colour. In the 18th century, men were known to wear pink silk suits that had floral embroideries. Those outfits were considered very masculine at the time. Secondly, women generally love the colour. From birth, women were drown more to pinkish or reddish colours. From their toys to their clothing, women have generally loved the colour pink. So, imagine a guy brave enough to wear pink? Lastly, a guy who wears pink is deemed bold and powerful. Pink ribbons were given to those who ran in the New York survivor race in 1991. Talk about power in colour.
