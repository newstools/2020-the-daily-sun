THE Basic Education Department is ready to go to court to defend its decision to have matrics rewrite two leaked exam papers. On Friday, 4 December, Minister Angie Motshekga announced pupils would have to rewrite maths paper two and physical sciences paper two.

However, no letters had arrived from teacher’s union Sadtu yet. The union said it would go to court to seek an urgent interdict to challenge the decision. Secretary general Mugwena Maluleke said the decision had left many pupils and teachers feeling upset and frustrated. “Pupils are being punished for something that is not of their making, as only a few saw the paper,” he said. Affected pupil Basetsana Kgaphola (18) told Daily Sun the subjects were difficult and studying under lockdown had not been easy. “We can’t be told we need to write again. It’s not our fault that someone was careless with the exam papers,” she said. Zenzele Mkhwatshwa (18) said he didn’t think he would be able to write again.  Oratile Pelo (18) said she didn’t mind rewriting physical sciences because it would give her a chance to study more, but she was not up for maths. “Maths is difficult and they can’t make us go through that again,” she said. An angry Lebogang Boloka (19) said it was unfair that she spent sleepless nights while others took the easy way out. “Although I’m disappointed and upset, I think it’s only fair and right because some people cheated,” she said. Tebogo Sihlangu (18) said: “I fear the new paper will be harder than the previous one.” Ronello Tivane (20) said he felt pupils who did nothing wrong were being punished. Ronello’s father, Petros, said matrics had gone through a terrible year and rewriting would affect their mental state.
