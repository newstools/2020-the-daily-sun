A former Orlando Pirates coach, who’s accused of sexually assaulting a 39-year-old woman, has been released on bail. The accused was bust after he allegedly touched the complainant’s buttocks during a Cosafa Cup game in Port Elizabeth. According to NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani, the accused appeared in the New Brighton Magistrates Court on sexual assault charges on Friday, 11 December and he was granted bail. “It is alleged that on Monday during the Cosafa Games in Port Elizabeth, a 39-year-old woman was delivering coffee at the Isaac Wolfson Stadium when she asked the coach if he would need sugar with his coffee,” she said. “He allegedly said no and disclosed that he needed another type of sugar while pointing at her private parts. It is alleged that the lady complained to her boss who in turn warned the coach not to do it again.” Ngcakani said: “Later on that day the lady went to deliver coffee again at the same stadium and this time the coach allegedly touched her buttocks. The coach was granted R10 000 bail and his next court appearance will be on 25 February 2021.”
