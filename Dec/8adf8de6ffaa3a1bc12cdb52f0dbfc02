TSHWANE have issued a strong statement in the Spar National Netball Championship which are underway at the Zwartkloof game reserve in Bela-Bela, Limpopo. The competition started on Monday and the reigning champions wasted no time setting their intentions clear on the first day. They comfortably defeated Ekurhuleni 67-13 in their first match of the tournament. Following Mangaung’s decision to withdraw, Eastern Cape teams Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo City also withdrew from the Senior A division due to fears of a spread of Covid-19 as their province was identified as the virus hotspot. This left only five teams competing for the top-flight title. Tshwane assistant coach Ivy Masebe said their first match felt too easy.”Coming here we expected a tough competition but things were too easy from the first match we played, ” Masebe stated. ”It felt like we were at training We are hoping the tournament will get tougher because we put so much time in preparing as we expected tough games.” The six-day domestic showpiece was initially set to be played in Stellenbosch in August. But it had to be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year's runners-up, Dr Kenneth Kaunda also had a convincing start beating Johannesburg 59-29.Johannesburg also lost 43-32 to Cape Town. On Tuesday, Cape Town have two tough matches against Dr Kenneth Kaunda in the morning and Tshwane in the afternoon. In the other match Johannesburg will be hoping to redeem themselves when they face Ekurhuleni.
