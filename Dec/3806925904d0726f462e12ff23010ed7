THE ANC and its affiliate organisations have called for the suspension of Sasco president, Bamanye Matiwane. Matiwane is accused of assaulting former Sasco regional secretary in the Western Cape, Noxolo Koko, at a lodge in the Eastern Cape earlier this week. Provincial deputy secretary of the Young Communist League in the Western Cape, Naledi Maponopono, said: “We hope the president can be humble and step aside until the allegations against him are resolved. “He must do this in the spirit of what Sasco stands for as an organisation,” said Maponopono. “To further intimidate women who’re speaking about the incident and threaten them with legal action is proof to us that the current leadership of Sasco doesn’t take seriously the plight of women in South Africa.” The Sasco national working committee issued a statement, saying Matiwane was seeking legal advice. Provincial secretary of Cosas, Malibongwe Sihlalo, said if Matiwane did indeed assault Koko, he must be brought to book. “Sasco must suspend their president pending the investigation,” said Sihlalo. “We cannot condone gender-based violence in our structures. “We’re clear that if he assaulted her, measures must be taken and an example must be made of him because we can’t afford to have that kind of leadership at the helm of a huge organisation like Sasco.” ANCWL secretary-general, Meokgo Matuba, called for the suspension of Matiwane. Sasco national working committee spokesman, Luvuyo Barnes, said no case was opened against Matiwane. “As far as we know as an organisation, there is no case opened against our president at this point,” said Barnes.
