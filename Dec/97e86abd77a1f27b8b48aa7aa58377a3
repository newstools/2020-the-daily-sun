KGAOGELO Tshigeng (29) is satisfied now that a case against his lover who allegedly bit his nose off has been opened. Kgaogelo from Luka outside Rustenburg, North West, told the SunTeam he feels a sense of relief that justice will finally happen. “I’m happy I was taken seriously and that my rights were acknowledged. I thank Daily Sun for taking an interest in my pain. I have managed to open a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm,” he said. He said he is now waiting for a date, so he can pinpoint the police officers who made fun of him at the station. He said this was a lesson to all that everyone has equal rights regardless of gender. Kgaogelo’s nose was bitten off allegedly by his girlfriend during a fight at a friend’s place on 12 December. His story was published on the front page of the People’s Paper on Friday, 18 December. He faced embarrassment at the hands of Phokeng Police Station officers who were supposed to help him. Upon hearing his nose had been bitten by a woman, they laughed at him and would not open a case. Ward Councillor Olga Chauke said this was a step in the right direction.
