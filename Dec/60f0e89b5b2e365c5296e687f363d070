THE festive season is here and it’s wedding season. Here are some of Mzansi’s favourite celebs who tied the knot this year under strict lockdown conditions. 1. Theo and Vourne Kgosinkwe They’re expecting a baby and have shown us love conquers all.

Mo Flava and Mbali Cele Metro FM presenter DJ, Mo Flava, has proved whoever said DJs are players wrong. In October, he announced he’s officially off the market when he shared he’d tied the knot with long-time girlfriend, Mbali Cele. In a short and brief post, Mo Flava said: “Meet Mr and Mrs Tsiki. Done and dusted. My mission is to make Mbali happy for the rest of her life. “It will be accomplished. Celebrations loading! She deserves only the best,” he said.

Hungani and Stephanie Ndlovu The talented actors got married earlier this year after they took to social media and shared pictures of what seemed like their wedding day, and then later shared a mini-documentary talking about their big day.
