THE 47-year-old woman would love a night without zombies! The woman from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she’s haunted by dead people who’re pleading for help. “They are mostly dead relatives and people I knew growing up in Mpumalanga,” she said. “They appear to be trapped and crying out for help. But when I ask how can I help them, they become distracted and I wake up.” The mother of one, who is a street vendor, said she has been praying and fasting with pastors but things seem to be getting worse. “From an early age I used to dream about dead people. After my mother died in 2018, she came to me in a dream and said she was being fed by people she didn’t know who were giving her instructions and she wasn’t in her grave.” She said she began questioning her mother’s death. “She was very healthy and died within a week after suffering from a stroke.” “Almost every night I dream of dead people asking for help. “They claim they are being trapped and not in their graves, while others say they are being attacked. “When I ask how I can help, another group of people appear and everything becomes disjointed,” she said. The woman’s sister said they believe she’s spiritually gifted and could be a medium. “She is not coping at all and her dreams are becoming a curse. “We don’t know what to do. ] We pray she gets the help that she needs.” Her 30-year-old son added: “Things are getting worse, she has lost so much weight. I wish she could get help with her dreams because they are distracting her daily life. This has also affected my life negatively, I believe she should get help she will be able to help me as well.” Gobela Joseph Dungamanzi said the woman is gifted and she needed to slaughter and perform a ceremony for her dead ancestors. “This is their way of communicating with her. They want her to acknowledge them because of her gift so she can prosper in life.”
