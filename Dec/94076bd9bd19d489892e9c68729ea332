THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Western Cape have called on the cops to hunt down and arrest a man who was seen on video assaulting a madala. A video that surfaced on social media on Monday shows an old man who seemed to be begging for something from a young man. The suspect hit the unsuspecting madala on his cheek and he fell to the ground. EFF’s secretary in the Western Cape Banzi Dambuza and party member, Ntsikelelo Tyandela, went to Lansdowne cop shop on Tuesday to open a case against the suspect. Speaking to Daily Sun outside the cop shop, the Red Berets said: “We received an assault video of an old black man being beaten up by a young man who did something very foolish. As the EFF, we are here to ensure that the law takes its course. We are here to ensure that if cops are not doing their job, we will push them to do it.” Dambuza said they have not established the name of the victim, but he is believed to be a homeless person. They said they will not rest until justice is served. “We have received the address of the perpetrator and we are here at this police station because it is the one within the jurisdiction of where the perpetrator lives. We are ready to go and pick up the perpetrator ourselves if the police are not willing to do their work,” said Dambuza. Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk said investigations were underway. “This office is aware of the video clip going around on social media, and we have registered an inquiry to investigate this matter. “Woodstock police are investigating this matter. Anyone with information about this incident is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or Woodstock SAPS,” said Captain Van Wyk.
