GAVIN Hunt is starting to sound like a stuck record, lamenting Kaizer Chiefs’ poor upfront every week. It was yet another poor result for Amakhosi as they were held 1-1 by Bloemfontein Celtic in their DStv Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday, going six matches without a win. Hunt’s laments about the lack of goals rang true as his team couldn't add to Anthony Akumu eighth minute goal and eventually shared the spoils after Tumelo Mangweni equalised for Siwelele. ”They had one chance the whole game and they scored. That's pretty much what has been the story of our season so far. So disappointed but with what we have, you know we're making progress,” said Hunt. ”I thought it was a good performance, the first half was very good you know. We've had some great opportunities, if you make it 2-0, 3-0 then it's much easier. ”The longer it stays at 1-0, they had one chance the whole game and they scored. ”But obviously you know upfront, it is what it is. The result should be better, we all know that but there are signs, there are certain signs. But you're getting hurt with every little mistake it's a goal against you. I understand that in football but you have to work a little bit harder then. ”We have to be a little bit compact and things like that, all in all certainly we should have got three points I felt it you know but it is what it is.”
