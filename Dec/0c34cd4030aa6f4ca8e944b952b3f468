THERE were smiles on the faces of victims of heavy rains in Gxididi outside Mthatha, Eastern Cape. This as they received early Christmas gifts on Thursday, 17 December from various private companies led by Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. Ndabeni-Abrahams surprised the tornado victims with more than 100 blankets and building materials. This intervention by the minister and the private companies, which included Huawei and MultiChoice, gave the families hope as some of them still struggled to rebuild their houses. One of the beneficiaries, Khunjulwa Nkunjana (38), told Daily Sun her family was still devastated by the mess caused by the heavy rains. “We lived in a three-room house, but that heavy rains destroyed everything. We don’t have a place to call home. The whole house was destroyed and we were sleeping in our neighbour’s house,” she said. Khunjulwa said she was very excited by the building materials and blankets. “We will try to build a home by next year,” she said. The storm which hit OR Tambo region last month left thousands of people homeless and injured, while more than five people lost their lives. Ndabeni-Abrahams said: “I am here as a member of parliament. We are here to bring back hope and make sure people have a great Christmas. “We called everyone on board to help us and some companies responded well with an amount of R1 million in terms of all these materials to help the affected families.” She said for now, they were helping those who were badly affected by the storm.
