FAMILIES have received Christmas goodies in the form of food parcels. The 400 families have children from the eight schools in Ledig and Mahobiskraal outside Rustenburg in the North West. Giving out the goodies, Bakubung Ba Ratheo Chief Solomon Monnakgotla reminded the families that they should not deny the children food. Unemployment is rife in the area and many children rely on food provided at schools, but the schools are closed for the holidays and hunger is a serious issue at home. Chief Monnakgotla said the action was to ensure that no child in the community went to bed on an empty stomach. “The food we’re donating today is not for uncles and aunts and friends. “It’s food for the children,” said the chief. Lydia Hlophe (44) lives with her three children and the family survives on her doing piece jobs. “This Friday is going to be a good Christmas for my children. Seeing my children happy is the greatest gift a mother can have. We are thankful for the groceries,” said Lydia.
