Thembinkosi Lorch was full of praise after his match-winning contribution to Orlando Pirates' MTN8 final 2-1 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday. Lorch started the match at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on the bench but was introduced after just 24 minutes for the injured Thabang Monare. He both won and scored the winning penalty on 53 minutes after Deon Hotto had levelled Siphelele Luthuli's third minute strike just after the half hour mark. Speaking after the game, a delighted Lorch, who only recently returned to training after minor knee surgery, praised his family, Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer and assistant Fadlu Davids. He told SuperSport TV: "Itâ€™s been a difficult year for me, and I would like to thank my family for supporting me throughout the difficulties. "I've wanted to win trophies, especially for Orlando Pirates and I'm happy to be the Champion today. "He's a good coach, he and coach Fadlu so obviously we have to follow their instructions and do the job." - TEAMtalk media
