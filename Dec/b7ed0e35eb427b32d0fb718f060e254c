NEIGHBOURS used to hear the 10-year-old girl’s screams, but they didn’t know why she was screaming. They became suspicious as she was not allowed to play with other kids. Their suspicions were confirmed when the landlord borrowed the girl’s father’s phone to play music and stumbled across sexually explicit pictures of the young girl on her dad’s phone. The landlord notified neighbours and they reported the dad to the police. He was bust on Friday 4 December. Captain Bernard Matimulane of Ivory Park Police Station said the 35-year-old suspect from Tswelopele will appear in court soon. “The man has, for a while, being suspected by his neighbours for being up to something. They observed that he never allowed his daughter to play with other children. We are told the young girl’s behaviour was odd and that she was often heard screaming in the rented room. “The landlord asked for his phone to play the music only to find sexually explicit pictures of the girl, which it was suspected were taken by the father. Nearly 40 pictures depicted the young girl in sexually explicit poses,” said Matimulane. “Preliminary evidence shows that the pictures were taken on different occasions. The suspect appears with the victim in some of the photographs.”
