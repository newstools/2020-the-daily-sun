The Unification Task Team is threatening to impound all cars belonging to Old Mutual undertakers, starting from 18 Friday, December. The task team made the announcement at a media briefing earlier on Friday, which started about two hours later as they were still waiting for some of their members. They said Old Mutual is refusing to stop operating as a funeral parlour, while being an insurer at the same time. The task team’s chairman, Muzi Hlengwa, said they are prepared to fight for their industry. “If we see these Old Mutual undertakers we will impound the vehicle and release the body for R40 000. People must stop using their undertakers,” said Hlengwa. He said they are planning a huge march late next month or at the beginning of February. “We will march to their head office in Sandton, Joburg. “Everything will be at a standstill,” said Hlengwa. He said the company can’t be two in one. “They can’t be our referee and player at the same time,” said Hlengwa. He insisted that bereaved families must move their bodies from the company with immediate effect. “They will see us as heartless people when we impound their bodies. They must take our instruction. There will be no waiting period for them if they tell us they are from old mutual,” said Hlengwa. No one from the company attended the briefing. Daily Sun tried to call the head office, but there was no answer.
