A ROBBER tried his luck at Boxer Superstore in Thulamahashe Plaza, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. He walked into the shop on Monday, 7 December and threatened to blow cashiers’ and shoppers’ brains out with a gun. He then looted cash from the till. He threatened to kill everyone as he was making his way out. His gun clicked and his hostages realised he was holding a toy gun. Realising he’d been caught out, he took off but didn’t get far. The fuming shoppers caught up with him and moered him until he fell and bled on the pavement. If it wasn’t for police and guards, the people would have had their way with him. “Kill this bastard! Kill this criminal! You wanted to rob us of our hard-earned cash with this toy gun,” shouted the shoppers. Mall guards supervisor, Foster Khumalo, said: “The angry shoppers were all over him, assaulting him with everything they came across. But we managed to rescue him with help from cops.” Meanwhile, a robber was killed and his accomplice hospitalised after they were confronted by angry residents during a robbery in Rooiboklaagte, outside Acornhoek. Colonel Donald Mdluli said he’d give Daily Sun a comment later.
