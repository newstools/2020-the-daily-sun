THIS whoonga addict wants to spend Christmas with his family, but the drug has taken over his life. The 32-year-old from Durban, who didn’t want to be named, told Daily Sun he was in matric when he was first introduced to the drug. “I’d just written my last paper. We decided to have a pens down party,” he said. “One of my friends gave me a cigarette. I didn’t notice anything different and puffed away. “Within minutes I felt very strange. It was a nice, relaxing feeling. I don’t know how I got home. In the morning I had a terrible hangover.” The man said he went back to the friend to get another laced cigarette to ease his hangover. “I’ve never stopped smoking. The addiction got so strong I started stealing,” he said. “Eventually, my family got tired of me and kicked me out. I was forced to live in the streets, and that’s where I met other addicts. “I miss my family, especially during Christmas. But I know I can’t go back home. I’ll spend Christmas here in the bushes smoking.” He said he smokes whoonga with more than 40 fellow junkies. “We no longer want to be here and seek any kind of help,” he said. The man’s dad told the SunTeam he’d done everything in his power to help his son, but nothing seemed to work. “He’s caused me enough pain. I’m now waiting for him to die, so I won’t have to worry about his whereabouts,” he said. Buyisile Mlaba from NGO Shanela Mshanelo said they were trying to get addicts into rehab. But lockdown stood in their way of accomplishing their mission. “The only thing we can do for them now is to introduce them to sports just to keep them off the streets,” he said.
