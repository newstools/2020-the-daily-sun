THE South African Post Office has warned against buying spots in queues. Spokesman Johan Kruger told Daily Sun he’d become aware of self-appointed queue marshals. They apparently ask customers for a fee to get a spot at the front,” he said. “This appears to be the case, particularly where large numbers of beneficiaries visit branches to collect the R350 relief grant.” “Customers are advised not to pay the money demanded by these queue marshals, and to report such incidents to the police and branch in question. “It should be noted that the post office doesn’t have jurisdiction over the behaviour of members of the public outside its property. “Anybody who becomes aware of postal crime in any form may report it to the post office’s toll-free hotline, 0800 020 070.” He said customers were also being asked to strictly observe measures put in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus such as wearing masks, sanitising and practising social distancing. Kruger said grant recipients could also get paid into a post office bank account.
