DJ AND producer Trendy L is celebrating 11 years in the music industry this year. The musician, whose real name is Kelebogile Moepi, said it hasn’t been an easy journey, but it has been worth it. Trendy L, from Soshanguve in Tshwane, said her experiences taught her to never give up. “My journey in music hasn’t been an easy one. I’m a qualified DJ, but I don’t get treated like one. “For years I’ve tried to go to different places and ask for gigs, but they don’t give me opportunities because I’m female. “But that made me stronger and that’s how I’m still in the game, 11 years later. They motivate me to do more and push harder.” ALSO READ|MSHOZA'S FAMILY DRAMA Trendy L said she feels the need to encourage up-and-coming female musicians so they know not to give up. “Female DJs must try to be consistent. Yes, it’s hard because we don’t get as much attention as men do, but they must not give up. “They must prove that they can do it, focus and most importantly, they should believe in themselves.” The musician studied DJing and production at the Soul Candi Institute. “About 11 years ago I was out with my brother and I saw DJ Zinhle playing. “I was fascinated by what she was doing, so much that when I got home I started researching and wanted to know where I could learn to be a DJ. “That same week I went to Soul Candi Institute and registered. I’ve been into DJing since then.” The producer recently released a single titled Mhlaba Wonke, featuring Sponch Makhekhe, last month. “I also have an album coming out soon. It’s been ready for some time now. “I’m just waiting for the right time. I want to push singles first until my brand is strong, then I’ll release the album.”
