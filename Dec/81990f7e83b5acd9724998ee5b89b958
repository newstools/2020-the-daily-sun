THERE
has never been a dull moment between Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns. From
the senior teams to the young ones in academies, it is always fireworks when
these two giants meet. This
weekend as DStv Diski Challenge 2020-21 season kick-off in Soshanguve. The
two clubs will face each other in the blockbuster which is billed for Giant
Stadium, Soshanguve on Sunday at 1pm. The
Diski Challenge returns without fans allowed at the stadium due to the
coronavirus pandemic. However,
that will not stop the show as most of the clashes will be televised on
SuperSport TV. In
the history of the Diski Challenge, the two clubs have been the most
interesting to watch as their fixture always have goals galore and ushukela, shoe shine and piano. In
January before the Diski Challenge was discontinued due to the coronavirus,
Sundowns and Chiefs played to a seven goals thriller at the same venue, with
Sundowns clinching a 4-3 victory. Players
such as Promise Mkhuma (Sundowns) and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo (Chiefs), who are
now both playing in their respective first teams, were stars of the show. Sundowns
coach, Surprise Moriri, who will be leading the club this season, says despite
not getting enough time to prepare his charges, will fight tooth and nail to
stamp their authority. “From
our side, we are raring to go,” Moriri said. “However,
we have not had much time to prepare because of exams since our teams got a lot
of youngsters. But that will not be an excuse, those who are available will do
the job. “We
had to let them focus on their exams, we did not want to stress them about
football and fail at school.” On
the other side Chiefs will be led by first-team assistant coaches - Arthur
Zwane and Dillon Sheppard. Zwane,
who has been in charge of Chiefs lads since 2016, will lead the line from the
bench with support from Sheppard, as well as Tshidiso Letsholonyane from the
youth ranks.
