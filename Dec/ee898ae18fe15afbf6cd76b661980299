The chairman of the Nandoni Complaints Resolution Committee, Solomon Baloyi said the Department of Water and Sanitation has failed them. Baloyi, who represents the families affected by the construction of Nandoni Dam in Limpopo more than 20 years ago, accused the department of not fulfilling its promise. The families were hopeful in October after deputy minister David Mahlobo visited them and promised they’d be compensated by December. But Baloyi said the department’s now dragging its feet in paying them “We are worried that the department is applying delay tactics in terms of paying households affected by the construction of Nandoni Dam. “They are not fulfilling their promise, which said we would get payment before the end of the year. “We were happy when the deputy minister made the promise, but it seems we will face a bleak Christmas this year,” he said. According to Baloyi, only 300 from around 1 400 affected households have received their monies so far. He said they have written many memorandums regarding the delay in payment but the department has been making empty promises. Baloyi and some stakeholders met the Minister of Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu on Friday, 11 December, in the Vhembe Council Chamber. This was to try and resolve the matter, which according to them is long overdue. Sisulu, who was joined by Vhembe mayor Dowelani Nenguda, started by apologising. She agreed the matter was long overdue to be resolved as the families were forced to move in 1998. Sisulu praised the affected communities for not taking law into their own hands and destroying government infrastructure. According to Sisulu, it’s the government’s responsibility to make sure the promises made to the people are met without compromise. Sisulu said she was also worried that some households have raised complaints that they have not been given a chance to dig up the graves of their loved ones but they were working on it.
