THE festive season is well underway and it’s peak season for stokvels to share their money and groceries. Unfortunately, during this time unsuspecting people get robbed of their hard-earned savings. Speaking to Daily Sun, Joburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said they get a lot of complaints from stokvels during this time of the year. Cops have now outlined safety tips for the public. “We are appealing to the community to refrain from sharing money in their homes or in secluded places,” said Mbele. He added that people should: • Refrain from withdrawing large amounts of money from the bank for sharing. • Make sure that you do electronic transfers through the bank. This will prevent would-be criminals from having targets to rob. Mbele emphasised the importance of the community working with the police to ensure a safe festive season and beyond.
