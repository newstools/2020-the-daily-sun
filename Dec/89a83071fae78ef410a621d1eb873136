TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila defender Tebogo Thangwane is a lucky man and should thank God and his ancestors. This is the opinion of Vhadau VhaDamani head coach, Joel Masutha, after Thangwane survived a career threatening injury. This during their 1-1 draw against AmaZulu in the DStv Premiership clash at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. AmaZulu midfielder Xolani Mlambo nearly broke Thangwane’s leg after he stepped on it in a horrible tackle. Referee Cedric Muvhali did not even caution the former Orlando Pirates player after the incident. Muvhali’s decision not to show Mlambo a red card has shocked many football fans, with some calling for action to be taken against the referee. But Masutha refused to comment of Muvhali’s officiating, which nearly cost his defender’s career. “You know we are a new team in the PSL and our focus is on the field to fight to win games and collect as many points as we can,” said Masutha. “I don’t want to comment on the referee as everyone who was watching that game saw everything. If I comment I will get fined and I don’t have the money. All we have to do as a team is to soldier on. “I’m just glad Thangwane was lucky after that injury, as he only suffered some bruises. We expect him back at training this week.” In 2017, the South African Football Association suspended Muvhali and his assistant Patrick Jafta for three months after a poor officiating in a top-flight clash between Cape Town City and Polokwane City. In that clash, which Polokwane won 1-0 from a dubious penalty, Muvhali and Jafta had to be escorted from the stadium by police.
