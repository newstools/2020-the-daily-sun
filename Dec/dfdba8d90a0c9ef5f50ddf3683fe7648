A MLUNGU has been living in the kasi for almost seven years and he loves it. Another thing Andre Venter loves about living in the kasi are the kotas. He said the kota is 100% kasi food and is more affordable than a hamburger. The 59-year-old from Itsoseng in Erasmus, Tshwane, said he ate a kota more than three times a week. “I also take it for lunch when I’m working somewhere. I buy it in certain places where they know my flavour,” he said. Andre said he was introduced to kotas when he moved to Itsoseng with his wife about seven years ago. “I feel good and happy when I eat kotas.” The father of four said people in the kasi have accepted him. “My family knows I live in Itsoseng and they don’t have a problem with it. Being in a relationship with a black woman taught me so much, as well as socialising with people in the kasi,” he said. Although Andre is divorcing his wife, he said he will marry again if he finds a woman who will accept the life he lives. The mlungu, who does metal work, said he also did part time jobs around Tshwane. He said that he’s also learning Tswana and other languages. Andre’s landlord, Elizabeth Mokoena (52), said the mlungu is a good person and is loved in the kasi. “We love him and he likes our lifestyle, which makes him more appreciated,” she said.
