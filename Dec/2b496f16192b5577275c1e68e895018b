RESIDENTS of Lehae, south of Joburg, want justice for a 12-year-old who was beaten to death, allegedly by her mum and boyfriend on Tuesday. This apparently happened after the kid slept over at a boyfriend’s place. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun the mum had always been abusive towards the girl. “She’d hit her with cables and basin pipes and almost drowned her in a bath tub to scare her,” she said. Another neighbour said she once beat her daughter so severely she ran away and came back two days later, only to be beaten again. KILLER WOMAN SAYS SORRY! “It was really bad. No matter how much we tried to speak to her, she never changed,” said the neighbour. The neighbour once threatened to call the police if the woman continued to beat her daughter. “Nothing scared her. She even chased away people who went to talk to her,” she said. The neighbours said police once warned her, but that didn’t help. A man who lives in the same street said he didn’t realise the abuse was this bad. “We’d sometimes see the child crying in the streets, but we just thought she was an unruly child.” Captain Kay Makhubele said the mum and lover were arrested in connection with murder.
