Bloemfontein Celtic will lock horns with Baroka FC in the DStv Premiership match at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday. Kick-off is at 7:30 pm CAT. Phunya Sele Sele are coming off a disappointing 2-1 defeat to Orlando Pirates in the 2020 MTN8 final with Siphelele Luthuli netting for Celtic. However, the Free Stage giants snapped their four-match winless run in the league when they defeated Black Leopards 1-0 before they faced Pirates in the cup clash. Celtic are placed 14th on the league standings with four points from five matches having recorded a draw against Lamontville Golden Arrows and a win over Leopards. John Maduka, the Celtic head coach, reflected on their defeat to Pirates and he added that his side should start winning their league games. "We did not make the right decisions in the final third. But I’m very proud of the boys. They gave it everything. We lost the match but with pride, having fought well," Masuka said. “We will try to motivate the guys, even though it is not easy. Everyone wanted to win badly. We will try to motivate them so we can start winning games in the league.” Meanwhile, Baroka are undefeated in their last two matches in the league having secured a 2-1 win over Chippa United in their previous match. As a result, Bakgaga Ba Mphahlele are placed third on the league standings with 11 points from six matches having recorded wins against Chippa, Black Leopards and Maritzburg United. Thoka Matsimela, the Baroka head coach, was pleased to see his side return to winning ways against Chippa and he is eyeing more first-round wins in the league. "After the drama of the past three games, I waited until the referee blew the final whistle before I could celebrate," Matsimela said. "I was relieved that we protected our lead until the end of the match. It's tough to win games in the second round. The earlier, the better for us." -SuperSport
