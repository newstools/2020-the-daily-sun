A SUSPECT who allegedly assaulted, raped and strangled Phuthi Ramara (21) was arrested on Monday, 28 December. Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the suspect had been on the run since the discovery of Phuthi’s naked body by a jogger in a playground in Protea Glen, Soweto, earlier this month. He was bust in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, following a tip-off. Masondo said the suspect was on his way to Joburg. “With the help of community members, we were able to corner the suspect (35), whose intention was to flee to Lesotho,” said Masondo. “The family didn’t know Phuthi was missing until her cousin and a friend came looking for her. “Phuthi was identified by her tiger tattoo on the neck, a flower tattoo on her right leg, and her name on her hand.” He said the suspect is expected to appear in the Protea Magistrates Court soon, facing charges of murder and rape. “Police will continue to prioritise cases of crime committed against women and children to ensure perpetrators are hunted down and arrested,” said Masondo.
