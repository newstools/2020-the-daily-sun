One can’t help but wonder why governments ignore doctors and scientists with a differing view regarding a Covid-19 vaccine. It’s in the best interests of the public to give opposing sides equal media coverage. The World Doctors Association, which consists of over 51 000 doctors, has since early this year opposed reports on the Covid-19 pandemic, wearing of masks, social distancing and lockdown. With science and medical facts on their side, they’ve maintained their position. But their views are suppressed by the media and their videos are constantly banned on Facebook and YouTube. World media also turned a blind eye to the UK’s public health bodies and the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. On 19 March, the committee decided the coronavirus should no longer be classified as a high consequence infectious disease, and it was downgraded to the same status as the common flu. Seven days later, the British government published a 358-page Emergency Bill, giving itself massive powers. That took away the freedom of the British people and turned Britain into a police state. As expected, the South African government followed suit and announced lockdown for 21 days from March 26. Why is our government ignoring critical information from the advisory committee doctors? That should have been front page news. Governments are preying on our ignorance.
