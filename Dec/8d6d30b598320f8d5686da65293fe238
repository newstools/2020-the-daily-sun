The Automobile Association has criticised the Road Traffic Management Corporation regarding outstanding traffic fines. The association said it’s outrageous and amounts to fear mongering among South African road users. This comes after the RTMC said motorists must check if they have any outstanding traffic fines before embarking on their festive journeys. The AA said the RTMC must apologise to motorists for creating a false impression of the RTMC’s law enforcement capability. In the statement issued on Tuesday, 8 December, the RTMC said: “Traffic officers are being deployed on all major routes and those found with outstanding traffic fines will not be allowed to proceed. “If this approach is followed through by law enforcement officers, it amounts to an immense abuse of power and the RTMC will effectively be stealing citizens’ rights. “It is beyond belief that an organisation tasked with enforcing the law and headed by an advocate of the High Court can make such a disgraceful statement clearly threatening citizens, instead of focusing on how to enforce the law better.” According to the AA, the statement is indirectly saying motorists with outstanding traffic fines will be arrested, which is a major contravention of South Africa’s laws. “The only time a road user may be detained at the roadside is if a warrant of arrest is issued against their name. Preventing someone from proceeding on a journey because of an outstanding traffic fine amounts to arrest without following due processes. We cannot stress how totally shameful and outrageous such a statement is,” the association said.
