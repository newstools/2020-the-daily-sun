Mpumalanga police have launched a manhunt for a suspect following the recovery of a stolen bakkie at Lebombo Border Post, in Komatipoort on Saturday, 05 December. The bakkie which was reported stolen last month was found covered with grass brooms. In the video circulating on social media, the car is seen stashed inside a truck which was covered with grass brooms. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdluli said it is believed that the driver was intending to cross the border to Mozambique with the stolen car. Mdluli said police at the border post were busy with their duties when they noticed a suspicious white one turner truck with Mozambican registration number plates. "The truck was full of traditional brooms but the members became concerned and were convinced that there was something sinister about the truck. The truck driver was not available and members got information that he had gone to SARS offices to complete certain documents required when crossing the border with goods. It later surfaced that the driver had fled to Mozambique, leaving the truck behind," he said. Mdluli said police then went to look for the driver at SARS offices but they could not find him and they began searching the truck. "Whilst removing the traditional brooms, police discovered a white Ford Ranger with false registration number plates. Upon further probe, the police found that the car was reported stolen at a garage in Sandton on 30 November," said Mdluli. Police are appealing to anyone with information that can assist police in the investigation to contact them. WATCH: POLICE RECOVER STOLEN BAKKIE! pic.twitter.com/II29vSNI0e
