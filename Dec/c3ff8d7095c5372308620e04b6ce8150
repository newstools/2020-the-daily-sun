THE SABC’s controversial Summer Song of the Year is facing fresh accusations. Sources claim Ukhozi FM’s programme manager Zandile Tembe interfered with the nomination process after Amageja by Indlabeyiphika was not nominated in the top 10. “Zandile was advised by a former SABC employee to include the song as the SABC will make money out of Amabhinca and it would ease the tension between Khuzani Mpungose and Mthandeni Manqele,” said the source. In a voice clip in Daily Sun’s possession, Zandile says they made a mistake by putting the song under Igcokama Elisha’s name instead of Indlabeyiphika. “Tshatha, you’ll correct this one for me,” she’s heard saying, to which Tshatha responds: “It should’ve been Amageja by Indlabeyiphika and not by Igcokama Elisha. We apologise for this mistake.” Another source claimed Khuzani’s song, Ijele, and Mthandeni’s song Amageja didn’t qualify to be in the top 10. The source said the songs had to be submitted, played and gained popularity on Ukhozi FM but this was not the case. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolela said the committee sources music before submission by artists. “Amageja by Mthandeni was included on the top 10 as it received a lot of nominations and was verified to be on the playlist. There was an error as the song was initially submitted by Igcokama Elisha.”
