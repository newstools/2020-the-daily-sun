Lwando Ntubeni from Khayelitsha in Cape Town is fuming after Lingelethu cops allegedly refused to assist him. According to Lwando, he visited the police station to open a case against a group of people who had stabbed him but cops allegedly refused to assist him. “The police officers told me about the curfew time. They said I must go back home and come back the following day,” he said. Lwando said he was in pain but the cops didn’t care. “I showed them the stab wound but they didn’t care. They saw the blood but still refused to assist me. What is their job if they are going to chase us away when we visit the police station for help?” Lwando said the people who stabbed him are going to walk free because he ended up not opening the case. “We are told about not taking the law into our own hands but what must we do when we are getting this type of treatment from the people who are supposed to assist and protect us. Why do they always want us to beg them to do their jobs?” aid Lwando. He wants the cops to be punished so they don’t do the same thing to other people. “What if I died while they were telling me about coming back the next day because I was bleeding heavily?” he said. His brother said what they witnessed at the cop shop was a shame. “I usually hear about people complaining about police officers but I never thought we would experience the same thing. They just don’t care about residents,” said the brother. A resident in Khayelitsha said the only thing cops are good at is beating innocent people. “They are doing all these things because they know nothing will happen to them. They don’t respect the communities and always boast about being police officers.” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said Lwando must lodge an official complaint with the police station’s management. “For the allegations to be investigated they need to lay an official complaint,” said Rwexana Lwando said he would go next week to report the matter to the police management.
