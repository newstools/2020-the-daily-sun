Dear MizzB I AM transgender and my friend’s boyfriend is making moves on me. Truth is, I really like the guy and wish to have something with him. My friend has been there for me through all my ups and downs of life, so I don’t want to disappoint her. I’m thinking of having a secret affair with the guy to protect my friend. Dear Brother Falling in love and just fooling around are two different things. First, establish if your imagination about your friend’s man making moves on you is true or not. Friendship is a valuable asset that should not be lost or risked over something that is temporary. If you really care about your friend and her feelings, please stay away from her man. Ask yourself how you would feel if the tables were turned with you at the receiving end. Good luck!
