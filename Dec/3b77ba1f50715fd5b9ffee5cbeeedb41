PRESSURE is the name of the game for Josef Zinnbauer. The Orlando Pirates coach is under no illusion regarding the task he faces guiding Bucs in the MTN8 final against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (6pm). In a coaching career spanning more than 20 years, Zinnbauer is yet to achieve cup glory, but that is not the source of pressure for him. He is carrying a weight of expectations from the long-suffering Bucs to quench the fans’ thirst for silverware. It has been six years since the illustrious team last lifted a trophy, having come second best in four cup finals since they last won the Nedbank Cup. “There is always pressure in football,” said Zinnbauer. “We always have pressure as coaches, especially working for a big club like Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns or Kaizer Chiefs. You always have pressure. I have no problem with pressure. “We know what we are doing when we sign contracts. But this is the reason why we find the best players as coaches. You have more chances to win like we do on Saturday (tomorrow). ” Celtic are equally anxious to win a trophy, having missed out on the Nedbank Cup title when they lost to Dowsn in September. Coach John Maduka said they believe that this will be second time luck for them, and against a Pirates side. “We know that we are capable of competing against anyone and we are looking forward to the game. I hope nothing will disturb us in our preparations,” said Maduka.
