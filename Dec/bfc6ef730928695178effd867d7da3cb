TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula has issued a stern warning against reckless and drunk drivers. Mbalula was speaking during a road safety campaign held at the Cricket Club in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Thursday, 3 December. He told Daily Sun: “People are dying like flies on national roads and should come to an end.” They intended to ensure road accidents became a thing of the past. “As much as law enforcement plays its part on our roads, safety should start with us,” he said. “We should be aware that once one drinks or smokes dagga, their vision becomes impaired. We need 100% sober people behind the steering wheels,” he said. It had been proven that the majority of people involved in accidents were pedestrians. “Cyclists should ensure they’re always visible on our roads to avoid unnecessary accidents,” said Mbalula. They’d throw the book on those who undermined road rules! He said every province had been given unmarked cars, and ttaffic cops who took bribes would be jailed. Transport MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya said: “We’re ready for the festive season.”
