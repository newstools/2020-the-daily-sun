The Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital in Cape Town
has appealed to the community and corporate to make this festive season about
the children. According to Acting CEO of the Red Cross Dr. Anita Parbhoo
this year has been tough on many, and children are also feeling exhausted and
even more so those having to spend their time in hospital especially during the
festive season. “For those who have given to the Hospital in the past,
please consider making this festive season brighter for young patients some
toys would be great for the patients,” said Parbhoo. She said however one sometimes overlooks the need of food
parcels for the patients to take home when they’re discharged. “It allows
parents to ensure the patient is well nourished while also allowing them some
wiggle room to be part of their children’s recovery at home without having to
rush off to work to put food on the table that night,” added Parbhoo. All donations for the children at the Red Cross War Memorial
Children’s Hospital should be made directly to the hospital by contacting Carla
Brown on 021 658 5196 or residents can support the Red Cross and patients
through their programs and infrastructure projects by donating financially
