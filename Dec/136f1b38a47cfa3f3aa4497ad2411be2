A MAN has said he was raped while the suspect puts forward claims of extortion. This after a man (28) belonging to the LGBT community claimed he was raped by a well-known banker (62), who offered him a lift home. According to police spokesman Justice Ramaube, the alleged incident took place on 4 December in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. Ramaube told Daily Sun a man who said he’s gay agreed to get a lift from the suspect when he offered. “He alleged that as they were driving via Driefontein Street, the suspect suddenly stopped his car and began to make explicit remarks. He asked questions such as what type and colour underwear he was wearing, saying things such as ‘you have nice legs’ and ‘what do you do at night when alone?,’” said Ramaube. Ramaube said the victim claimed he was uncomfortable with the remarks and asked the suspect to stop. “It was a little too late because by then the suspect had allegedly already undressed himself and threatened to shoot the victim should he attempt to get out of his car. Ramaube said the victim said after his ordeal, they drove together and the suspect withdrew money and gave it to him. However, it has also been discovered that the suspect has also opened a case of sexual assault against the victim, accusing him of extortion. “In his allegations, he said he was tormented by the victim who was demanding money from him unnecessarily. He further alleged that the victim asked him to drop him off at his house. Then along the way he asked him to stop his car, which he did,” said Ramaube. Ramaube said the suspect claimed he was undressed by the victim, then proceeded to do a mouth job on him. “The suspect said when done, the victim ran off with his trousers and clothes, including a bag containing R3 500. A case of sexual assault against a 28-year-old victim has been registered for further investigation by the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit.” No arrests have been made in both cases as investigations are underway.
