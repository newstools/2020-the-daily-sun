SEKHUKHUNE have to learn quickly from their mistakes, if they’re to mount a serious challenge for promotion to the DStv Premiership. This is the view shared by their astute mentor, Johnny Ferreira, ahead of their third match in the GladAfrica Championship. The rookies will lock horns against Richards Bay at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). Adibahlabe have talked up a big game but now the time for them to walk the walk has arrived. The Limpopo team started well in their first game when they thrashed Royal AM 4-0 to signal their intentions. But they dropped the ball last time out against Jomo Cosmos, letting Ezenkosi off the hook via a 2-2 draw. Ferreira, who has set high standards for his team this season, wants to see improvement against the Natal Rich Boyz. He has challenged his side to be more ruthless and kill off teams when they’re smelling blood, something they failed to do last time out. “Mistakes happened in our last game and I was extremely disappointed as we got so many scoring chances and wasted them,” said Ferreira. “The players need to learn that in the Championship, teams don’t give up until the last minute. It’s important to use the opportunities when they present themselves.” “But we’ve regrouped and we have a good strategy for our next game.” Sekhukhune will be eager to get back to winning ways and add to the four points they’ve amassed in their two matches so far. Meanwhile, fellow Championship newbies Bizana Pondo Chiefs and Pretoria Callies, who were promoted from the ABC Motsepe League, are poised to make their debuts in the second division. Bizana travel to Tshwane for a date with the University of Pretoria at the Tuks Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Callies will be in action on Sunday against Free State Stars at Goble Park.
