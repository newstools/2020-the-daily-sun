There was drama at the Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting on Friday 4 December. The meeting was jolted with spontaneous outbursts when council speaker Buyelwa Mafaya was manhandled out of the council meeting, allegedly by municipal bodyguards. This unceremonious ousting took place just minutes before a vote for a new mayor was about to start. Acting municipal manager Mandla George presided over the meeting under the newly-appointed speaker Marlon Daniels. Daniels then presided over the election of a new mayor and the DA, Patriotic Alliance, ACDP, Cope, United Front and AIC gave DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga firm authority to run the city. The mayor’s position became vacant after the late UDM Mongameli Bobani was ousted in December via a vote of no confidence. Bhanga said: “They can do anything that is criminal to make sure they cling to power. As the DA, we will never allow criminals to take control of us.” The DA said Bhanga was in talks with various political parties in order to form a stable coalition government. Mafaya said she would lay charges against the three guards. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu to Daily Sun that no case had been opened.
