LADYSMITH Black Mambazo has extended the time of its 60 year anniversary celebrations. The international-acclaimed scathamiya group celebrates 60 years since it was formed in 1960 by its late founder Joseph Shabalala. Many of the group’s anniversary events were interrupted by the death of the founder as well as the Covid-19 lockdown. Shabalala died in February after a long illness that forced him to retire and left his three sons Sibongiseni, Thami and Thulani to lead the group. The group has extended the celebrations up until May. Manager Xolani Majozi told SunBuzz that the 60 year anniversary celebration is a big thing to them because there are only a few groups that celebrate this milestone. “Our 60 year anniversary celebration was not going to be a one day birthday party. We planned to celebrated for the whole year. “We started celebrating when the year began, but our plans were interrupted by the Covid-19 lockdown,” he said. Majozi said they have planned virtual events that people could enjoy at home. “On Sunday, 27 December and 3 January we will have a live concert that will air on Mzansi Magic at 5pm. “The concert will feature Unathi, AKA, Vusi Nova, Mondli Ngcobo, Naima Kay, Malini, Kholenso Abafana Benkokhelo as well as artists from Ladysmith Black Mambazo Academy,” he said.
