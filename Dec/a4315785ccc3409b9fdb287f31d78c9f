YOUNG thugs are causing chaos and hijacking e-hailing taximen. But cops are struggling to deal with the kids, who’re apparently barely in their teens. Cops in Nyanga, Cape Town, said the kids are as young as 12. “There are young boys hijacking cabs here,” said Philippi station commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha. “We’re talking about 14 years and 12 years of age. And we can’t arrest them,” Many roads in Browns Farm are blocked so that Uber, Bolt and other e-hailing taxis can’t drive through. Resident Nandipha Shumi (38) said they have barricaded the roads to make sure Bolt and Uber drivers only pick people up from the main road. “This is because there are kids who request the drivers to come to our streets and then rob them,” said Nandipha. “After that they use the cars for drag racing and spinning, endangering our children.” Ncatha was worried by the rate at which kids drop out of school, and he accused parents of not doing anything about this. “How can a 12-year-old rob a cab? Government is providing WiFi hot spots for kasi youths to access the internet and apply for jobs,” he said. “But the internet is used for other activities such as inviting e-hailing cabs, which they rob.”
