AFTER Keitumetse Banda (12) went missing, her family in New Eersterust near Hammanskraal had hoped she’d be found. She was last seen with a man who’s known to them. But her mutilated body was found by a passerby in the bushes near her home. Her throat had been slit. According to her grandmother Johanna (52), Keitumetse was playing with her friends on Friday 4 December when the man took her, saying he wanted her to do something in a nearby village. “We started to look for her when we realised she wasn’t back home. “We looked for the man, but he was also nowhere to be found,” she said.  Keitumetse’s aunt, also a Johanna (30), said she received a call on Saturday 5, December that she’d been found. “I was excited, but this was short-lived when I was told she’d been found dead. “It felt like a bad dream,” she said. Keitumetse’s mum, Agnes (38), said whoever was responsible deserved to die! Captain Kay Makhubele said the girl was reported missing on Saturday morning at about 2am. “Police arrested the person who was last seen with the girl. “In the morning, a girl’s body was found next to the Stinkwater Dam with injuries.” The suspect was charged with murder and will appear in court soon.
