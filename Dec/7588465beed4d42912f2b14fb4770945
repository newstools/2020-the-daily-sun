COPS got a tip-off a drug dealer was selling from his car. When they pounced he denied having drugs. But when cops searched his car on Monday, 30 November, they found 16 small packets of drugs neatly placed under the gear lever cover. The 37-year-old male suspect was arrested for possession of drugs at the corner of Heidelberg Road and Boschoek Road in Ratanda, Heidelberg. Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said police received a tip-off about a man in a blue Opel Corsa selling drugs near Ratanda. “The car was parked near the robots and the suspect was luring passersby to buy the stuff,” he said. Tshilate said on arrival, the suspect and his car were searched. “Drugs were found hidden underneath the gear lever canvas cover. The suspect was immediately arrested. Drugs and the car used to sell drugs were seized.” Ratanda station commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Makgora Selota, commended the good partnership with the CPF and the community at large in eradicating crime in their area. Selota encouraged the community to report all criminal activities to the police immediately. He assured them that all information provided will be treated with serious confidentiality. The suspect will appear in the Heidelberg Magistrates Court soon.
