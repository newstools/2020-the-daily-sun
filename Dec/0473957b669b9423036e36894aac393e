GAUTENG Premier David Makhura has replaced axed health MEC Bandile Masulu, even though the Special Investigating Unit report into the matter hasn’t been finalised. Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi was yesterday announced as the new MEC. Makhura said on Monday, 30 November his decision to quickly appoint a new MEC was due to the surge in Covid-19 cases in the province and fears that a second wave was coming. Three months ago Makhura used the SIU’s preliminary report to fire Masuku but promised he’d reinstate him if the final report cleared him. Asked what would happen if a court sets aside the SIU report used to fire Masuku, Makhura dodged the question. “I don’t want to deal with issues that aren’t around me. I don’t want to deal with the MEC’s papers. HUSBAND: WHY I DIDN'T BURY MSHOZA! “I’ve seen them and they aren’t talking about my decision. Don’t speculate.” Masuku was fired after the department irregularly awarded a PPE tender worth R125 million to Royal Bhaca Projects. The company is owned by King Madzikane ll, husband to presidential spokeswoman Khusela Diko. Makhura said co-operative governance deputy minister and former Joburg mayor Parks Tau would be sworn into the Legislature before taking over as economic development MEC. He said Tau would be sworn in some time this month after finalising matters at the ministry. “I’m doing my job to make sure Gauteng is in good shape to handle the surge in Covid-19 and HIV/Aids cases,” he said.
