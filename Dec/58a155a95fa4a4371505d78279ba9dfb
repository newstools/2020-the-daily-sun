PALESA Madiba’s mum Khosi Galisitwe will visit her daughter’s grave to deliver the good news to her. This comes after Dumisani Mkhwanazi was found guilty on all five charges against him by the South Gauteng High Court. Khosi was seen smiling for the first time on Friday 4 December since she has been attending the murder trial. She said: “I told myself that after this I will go to her grave and tell her we have won the fight.” She said although she was happy Mkhwanazi was convicted, she was still hurting that she lost her daughter. “I feel happy but have pain in my heart. I’m happy that justice has been served. I will have peace in my heart,” she said.  After Judge Prince Manyathi delivered a verdict, the family and members of the community gave a rapturous applause. As Mkhwanazi went down to the cells, he showed journalists the middle finger as he was not happy with the verdict. Khosi said her daughter’s killer doesn’t deserve to be part of the society.  “He’s a danger to our children. They must take him where people like him are. A life sentence is good for him. I used to see it on TV and never thought it could happen to me. I will share my journey with other mothers and encourage them to believe that all will be well,” she said.  Manyathi found Mkhwanazi guilty of murder, theft, defeating the ends of justice and possession an illegal firearm and ammunition. Sentencing in the matter is set for 26 February 2021.
