  CAPE Town City star midfielder Mduduzi Mdantsane has urged
his teammates to be more disciplined this weekend when they host Orlando
Pirates in a Dstv Premiership match. City host Pirates at Danie Craven Stadium in Stellenbosch on Saturday at 3pm. Mdantsane who has been one of the outstanding performers for
The Citizens since the 2020-21 season started says discipline will be the key
to three points. “Emotions are always high when we play Pirates,” Mdantsane
said. In the recent two meetings of these two sides, Cape Town
City got two red cards. Mpho Makola and Fagrie Lakay were given marching orders in
their past two meetings against the Soweto giants. Both dismissals came in the 33rd minute of the first half
with Makola got sent off in the bio-bubble on 23 August, while and Lakay was
sent off for an early shower in the MTN8 quarterfinal on 17 October. However, The Citizens managed to hold on and collected
maximum points in the bio-bubble defeating Pirates 1-0 despite being one man
down. They went on to lose with the same scoreline in the MTN8 quarterfinal. Mdantsane said they will need to calm their heads and grind
results this weekend. “In the bio-bubble, we got a red card and got away with it
as we won the game but it was a different story in the cup game. We will have
to be very cautious and disciplined because once we are one man down everything
just becomes difficult, we will struggle to match them. “We all know they are a big team we give them respect.” The Mpumalanga born player joined City midseason in the last
campaign. It took him sometimes to settle in Cape Town, and now he says he has
settled hence his performance is slowly getting better to the player we know
that was Baroka FC engine a couple of seasons ago. He said: “You know changing teams always comes with
challenges. When I arrived here it was a bit difficult but now things are good
I understand the culture of the team and everything better.”
