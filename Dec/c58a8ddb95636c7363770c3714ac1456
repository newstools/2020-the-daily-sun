THE holiday season is finally upon us! Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, many of us are looking forward to some much-needed downtime. While many of us will be taking a break from work and school, some will be looking forward to taking a break from the stove and a lot of braaing will be taking place. As the braai season kicks off, here are some braai tips to make you the hottest braai master: 1. Quality over quantity Many of us would rather worry about how much meat was brought instead of what meat was brought. Don’t be afraid to spend a little more at a quality butcher. 2. Hygiene We’re still in the middle of a pandemic, so hygiene from your braai master is key now more than ever. All utensils must the cleaned at all times. 3. Do not freeze your meat Don’t freeze your meat as ice crystals stab holes into the muscle and your meat will be less juicy during the braai. 4. Invite the right people Most importantly, invite people who you’ll enjoy the beef with instead of beefing with them.
