THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has confirmed that the MTN8 final will be played in Durban. The final will be between Bloemfontein Celtic and this competition’s second record winner Orlando Pirates on 12 December (6.30pm) at the venue. Since the stadium was reopened in 2010, this will be the sixth MTN8 final at the venue that hosted the 2010 World Cup semi final. The venue hosted the first Wafa Wafa Cup final in the 2010-11 season. Pirates beat Moroka Swallows on penalty shoot outs. The venue also hosted the 2013-14 season in which Pirates were in the final but lost Platinum Stars. Pirates were back again at the venue in the 2014-15 season against their biggest rivals – Kaizer Chiefs, but again they lost. The other final was in the 2017-18 season in which SuperSport United defeated Cape Town City. These two teams were back again at Durban’s iconic venue and this time Cape Town City avenged the score to crown what was Benni McCarthy’s first trophy as a head coach in 2018-19 season. That was the last time it hosted the final as last year’s event was hosted at Orlando Stadium in which SuperSport beat Highlands Park. While Pirates are in the final for the fifth time since MTN took over the sponsorship in 2008 and last time won it in 2011, it is the first time for Bloemfontein Celtic under the telecommunication. Siwelele won it when it was known as a Supa 8 in 2005. They defeated SuperSport when Rotson Kilambe scored the winner under Paul Dolezor.
