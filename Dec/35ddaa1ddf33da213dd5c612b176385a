THE Malawian government has been accused of stealing money from Prophet Shepherd Bushiri. This is money he paid in advance to use Bingu Stadium, but the decision was later reversed. According to Malawi Times, when Bushiri asked for a refund, the money, amounting to K5 million (kwacha), could not be traced – only K800 000 reflected in the system. Lingadzi police station in Malawi confirmed that they arrested Wongani Ng’oma and Edwin Kambalame for theft, but the third suspect was still at large. Lingadzi police spokeswoman Salome Zgambo said the duo allegedly committed the offence on 3 December. She said the third suspect was a principle accountant at Ministry of Youth and Sports. “On 3 December, Enlightened Christian Gathering Church (ECG) booked Bingu Stadium for an overnight crusade, which was later cancelled and the church demanded back the payment,” she said. She said the ministry asked the first suspect to arrange the deposit slip and payment vouchers for the accountant general to process the funds for ECG. But the first suspect failed to produce the documents and later revealed that he shared the money with his superiors at the ministry. Zgambo said the suspect only deposited K800 000 and the remaining money was misappropriated. “Police have so far recovered K3 million from the first suspect. “Enquiries are underway to recover the remaining money and the arrest of the third suspect,” she said. Meanwhile, Bushiri had to settle on using a park for the overnight service on 31 December. The church was granted permission by private-run Umodzi Park to host the service at the Malawi Square. Church spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said the square was part of Umodzi Park, which comprised of a five-star hotel and conference centre. Nyondo said they will be guided by Covid-19 regulations and wearing a mask, practising social distancing and sanitising, were important. He added that people would need to produce Covid-19 negative certificates.
