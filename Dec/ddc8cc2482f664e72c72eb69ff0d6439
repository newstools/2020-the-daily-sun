PUBLIC Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has been summoned to appear in court early next year to answer to three perjury charges. The charges relate to her appeal to the Absa report, where it was alleged she misled the court about how many times she’d met former president Jacob Zuma. According to the charge sheet, Mkhwebane misled the court in three affidavits, in which she allegedly unlawfully and intentionally said incorrect things. The affidavits relate to her appealing a court decision that set aside her remedial action and findings into what’s known as the Ciex report. This matter relates to a loan by the SA Reserve Bank amounting to billions to Bankorp, a company currently owned by Absa. Investigations into the “lifeboat” loan were started by her predecessor, Advocate Thuli Madonsela, after a complaint was laid with her office in 2010. In her final report, Mkhwebane charged that the Reserve Bank and government failed to recoup the money from the owners of Bankorp, which was Absa. Mkhwebane said a parliamentary portfolio committee must amend the Constitution and redirect the primary objective of the Reserve Bank of protecting the currency. The Reserve Bank took the remedial action to court for review to be set aside and won, but Mkhwebane appealed. Mkhwebane’s office declined to comment on the matter and referred queries to the National Prosecuting Authority.
