PUBLIC Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, deputy public protector Kholeka Gcaleka and acting CEO Yalekile Lusibane led staff members in celebrating the Public Protector South Africa’s (PPSA) achievement of a clean audit. This was reported in the institution’s 2019/20 annual report. The celebration was held in Tshwane on Thursday. Mkhwebane said this was the first time in the PPSA’s 25-year history that the institution’s financial statements were found by the Auditor-General South Africa to be in order. She said the closest the PPSA came to this prestigious audit outcome in recent years was in the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years, when the institution received back-to-back unqualified audits with findings. According to Mkhwebane, the PPSA’s audited financial statements for 2019/20 told the story of an institution in good financial health. Its accumulated deficit dropped to R1 million in 2019/20 from R2,6 million in 2018/19 and R19 million in 2017/18. “As things stand, the PPSA’s assets far exceed its liabilities, marking a turning point from previous years during which the institution’s solvency came into question. “Corporate governance matters aside, the PPSA also performed well, achieving nearly 80% of its targets,” she said. She said in the year under review, the institution exceeded its target of finalising at least 7 000 matters in its caseload by nearly 5 000. She said between April last year and March this year, the PPSA had a caseload of 15 245 matters and during that period, the institution managed to finalise 11 643 cases. “These are not just numbers, we really made an impactful change in the livelihoods of many disadvantaged communities through the resolution of thousands of complaints pertaining to access to drinking water and housing, undue delays in paying out pension and workers’ compensation benefits, unlocking the lives of victims of identity theft and addressing the plight of small business people,” she said. Mkhwebane attributed the success to her office’s 357 staff members. She described them as the foot soldiers who made the institution shine.
