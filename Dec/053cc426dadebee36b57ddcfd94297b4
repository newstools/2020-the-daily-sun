COP shops are supposed to operate 24/hours. But residents from Samora Machel in Cape Town complain that their local cop shop closes at 10pm. One of the residents, who asked not to be named, said:“When you visit the police station after 10pm, you will find it closed. ”The resident said one of the police officers said the cop shop closed because there were not enough police vehicles. “They must stop what they are doing especially now that it’s the festive season. A lot is going to happen and we are going to need them,” said the resident. Bongani Maqungwana, member of the community policing forum, said they heard about the complaint and visited the police station during the hours in question. “The residents had been complaining and we went there after 10pm and found the station operating,” he said. Bongani said the police officers closed the big gate because of security. “They only open the small gate. The residents can go there and see for themselves,” said Bongani. Captain FC Van Wyk said the station commander said the police station operated 24/7 with no limitations. “According to him, he met all structures and stakeholders in the area and they know that the station is fully functional. We have four shifts for CSC and CPU that operate 12 hours around the clock plus CPU operations that are sometimes led by our Vispol head. There is not a single day the station is closed and our station’s visit register can be used as evidence,” said Van Wyk. He said the cluster and provincial office stand-by officers always found the station active and operational throughout the night. Van Wyk also denied there was a shortage of vehicles at the station.
