A WELL-KNOWN Eastern Cape bishop, who was rumoured to be dead when fake news circulated after he contracted coronavirus, has died. Rev Mthobeli Matyumza, the bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa in Queenstown, died at an East London Hospital on Tuesday. Fake news circulated on social media last week, claiming Matyumza had died of Covid-19 after he tested positive. That prompted the church to issue a statement to dispel the misinformation. “It was important to disclose the bishop’s status in order to fight stigma as well as to alert the people that the virus still exists,” said the church. “It’s further important that we caution our people about spreading information they come across, particularly regarding supposed deaths. “It’s not our business to announce the death of people but the family concerned.” On Tuesday, Presiding Bishop Purity Malinga confirmed that Matyumza had died at an East London hospital. She said: “Our heartfelt sympathy, prayers and thoughts are with his wife Vuyokazi, their three daughters, the wider Matyumza family and the Queenstown Synod at this very difficult heart-rending time.” Malinga said funeral arrangements would be announced in due course. In a video that circulated on social media last week, members of the church in the Zwelitsha circuit, which falls under Queenstown synod, were seen dancing without masks. The video came at a time when the central part of the province had become a hot spot. The province has 149 510 positive cases, with 5 586 deaths.
