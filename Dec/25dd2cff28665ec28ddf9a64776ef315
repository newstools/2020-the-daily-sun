SUPERSPORT United on fire striker Bradley Grobler is targeting 20 goals this season. The Bafana Bafana forward was speaking following Matsatsantsa a Pitori’s 3-1 DStv Premiership win against Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. The 32-year-old scored a brace for the Tshwane outfit. United’s other goal was netted by Thamsanqa Gabuza, while Baroka’s goal was an own goal by Grant Kekana. So far, Grobler is the joint leading goalscorer in the Premiership with Themba Zwane of Mamelodi Sundowns. They both netted seven goals each. “I am happy with the way I have been doing this season,” said Grobler. “You are always happy as a striker when you are scoring goals. I have seven goals and my aim is to score 20 goals this season. “It will also be good for a South African to end as the leading PSL goalscorer this season. I am optimistic that I can do it if I can manage to avoid injuries and keep working hard. But I am not going to put myself under pressure. “The aim is to take one game at a time and hope to continue with this form.” The Joburg born player said victory against Bakgaga was a Christmas present for their fans. “It has been a tough year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and our fans cannot come to stadium to watch us, so this win was for them,” said Grobler. The three times PSL champions are third on the log with 15 points. Kaitano Tembo’s lads are three points behind leaders Downs.
