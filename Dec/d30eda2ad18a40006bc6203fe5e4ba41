SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter has admitted that his players have surprised him with their fearless approach and how they have easily adapted to his system in the DStv Premiership. However, Truter has given credit to three “old horses” – Lebohang “Cheeseboy” Mokoena, Vuyo Mere and Musa Nyatama, saying they have played a huge role in his team. The Dube Birds, not only are playing without fear, but they have surprised with their dynamic approach. At times they play without a striker, but that has worked well so far. The Birds lie second on the table with 12 points from six games, two points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. They are one of four unbeaten teams left in the Premiership. “Kudos to Cheeseboy, Musa Nyatama and Vuyo,” said Truter who was named the DStv Coach of the Month for October/November. Truter praised his old horses. “These guys have played at the highest level. They have been there done it and they make my job so much easier,” said Truter. “The young players feed off from them and these senior guys are always ready to give advice.” Truter said that he and Swallows remain a close book and that is part of the reason why they have been successful in the opening games. “We are new but if you want to analyse us, you can do so but we are not going to change that much. “We want to put the pressure on our opponents as much as we can.” Playing without a recognised striker has made it difficult for clubs to plan against them. “We changed the structure and sometimes we play with a false nine,” added Truter. “Sometimes we don’t play with a striker at all. But there are one or two players we signed before the deadline that will make their appearance soon.”
