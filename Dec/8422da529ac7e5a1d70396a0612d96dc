TWO  men released an amapiano song last month which they dedicated to the man who helped them get houses. David “Poponki” Moeketsi (60) and Jacob “Wakhe” Motsepe (48) said the song was dedicated to Mpho Nthite, the chairman of Rama City in Tshwane, as he had helped them get RDPs last September. At the launch of their song titled Mpho Nthite, the two said residents loved it and told them to continue making music. Poponki said age was just a number and he planned to pursue a career in music. He said he wanted to take amapiano to another level. He said they wrote the song in August and would start working on an album soon. “This song is for Christmas and we believe it will carry us through to next year,” he said. But Poponki said he would not let fame control him as he had a wife to think about. Poponki, who lived in a shack in the North West before getting his RDP, said: “This song will encourage Mpho to continue helping others. I admit we discovered our musical talent late, but we won’t disappoint.” Mpho said he started the development of Rama City to give people the opportunity to have their own homes. “The two men appealed to me for help and I had to do something. I gave them my blessing to produce a song with my name,” he said. Singer and dancer Chomee also praised the duo.  She said: “I’m happy with their catchy song and what it stands for.”
