FAMILY and friends gathered to say goodbye to Bafokeng queen mother Semane Molotlegi yesterday. Among those who attended the memorial service at the Bafokeng Conference Centre in Phokeng, North West, were Health MEC Madoda Sambatha and Rural Development MEC Desbo Mohono. Paying tribute, Molotlegi’s friend of 30 years, Kevin Dowling, said he’d remember her for her captivating laughter and charisma. He said the life of Mmemogolo, as she was affectionately known, was testimony to her dedication to her people. “Working alongside her over the years was an experience I’ll never take for granted. She was a woman of faith,” he said. Community member Bosha Ramorwa said Mmemogolo’s people were comforted by the fact that she left behind a great legacy. “She carried so much light. She was an adviser and a great leader. The lessons we learnt from her will always be remembered,” she said. “She taught us how to use our own hands and survive. She was a remarkable woman. “She played her role on earth very well and we thank God for her life, which was well lived.” Royal family representative and Mmemogolo’s daughter, Doreen Khama, said she was a selfless mum. “Our sister and mother was not defined by tradition. She was defined by love,” she said. “She was a symbol of humanity. Her compassion and dedication to fight came naturally. “She was always ready to assist. She was indeed a great woman who lived her life as a servant.” Mmemogolo will be buried on Saturday.
