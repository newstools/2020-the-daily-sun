SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has challenged young midfielder Sipho Mbule to maintain consistency throughout the whole season following his bright start. The 22-year-old midfield maestro has begun the current campaign like a house on fire, playing a starring role alongside red-hot striker Bradley Grobler for Matsatsantsa A Pitori. But Tembo has seen this movie before with young Mbule. He had a similar start to last season with a couple of eye-catching performances early on, but could not keep up that level for the whole campaign. Tembo is hoping things will be different this time around. “Sipho technically is one of the best players in the league,” said Tembo. “But he has got to change his game as well, maybe not change who he is and his style of play but he needs to affect matches on a more regular basis than he is currently. “He is extremely creative and has the ability to score goals. He needs to do a lot more of that. “He gets into good areas and that too needs to happen on a regular basis. “I think his fitness levels need to improve because I noticed that when he gets tired he starts making a lot of mistakes and that’s another area we need to put a bit more work on. “But generally, I’m satisfied with his progress at the moment. He had a good start last season as well, but he tailed off towards December. “He completely disappeared and only started playing again towards the end of the season in the bubble. “So we need him to be a little bit more consistent this season, score more and create more. We can’t have a talented player like that and we don’t use him to his full potential.” Mbule, who has scored once and provided two assists in his four appearances in the DStv Premiership so far, will be looking to pick up from where he left off before the Christmas recess. Matsatsantsa will resume their campaign with a clash against Chippa United at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on the 5 January.
