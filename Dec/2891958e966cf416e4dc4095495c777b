SOUTH Africa has finally made a down payment to secure the country’s entry into the Covax facility after missing the opportunity on two occasions. A payment of R283 million has been made through the Solidarity Fund to the Covax facility in a bid to accelerate the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines in Mzansi. The down payment represents 15% of the total cost of securing access to vaccines for 10% of the population, which is about six million people. The country’s membership in the Covax facility ensures that Mzansi receives its equitable share of the vaccine once it becomes available. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said: “It’s a privilege to oversee a process that has brought together government, international partners and business for the sole purpose of delivering quality healthcare to the people of South Africa. “This is what we’ve been advocating for when we speak of multi-sectoral collaboration, and it’s gratifying to see this spirit being harnessed for the good of our people, Africans and the global village. We convey our sincere gratitude to the Solidarity Fund for its unwavering support to government to ensure that no one is left behind as we seek to protect our most vulnerable citizens against the scourge of Covid-19.” The DA, which has been pushing for the government to make the payment, has welcomed news. Its spokeswoman Siviwe Gwarube said: “We want to understand how the storage will work and how will the vaccine be distributed to the most remote places in the country. The government needs to be transparent and explain how it will handle the roll-out of the vaccine.” She also pleaded with South Africans to refrain from making unnecessary trips and always keep their distance when in a crowd.
