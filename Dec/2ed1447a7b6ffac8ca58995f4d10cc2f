AS NEW Year’s Day approaches, municipal cops and lifeguards are making sure people don’t set foot on beaches on Friday! This follows reports that unhappy rural residents in the Eastern Cape were threatening to force their way onto the beaches. Beaches in the province and elsewhere were closed by President Cyril Ramaphosa a few weeks ago following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Most residents have welcomed the decision, but some felt the president was being harsh on local business and ordinary people. King Sabata Dalindyebo Hawkers Association chairwoman, Thembeka Gawulekhaya, told Daily Sun the decision to make beaches no-go areas spelled doom for people in her line of work. “There’s a possibility our kids won’t be able to attend school in January, or won’t have school uniform,” said Gawulekhaya. Municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampozo confirmed to the SunTeam that 16 law enforcement officers had been sent to Coffee Bay and Hole in the Wall to ensure beaches remained no-go areas. “It’s true that there are people who have tried not to comply with regulations but I can tell you they were turned away by officers as they tried to enter beaches,” he said. Mampoza said Mayor Nyaniso Melani had already met with various stakeholders and traditional leaders to make sure no one broke regulations and that beaches remained closed until Sunday 3 January. Meanwhile, Port St John’s Municipality sent extra officers to Second Beach to make sure no one went on to the beach illegally.
