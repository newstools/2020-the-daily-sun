Human remains believed to be that of a missing ranger were discovered on Thursday, 17 December, at the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga. Provincial police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said the discovery was made not far from where the 51-year-old field ranger was last seen by his colleague about a month ago. Mdluli said the park management notified police about the gruesome discovery and upon arrival, a team of forensic experts collected the remains. “DNA tests are underway to ascertain if the human remains are that of the ranger who mysteriously went missing about a month ago. Other items used by field rangers were also recovered at the site and it is believed that it might be the ones which were used by the missing ranger. “A probe on what has actually transpired is in progress to reveal details about how the victim disappeared,” he said
