A BROKEN heart and tears are the biggest curses. This is a warning from Gobela Grace Ndlovu and Gobela Joseph Dungamanzi. They told Daily Sun not all bad luck and bad spirits were the result of muthi, but were the tears and pain people caused others. Ndlovu said thugs, murderers, heartbreakers as well as people using evil spirits were bound to pay for their deeds. “Not all people who seek help from izangoma are cursed because of muthi. They are suffering because of the pain they’ve caused others. “There isn’t a greater curse than breaking someone’s heart and making them cry. Our hearts are fragile and can carry the biggest pain. When people cry because of the pain caused deliberately, their tears do not fall in vain, but haunt those who caused them,” said Ndlovu. She said lives were destroyed by tears. “Some become drunkards and nothing ever works out. They think it’s witchcraft, but it’s not always the case. When we reveal to them during consultations that it’s the pain they have caused in the past, they become shocked. “Some have abandoned their children, leaving mothers in tears. They might be gone, but those tears will follow them. “Even in families, so much pain is caused,” said Ndlovu. “But when two people retaliate by using muthi against each other, they will never get along.” Ndlovu said asking for forgiveness was the answer. “Whatever we can do as izangoma will be a constant temporary solution until they ask for forgiveness to those they have harmed. Dungamanzi said tears carried the greatest power. “It’s demonic when thugs steal people’s hard work and they will pay. A heart can create the biggest wound and it cannot be healed easily. Those who harm and cause pain need to know that the biggest curse lies in the heart and tears,” he said.
