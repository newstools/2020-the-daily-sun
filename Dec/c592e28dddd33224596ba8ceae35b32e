IF YOU’VE forgotten to fill up your tank at the petrol station, don’t worry. There is a new smartphone app called Refuel, which delivers a full tank of petrol or diesel straight to your car. According to a report by Business Tech, the fuel is delivered in a custom-built truck with all necessary safety features, which carries both petrol and diesel. “Refuel saves time and money by not having to find a fuel station as refuelling gets done while you’re at your desk. Another factor which influenced the development of the app is security and safety. It’s an unfortunate reality that fuel stations are a growing crime hot spot, so there are clear security benefits,” said Refuel’s co-founder Ricky Luntz. Luntz said the price per litre is the same as one would pay at a petrol station, plus a nominal service fee of R20 each time a vehicle is filled up. Refuel reportedly keeps customers updated throughout the process by letting them know when the refuelling truck is en route, and by sending notifications. “The app was finalised just before lockdown but Covid-19 forced us to pivot from what was initially a consumer offering to one that has far stronger corporate focus, added to which we are now refuelling many fleets, bowsers and generators,” said Luntz.
