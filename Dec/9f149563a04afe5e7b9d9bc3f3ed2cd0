MAMELODI Sundowns relaunched their quest for another continental title on a positive note with a 2-0 win over Jwaneng Galaxy in Botswana, Lobatse Stadium on Tuesday afternoon. After six seasons of Champions League football under Pitso Mosimane, who guided them to the 2016 crown, Sundowns started business in the elite continental club football competition without the new Al-Ahly tactician as they are now under the guidance of three co-coaches, Manqoba Mngqithi, Rulani Mokwena, and Steve Komphela. The trio did not disappoint as they managed to get the victory which ensured they end the year on a high. Mothobi Mvala and Peter Shalulile scored the crucial goals to ensure the Brazilians return home victorious. Sundowns took an early lead in the 10th minute through Mvala, who neatly placed his right-footed effort into the back of the net after Lyle Lakay did well to pick him out inside the box. The Brazilians doubled their lead just seconds into the second half when Shalulile pounced on a loose ball after a mistake from the Jwaneng defence. Sundowns were last involved in Champions League action in March when they lost 3-1 to Al Ahly on aggregate in the quarter-finals, who went on to win the title. They came to this encounter without star players such as Themba Zwane, Kermit Erasmus, Rivaldo Coetzee, Gaston Sirino, George Maluleka, Keletso Makgalwa, and Hlompho Kekana. However, the 2016 champions proved their depth as they went all the way to win the encounter. Sundowns handed a first-team debut to newly-promoted Siphesihle Mkhize who was promoted to the first team alongside Musawenkosi Mdhuli. Sundowns will now host Galaxy in a return leg which is scheduled for 6 January next year.
