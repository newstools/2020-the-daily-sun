RISING YouTube stars are pleading with Mzansi to help them buy a new camera and microphone. The actors behind the online series Abafana The Boys vs Amantombazane The Girls told Daily Sun their equipment was stolen. Series writer and director Sanele Sikhakhane said they were forced to stop filming. “The camera and microphone were joined together. What makes it worse is that we only had one camera and microphone. We were saving for another camera. I took the kids out for a trip on 24 December and when we came back, the equipment was gone,” he said. “I bought everything for R11 500 and that’s the amount we’re trying to raise. So far, we have received donations of R1 800. We still have a long way to go and we hope South Africans will come through for us.” He said he was worried about the kids who worked on the show because they sacrificed their holidays to be available this month. “All the kids decided not to go away for holidays. They chose to stay as they wanted to be better at acting. We had planned on filming every day this month. They are my biggest worry because they’re heartbroken.” Sanele said they started filming the series three months ago and were proud of its success. “I didn’t think the series would be big this year but I had faith in these kids and this series. “I knew they would do well. The talent and content was unique. I just didn’t think it would happen this fast. I’m proud of them. I just hope we’ll be able to raise funds soon so we can get back to work,” he said.
