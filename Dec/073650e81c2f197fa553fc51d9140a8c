GABISILE Shabalala has once again called on motorists to obey road rules. The Mpumalanga community safety MEC said this after a speeding driver lost control of his car, drove into a roadside ditch, and had to swim out. The incident occurred on the R40 road in Dwarsloop, outside Bushbuckridge, on Saturday. Shabalala said traffic volumes always go up at this time of the year, when people visit loved ones or go on holiday. “With an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, there’s a likely increase in the number of crashes. “We’re calling on all road users to be cautious and obey the rules this festive season and beyond. “Many lives are lost during the holiday season. It should be everyone’s responsibility to help government curb road accidents. “These crashes are a result of speeding, driving unroadworthy vehicles, tiredness and drinking. “The department needs buy-in from road users.”We need responsible drivers who will always prioritise their own safety and that of other road users. We cannot afford to lose more lives due to reckless and negligent driving.” She warned that traffic cops will be tough on those who disobey road rules. “We’ll stage roadblocks, law enforcement operations, road safety campaigns and rest stops on most routes, especially those identified as hotspots,” she said.
