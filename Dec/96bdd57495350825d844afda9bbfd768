POLICE are investigating a case of attempted murder and an inquest docket after Robert Sibanyoni (46) allegedly shot his wife before turning the firearm on himself. The shocking incident happened in Sgagule Village outside Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge on Thursday evening, 17 December. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said the reports indicate the husband had an argument with his wife where it turned violent. “It is believed that the man then allegedly shot her before turning the gun to himself. “Police as well as the paramedics were notified about the incident and upon arrival the man was certified dead at the scene. Meanwhile, the woman was taken to hospital where she is receiving medical attention,” he said. “We strongly condemned the sad incident and make a clarion call to couples to make use of structures such as services from social workers and faith-based organisations whenever they come across life challenges rather than to kill themselves and their partners,” said Mdhluli.
