MANY companies have officially closed shop for 2020, a challenging year that was marred by Covid-19. Many employers and employees are looking forward to the December holidays. Sadly though, some of us will be still grinding and working through #KeDecember, and like my late wise mkhulu would say: “We are going to have to make ourselves comfortable in an uncomfortable situation.” For those who will be working through the festive season, here are some tips to help you enjoy working through this period: 1. Have a creative working plan If you are going to be tempted to join those who are on holiday already, then get your tasks and projects out of your head and onto paper (or into an app). 2. Create a fun working environment Create a festive, happy work environment. From decor and food to ambiance, make working during December fun. 3. Find time to relax and unwind Linked to the second point, take some time out during quiet working periods to reflect on the year and reward yourself for every work milestone you achieve during this time.
