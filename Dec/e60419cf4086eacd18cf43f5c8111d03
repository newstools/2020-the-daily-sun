KAIZER Chiefs have received a welcome boost with the recovery and return to training of their top striker Samir Nurkovic. The Serbian is yet to feature for Amakhosi this season owing to his injury. The 28-year-old underwent surgery on his groin after the last game of their campaign in the bubble and has been unavailable ever since. And his absence has been felt by Gavin Hunt’s charges, who have only scored three league goals this season. As a result, Amakhosi languish in 13th spot on the standings with five points from as many matches. Nurkovic’s return will be welcome by Hunt, who has seen his side struggle particularly in attack. And having scored 13 league goals last season, Nurkovic’s return has been eagerly awaited. “Samir Nurkovic returns to training this week. His progress will be monitored and further updates will follow,” the club revealed on their social media. The club also provided a promising update regarding defender Reeve Frosler’s potential return date. Frosler, who sustained a knee injury in their 2-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates in the MTN 8, could be back as soon as next month. “Reeve Frosler is recovering well from his knee injury and will remove the brace this week. He is expected back in January,” added the statement. Amakhosi will be looking to turn their fortunes around when they face Black Leopards in their rescheduled match. Initially meant to be played on Tuesday, the clash has been postponed pushed back by a day. This after Chiefs’ Caf Champions League clash against PWD Bamenda of Cameroon was also postponed this past weekend. Chiefs and Leopards will now do battle on Wednesday at the FNB Stadium (7.30 pm).
