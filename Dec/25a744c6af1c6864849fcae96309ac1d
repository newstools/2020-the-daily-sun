BEN Ngubane has admitted there was a possibility that people outside of Eskom were using people within the company for their own agendas. Ngubane told the Zondo Commission on Tuesday the country had an issue with governance, which he said was due to cadre deployment. He claimed he knew nothing about a 2015 deal that saw Eskom pre-paying R1,68 billion to Optimum Coal Mine for coal supply for a year. The deal was made while he was chairman of Eskom’s board. It turned out the deal was structured to benefit Gupta-owned company Tegeta as the company used the money as a guarantee to buy the mine. Tegeta’s Salim Essa gave instructions to Eskom executives on what to include and leave out of the agreement. Ngubane said former Eskom legal head Suzanne Daniels came to his office with documents already drawn up and told him there was an emergency. He said the documents were already signed by former head of generation Matshela Koko, and there was a letter from the mineral resources department. “I’m thoroughly disappointed in Daniels. I relied on this lady for everything at Eskom. I didn’t even know about this project until she brought documents to me. “I was hardly involved with primary energy issues, which is coal and diesel,” he said. Ngubane told the inquiry former public enterprised minister Lynne Brown seconded Brian Molefe to Eskom after CEO Tshediso Matona was suspended in March 2015. “We approached the minister to present our problem. She said Molefe would help Eskom and we were happy with this,” he said. Ngubane said he was not surprised that Molefe was suggested to take over at Eskom because of his known abilities. “Among black people, there are very few people with the capability of Molefe,” Ngubane said.
