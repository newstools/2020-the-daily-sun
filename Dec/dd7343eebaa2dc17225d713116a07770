A YOUNG man has been recognised for his heroic moment when a Golden Arrow bus was robbed. One of the passengers told Daily Sun they were robbed of their cellphones by three armed men while travelling at night from Cape Town to Mitchells Plain. “We didn’t notice that the driver had run off and left us there, but our hero came to our rescue,” he said. “He took control of the bus and drove us to safety.” Another passenger said if the unnamed driver didn’t drive the bus, the criminals could’ve come back for more. “We did not know he didn’t have a licence when driving the bus, but he did a great job,” said the passenger. Golden Arrow’s spokeswoman Bronwyne Dyker-Beyer confirmed the incident saying they made contact with the hero to offer him the opportunity to obtain his learner’s licence and driver’s licence with the assistance of their training and assessment centre. “This will open many doors for him, which include the possibility of becoming a professional bus driver.” She said the driver ran off to get help. A resident said what Golden Arrow did was good but the hero risked the passengers lives. “It could’ve ended in tears. Thank God nothing happened and everyone was safe,” said the resident.
