ASLO READ | VUYO'S DECISION TO CALL IT QUITS BACKFIRES She begrudgingly joins her dysfunctional family for the first Christmas holiday in years, and it’s not the merry return of the prodigal daughter everyone was hoping for. She manages to ruin her younger sister’s Christmas wedding before it even takes place, and spends her next six days frantically trying to get things back on track. In a previous interview with Daily Sun, the show’s creator Rethabile Ramphakela said: “When we were creating this series, we wanted to create something for December. “This is because South Africa doesn’t have its own Christmas special in terms of film and television, so we thought about a fun comedic story about a wedding with a disastrous family.” A post shared by Netflix South Africa (@netflixsa)
