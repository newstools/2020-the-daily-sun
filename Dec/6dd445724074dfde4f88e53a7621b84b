INSTEAD of saying cheers to the weekend like Rihanna once sang, we are about to say cheers to the year 2020. A year that can best be described as an abnormal year, with Covid-19 ravaging the entire globe, many of us resorted to stress relieving mechanisms such as alcohol. This industry, like many others, went through a financial crisis which saw some brands struggle to make a decent turnover. According to the Spirit Business global platform, popular alcohol brands were ranked in terms of their overall performance during the 2020 financial year. We take a look at some of the popular brands we are fond of in South Africa that made the top list: Smirnoff The Diageo-owned Smirnoff dropped down two places on the list to become the sixth biggest-selling spirit brand in the world. Johnnie Walker Walking in at number 9, it is the only Scotch brand to make the list despite seeing a drop from its 2019 numbers per case sold by 2,8%. Bacardi Coming in at number 10, the Rum Brand Champion 2020 for the second year in a row is Bacardi, which grew by 3,9% to reach 17,8 million cases.
