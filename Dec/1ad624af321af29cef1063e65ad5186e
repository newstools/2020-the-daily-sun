FORMER Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi is still fighting for his life in hospital. But the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in Palm Ridge, Joburg, has issued another warrant of arrest for him for not appearing in court. Agrizzi was supposed to appear on Thursday 3 November, alongside co-accused Vincent Smith, a former ANC MP, on corruption charges. In court, Smith confirmed that he had got rid of his previous lawyer to appoint a new one. Agrizzi’s lawyer Advocate Mannie Witz told the court his client was still in the ICU. State Advocate Peter Serunye told the court he had received guarantees for property owned by Agrizzi in Italy. These were among the conditions put in place by the South Gauteng High Court following his bail appeal. “The state is in position of the title deed, we have received guarantees from the accused,” he said. Giving an update on Agrizzi’s health, advocate Daniel Witz said: “He’s got specialists attending to him and his health is slowly improving, but he still has a long way to go. “They’re hoping within the next few weeks he’ll be discharged, if his health continues improving. At the moment, he’s still on various machines. I went to see him. I can’t take instructions from him, he gets tired. There’s so much medication. “I’ll probably go see him either today or tomorrow, just to bring him up to date and up to speed with what’s been happening with the court appearances and with various aspects,” he said. On the high court’s bail conditions, Witz said his client was following them. “The only condition he can’t comply with is once he gets discharged from the hospital, he has to report to the Douglasdale Police Station once a week,” he said.
