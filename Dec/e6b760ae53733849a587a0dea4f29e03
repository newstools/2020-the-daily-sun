SUMMER is the season for all kinds of creepy crawlies. Every insect seems to come out and thrive at our expense. One of these insects are ants. Deemed the strongest and the most hardworking insects, ants, much like flies, have a mob mentality. The minute you spill or drop any kind of food on the floor, they come flocking in their numbers to attend to your mess. Some also have self-made residences in our homes and the question is: how do you naturally evict these unwelcome tenants? 1. Vinegar Mix a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray it directly onto the ants to kill them. 2. Lemon juice Just like vinegar, lemon juice also seems to destroy the scent trails that ants follow. 3. Cayenne pepper or black pepper Ants hate cayenne pepper. Black pepper will work just as well too. Create a great wall of pepper around the areas they reside in. Itâ€™s guaranteed they will not bypass this wall.
