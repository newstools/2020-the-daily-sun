THE Department of Correctional Services has confirmed that Andile Lungisa is a free man. The former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor, who was sentenced for assaulting a DA councillor in 2016, has been freed on parole after serving two and a half months of a two-year sentence. He’s submitted several unsuccessful appeals and was waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on his sentence. He approached the court in a bid to overturn his two-year sentence to correctional supervision. Department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo confirmed Lungisa was released on bail on Tuesday, 1 December. “Lungisa is classified as a first-time offender with a positive support system, and having responded positively to rehabilitation programmes, parole placement for Lungisa is in line with Section 73 of the Correctional Services Act,” he said. “Lungisa initially served 16 days before he was released on bail pending his appeal application. “He was readmitted to continue with the sentence in the corrections system on 17 September after his appeal application was unsuccessful. “The special remission of sentences granted by President Cyril Ramaphosa reduced Lungisa’s sentence by 12 months. “This parole placement means Lungisa will serve the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections, wherein he will be expected to comply with a specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until the sentence expires.”
