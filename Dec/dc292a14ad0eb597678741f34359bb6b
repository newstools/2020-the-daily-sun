PATRICE Motsepe has refused to be entirely drawn on his campaign for the Caf presidency but has admitted his ambitions for the home highest office. The Mamelodi Sundowns supremo is vying for the top job along with three other candidates, though they are all yet to pass the prerequisite vetting test. However, Motsepe, who's bid to become the eighth Caf president has caught many by surprise, has remained mum on the interest in the position. ”It will be extremely premature for me to say anything. This is the time for me to listen and be exposed to be the views of various leaders and presidents,” said Motsepe. ”There see excellent candidates, good capable people. But I don't want to talk about that now. We will have a press conference and make the appropriate announcement at the right time. Motsepe has gone on a charm offensive with a campaign trail that is gathering speed by the week. He rolled out the red carpet, or rather the Sundowns yellow, for several heads of federations on the continent on Saturday. Among those in attendance at the Sundowns 50th-year celebrations were a delegation from Nigeria, Zambia, Benin, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
