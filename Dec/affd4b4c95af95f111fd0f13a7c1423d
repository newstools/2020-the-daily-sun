A WOMAN who was raped, emotionally abused and set on fire by a prophet wants women to know men of God can be abusers. The 28-year-old from Diepsloot, north of Joburg, said the the father of her three-year-old child tricked her. She’d gone to the prophet’s house with other congregants in 2017 to prepare for church when he gave her what he said was holy water. But it was drugged and she became drowsy and fainted. She said she woke up to find the man naked, and it was clear he’d had sex with her. “When I wanted to go to the police, he beat me and told me he’d kill me and my family,” she said. “I had a boyfriend I loved very much, but after drinking that water I started despising him.” She dumped her boyfriend and started dating the prophet. She later became pregnant. “I was devastated. I wanted to get rid of the child, but he noticed I was pregnant,” she said. The woman said she started loving her unborn baby after a few months and swore she’d leave the prophet. But she continued living with him after giving birth. Last January, she finally fled and went to live with her brothers in Alexandra, north of Joburg. “He took the baby and again threatened to kill me. He demanded I come back but I refused,” she said. The woman said the prophet in June poured petrol over her shack while she was inside and set it alight. “He’s now in police custody but the case is dragging. I really hope justice won’t fail me,” she said. The woman’s 36-year-old brother said he hoped other prisoners “dealt” with the prophet. “At one point I felt as if I’d failed my sister, but I realised it wasn’t my fault. He’s sick and needs to burn in hell,” he said. Police spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo, confirmed cases of rape and assault were opened. “He’s in prison and the case is still being investigated,” he said.
