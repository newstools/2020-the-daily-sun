GENERATIONS: The Legacy star Manaka Ranaka has given birth. Manaka, known as Lucy Diale on the SABC1 soapie, had her first baby boy on 15 December. The actress took to Instagram to introduce her boy to the world. She posted his arm and captioned it: “Soooooo good to be finally here. Now, where should I put my bags?” Her fellow industry mates such as Basetsana Kumalo, Nhlanhla Nciza, Bokang Montjane and Zola Nombona commented on the post and congratulated her.

Manaka, who already has two daughters, spoke to Daily Sun in October and said she didn’t care about the baby’s gender. “People have been saying they hope I’m carrying a boy, but we’ll see. I look forward to giving birth to a child. I don’t care if it’s a boy or a girl, as long as it’s not an animal,” she said. The actress said she doesn’t subscribe to the notion that boys are heirs. “Boys and girls are equally important and have different functions in society. I don’t believe that boys are necessarily better. According to society and cultural norms, they’re carriers of legacies. Girls also bring kids into this world,” said Manaka. The star has been on leave from Generations: The Legacy since last month. Shared post on Time
