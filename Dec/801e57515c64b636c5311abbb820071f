YET another cup final, yet another trophy for Pitso Mosimane! The ex-Mamelodi Sundowns has delivered a treble for Egyptian giants Al Ahly, making good on his promise to club president, Mahmoud Al Khatib. The Egypt Cup, achieved through a penalty shoot-outs win against El Gaish at the weekend, was Mosimane’s 15th coaching career trophy and remains as special as the first one he won with SuperSport United back in 2004. It’s yet another feather in Mosimane’s cap, the Al Ahly coach having etched his name in the history books after he achieved a second treble in a season with different clubs, following his exploits with Mamelodi Sundowns. He has added to Ahly’s Caf Champions League and domestic league triumphs with a penalty shootouts victory over a gutsy El-Gaish side at the Borg El-Arab in Alexandria on Saturday. Mosimane’s stock has continued to rise since his arrival at Al Ahly in October on the back of a treble win with Sundowns with whom he clinched the league, the Telkom Knockout and the Nedbank Cup. But it wasn’t a walk in the park for Al Ahly, who conceded in stoppage time and saw the game go into extra time. Mosimane completed the work began under Rene Weiler, who was jettisoned despite leading Al Ahly to the league championship. The ex-Sundowns coach ensured they deliver on the first Champions League promise, a feat his predecessors couldn’t achieve in seven years. To underscore his achievement, Mosimane guided Al Ahly to victory against bitter rivals Zamalek, a 2-1 win to add a second star to his CV. What’s next? The Caf Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup are his next targets. “We still have two tournaments left, and need to fight to clinch them,” said the ambitious coach from Kagiso.
