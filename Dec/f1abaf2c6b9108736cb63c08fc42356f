NEWLY appointed AmaZulu coach Benni McCarthy said he shares the same ambitions with the club. In fact, McCarthy said his ambitions are higher than those of the club’s president, Sandile Zungu, whose ambitions this season is to see the team finish in the top four. McCarthy said he wants to do better than that and believes the players assembled by the club this season can do the job for him. “The investment the chairman has made into the club means that the future is there for us to compete,” said McCarthy. “We don’t want to just fill up the numbers. We want to be up there at the top. When I had my first job as a coach (at Cape Town City in July 2017 until November 2020), I didn’t do bad. We overachieved what we imagined.” The 43-year-old, in his first coaching job, guided Cape Town City to the MTN8 final in his first season in charge, losing to SuperSport United in the final. But the following season, City beat SuperSport in the final of the same Wafa Wafa Cup. With how Usuthu president flexed his muscles in the transfer market, McCarthy said these players can help the club win their first trophy since beating Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 in the Coca-Cola Cup final at FNB Stadium in 1992. The club signed Makhehleni Makhaula, Sicelo Mkhize, Siphelele Nene, Thembela Sikhakhane, Limbikani Mzava, Samkelo Mgwazela, Siphelele Mthembu, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Xola Mlambo, Veli Mothwa and Phakamani Mahlambi on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. “With what this club already has, it is just for me to put it together,” said McCarthy. “The chairman wants to finish in the top four. My ambitions is far greater than his. My baby steps are over. Now I’m ready to compete. I’m not arrogant about it, but I know what I can bring to the table.” McCarthy was not on the bench when Usuthu lost 2-0 to Golden Arrows in the DStv Premiership match. Assistant coach Alan Freese was in charge.
