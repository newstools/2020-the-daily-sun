A man was
caught on camera firing a gun at a toll plaza in Pretoria on Sunday. Footage of
the incident shows the man firing multiple shots into the air while a group of
people sing "jou ma se p**s" in the background. The
incident happened at the Doornpoort toll plaza, which is operated by Bakwena. Charmaine
van Wyk, PR manager for the Bakwena N1N4 toll road, said the details of the
incident were unclear. "We
are aware of the incident that took place at Doornpoort plaza," she told
News24. "The
matter is under investigation with the local authorities at present." Gauteng
police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said a preliminary investigation
revealed that personnel who witnessed the incident did not report it to police. He said the
police later opened a case. "Police
opened a case of discharging a firearm in a public place and negligent handling
of a firearm," Masondo added. Police are
searching for the man and have appealed to members of the public who have
further information to contact their nearest police station. SOURCE:
