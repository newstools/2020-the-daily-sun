Almost R12, 5 million has been spent on social grants every month, an additional R50 million during Covid-19, and in May alone almost R200 billion was paid out to 11 million recipients in May. The South African population stands at about R58,78 million. If all South African citizens, who qualifies, received the once-off R1 million social grant, even if they can pay all South African citizens, then cancel all social grants relief programs/funds this will go a long way for all citizens. Meanwhile, the average man in the street is worried sick about wastage and misappropriation of these funds. Is this a case of history repeating itself? During the Zuma administration, trillions of rands were misused for personal gain by politicians. In Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s so-called New Dawn, trillions of rands will at some point most likely have been used for personal gain by so-called leaders. Surely, a total administative clean-up is needed in order to put a stop to this. Letter by Skhumbuzo Bolotini Elandsdoorn
