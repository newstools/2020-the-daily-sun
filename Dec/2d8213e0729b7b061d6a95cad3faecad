The holiday season is here. Despite Covid-19 still in our midst, many of us are already planning vacations and family visits. This means many of our homes will be left vacant during these holidays. Holiday stats show this is the time of the year where house break-ins become prevalent as many of us are seldom home. So, here are some ways to keep your home safe and secure during the festive season. 1. Keep your travel plans offline Social media is a powerful and harmful tool. More often than not, we tend to become complacent when it comes to what we share. Be careful of sharing your travel plans online. You don’t know who’s watching. 2. Keep a healthy relationship with your neighbours No man is an island and during the festive season, you need a third eye to ensure your home is safe in your absence. 3. Hide all your precious belongings Should you find yourself in an unfortunate situation of experiencing a house break-in. Always make sure you don’t keep any valuable items in the reach of criminals.
