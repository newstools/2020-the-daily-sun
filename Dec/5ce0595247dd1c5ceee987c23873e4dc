BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coach John Maduka hopes lady luck will be on their side when they face Orlando Pirates in the MTN8 final at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (6pm). The former Celtic midfielder has instructed his players that, if they don’t win, no one will remember them but if they win, then victory will be etched in history. The Mangaung-based outfit have lost the last two finals they have played in recent years. They narrowly lost the Nedbank Cup in the delayed season last term at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns. Before that, Siwelele, who are in the Wafa Wafa Cup final for the first time since the cellphone provider took over the sponsorship in 2008, also lost the Telkom Knockout final in 2017 to now defunct Bidvest Wits in Durban.Celtic’s last trophy was in 2012 when they lifted the Knockout, which was also played at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.Maduka, who lifted this cup in 2005 with Celtic when it was known as SAA Supa 8, said it will leave a bitter taste to lose another cup final after working so hard to get to this stage, having defeated Sundowns and SuperSport United en route to the final.“It’s not good to be in the cup final and not win it,” said Maduka.“Because at the end of the day people will not ask who was in the cup final. People will ask who won the cup final.“This is our second cup final in a space of two or three months, so it is very important to go all out and make sure that we win this cup.”Despite Maduka’s desire to see the club he made his name with win this cup, he’s under no illusion of the task that lies ahead.He has taken notice of Pirates’ unbeaten run so far.During this unbeaten run, Bucs beat Celtic in a DStv Premiership match last month.Pirates also sent out an ominous warning in the MTN8 quarter-final, beating Cape Town City and in the semis against Kaizer Chiefs when they scored five goals on aggregate against Amakhosi without conceding a goal.“We expect a very tough game against Pirates. But we strongly believe that we are capable of competing with anyone,” said Maduka.
