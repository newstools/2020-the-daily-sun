INITIATION schools in Cape Town have been stopped from opening their doors due to Covid-19, but some people in Khayelitsha are ignoring he ban. A community member, who did not want to be named, said the government was confused. “How can they open beaches and taverns and close initiation schools?” said a resident. “I would do the same thing if I had a boy.” He said the initiation aims to instil good moral and social values in young men. “This is an important practice. Initiation is not for political parties. They need to respect that.” He said they know that the decision was taken without consulting the traditional leaders. “Why did they allow it in the Eastern Cape where the number of infections are increasing every day? I am supporting the parents who take their kids to initiation school,” said the resident. Sikelela Zokufa from Somagwaza Institute and also a traditional surgeon said they heard about the initiation huts that were built in Khayelitsha. “We have reported it to the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport,” he said. He said the department will have to take action. “The surgeons will have to answer because they didn’t follow what the government said. We also wanted to continue, but we had to respect what we were told,” said Zokufa. Another resident said initiation schools are far safer than other places government have opened.
