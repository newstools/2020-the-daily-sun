BLACK Leopards coach Dylan Kerr admitted that his boss David Thidiela is not happy with Lidoda Duvha’s recent results. Leopards have now gone four consecutive DStv Premiership matches without a win. The Venda-based side have collected only two points from their last four games after two defeats and two draws. They are currently second from bottom with five points from eight matches. “The chairman is angry as he should be for the points we have lost,” said Kerr, who succeeded Patrick Aussems last month. “The chairman doesn’t like to lose like all of us.” Kerr has been in charge of Leopards for five games, winning one, drawing two and losing two. The Englishman said here are players who have cost them to drop points due to lack of commitment. He went on: “I will accept any blame from my chairman, but players have a responsibility too when selected. “My job is to manage them better by instilling mentality not to lose. “The chairman has put together this squad with others (other coaches) and while we play 70% good, that 30% is costing us and costing us big.” Despite his players’ poor form, Kerr said his job is safe as he has the full support of Thidiela, who is well known for firing coaches if the results are not forthcoming. “The chairman is always supporting the team and he is behind us,” said the former Baroka coach. “In our past three games, we started well and we somehow panicked and changed how we were playing. “I’m positive that we’ll get things right when the league resumes after the Christmas break.”
