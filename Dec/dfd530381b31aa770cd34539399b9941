MAMELODI Sundowns have parted ways with Katlego Otladisa without making his debut in the Masandawana senior team. Otladisa was spotted whilst playing for Platinum Stars in 2017. In January 2018 he made the move to join the Brazilians but his stint there was not a fruitful one. He made few appearances with the club’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge team before being loaned out twice to Cape Umoya (now Cape United) and later to Ajax Cape Town (now Cape Town Spurs). On his first loan stint with Umoya, Otladisa featured in just 10 GladAfrica Championship games for Umoya and scored one goal in a season which saw the club finish 10th on the league standings Last season he was with Ajax and struggled to make regular appearances when the club finished the campaign as runners-up. Sundowns announced on Friday in a statement that they have parted ways with the speedy winger. "Mamelodi Sundowns would like to wish you all the best in your future endeavours and we are proud of the contribution you have given to the club," the club said.
