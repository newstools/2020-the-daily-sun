A TAXI squad member has been arrested for possession of an unlicensed firearm. Joburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele told Daily Sun that the 37-year-old man was but this morning in the Joburg CBD. Mbele said police were doing their routine crime prevention duties when they saw a suspicious white Toyota Hi-Ace skipping a red robot. “They gave chase and stopped the vehicle,” said Mbele. He said there were two occupants inside the vehicle. Police searched them and recovered a firearm with live rounds from one of the men. “He failed to produce a licence to possess a firearm,” said Mbele. He said the firearm will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if it was used in the commission of other crimes. “Investigation is underway and the suspect will appear soon in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court soon,” Mbele added.
