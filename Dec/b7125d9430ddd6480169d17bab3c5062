THE Hawks have arrested three people in Polokwane for fraud on Thursday, 17 December. This follows the public outcry over 40 shacks worth over R2,4 million meant for temporary shelter for Talana Hostel residents in Tzaneen, Limpopo. The three people, who include a housing official, were arrested in Polokwane for alleged fraud of the temporary housing units meant for the hostel dwellers. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said the suspects include a project manager from the Housing Development Agency (35) and company director (44), who built 40 units that don’t conform to the design and specifications required. “The suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court on 18 December to face several counts of fraud. “More arrests are imminent as the investigation continues,” said Maluleke.  The shacks were officially handed over to 40 families by Premier Stanley Mathabatha, accompanied by MEC Basikopo Makamu of the Department of Human Settlement in August this year. Soon after the outcry, Limpopo’s Human Settlement Department also suspended the construction of multi-million rand shacks near Burgersfort.  About 152 shacks to the tune of around R10 million were being constructed in Apiesdoring outside Burgersfort at the time. The department’s aim was to alleviate overcrowding in informal settlements in line with Covid-19 regulations.
