Raffles and events, both physical and online that will make LaLiga fans vibrate. Africa and America will have eight activations, Asia with nine, 14 in Europe and 11 in MENA. As part of the campaign, football fans in South Africa will be able to enjoy blockbuster, non-stop football action on LaLiga’s dedicated football – SuperSport LaLiga on DStv Channel 204.
