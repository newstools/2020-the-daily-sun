CHURCHES used to be a place of safety for women and kids But this isn’t the case anymore, thanks to pastors taking advantage of people. A newly-formed organisation, the Council of Christian Elders, is now working to fight these pastors and bring dignity back to churches. Spokesman Apostle Mzoxolo Oliphant said the name of the church had been tarnished and people didn’t trust it anymore. They held a workshop at Welwitschia Primary School in Delft, Cape Town, over the last weekend of November to discuss challenges facing the church.

Representatives of churches around the Western and Eastern Cape took part in the event. Bishop Justice Jamangile Mbana of My Father’s House Bible Church in the Eastern Cape said: “A lot is happening that has put the church in a bad light, and we’re working on ensuring many people see the good in the church. “We’re unhappy with what’s happening, so we came up with this body to deal with it.”
