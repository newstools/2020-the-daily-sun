Next year it’s the municipal elections in Mzansi. The ANC has been in power for more than 26 years and is expected to win, albeit with a lesser margin. I digress. Not so long ago, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced that the country has entered the second wave of the coronavirus. I hope this second wave doesn’t present an opportunity for politicians and government officials to steal PPE money once again. I hope the government has put systems in place to prevent this from happening. We can’t afford another wave of PPE scandals. Covid-19 has claimed many lives, especially the elderly. In some cases, it has wiped out three or more family members, almost at the same time. That’s how deadly this pandemic is. Last Saturday, I went to Mohlakeng near Randfontein to visit a friend. There, I saw people partying and dancing without wearing masks and without care. It was barely a week after Mkhize announced that the country was into the second wave of the pandemic. People may be lockdown regulations-fatigued. That is why they don’t wear masks. But Covid-19 is still very much with us. And it kills. Fellow citizens, comply with lockdown regulations.
