THE first One-Day International of the three-match series between South Africa and England has been postponed to Sunday, Cricket South Africa (CSA) has announced. This decision results from a player from the Proteas team testing positive for COVID-19 after the teams’ last round of scheduled testing performed on Thursday ahead of the ODIs. In the interests of the safety and well-being of both teams, match officials and all involved in the match, acting CSA CEO Kugandrie Govender and her England Cricket Board counterpart, Tom Harrison, have agreed to move the first match to Sunday. The amended tour dates are as follows: Sunday, 1st ODI, Eurolux Boland Park, Paarl (Day Match) Monday, 07 December – 2nd ODI, Six Gun Grill Newlands, Cape Town (Day-night Match) Wednesday, 09 December – 3rd ODI, Six Gun Grill Newlands, Cape Town (Day-night Match)
