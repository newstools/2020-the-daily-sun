FAILING to lift the Cosafa cup title last year still hurts on Amajita players. The Mzansi cream of the crop were defeated 3-0 in last year's finals by the hosts Zambia and this time around they will be out for avenge. The Cosafa Cup is scheduled to start on Thursday in Port Elizabeth with the final set for 13 December. Amajita, who are the hosts, aim at following in the footsteps of Banyana Banyana and Amajimbos (Under-17) who recently won the Coasafa title in Port Elizabeth. Helman Mkhalele’s charges are in Group A alongside Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Mozambique. Midfield star Oswin Appollis, who was part of the team last year, said things just did not go their way, however, this time they will do whatever it takes to win the tournament. “Losing in last year’s final was a painful experience for all us who traveled there,” Appollis said. “We so much wanted to win the tournament, however, it was never met to be. Things just did not go our way on the day. “Going into this year’s camp, we had a chat as players and everyone was in agreement that we need to top our performance from last year. Everyone in the team is just driven to win it this time around and I truly believe that we can.” The SuperSport United player is the most capped player in this squad with 10 caps as Mkhaleles roped in new blood in his squad. Amajita need to reach the final of the tournament to book themselves a place in the next year’s U-20 Afcon tournament set to take place in Mauritania. Appollis added: “My dream now is to help the team reach the final and win the tournament. It will also be a dream come true for me to represent my nation at next year’s Under-20 Afcon.
