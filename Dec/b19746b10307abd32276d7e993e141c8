A MUM and her three children died in a shack fire on Wednesday, and her two other children were left fighting for their lives in hospital. The sad incident in Itsoseng, North West, left residents shocked. According to police, the 33-year-old mum and her kids, aged between 10 and 17 died while the remaining two, aged eight and 13, managed to escape. North West police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “It’s alleged the fire was started by a stove. “Someone was warming food and fell asleep.” Local councillor Oupa Marapyane said he was told at about 8am on Wednesday by a ward committee member. “I was informed that a mum and three children burnt to death in a shack while another two children were rushed to hospital with serious burn wounds,” he said. “Burying four people will put a huge burden on the family.” The councillor appealed to SunLanders to help the family with items such as food, clothes and building materials. “The father of the woman is very traumatised for losing his daughter and grandchildren at the same time,” he said. Marapyane said the mum tried to save the children but only managed to get the two survivors out. Family members were still too traumatised to talk about the incident when the SunTeam approached them for comment.
