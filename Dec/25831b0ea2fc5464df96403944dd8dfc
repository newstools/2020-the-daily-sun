AS THE curtain slowly goes down in 2020, Mzansi boxing community is ending the year in style with two boxing feasts this weekend. Both mouth-watering showdowns will take place in Gauteng. Throwing the first punch will be TLB Promotions with a five bouts event which will be headlined by the SA and ABU welterweight championship between Mzoxolo Ndwayana and Thulani Mbenge at Kagiso Memorial Hall tonight. The tournament, themed “Don’t look away, Keep Punching”, is meant to create awareness on gender-based violence. The following day all roads will lead to the Golden Gloves show at Emperors Palace, where WBA Pan African cruiserweight champion Akani Phuzi will put his crown on the line against Johnny Muller. TLB Promotions boss Joyce Kungwane said she is elated to be able to stage a second tournament this year after a tough 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It’s all system go for our event. I’m excited and looking forward to it. “I thank Gauteng Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation Department for their support,” said Kungwane. She said it is challenging to organise a tournament under Covid-19. “It is very challenging. The processes are draining, testing of people and the bio-bubble. It’s worse when you are organising not knowing the Covid-19 status of fighters,” she said. This has been a tough year for local boxing as three tournaments that were scheduled for this month were cancelled due to Covid-19 and one in KwaZulu-Natal called-off after a promoter failed to meet Boxing South Africa’s basic requirements. The tournament billed to stage the IBF World Flyweight Championship defence title between Moruti Mthalane and Jayson Mama as the main bout and the WBA Middleweight Pan African title fight between Nkululeko Mhlongo and Walter Dlamini has been cancelled.
