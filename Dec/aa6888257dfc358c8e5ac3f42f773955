AFTER hundreds of shacks burnt down, many of the victims were forced to seek shelter in a church. Tamara Mlamla (34) from Masiphumelele in Cape Town said they were now living in fear of becoming infected with Covid-19. “We get donations almost every day and collect them at the same place. Some people don’t even have their masks on when they know they are going to meet other people.” Tamara said she feared many people were still treating the virus as a joke. “If you tell someone to get a mask, they say you think you know better than them,” she said. Daily Sun visited the area recently when Mayor Dan Plato handed out food parcels, blankets and mattresses. The SunTeam noticed many people didn’t have masks. Tamara said: “You could see for yourself when you first arrived that many people didn’t have masks. If we continue like this, we are not going to survive the second wave.” Another resident said the government had done everything it could to teach people about the virus. “If people want to die, the government should let them. These are adults who stay with elderly people but if they are acting like children, let them die,” said the resident. Mayor Plato also urged residents to take the virus seriously. “We can only win the battle against the virus when we work together. Everyone needs to do their part. Wear your masks at all times and wash your hands,” he said.
