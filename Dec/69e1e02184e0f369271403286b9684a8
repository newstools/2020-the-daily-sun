JOBURG Metro cops have been strengthened by the addition of more than a 1 000 new members. The launch, attended by Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, was held at the Orange Farm Sports Complex, south of Joburg, today. “They’re now fully qualified officers,” said Makhubo. “We have confidence in them and hope they honour the role they’ll be playing to bring back the dignity of the city.” Makhubo spoke about criminals who’ve turned themselves into landlords and developers. “They illegally grab land and rent it out to the less fortunate.” Makhubo said he was worried because the invasions happen in front of members. “At Nana’s Farm near Lenasia, south of Joburg, officers watched as people erected shacks. I asked them what they were waiting for and they said they only have live ammunition. Now, the land invasion rapid response unit will always be ready and stop invasions when they start.” Speaking about GBV, he said he watched a video of a six-year-old boy who wanted a gun because his girlfriend was cheating on him. “The person who shot the video seemed to find humour in what the child was saying. That child should have been reprimanded so that he loses the mentality that when things go wrong in a relationship, violence is the answer,” said Makhubo. He said this is the start of a safer city and all these issues that were addressed need to be implemented. Mazibuko said: “Crime in this area is sickening. The city has become a playground for foreign nationals. They run all these businesses that our people should be running.” She said foreigners sell drugs to the youth, and that they prostitute and traffic women and children. She said: “Criminals will want to capitalise on this difficult time, destroying as many lives as possible. The units need to keep a close watch on them and work to restore confidence among the people of the City.”
