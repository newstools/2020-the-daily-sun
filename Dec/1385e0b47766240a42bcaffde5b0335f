THE meteoric rise of youngster Kayden Francis fills Chippa United’s DStv Diski Challenge coach Siya Gwambi with so much pride. The 17-year-old recently became the youngest player to ever represent the Chilli Boys in a top-flight match. He made his first-team debut against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) a little over two weeks ago. That was a proud moment for Gwambi, who had helped nurture the youngster in the Chilli Boys’ reserve team. It’s moments like that which show the importance of the Diski Challenge, insisted Gwambi. “I had a tear in my eye when I saw him come on for his senior debut,” said Gwambi. “As a coach in the reserve structures, you live for moments like that. We push these boys so hard in an attempt to get them ready for the next level. “And he (Kayden) was one of our best players. We knew that he was destined for bigger things. “This competition has played such an important role in affording these youngsters a clear pathway to their dreams.” Gwambi has the task of producing even more youngsters for the senior team, with Chippa focusing on youth. Lehlohonolo Seema has built a relatively young team since taking over as the senior side’s head coach and will rely on the Diski team to produce more gems for him. The Chilli Boys’ reserves are currently in 10th spot on the standings, having picked up three points from two matches so far.
