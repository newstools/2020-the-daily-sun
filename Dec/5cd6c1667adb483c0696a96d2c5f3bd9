CONCERNED Malusi Soni told his family on Friday, his baby
mama was making death threats again. They didn’t think it was serious, but it appears she had an
evil murder plot in her mind. The 31-year-old Malusi from Umlazi F section, south of
Durban, died of burn wounds at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital the following
day. His home was petrol bombed! His cousin, Thandeka (32), said Malusi was a security guard. Thandeka said the baby mama called him on the morning of his
death, asking him to visit his child in the Durban CBD. “He told us he’d told her he didn’t have time and had to go
to work,” she said. She said later that day the woman sent Malusi death threats
via SMS. “He told us he and a colleague after work noticed a
suspicious man with a big knife, but they hopped into a taxi to town. “At about 11pm we were woken by loud screams for help. We
rushed to Malusi’s room, which was on fire. There was a half-empty bottle of
petrol and female takkies nearby.” The family rushed him to hospital, where he died the next
day. “We’ve heard he wasn’t the first person she killed. We want
police to arrest her before she kills more people,” she said. Thandeka said Malusi broke up with his girlfriend last year
and she’d been threatening him. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said arson and murder charges were
opened at Umlazi cop shop. “The matter is still under investigation,” said Mbele.
