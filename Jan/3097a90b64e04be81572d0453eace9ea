POPE Francis apologised on Wednesday for slapping a woman who had grabbed him as he greeted a crowd of devotees. This was shortly before he delivered a speech denouncing “every form of violence against women”. The image of a visibly annoyed Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of an admirer as he walked by Catholic faithfuls on New Year’s Eve instantly went viral on social media. “We lose patience many times,” Francis confessed. “It happens to me, too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday.” – NEWS24
