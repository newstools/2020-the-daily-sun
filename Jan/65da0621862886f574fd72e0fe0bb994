SURPRISE Moriri used to send shivers down the spines of many PSL defenders when he was at his prime. The free scoring midfielder, who is 39 year-old now, was born in Matibidi in Mpumalanga and he made his name at Silver Stars who were promoted to the PSL in the early 2000s. Moriri had a unique playing style that bamboozled defenders - he would glide slowly, then change his gears, leaving defenders eating dust before scoring his trademark beautiful goals. He also played 34 matches for Bafana Bafana where he scored numerous goals for the national team. After 12 years at Masandawana, he went on to finish his career at Highlands Park. He is back at Sundowns as the Assistant to MDC coach David Notoane. Please share with us your fondest memory of Surprise Moriri?
