KAIZER Chiefs star Bernard Parker and former Generation The Legacy star Fana Mabaso (real name Duna Mnqobi) have a seriously striking resemblance. Parker is at the twilight of his career at Amakhosi, a club that he has represented with aplomb for close to 10 years. The Reiger Park-born goalpocher, fondly known as "Hond" also played for Bafana Bafana for many years. Fana Mabaso, whose part in the popular was ended last year, was the perfect son who hated his criminal father Jack Mabaso but he then got caught up in his dad's dark ways and a war between son and father became deadly. Do you agree with SunSport that Parker and Fana Mabaso may have been separated at birth...
