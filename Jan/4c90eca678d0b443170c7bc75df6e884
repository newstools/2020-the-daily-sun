SHE’S only 13 years old and people pay attention to her message when she speaks. Njabulo Zulu is a motivational speaker. The young motivator from Soshanguve block FF, Tshwane, said she was bullied at school. She said she then started to teach other kids that everyone was equal. She told Daily Sun other pupils told her she was black like shoe polish and that she was ugly. “I didn’t like it. I hated myself when they called me names.” Njabulo said she was happy her motivational speaking had boosted her confidence and changed people’s lives. The grade 8 pupil at Soshanguve Technical High School said other kids appreciated her work. “They celebrate me and want me to be myself,” she said. Sh’s also a violin player, preacher, MC and drama student. Njabulo said her long-term goal is to make sure pupils are no longer bullied. She’s working on her new campaign, Play Your Role. Last year she hosted a Sunday school show on TUT FM. She said she wanted to be a paediatrician when she grew up. Njabulo’s mum, Dudu (34), said her daughter followed in her great-great-granddad’s footsteps. He was a pastor. “I’m blessed and happy to have such a wonderful child.” Dudu said her daughter hated parents who called their kids names. She said Njabulo would continue to visit schools doing her campaign.
