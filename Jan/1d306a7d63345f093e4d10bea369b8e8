Siyabonga Nomvethe has revealed that he came out of retirement after AmaZulu failed to deliver on a promise that they would give him a job. The 42-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates forward this week signed a six-month contract with first division side Uthongathi FC after he quit the game at the end of last season. Nomvethe said he was waiting for word from Usuthu about a role they promised him within the club structures but as, yet nothing came of it. The forward said in an interview with SAFM: "I was waiting for something from AmaZulu after I had retired, but it didn't come. "So, I had to go back and play and these guys, Uthongathi, seriously wanted me. "AmaZulu promised me something and it never happened. When I finished there, I was expecting to be working but nothing has happened since [my retirement]." The former Bafana striker added: "I spent six months sitting at home, sleeping, waking up, taking the kids to school. "When you are sitting at home you end up thinking too much. When Uthongathi wanted me, I even said, 'guys, let's wait because I'm waiting for a job at AmaZulu, but it didn't come. "I've got to say I'm disappointed that I didn't get the job I was promised at AmaZulu, but I have no hard feelings. I respect the club, it's a big institution, but I thought I would be working at the club by now." Nomvethe also shot down suggestions that he was forced to come out of retirement because he was having financial troubles. "I hear people say I'm out of money and that's why I'm coming back but that's not the case," Nomvethe said. "I mean I have a house in Umhlanga, and I have another one in Joburg. I actually drive a Tazz even though I have a Golf 6. "I can buy an expensive car but that's not important to me - what's important is to look after my family, my wife and pay school fees. "I want to play until I'm 45 and if I feel good then I will play until I'm 50." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
