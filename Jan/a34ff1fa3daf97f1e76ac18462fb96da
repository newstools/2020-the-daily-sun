Athletics fans will be able to watch their favourite athletes and races live on the small screen after SABC COO Ian Plaatjies and ASA president Aleck Skhosana signed the deal at the broadcasting corporation headquarters in Auckland Park, Joburg on Wednesday. This undisclosed deal will see popular events such as the Old Mutual Two Oceans marathon, Comrades marathon, Soweto marathon, Cape Town marathon  and Nelson Mandela Bay marathon televised live on SABC 2 channel. The deal starts in March and ends in December. Other events that will be broadcast lives are the FNB 12km, Joburg 10km, SA cross country championships and super schools’ series. The broadcast will start with the Grand Prix series just two days before the start of the Two Oceans marathon followed by the SA senior track and field championships. SABC group CEO Madoda Mxakwe said the events will not be delayed-live and that the SABC have found a slot to accommodate all the events as promised. Madoda said: “It’s a landmark partnership and we have reached an agreement to be the ASA exclusive right holder for the 2020 season. We will air the events live on SABC 2 starting in April until the end of the year.” ASA president said for the first time the SABC have exceeded their expectations and that this ground breaking deal will benefit the athletes. Said an excited Skhosana: “Emerging and top-class athletes will benefit greatly from this deal. We will be able to invite big name athletes from all over the world to come here and compete against our own. For the first time we are happy with our deal with the SABC. It’s lucrative and we have no complains.”
