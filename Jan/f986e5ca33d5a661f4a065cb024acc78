KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed the departure of midfielder Kabelo Mahlasela. Mahlasela joined Chiefs at the beginning of last season and has endured a difficult stay at Chiefs over the past two years as he's been struggling to break it through in the starting line-up. The former Bloemfontein Celtic winger has since been loaned out to Polokwane City on a short-term loan until the end of the 2019/20 season in an effort to afford him game time. The club announced the news on Thursday afternoon.
