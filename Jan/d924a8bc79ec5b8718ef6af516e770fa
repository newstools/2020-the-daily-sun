SA's TV mogul Carol Bouwer launched a bespoke bag line 2 years ago and today we take a look at these amazing pieces. In 2018 Carol visited New York to launch her “African Odyssey 2018” summit and showcased her handbag collection at an exclusive cocktail reception held at the chic Noir et Blanc Boutique in Chelsea, NYC and had an interview with Fashion Edits where she revealed that her line benefited more from her knowledge of luxury and couture. "I have, after all, been a consumer for the longest time.." she said. The Carol Bouwer bags don't come cheap for a regular South Africa, they range from R 15 000.00 - R 200 000 and sell from Cape Town but can be shipped to anywhere in the world.
