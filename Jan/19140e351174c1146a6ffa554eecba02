THE ANC celebrated its 108th birthday in Kimberley today. ANC leaders and delegates gathered at the Thabo Moorosi and Mayibuye multipurpose centres in the Northern Cape for the cake-cutting ceremony. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa paid tribute to the party’s first secretary-general, Sol Plaatje. “Here lies our DNA as a movement, the DNA of the Sol Plaatje family,” Ramaphosa said during an early morning address at the struggle icon’s grave at West End Cemetery. Plaatje, a former journalist, was celebrated as an intellectual. Ramaphosa quoted the opening line of Plaatje’s book, Native Life in South Africa. “There will forever be one phrase he used which was quite emotive but also politically packed with a lot of meaning, which said after the 1913 Land Act was passed, where he wrote: ‘Awakening on Friday morning, 20 June 1913, the South African native found himself, not actually a slave, but a pariah in the land of his birth.’ “It was published in 1916, the most telling emotive phrase about the pain that black South Africans felt at the time and continue to feel up to this day, about the dispossession of land,” said Ramaphosa. He said the ANC took a revolutionary resolution at its 54th national conference on the expropriation of land, which he said was inspired by Plaatje. Obakeng Plaatje said they wanted to apologise to the country and to the ANC for the behaviour some of them displayed. On Sunday, people claiming to be Plaatje’s true descendants removed a fence the government had erected. Northern Cape Premier and ANC chairman, Zamani Saul, said whenever the province tried to honour Plaatje, it became embarrassing because of the family’s feud. – NEWS24
