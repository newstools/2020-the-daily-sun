“Money… can they bring us some of the money” These were the words of a woman in a taxi that was passing the crime
scene where a cash-in-transit heist had just happened. One of the woman in the taxi screams at the people near the cash van to bring some of the money
for them. As the taxi passes next to the cash van, some of the passengers tell the
driver to stop, following that they rush towards the cash van to help
themselves. By the looks of things the thugs used a Lexus GS to crash into the cash, which burst into flames after the crash. It is not clear where and when the incident happened.
