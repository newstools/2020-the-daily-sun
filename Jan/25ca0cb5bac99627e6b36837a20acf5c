The man of cloth was about to perform for shoppers at Thulamahashe Plaza when
he saw a thief being moered.    He was caught up with the shoppers who moered him with everything they came
across. As the thug was screaming for help, a life saver Reverend Sibiya of Revival
Church of Jesus Ministries came to his rescue and pleaded with the mob to stop
beating the thug. “Stop it please. The man has had enough. Don’t kill him I am begging you. He has
learned from his mistakes,” shouted Sibiya as guards also intervened. Sibiya was joined by the guards who ran with the man to the plaza guard room as
the mob continued to swear at him. Senior guard at the plaza Eddie Mkhonto told the Sun Team that the man was
spotted shop lifting four pairs of USB cables worth R130 at the Pep Stores
before he ran away. He said the alleged thug was later released on a warning and the stolen cables
were returned to the shop.
