Hey MizzB I AM 22 years old and dating a guy I met last year after
  he’d just broken up with his ex. Our relationship is great but I find myself constantly cyberstalking his ex. I created a fake identity to check her social media pages to see what she’s up to. I contacted the blesser’s wife and shared pictures of this girl with her husband. I don’t see why the wife got upset with me as I was trying to help her! 
 What should I do? Hey Girl This could cause you to miss out important things in your life. The time spent stalking this girl will be better spent on education, your relationship and youth. Meddling in others’ affairs is consuming and in the end you’ll be the hurt one. People and things in your life need your attention and neglecting these, you may lose what is important, while chasing things that don’t make you a better person. You don’t need to take others’ shine to glow. Let’s help you.
