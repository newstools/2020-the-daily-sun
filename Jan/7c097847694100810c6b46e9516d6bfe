MASTER KG was lucky to escape with his life on Saturday after two tsotsis robbed him of R120 000. According to police sources the DJ and producer, whose real name is Kgaogelo Moagi, was followed from Carlswald Lifestyle Shopping Centre in Midrand, Joburg, to his home where thugs pointed a firearm at him in front of his sister and took his money. According to sources the 24-year-old, who’s originally from Tzaneen in Limpopo, was unaware he was being followed. “He reported that he withdrew the money from an FNB in the complex because he was supposed to leave for Limpopo that evening to perform,” said a cop. “He later opened a case of robbery, which is being investigated at the Midrand Police Station.” Master KG, who’s known for hits such as Skeleton Move and most recently Jerusalema, took the music scene by storm with his long-time friend DJ Maebela. He started making music in his village when he was only 13. Master KG has worked with famous artists such as Zanda Zakuza and Makhadzi.
