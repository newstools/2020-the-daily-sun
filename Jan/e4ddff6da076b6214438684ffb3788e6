SHE thought her son would be well taken care of in hospital. But he was discharged and her life was now a living hell. Anna Mahlako (57) from Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said she’d been homeless for a month. This was after her mentally-ill son destroyed her shack in November after he was discharged from hospital. Anna said she’d taken him to hospital after he relapsed from his chronic medication. “He was not behaving well. It was too much for me, so I took him to hospital so he could be treated and given relevant medication,” she said. Anna said the hospital told her there was nothing wrong with her son. “They told me to report him at the police station if he behaved badly.” She said her son had beaten her up and made her life a leaving hell.  Anna said she was worried her son would kill her if nothing was done.  Her neighbour Jan Mosoane (61) said they didn’t feel safe. “He broke my car and house windows. It’s very sad because he was fine when he took his pills,” he said. Jan said other neighbours were tired of him and didn’t want to see him in the area anymore. Chief director of Tshwane District Hospital, Mothomone Pitsi, said he’d check with the hospital CEO about the matter. “If any patient is discharged and the family or the patient relapses, they can go to the nearest health facility for assistance. The referral of the matter to the hospital CEO is for them to be able contact the family and be able to advise them on how to manage the patient appropriately, including possible readmission.”
