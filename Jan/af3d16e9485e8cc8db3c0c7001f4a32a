UKHOZI FM presenter Zimiphi “Zimdollar” Biyela angered listeners on Saturday. She made controversial comments about the fight between the SABC and Owen Ndlovu over the summer song competition concept. Although she admitted the SABC had made a mistake, she insulted listeners who had voted in the competition, which was interdicted from being aired on New Year’s Eve. Zimdollar said: “Now that the courts have spoken, there’s nothing we can do. We know some of you spent a lot of money voting. “Some of you even sold your goats in order to vote, but this happened. We’re sorry. But to those who only spent R1,50, I’ve got nothing to say except ashila demed. You have a big mouth yet you spent only three 50 cents.” She boasted that she’d been married and divorced many times. “Whenever I divorce a man, I never return his cows. Instead I move on to the next one. My secret is simple: I’m obedient,” she said.  Zimdollar’s comments angered many on Facebook. Makhedama Sakhile suggested Ukhozi FM take disciplinary action against her: “So much disrespect for listeners. Ukhozi FM survives because of its listeners. That R1,50 is still money to them.” Zimdollar said: “Those maskandi fans are stupid. Some of them cannot use their heads. I’m not going to entertain them. I just don’t care. I only said ashila demed, a popular maskandi term.” The SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “The SABC has noted the public’s displeasure on various social media platforms regarding Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka campaign. The SABC is duty bound to adhere to the court order and await the legal processes to take place in resolving this matter. All our on-air personalities are required and encouraged to address the listeners complaints applying the SABC values at all times. Zimiphi Biyela took it upon herself to acknowledge the listeners complaints and apologise.”
