MORE charges could be added against former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and her co-accused when they return to court in April. The state found new evidence that money involved in alleged irregularities in the solid waste tender rose from R208 million to R389 million. Gumede and her co-accused appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday. There was a postponement after one of the accused collapsed and was rushed to hospital while in the dock, probably because the air conditioning wasn’t working. Prosecutor Ashika Lucken said the state found companies irregularly awarded the tender continued to do work, although the state had already started investigating in 2018. Gumede’s legal team wanted the state to provide her with detailed charges so they could prepare for trial, but the state asked for more time. Lucken said the state would need more time to go through the 4 000 documents. The court agreed but said it must give an update in three months. The matter was moved to 16 April. Gumede told her supporters outside court: “Wait for these three or six months they’re asking for, because the truth will come out.”
