CLASSES will continue at Protea South Primary School in Soweto after it went up in smoke on Friday. This was the third school to catch fire in Gauteng since the beginning of the year. Tokelo Secondary School in Evaton, Vaal, was torched on 2 January, while Khutlo Tharo Secondary School in Sebokeng, also in the Vaal, was burnt down in the early hours of Wednesday. No one could tell what started the fire at Protea South, but parents suspected foul play. They said they wanted answers. “We hope the police get to the bottom of it. This is the future of our children,” said parent Visiwe Nqulunga (30). She said two of her kids went to the school.  “Now I fear for them. What if whatever started the fire comes back during the day? What will happen to our kids?” she asked. Another parent Lindiwe Ntuli (28) said: “If schools around kasis fall victim to fires, we will be forced to send our kids to private schools, but the problem is they’re very expensive.”  Community leader Scelo Ndlovu said the school had to work hard to provide protection if the fire was started by someone. “We can’t allow people to easily gain access to the school premises and do as they please. The safety of our children is at stake,” he said. At the scene, police told Daily Sun they were not sure what caused the fire, but were investigating. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was supposed to visit the school to assess the damage, but had to go to Parktown Boys’ High School after a grade 8 pupil drowned during a school camp.
