SANDF robbery suspects were due back in court on Friday after being denied bail last week. The twelve people linked to the theft of 19 R4 assault rifles from the South African Defence Force's (SANDF) Tek Base in Lyttleton, Tshwane were released from custody. They appeared on charges of theft, negligent loss of weapons and house breaking. SANDF national communications head, Siphiwe Dlamini, said the accused were released from custody, rather than on bail, due to internal military court processes. They are expected to appear at the military court again on March 10. Dlamini previously said that the theft was a concern, as it happened on the military's grounds, and could only be pulled off by people who had the knowledge and know-how. The accused were originally denied bail when they appeared in court on December 27 last week. Previously Dlamini said more than 40 people were interviewed and it was nailed down to the 12 arrested and there are more arrests expected. Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, said she is confident that the current investigations will yield the required results and that all perpetrators will be subjected to all applicable criminal laws of the RSA. The ANC study group on defence and military veterans condemned the act of criminality. Last week ANC whip Thabo Mmutle released a statement said: â€œIt is horrific to imagine the safety of the public when there are dangerous warfare weapons on the streets, as this poses a serious safety risk to citizens and leaves much to be desired about the security of the republic."
