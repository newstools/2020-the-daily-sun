KAIZER Motaung Junior has paid tribute to his father Kaizer Motaung. As Amakhosi celebrates their 50th birthday today, Junior said the Amakhosi chairman was God send. The retired footballer said the reason why he wore jersey number 7 during his playing days at the Soweto giants is because the birthday day of the club meant a lot to him and his father. An excited Motaung said: “The reason why I choose to wear jersey number seven is because it was the day that the chairman (my father) began the journey to form the club. What the chairman has done to South African football is amazing. For me personally, I wouldn’t be here right now. Without him I wouldn’t exit, and I would have lived and experienced what I have. If you look at the lives that the chairman has touched economically is priceless. He created thousands of jobs and created platform to millions and this day is deeper than an anniversary.” He also talked about growing up in the Motaung household and the stories that his father shared with him about the apartheid era. Added Motaung: “My father and the legends at the club shared a lot of stories. They played a huge role during the struggle and taught us what it means to be a better man. It was great growing up in a football mad-family.”
