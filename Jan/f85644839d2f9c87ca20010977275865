Tehran, Iran ~ AT LEAST 40 people were killed in a stampede as Iranians gathered for the burial of top military commander Qasem Soleimani in his hometown of Kerman yesterday. More than 40 others were injured as millions packed the streets for the funeral procession. Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike outside Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on Friday. His killing has raised fears of a conflict between the US and Iran. During the funeral procession, many mourners chanted “Death to America” as they waved the Iranian flag. As Soleimani’s body arrived in Kerman for burial, a senior Tehran official said Iran was considering 13 scenarios to avenge his killing. “We will take revenge, a hard and definitive revenge,” the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, General Hossein Salami, told mourners. Soleimani was widely considered the second most powerful man in Iran behind supreme leader, Khamenei. The US saw him as a terrorist and a threat to its troops. Soleimani was responsible for building up Tehran’s network of proxy forces across the Middle East. US President Donald Trump adopted a tough stance against Iran after his election and Tehran responded with its own campaign. Tensions were raised further last month after the US attacked an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq it blamed for attacks on US forces. In Washington, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper denied reports the US military was preparing to withdraw from Iraq, where both Washington and Tehran have vied for influence over nearly two decades of war and unrest. – REUTERS
