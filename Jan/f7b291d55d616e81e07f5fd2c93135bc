YESTERDAY marked one month since the firearms amnesty, which continues until the end of May, kicked off. So far, more than 1 400 illegal firearms have been handed over at police stations. National police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said close to 14 000 rounds of ammunition and 1 500 illegal and unwanted firearms were handed over at police stations across the country. Naidoo said people took advantage as firearms were used in violent crimes and it was encouraging to see the response. He said 1 465 rifles, shotguns, handguns, pistols and revolvers were handed over at police stations around the country. “We’re very encouraged by the fact that people have come forward despite December being a festive period,” he said. “People have come in and handed in illegal and unwanted firearms, as well as ammunition. “We’re confident this number will grow significantly in the next five months.” He said the firearms handed in included 1 248 handguns, 75 shotguns and 142 rifles and that most firearms were handed in for destruction. But police also received applications for relicensing. Naidoo encouraged people in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition to take advantage of the amnesty period to hand over guns without fear of prosecution. “But any person who hands over a firearm that has been used in the commission of a crime will not enjoy such immunity,” he said. He said all firearms that were handed in, before they are destroyed, would undergo ballistic testing to ensure they hadn’t been used to commit crimes.
