NURSES at Clairwood Hospital in Durban want security to be beefed up after a patient (47) was shot dead on Friday. Two unknown armed men stormed into the hospital, past security guards, went to the patient’s bed and shot him in the head in full view of patients and hospital staff. The patient, a foreigner, was being treated for previous gunshot wounds after being transferred from King Edward VIII Hospital in December. “This incident proved our lives aren’t safe. Next time nurses won’t be lucky,” said one nurse. Another was traumatised. “I wasn’t at work, but hearing how the thugs entered terrifies me. This also shocked patients and they’re also terrified.” The nurse said they were told they’d be taken for counselling, but that wasn’t enough. Beefing up security would set them at ease. Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said: “We send our condolences to the family of the dead. “We are shocked at this brazen display of violence right inside a healthcare facility.” She said although it wasn’t always possible to predict such an incident, the fact that the perpetrators could escape without being caught by security or the police called into question their preparedness. “We will have to urgently re-look at our security protocol and make improvements as far as possible and within limited means,” she said. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. A case of murder was opened at Montclair cop shop.
