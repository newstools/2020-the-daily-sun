MAMELODI Sundowns have promoted Multichoice Diski Challenge captain promise Mkhuma to the first team. The 19-year-old was promoted on Friday and signed a five-year deal with Masandawana. Mamelodi Sundowns have announced the promotion of young winger Promise Mkhuma from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) squad. The Daveyton-born attacker has been instrumental for coach David Notoane's side in the Diski Challenge team. He helped the club remain at the top of the log banging in 10 goals and more than 10 assist in 21 games in the PSL reserve league. Mkhuma has been a breath of fresh air in the reserve league.Not since the era of Percy Tau, Khayelihle Shozi and Sphelele Mkhulise in the Multichoice Diski Challenge has any younger drew great interest. Former SA Under-20 coach Thabo Senong who is now in charge of Lesotho national team, has predicted a bright future for Mkhuma.“His good qualities are his values as a human being. Very humble, coachable and committed to his football,” Senong enthuses.“He is very quick, intelligent and technically gifted. He is flexible and adapts to different systems of play.“The youth department at Sundowns played a huge role in his development. We won the 2018 Cosafa Cup with him and he was player of the tournament, we qualified for the world cup with him and he did well at the global event.”“He must remain levelheaded as I know him, and he should stay away from bad circles and focus on his football.Senong added: “He should avoid complacency and remain in the right frame of mind. Too much praise from the media can affect his talent negatively." Mkhuma follows the likes of Percy Tau, Sphelele Mkhulise, Keletso Makgalwa, Herold Majadibodi and others who were promoted from Downs  Diski team to the first team.
