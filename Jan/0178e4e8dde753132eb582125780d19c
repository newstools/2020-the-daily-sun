HE GAINED fame when Zodwa Wabantu paid lobola for him. But after a nasty break-up, Ntobeko Linda is picking up the pieces and has ventured into acting. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ntobeko said he realised life had a lot to offer and that there were many opportunities in the entertainment industry. “I’m young and I want to explore more in life and grab any opportunity that comes my way,” he said. Linda was spotted on SABC1’s Uzalo last week.  He said Uzalo was his first gig. “I’m still new to this thing. I hope producers will see my talent and I’ll get more roles,” he said. Linda attended many events with Zodwa but he refused to tell the SunTeam whether she helped him decide to pursue a career in the industry. “I wish not to comment on anything involving Zodwa. I’ve moved on after the break-up and she has moved on too,” he said.  The aspiring actor said he was passionate about his new career and his wish was to one day start his own TV production company.
