Millions of people are poor and are surrounded by the rich people. The rich can’t even take a cent out of their pockets to help the poor. They can’t even buy them a loaf of bread. It’s heartbreaking to see people suffer, especially kids. To be generous isn’t a sin, it’s a great thing. Donating things like clothes, food or toiletries to the needy can help reduce the amount of suffering we see. I’ve personally donated some of my old clothes to a few people and they were happy. Now just put yourself in their shoes, you’ll see how painful it is to be poor. Starting from today, you can share the little you have with those who are less fortunate.
