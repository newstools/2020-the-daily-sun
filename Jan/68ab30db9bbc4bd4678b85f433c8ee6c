AS Orlando Pirates ran riot on Tuesday night, walloping Polokwane City 4-1, assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena was again conspicuous by his absence on the bench. The Pirates officials and coach Josef Zinnbauer say that Mokwena is on leave. Asked again last night after Polokwane match about Mokwena's absence, Zinnbauer said: "I said it last week that he is not here. He is on leave." What is baffling is that you hardly hear of soccer coaches going on leave during a very crucial time of the season. This is a unique turn of events and it has got the SA soccer fraternity guessing and asking themselves questions. Mokwena was given the head coach responsibility when Micho Sredojevic left the club in a huff. Mokwena struggled a bit with results and consistency and he was replaced with German coach Zinnbauer.
