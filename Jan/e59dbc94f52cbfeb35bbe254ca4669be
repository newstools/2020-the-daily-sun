Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has backed Cape Town City to turn around their poor run of form and return to winning ways. Middendorp's side beat City 3-0 on Sunday which meant the Citizens have now won just three of their 23 fixtures and just five since last April. Benni McCarthy was sacked with the more experienced Jan Olde Riekerink taking charge. City are in 13th position, just one point above the drop zone. But Middendorp believes the Cape outfit are still a quality side with 'very skilful' players and believes they will start getting some points under their belt before too long. Speaking to the club's official website, "A soccer game is 80% mental… We were on top of it, I could feel it. We were more confident and stronger mentally than the position. We were not sublime in our play, but there was no point where I felt we could lose this game. "This is the kind of strength we need to compete and stay on top. The opposition is very skilful I must say. Not Kermit Erasmus alone, they are a bunch of good players. They just need more confidence to get results. They will soon start to pick up points, I think." City next face Bidvest Wits on the weekend. Kick-off is at 18:00 SOURCE: SPORT24
