THROUGHOUT 2019 a number of pupils from Zwelibanzi, Menzi and Velabahleke high schools in Umlazi, south of Durban, helped one another with difficult subjects. The teamwork made the like-minded pupils shine. But Andile Mkhungo (17) had an added motivation that helped him achieve seven distinctions. “My peers helped me a great deal but I was also pushed by my home situation,” said Andile. “I live with my mum in a squatter camp. I wanted to pass very well so I could get a bursary to study and break the chain of poverty at home.”  He said his mum didn’t have a stable job and she raised him by herself. “I’m glad I got a provisional offer to study medicine at the University of KZN,” he said. His friend, head boy Ndumiso Mthembu (17), got five distinctions. Ndumiso said: “I had to lead by example. It really helped me to help others because they gained something and I also gained.” Thandolwethu Gumede (17), who got eight distinctions, is over the moon.  “I can’t wait to go and study medicine. I thank our principal for pushing us,” she said. At Menzi High matrics Amahle Mathe (17), Bongumusa Mkhungo (18), Phindile Mthembu (17) and Lungiswa Cele (17) believe working as a team paid off. They all got seven distinctions each.
