TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula has revealed that more than 9 000 motorists were arrested over the festive season. Mbalula revealed this in Tshwane yesterday during a media briefing on festive season road death statistics. He said motorists were bust for various offences, including drunken driving, speeding, reckless and negligent driving and outstanding warrants. Mbalula also revealed the number of fatal crashes had gone down by 3% from the previous festive season. Over the Christmas period there were 1 390 deadly crashes, compared to 1 438 the previous year. But he acknowledged the government had failed to reduce road deaths by 50%, as it promised the UN it would do by this year. “The number of people who lose life and limb on our roads is alarming and the cost to the economy is in excess of R168 billion.” He said the number of vehicles stopped and checked over the festive season increased from 1,3 million to 1,5 million. He said road blocks conducted increased from 775 to 1 924. “The number of traffic fines issued decreased by 191 862 as a result of increased compliance with road regulations,” he said. He said Free State recorded the highest reduction in road deaths with a 35% decline. In Limpopo deaths increased by 12% and they went up by 1% in Gauteng.
