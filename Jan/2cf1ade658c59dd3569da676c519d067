THERE were hiccups when pupils across the country returned to school yesterday. Some said despite applying in time last year, they were not allocated space. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said there was space available at 912 primary schools and 374 high schools. All districts would operate as walk-in centres for applications until next Friday.  The angry parents said they were told to finalise registration on the first day. Hlengiwe Nxumalo (33) said she was told last year they didn’t have forms available and to return the first day.  SGB deputy chairman Themba Mhlongo said he was told he had to wait for three months when a new school would be opened. He said 28 parents were turned away. KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa advised parents to report the matter at the local district office. Community leader Bernard Mtshayise said they’d been begging for the school to be fixed the past 18 years.  “The schools are not going to open until all our demands are met,” he said. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said mobile classrooms were provided to make sure pupils learn in a suitable environment. “Old mobile classes will be fixed and sent to help schools in need.”  Meanwhile, parents at Tiphembeleni Primary School in Kanyamazane were furious with the department . In October, it moved pupils to another school following concerns about the school’s poor condition. It promised the school would be fixed by new year, but yesterday pupils were taken to another school. Zwane said contractors were on holiday.
