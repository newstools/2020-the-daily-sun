Some of your so-called friends see your full potential. They see what you’re capable of, your dreams, but never tell you to go for them. They want you to succeed, but not to the extent that you become better than them. They know that once you do, they’ll never catch you again. Your fake friends envy you. The support you need will come from people you don’t know. It will take time for you to realise this because you see your friends on daily basis. Even when people warn you about them, you tend to ignore their advice.
