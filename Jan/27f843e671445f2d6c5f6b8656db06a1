Penny Lebyane said the current crop of DJs have no substance and get choked on fame. She was speaking at the late radio legend Chillie M's memorial service yesterday at the Vosloorus Civic Centre. The radio personality shared humorous anecdotes of her encounters with Chilli M. "I met Chilli M at Metro FM when he replaced Kenny Maestro. He loved life. He regarded himself as the best DJ in the country," she said. She said Chilli M's mother at some point went to wait for Chilli M at the SABC's reception to collect money for his kids because he had gone AWOL for months on end. "He asked the bosses to sort it out and they did," she told mourners. She also recalled how Chilli M disappeared with US singer Mary J Blige during her SA visit. "He disappeared with Mary J Blige while her boyfriend was present," she chuckled. DJ Sbu also spoke fondly of Chilli M saying he has opened a lot of doors for young people in showbiz.
