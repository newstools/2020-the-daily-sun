A PASTOR who allegedly raped boys and young men at his church briefly appeared in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court in Tshwane, yesterday. Magistrate Krishnavennie Chetty postponed the case against the 32-year-old, who has been charged with two counts of rape and one of sexual assault, to today. The pastor allegedly abused the boys at the ministry school. One of his congregants broke his silence earlier this year, claiming the pastor gave his victims rings for keeping his dirty secret. The mum of one victim told the SunTeam she couldn’t eat or sleep. The 42-year-old said her 19-year-old son joined the church when he was 16 and was first raped in 2016. “We’re expected to have motherly instincts, but it happened right under my nose. I couldn’t read the signs,” she said. “The pastor grew up in the area and looked decent, kind and humble. “ Little did we know we were worshipping in a monster’s house. “He took the boys under his wing, saying he didn’t want them roaming the streets and abusing drugs and alcohol.” She said her son started acting strangely and became scared when he saw the pastor. “According to the pastor, my son was acting strangely because he had started drinking alcohol. But I confronted him and demanded the truth,” she said. She said when she did that, her son looked at her and said: “Mama, are you sure you want to know the truth?” She said when he said that, lots of things came to mind, but not rape. “I was shattered when he told me how he was repeatedly raped during bedtime, at times in front of other boys while they were asleep,” she said.
