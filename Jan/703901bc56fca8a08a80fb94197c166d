EVAH Khwinika’s family thought she was resting in peace after burying her in 2016. But in November, they learnt a local sangoma had allegedly dug up her grave! Last month, the family from Tshwane found some of Evah’s bones were missing. A police forensic unit exhumed the remains and the family were shocked when the remains were returned over the weekend with many bones missing. Evah’s brother Hendrick (47) said they were angry. “Both her hands, legs and backbone were missing. This means we only buried her skull.” Hendrick said he’d been having sleepless nights since his sister’s bones went missing and his back always hurt. He said his family believed things wouldn’t go well when ancestors weren’t resting. African Dingaka Organisation chairman, Andrew Somo (48), said they were not happy with what had happened as it hurt the image of sangomas. “We always warn these people they must not use body parts to heal people. As traditional healers, we use herbs, not body parts.” Captain Sarah Lesabane said a case of violation of a grave had been opened. She said no one was bust and cops were investigating. “The body was exhumed and checked. Whether parts are missing or not, the remaining bones must be buried again,” she said.
