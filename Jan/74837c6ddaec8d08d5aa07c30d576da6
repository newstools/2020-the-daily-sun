“There were no incidents of paper leakages or group copying but there were incidents of dishonest and those results will be blocked”. Those are the words of Umalusi Chair Professor John Volmink speaking at Umalusi’s annual media briefing on the approval of national examinations results in Tshwane on Friday. Volmink said across assessment bodies the 2019 exams did not have any systemic irregularities. “Each academic year brings a new set of challenges. Exams were largely incident free, there were minor distributions in some parts. ie; some exams were affected by load shedding but alternative arrangements were made and there was also some protests in the North West. He said council approves release of results.“The ?Department of Basic Education? must block results of those implicated in dishonesty and those results from unregistered Centres,” he said. Umalusi CEO Dr Mafu Rakometsi  said council may adjust raw marks.“It’s a national duty. We apply the same criteria in appraising quality of all assessment bodies. We have delivered on our mandate,” he said.? Ramoketsi said the Class of 2019 saw over 750 000 candidates write the exam.? “There was notable improvement in quality of question papers. We appeal to communities to pay special attention to socio-psychological needs of learners we’d need to create a conducive & nurturing environment outside of school hours,” he said.
