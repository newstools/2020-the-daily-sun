MADALA Ditedu Malehodi (82) and his two wives Mminara (76) and Sebolaishi (74) threw a big party to celebrate their 45-year anniversary on Monday. The three-way celebration took place at their family residence at Sweethome-Sebotlane Village, outside Bochum in Limpopo. Madala told Daily Sun the celebration had revived his love for his wives. He said their marriage in the 1970s had survived because in the past it was not a bad thing to marry two women, and they both understood what they were getting themselves into. “When I married my first wife I was 26. It was hard to convince her that I wanted to marry a second wife. “The elders spoke to her and that’s how she agreed to the second marriage.” He paid R86 and one cow to lobola his first wife and paid R64 and a cow for the second. Mminara said she couldn’t understand why her husband wanted to marry another woman. “I have everything the other woman has,” she said. “But in those days it was normal so I ended up allowing the marriage.” She said they both had houses in the same yard. “Sometimes he’d spend the whole week with the other family. That was painful but I got used to it,” she said. “Our marriage is still going on peacefully and we live like one family. “I’m on good terms with the other wife. We’re a lot like sisters.” Sebolaishi, the second wife, said she was grateful there was never trouble in the family. She thanked her seven children and grandchildren at the ceremony. Kgabo Kgomo (35), a granddaughter, said the celebration was her idea. “Everyone supported my idea,” Kgabo said. “We collected money for the event. “The marriage has stood the test of time.”
