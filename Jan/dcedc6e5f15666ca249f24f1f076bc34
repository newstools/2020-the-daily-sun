ZOZIBINI Tunzi is coming home. It will be her first visit to Mzansi since winning Miss Universe last year. Zozibini, who’s based in New York in the US, announced the exciting news on the official Miss Universe and Miss South Africa pages. She tweeted: “Hello beautiful people! I’m coming home. Tell the world I’m coming home.”  She’ll be visiting from next Saturday until 15 February. She’ll spend some of her time at home in Tsolo, Eastern Cape. Stephanie Weil, CEO of the Miss South Africa Organisation, said she was thrilled to be able to welcome Zozibini home. She said the organisation had a jam packed homecoming week and members of the public would be able to see Miss Universe, who was crowned on 8 December. “It’s going to be a memorable seven days. Everyone wants to see Zozi and wish her well. This will be their chance to do just that,” she said. The former Miss SA was crowned Miss Universe last month at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta in the US. Exact dates and venues that she will be visiting during her stay will be announced soon on Zozibini’s social media pages, as well as the various Miss SA and Miss Universe platforms.
