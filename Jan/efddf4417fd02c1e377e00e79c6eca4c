AMAZULU’S poor form doesn’t offer much hope, and it is hard to pick positives from their performances lately, as Orlando Pirates approaches. Pirates, who have won their last two league matches while keeping a clean sheet, will host bottom placed Usuthu at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (6pm). Pirates new coach Josef Zinnbauer is settling in nicely in Soweto, as the German mentor is yet to lose since December when he joined the club. He has won four and drawn the other five Absa Premiership matches he has been in charge of. On the other hand, they host the out of sorts Usuthu and the bookmakers could easily place their bets on Pirates to pocket three points from this clash. The Durban-based side are yet to score in their last two matches, which they lost. In fact, they have scored the second least number of goals in the league this season – 11. Baroka FC, who are three spots above Usuthu, have the worst scoring record as they have scored only 10. What is startling about Usuthu is that 10 of those goals have been scored by Bonti Ntuli – the other one came from Butho Ncube. They have not beaten Bucs in their last 11 matches in all competitions. The last time AmaZulu beat Pirates was on 9 August 2013 when Bongani Ndulula scored the solitary goal when then coach Craig Rosslee was in charge. Despite things looking very discouraging for AmaZulu, coach Josef Vukusic was impressed with the character shown against Maritzburg United last Friday, although they lost the game. “It will be a fight,” said Vukusic. “Of course I’ll have to motivate my players because I expect them to perform so that results will come. We will have to rectify our final passes and finishing before the Pirates match.” Vukusic insists that there’s no point in pressing any panic buttons just yet. “My team have offered me what I have expected from them,” revealed Vukusic who has won only four games of the 15 he has been in charge.
