COSATU’s biggest union, the National Union of Mineworkers, has called for the disbandment of Eskom board following the resignation of its chairman Jabu Mabuza on Friday. Mabuza resigned as chairman after Deputy President David Mabuza revealed during January 8 activities in Kimberley that he and Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan misled President Cyril Ramaphosa into announcing that there would be no load shedding until next week. NUM said the entire board must be disbanded immediately and be replaced by a competent team of men and women who will place the interests of the country and its people before anything. This call was supported by Cosatu’s second biggest union NEHAWuU. “The NUM agrees with the Deputy President David Mabuza when he said the Eskom management and board misled President Cyril Ramaphosa about halting of load shedding until the middle of January 2020. “Eskom is too important of a parastatal towards the economic growth and development of our country to be managed through egos and silo approaches by those at the political and policy level,” the union said in a statement. It said it welcomed the resignation of Mabuza, saying several executives at the utility have had their integrity and competence questioned and at times destroyed to cover up political management. “The NUM has on numerous accounts states that the lack of objective political leadership and oversight is a driver behind the dismal performance of Eskom. “Chickens will soon come home to roost and the spears will redirect themselves to the political heads and will sooner haunt the ANC as the governing party its proven inability to turn around several failing parastatal and covering up of political friends at the expense of the entire nations,” it said.
