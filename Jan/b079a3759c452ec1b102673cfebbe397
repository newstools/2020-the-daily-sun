JANUARY is usually associated with being broke. And it seems this effects everyone, including magoshas. They said their punanis also get to rest after the busy festive season. But the rest is not by choice, as there are fewer clients. Most streets where magoshas work are quiet, including Anderson Street in the Joburg CBD, as well as Grasmere Road and Eikenhof Street towards Vereeniging in the Vaal. A street vendor in Anderson Street said there have only been two magoshas working in the area. “I asked them where the rest were and they said customers were few because they were broke,” he said. Daily Sun tracked down a few magoshas.  One said she tried to hustle for clients last week, but came back empty-handed. She said November was her best month as she serviced a number of customers and made good money, but she didn’t want to say how much. “That’s why we encourage each other to save money. Our job is difficult because it depends on us getting clients,” she said. Another magosha said: “I worked well the whole year, but last month was a bit difficult as most of my clients closed early for the festive season. “I was lucky to have saved some money for my children to spend on Christmas clothes and school.” She said they also used this time to tighten their punanis. “Some use itshe lomgodi (virginity stone), while others use muthi to wash their punanis so they are tighter,” she said. Sangoma Magotweni Khoza warned the magoshas against using itshe lomgodi. She said it was not safe at all as it was acidic. “It ends up eroding the lining of the punani and women end up getting sick,” she said. She encouraged the women to rather use traditional herbal muthi.
