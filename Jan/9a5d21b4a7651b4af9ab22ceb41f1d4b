THERE’S barely time for Mamelodi Sundowns to reflect on their disappointing Absa Premiership goalless draw with Bidvest Wits as they must shift their focus towards the Caf Champions League campaign. Coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane could not hide his frustrations after he watched his side hit a brick wall against a 10-man Wits at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday. The draw felt like defeat to Mosimane and his troops, but they must put that disappointment behind them and focus on their game. Games keep on coming thick and fast, but Mosimane must find a way to refresh his squad. The Brazilians host USM Alger in their Group C encounter in Tshwane on Saturday (3pm). Victory against the Algerian outfit will guarantee their place in the quarter-finals. The Tshwane-based outfit will be looking to complete a double over the north African based side having beaten them 1-0 in Algiers, during the Christmas break. Mosimane is eager to wrap up qualification to the next round and fight for the battle to win the group. Sundowns are top of the group with seven points from three matches – two points ahead of Moroccan giants Wydad Casablanca. Alger are in third place with two points with Petro de Luanda bottom of the group with a point from the same number of matches. Mosimane reiterated the importance of collecting maximum points and making use of their home game advantage. Stressed Mosimane: “It’s a big game. It’s an important game for us. We must beat the Algerians here at the weekend. If we win, we will be guaranteed a place in the knockout stages. We want to get to 10 points and our only focus will be to fight for the top of the log. “We have to win the group to avoid the other big teams in the other groups. Finishing at the top of our group has its own advantages and we would like to capitalise on that. The plan is to win all over home game to ease the pressure on the team.”
