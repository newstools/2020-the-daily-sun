ALTHOUGH murdered medical intern Shongile Nkhwashu (24) was buried in her home village, her name will never be forgotten. During her funeral in Mayephu Village outside Giyani on Saturday, Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba announced the department would make sure a clinic in Matsotsosela Village, where her alleged killer was from, would be renamed in Shongile’s honour. Ramathuba warned young women to be careful of what kind of men they went out with. “Date someone in your league. It’s important for parents to get involved in raising their kids to avoid raising a monster like the man who allegedly killed her,” she said. Shongile was found murdered in her flat at Mankweng Hospital last Sunday. The killer was allegedly her boyfriend, Ntiyiso Shilumani. The 25-year-old appeared in Mankweng Magistrates Court and will appear again for formal bail application on Thursday. Deputy minister in the Presidency Thembi Siweya came to support the family, after Shongile’s dad Kenneth said they were struggling to accept her death. “It’s a difficult time for us and we need all the support. My daughter was our hope and that of the community. We hope her killer has no peace until his last day on earth.” Fellow intern Irene Mathetha said she would miss Shongile’s humble nature. “She cared about people.” Dzumeri Tribal Authority’s chief Divili Mavundza said they had lost the village’s first doctor.
