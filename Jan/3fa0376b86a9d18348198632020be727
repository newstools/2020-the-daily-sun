SUPERSPORT United have applied the never-say-die attitude! They have put their campaign to challenge for the title into the highest gear. They are aware that only points can win them the championship, something they have been doing with excellence throughout the season, with their latest being a 2-0 win against a hapless AmaZulu in Durban yesterday. Coach Kaitano Tembo has always been careful of what he says in media interviews, mostly referring to themselves as underdogs, but in reality they are real title contenders. They are currently third on the PSL log with 31 points from 18 matches â€“ a point behind second placed Mamelodi Sundowns. Evans Rusike and evergreen Bradley Grobler drove United to victory.
