Longwe Twala's mother Thembi has made a passionate plea for prayers. Thembi is pleading with the community to pray for her son, Longwe, after being on the wrong side of the law twice. Thembi who is a born again Christian says nothing beats a prayer. "I pray for my son and plead to others to do that, the devil is a liar and one day my son will come around,” said Thembi. She attends CFC Church in the East Rand and is asking anyone who is willing to pray for her drug addict son. "I wont turn my back on him, I will continue to pray and ask God for turn him around. "I appeal to all the mothers whose children are hooked on drugs to pray to God because this is all the devil's work,” she adds. Last week Longwe’s father legendary musician and producer Sello "Chicco" Twala said he has spent more than R1m trying to rehabilitate his drug addict son over 15 years.
