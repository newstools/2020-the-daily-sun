Eskom announced on Saturday evening that it would be implementing stage 2 load shedding from 10pm on Saturday to 8am on Sunday. It did not say whether the power rationing would continue for the rest of Sunday or next week. The power utility said the immediate reason for the cuts was an "unanticipated conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station". It did not provide further information. A broken conveyor belt at the power plant was a major factor behind the implementation of power cuts in October.
