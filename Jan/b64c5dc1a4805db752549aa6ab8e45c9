We have seen the rise of diverse dolls and the popular fashion doll Barbie is taking it to the next level. The Barbie fashion doll, which is manufactured by the American toy company Mattel,Â unveiled a version of dolls that look as if it has the skin condition vitiligo and another with no hair, in an effort to increase the diversity of the range.  The Barbie fashionista doll has become a cultural icon and has been given honours that are rare in the toy world. From her early days as a teenage fashion model, Barbie has appeared as an astronaut, surgeon, Olympic athlete, downhill skier, aerobics instructor, TV news reporter, vet, rock star, doctor, army officer, air force pilot, summit diplomat, rap musician, presidential candidate (party undefined), baseball player, scuba diver, lifeguard, fire-fighter, engineer, dentist and now even her race is changing to accommodate children from all walks of life. Mattel, who sells Barbie, said that the doll with no hair is important because, "if a girl is experiencing hair loss for any reason, she can see herself reflected in the line".  Barbie also honoured 13-year-old Jordan Reeves by introducing a doll with a prosthetic limb.
