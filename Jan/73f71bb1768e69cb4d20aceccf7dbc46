TOP law firm Mncedisi Ndlovu and Sedumedi Attorneys has been linked to alleged kickbacks involving a former member of the Transnet board. The firm, which has been investigating state capture at Transnet, was linked to kickbacks in an audio recording in the possession of City Press. The 2018 recording is of a conversation between fired Transnet board member Seth Radebe and law firm chairman Mncedisi Ndlovu. It was made when Radebe was fighting his axing from the board by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The discussion deals with an unexplained payment of R2,2 million by the firm to Radebe. He told City Press on Friday he was not aware of any recording or any conversation between him and Ndlovu. But after later listening to the recording, Radebe claimed it was forged. Ndlovu at first denied ever having had a discussion with Radebe, but after hearing the recording he disputed the authenticity of some parts of the clip. The recording suggests the speakers had met on a number of occasions and discussed the firm paying certain amounts to Radebe and him appointing preferred sub-contractors. â€“ CITY PRESS
