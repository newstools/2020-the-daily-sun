DURBAN businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize says she’s found her true self. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “The reason I have a glow is because I’ve found myself and removed all the negative and toxic people around me. I got to the point where I looked at myself in the mirror and found who I am. I focused on myself, loving and pleasing myself and that was when I started glowing naturally.” In an exclusive interview with the SunTeam, she revealed she had made a number of adjustments in her life, including losing weight. “At the moment, I cannot reveal how many kilograms I’ve lost, but I’m now very cautious of what I eat and how often I work out,” she said. “I’m loving the results and I’d definitely love to share my weight loss journey with other women out there, but that’s a story for another day.” Shauwn said her stepdaughter was the person behind her weight loss. “As you know, I live with Sbahle, the fitness bunny. She encourages me to eat healthily and watches me all the time,” she said. Speaking about her reality show Kwa Mam’Mkhize, she said she never expected such a positive response to it. “I didn’t know what to expect but right now, it’s overwhelming and humbling at the same time. I’ll forever be thankful to the people of South Africa for opening their hearts to me,” she said. Shauwn said she was first approached about doing a reality show six years ago, but wasn’t convinced at the time. “But producer Legend Manqele had a vision and a dream. He believed the show was worth doing and eventually persuaded me,” she said. The show revolves around Shauwn, her stepdaughter Sbahle and her son Andile Mpisane.
