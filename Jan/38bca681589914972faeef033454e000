MORE musicians have weighed in on the controversy surrounding Bishop Mosa Sono. This comes after a video in which the leader of Grace Bible Church in Soweto said church musicians were no different to car guards hit social media. Jazz artist Billy Monama has now also come forward to criticise the bishop. READ: 'AFRIKAANS SHOULD BE DROPPED' “I don’t think moruti is OK. Can the advisors in the church please wake him up. He’s in dreamland. Musicians need to be paid for their services unless they declare it as pro bono.”    Jazz artist Don Laka also gave the bishop a piece of his mind. “We’re not done with him yet. How dare he compare us to car guards? Has he ever heard of a degree in car guarding?” he asked. Gospel singer Dumisani Radebe said he felt disrespected. “We’ve been experiencing a lot of challenges in the industry and for him to say this just shows he’s no respect for us. We went to school for this,” he said. Music activist and Le’Vibe Entertainment member Paballo “Gadaffi” Sefara said she used to be a member of Bishop Mosa’s church and she was very disappointed.

Grace Bible Church said: “We hope people will respect the decision of the church and stop the malicious attacks on the presiding bishop that have become very personal.” The SunTeam was unable to get comment from Sono by the time of going to print.
