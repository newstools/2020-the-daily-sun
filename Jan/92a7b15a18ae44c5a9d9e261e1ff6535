After five years without running water, seven Limpopo homes
have been reconnected to the municipal water supply network. One of the
residents is a 72-year-old woman who was forced to use her old-age grant to buy
water from other villagers, the Office of the Public Protector said on Monday. This, after Thivhudziswi Lukoto from Ngwenani Yaha Themeli
in Thohoyandou approached Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in May to
intervene after their taps ran dry when a road construction project damaged the
underground pipework supplying their homesteads, spokesperson Oupa Segalwe
said. "In a written complaint, Lukoto said his mother often
had to push a wheelbarrow in search of water. He added six other families in
her neighbourhood had been affected," he said. "According to Lukoto, road construction workers cut the
water pipeline supplying the section of the village occupied by his mother and
neighbours. He tried in vain to have the problem resolved." 'Settlement agreement' According to Segalwe, this included several meetings with
Vhembe District Municipality officials. In its response to the Public Protector's queries, the
municipality said water was only supplied to the village at a basic level and
there were no taps in the residents' yards. An inspection in loco, however, found each household had a
tap and meter legally connected by the former Venda administration, Segalwe
confirmed. "A settlement agreement, the terms of which included
the restoration of the water supply to the affected households within a month,
was signed by Lukoto and representatives of the municipality, with the PP
(Public Protector) mediating," he said. Lukuto confirmed to Mkhwebane's office all seven households
had access to water now.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/public-protector-steps-in-to-help-families-get-running-water-five-years-after-taps-run-dry-20200114
