THE SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) have not set a target of medals for Team SA at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. With six months to go before the Games kicks-off at the capital of Japan, the SA Olympic mother body does not want to put the team under unnecessary pressure. Sascoc is taking the biggest team of 300 athletes after they toned down their strict qualifying criteria at the beginning of the year. The Games are scheduled to start on 24 July to 9 August in Tokyo. Team SA won 10 medals at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2016. That was the biggest haul of medals since readmission in 1992. But acting vice president Barry Hendricks, says that they want the team to go to Tokyo and enjoy themselves and not put too emphasis on winning medals. Said Hendricks: “We have made a decision not to make predictions or set targets of medals this year. The Olympics is about winning gold and participating at the biggest global sporting events" "If the federations believe that an athlete is good enough to win a medal, then they must make the predictions not us" "We will not make those declaration we just get our athletes out there to perform and not to put further pressure on them.”
