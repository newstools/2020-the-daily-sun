WORKERS who’re contracted under the City of Tshwane are demanding to be paid their outstanding salaries. Yesterday, more than 600 of them gathered outside Tshwane House, claiming they’d not been paid since November. They said they were tired of empty promises and wanted to be paid before Friday. Workers at the waste management, electricity, city parks, water and sanitation departments were affected. Labour Forum chairman Austin Mailula said the workers were meant to be insourced but were still waiting for salaries and uniforms. “We’re still discussing and negotiating with workers over these matters,” he said. Mailula said workers would be paid this week and be given uniforms. “The delay was caused by the political and municipal administration. There was corruption in the city,” he said. He said there were plans to retrain human resource officials and certain admin workers. “We were seriously under pressure and it was a bad thing for workers not to get paid over the past two months,” he said. Mailula said families of workers went through hard times over the festive season. Human capital mayoral committee member Richard Moheta said: “Tomorrow, I will sit with officials so you can get paid.”
