LIFE is at a standstill for David Tlometsane (61) from Jeffsville in Atteridgeville after his car fell into a giant hole in his yard. Daily Sun published an article about it last month. He said: “I found this big hole in the yard and it shocked me because I could have been hurt.” Since the incident, people have been promising to help him, with no success. “While the car is in there, it can also be damaged. Children risk falling in here when playing. This isn’t a safe place,” he said. David said he couldn’t go to work because people kept promising to come see him. He said neighbours were also turning it into a show. “People come knocking, like it is a movie scene.” He said their councillor has visited him a couple of times. His hope is with SunReaders. “I need help for the car to be taken out of this hole and I also need a place to stay,” he said. “Sleeping at this place would be a huge risk. I go to my friends’ and family’s homes to squat.” Councillor Solomon Sedibeng said: “We’re struggling to get through to the municipality because the offices were closed. This is not a safe area for people to live. We’ve been agitating to move them to another area.”
