American singing sensation Trey Songz is the latest star to be accused to sexual assault. This comes as the star is facing a lawsuit of  $10 million (about R160 million) for allegedly sexually abusing a woman. According to reports, the alleged assault happened in 2018 on the 1st of January. The woman, identified as Jane  Doe, claims that the Foreign hitmaker assaulted her in a Miami nightclub. He allegedly forced “his hand under her dress without her consent,” and attempted to “insert his fingers into Jane Doe’s vagina without her consent or permission,” court documents state. The alleged incident occurred while they were at a VIP table at Miami’s E11even Nightclub. The suit claims Songz and the woman were at a party at Diddy’s house before the singer asked her to join him at 11 O'clock in the evening. The 35-year-old crooner, whose birth name Tremaine Neverson, is no stranger to be accused of sexual assault, as he was previously sued for physical assault by a separate accuser, Andrea Buera. Buera claimed Songz attacked her at an NBA All-Star Weekend party, for talking to another man. He has yet to respond to the latest  accusations against him.
