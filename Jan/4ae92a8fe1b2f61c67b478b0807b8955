PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has committed the governing party to delivering its election promises. “The elections reaffirmed the ANC’s mandate to accelerate the social and economic transformation of society.” He said for the past year, the party had been focusing on uniting the party and mobilising all social partners to grow and transform the country. Addressing to the NEC in the Northern Cape yesterday, the president outlined what the party would focus on in the new year. “The focus of the members’ efforts need to be directed at attending to election promises as the party battles to fend off opposition parties in Tshwane and Joburg, where they are likely to face stiff opposition,” he said. Delivering his statement, Ramaphosa said the party would strengthen governance and fight corruption. He said it was vital that state-owned enterprises were protected and efforts made to assure the nation that Eskom would not be privatised. “The work to rebuild institutions will continue, ensuring all appointees are fit for the purpose and demonstrate the highest levels of integrity.” He said they would strengthen governance and tackle corruption, adding that the work to rebuild public institutions would continue, ensuring appointees were equipped for all purposes.
