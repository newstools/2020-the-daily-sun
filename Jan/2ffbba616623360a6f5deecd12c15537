Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp felt his side were the better team in their 2-1 defeat to SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday. Chiefs suffered their second defeat of the season, despite dominating for large periods of the encounter and Middendorp feels his side were the better team on the day. “I think over the 90 minutes in all four departments of the field in my opinion, we were definitely the better team," ” Middendorp told SuperSport TV. "I think the goalkeeper was good on the other side and we hit three times the goal-posts and we had opportunities to make zero-one or one-two or more than that. “The game is definitely something we don’t have to criticise too much. It’s a little small nonsense in the defensive and positioning and reacting better than a rest defence. “Pressurising and pushing a little bit more, putting a little bit more pressure on the passing and crosses. On the other side we have to be concentrated and look forward to the next game in three days. “It’s not about scoring one goal or breaking a record or whatever. I think the passing movement out of a deeper position, the spacing everything was there. “I think they had three opportunities. Forget about the last one, it is always something when you push more forward and they scored twice but this something we have to accept. “We had other games probably in the past (like this). It’s a normal situation. You balance it or get it balance over the entire season. There is no reason to run around with a headache or push each other to the wall. We’ve seen a good game from our side unfortunately with a bad result." SOURCE: SPORT24
