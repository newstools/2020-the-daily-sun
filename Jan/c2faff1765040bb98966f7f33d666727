WHEN she lost her mum last year, she thought she wasn’t go
to finish matric. However, Palesa Ntshwarang (17) from Garsfontein, Tshwane,
shocked her family when she passed with flying colours. She said after the death of her mum Cecelia Khupe, her gogo
prayed for her every day. “She prayed for me and with me in everything I did and that
gave me strength to hold on, despite losing my mother at a critical stage of my
life,” she said. The pupil at Curro Academy Pretoria got distinctions in
Afrikaans, English, geography, life orientation, life science, maths and
physical science. Palesa said she was a bit unfocused after her mum died and
was not expecting to do so well. “I feel overwhelmed, excited, shocked and above all, proud.
It was a rough year. I thought I had lost my support system because she always
encouraged me to study,” she said.  Palesa said she knew her mum was proud of her, wherever she
was. “This is what she wanted. She spoke about passing with
distinctions all the time. She is definitely proud of her little girl,” she
said. Palesa said she would be studying medicine at Stellenbosch
University. Her gogo Grace Kgupe (79) said Palesa passed by God’s grace. “She didn’t take her mother’s death well. She spent most of
the time locked in her mother’s bedroom when she was supposed to study,” she
said. Gogo Grace said she was very proud of Palesa as she was
following in her mum’s footsteps. “Her mum was very bright and educated. She travelled the
world and wanted the best for her children,” she said. Palesa’s sister Reneilwe Ntshwarang (25) said it was a
difficult year. “We are extremely proud. We knew she was going to make it.
However, we didn’t put pressure on her,” she said. photo-group
