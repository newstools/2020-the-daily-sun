Two of the 15 awaiting-trial prisoners who escaped while being transported to prison from court in Durban on Monday have been rearrested, while the remaining 13 are still on the run, Times Live reports. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele told the publication that the two male prisoners were caught in Durban's CBD on Monday evening."They were rearrested at different times on Monday evening. One of the men is facing charges of common robbery and the other faces charges of house breaking," she reportedly said.Police spokesperson Jay Naicker told EWN that 11 of the escapees were foreign nationals who were arrested for being in the country illegally. He reportedly said a Correctional Services vehicle driver was transporting 54 prisoners and stopped at a traffic light when he noticed something odd."The driver alleges that he stopped at the corner and noticed that the suspects were escaping at the back of the vehicle, and the door was padlocked when they left the court," he told EWN. Naicker reportedly said the four South Africans who escaped faced serious charges. He told EWN police were also looking at whether this was an inside job.In December last year, Gauteng police rearrested three prisoners and shot one dead during an escape attempt at the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, News24 reported. Five prisoners were appearing on different cases when they tried to escape. ~ News24
