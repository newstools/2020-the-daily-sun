40 FAMILIES were forced out of their homes following an oil pipe explosion that took place in Verwoerd Park, in Alberton Tuesday. The Ekurhuleni EMS spokesman, Eric Moloka told Daily Sun that the cause of the fire is still unknown and is being investigated. “Fortunately no injuries have been reported. The pipeline belongs to Transnet,” said Moloka. He further stated that there are people checking the number of affected houses. He said the fire took more than six hours to extinguish. An eyewitness who asked not to be named said she also don’t know what started and grateful that they’re still alive. “I was still in bed when my daughter woke me up to a smoke. When I looked out the window, there was a deadly fire and fire fighters all over the scene,” she said. “We were quickly evacuated,” she said. Residents fear that this will happen again because they don’t know what the cause of the fire was. Chere Mohlaka (36) who reside in the area said she wants to know what started the fire as she doesn’t feel safe. “I have a three months old baby, what if she got hurt. We really need answers and fast. They (authorities) telling us that it’s still being investigated is not an answer, these are our lives,” said Chere. Makhosonke Hlongwane (41) said he also fears for his life and he never saw this coming. “I’ve never seen any illegal activities taking place, if this was corruption then whoever did this must be a master mind. Our neighbourhood is very peacefully and it’s one of the reasons why we live here. I hope the EMS gets to the bottom of this,” said Makhosonke. Natasha Koen (46) said she was woken up by a smoke. “I coughed so badly, I went to see my doctor. “I’m actually glad I’m alive. EMS please investigate this matter and deal with whoever tempered with our safety,” she said.
