The Director-General of the Public Service Commission (PSC)is in hot water for allegedly hiring his nyatsi at a top post at the commission. Earlier today the PSC released a brief statement on website confirming that an investigation was underway. "Adv Smanga Sethene, an independent investigator and an Advocate from the Johannesburg Bar, has been appointed by the Office of the State Attorney to investigate allegations of nepotism in the filling of the post of Chief Director: Professional Ethics in the Office of the Public Service Commission", read the statement. According to IOL,the Sunday Independent reported that Mamphiswana allegedly refused to recuse himself from the October 2019 selection process which appointed the woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the seven-year-old child from outside his marriage. On Tuesday,the DA released a statement calling for action towards the investigation. Mamphiswana’s alleged failure to recuse himself from the appointment process despite his glaring conflict of interest has plunged the PSC into a crisis of credibility.The Commission is not “just another” government agency – it is the watchdog over the entire public service and is supposed to enforce and abide by the absolute highest standards of ethics. It is vital that the government acts immediately to protect the PSC from the damage unleashed through Mamphiswana’s alleged misdeeds",read the statement.
