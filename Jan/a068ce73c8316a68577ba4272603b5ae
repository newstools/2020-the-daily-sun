WHILE the rest of Mzansi was preparing for Christmas, Nomthando Ntengento had to rush home after her house caught fire. Just three days before she was supposed to celebrate the holiday with her family in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, she received a call from a neighbour. A fire had eaten her home in Khayelitsha site B in Cape Town. A family friend who was looking after the house had died in the fire and his girlfriend was in hospital. Nomthando lost everything. She was devastated. She has now appealed to Good Samaritans to help her. A resident said: “When firefighters arrived they managed to pull out everyone, but it was too late for the man. “I think someone poured petrol before setting the house alight.” It is believed the ex-boyfriend of the dead man’s girlfriend caused the fire. Cops spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. “A 47-year-old man was declared dead by fire and rescue personnel,” said Van Wyk. “The cause of the fire is unknown. Members were informed by neighbours that a woman whose name was unknown was with the victim in the house.” She was rushed to a nearby hospital. An inquest docket was opened.
