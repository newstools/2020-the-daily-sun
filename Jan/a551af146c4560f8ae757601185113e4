A shocking video of the police dragging and assaulting a
woman has surfaced on social media. The video left many people fuming. Many called the cop’s actions, abuse. In the video, two male police officers can be seen dragging
a woman who seems like she is resisting arrest. As they move a little bit further, one cop seems to be klapping
the woman on the face as they try to get her to stand up. People didn’t like the cop’s actions. It is not yet clear where and when the video was taken, but
people have called for the law to take its cause against the police officers. Rick said: “Truly speaking, that police must be suspended
from work. That’s against the law.”
