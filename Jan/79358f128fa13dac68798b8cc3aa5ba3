MAIDUGURI, NIGERIASOME army commanders have survived an ambush by Islamist militants, northeast of the country. It’s believed the ambush in the Borno State was retaliation by Boko Haram to the killing of a number of its leaders by the military in recent days. Militants laid siege and sprung an ambush against the envoy of the commander of the operation Lafiya Dole, Major-General Olusegun Adeniyi. Adeniyi was returning from a meeting with troops and Governor Babagana Umara Zulum. Uncoordinated fire from anti-aircraft guns, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades were unleashed by the extremists. Four deputy commanders were part of the convoy at the time of the ambush. Nigerian army spokesman, Colonel Aminu Iliyasu, said troops responded with superior fire power, resulting in the killing of an unspecified number of militants while others fled. “In the aftermath of the encounter, several Boko Haram criminal rebels were decimated,” he said. He said two soldiers were wounded during the encounter and were receiving treatment. Iliyasu said the commanders had returned safely to Maiduguri, which is the base of the military operations against Boko Haram. – CAJ NEWS
