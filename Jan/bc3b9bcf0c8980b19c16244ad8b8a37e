BLACK Leopards midfielder Lesedi Kapinga has strongly denied mounting speculations that he will be leaving the Venda-based outfit for a Gauteng club during the transfer window period, which closes on 31 January. “I am not thinking of leaving Leopards anytime soon as people have been saying,” said Kapinga, who has been a key player at Leopards this season. “What people are reading is not true. I am thankful to Leopards for helping me become the player that I am today. My focus is to help Leopards retain their PSL status for next season.” Kapinga’s contract with Leopards expires at the end of the current season and the talented midfielder has been linked with a possible move to either SuperSport United, Bidvest Wits or KwaZulu-Natal side AmaZulu. But the 24-year-old told SunSport his focus is with Leopards and nowhere else. “My agent is handling everything about my future and talking to Leopards,” he added. “But we have spoken and I need to stay focused and help Leopards move out of the danger zone. I am a professional player and I am still contracted to Leopards.” Asked if he would renew his contract with Leopards Kapinga said: “I don’t want to talk about contract issues at this moment. Let’s wait and see what transpires at the end of the season. My focus is to perform to the best of my ability here at Leopards. I love Leopards.” Leopards are 15th on the log with 17 points, the same number of points as Baroka, Polokwane City and bottom side AmaZulu.
