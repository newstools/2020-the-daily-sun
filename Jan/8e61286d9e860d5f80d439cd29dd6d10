Majority of us know that the Gold, Green and Rufous three-colour code trademark represents the Italian luxury brand Gucci, but Mr Price retailers stay creating high end brand dupes for the average South African. The MRP brand trended yesterday after Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula posted a picture showing a pair of shoes spotting what looks like the Gucci three colour code trademark captioning it "Mr Price". Twitter users came through to reveal their most favourite dupes and one of them was the Alexander McQueen sneakers that are currently everyone's favourite. Although this might seem like copyright infringement, Mr Price' version of the shoes are not the same as the Gucci colours. Gucci's colours are Light Gold, Bangladesh Green and Rufous not black. Gucci has before asserted claims of trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition against Forever21 for sale of clothing and accessories featuring a familiar striped pattern.
