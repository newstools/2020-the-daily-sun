KHETHOKWAKHE Masuku has been told to pack his bags and GO! The former Orlando Pirates and Black Leopards midfielder's dream of playing in the top flight again is fast fading away. The 34-year-old player was on trials with Absa Premiership side Baroka FC for two weeks with the hope to impress the Ga-Mphahlele outfit and their new coach Dylan Kerr. But the Englishman, who finally got his work permit on Tuesday, told SunSport on Wednesday that he will not sign the veteran midfielder and has told him to pack his bags and try luck with another teams. "Masuku did very well," said Kerr. "But he (Masuku) is not what we need right now. The thing is, we have enough players in his position." Masuku has also played for top flight sides Bloemfontein Celtic and GladAfrica Championship teams Royal Eagles and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. Last season the Soweto born player was with the ABC Motsepe outfit Baberwa. At Baberwa, Masuku played with the likes of former Kaizer Chiefs and Supersport United defender Tefu Mashamaite hoping to help the Gauteng outfit gain promotion to the Championship, but failed. Meanwhile, Kerr, who replaced Wedson Nyirenda who resigned as Bakgaga head coach after poor perfomance will be officially in chargeÂ  of the last season Telkom Knockout champions for the first time against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday (8:15pm). Kerr missed Baroka's five consecutive league matches against Cape Town City, Golden Arrows, Polokwane City, Stellenbosch and Maritzburg United while still waiting for his work permit. Baroka are currently 13th on the log with 20 points from 20 matches.They are very much relegation candidates if they don't pull up their socks. Baroka are only three points ahead of Leopards, Polokwane and bottom side AmaZulu.
