PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said the parliamentary process to remove her from office was unlawful and unconstitutional. Mkhwebane said National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise didn’t inform her of the motion to remove her. She said she had previously written to Modise raising concerns about members of the executive and legislature who had either been investigated or were being investigated by her office. Mkhwebane was speaking during a media briefing at her offices in Tshwane yesterday. “To date, I have not heard from the Speaker. This is a violation of my rights to dignity, privacy and confidentiality,” she said. The National Assembly last month adopted new rules on the removal of office bearers of chapter 9 institutions, including the office of the public protector. Last week, Modise announced she had approved a DA request to initiate proceedings for her removal from office. Mkhwebane said her investigations of high-profile politicians might have led to the backlash. “Since investigating the Sars rogue unit, I have received threats on my life and poison threats,” she said. She said the rules to remove her amounted to a violation of the constitutionally prescribed duty imposed on organs of state to protect the independence of chapter 9 institutions. Mkhwebane said she hoped the process should be temporarily suspended, postponed or dealt with in a friendly manner. There were reports over the weekend that Sars was looking into her tax affairs, and the Hawks into a perjury charge pursued by Accountability Now director Paul Hoffman. She said she was a law-abiding citizen and welcomed the investigation. “I am, however, concerned about what appears to be an abuse of state institutions to settle scores,” she said. She said some of her investigations might not have gone down well with certain sections of society. “Some of those matters involve Sars,” she said.
