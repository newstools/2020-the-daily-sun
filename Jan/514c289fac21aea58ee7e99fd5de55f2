TODAY we put a spotlight on hot buttered rum. This is a mixed drink containing rum, butter, hot water or cider, sweetener and spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. In the US, hot buttered rumâ€™s history dates back to the colonial days. It was in the 1650s when Jamaica began importing molasses to Colonial America. New England started opening distilleries where the colonists then began adding distilled rum to hot beverages such as toddies and nogs, creating hot buttered rum, eggnog and others.
