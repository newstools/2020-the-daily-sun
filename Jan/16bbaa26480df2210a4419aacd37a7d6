AIDS infections continue to rise, and everyone needs to get involved to help fight the pandemic. According to Statistics South Africa, the estimated overall HIV prevalence rate last year was approximately 13,5% among the South African population. Over a fifth of Mzansi women in their reproductive ages (15 to 49 years) are HIV-positive. Although HIV prevalence among the youth aged 15 to 24 has remained fairly stable over time, the total number of people living with HIV increased from an estimated 4,64 million in 2002 to 7,97 million by last year. Although over 60% of Mzansi people living with HIV have access to antiretroviral treatment, there are challenges to retaining people living with HIV in treatment adherence, with a number of patients being lost to follow-up after starting treatment. Dr Nasiha Soofie, medical head at Sanofi Pasteur Vaccines, said: “While celebrating achievements, we have to be aware that we have many milestones ahead, in terms of curbing new infections, increasing access and compliance to ARVs.” From a regional perspective, UNAIDS reports that in eastern and southern Africa, there were 20,6 million people living with HIV in 2018. Furthermore, in 2018, there were 800 000 new HIV infections, and 310 000 deaths. Of those who have HIV, only 13,8 million accessed treatment in 2018. In addition, in sub-Saharan Africa, four in five new infections among adolescents aged 15 to 19 are in girls, and young women aged 15 to 24 are twice as likely to be living with HIV than men. Women who have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence are also 1,5 times more likely to acquire HIV than women who have not. The good news is thatWhile life expectancy at birth declined between 2002 and 2006 in Mzansi, largely due to the impact of the HIV and Aids epidemic, expansion of health programmes to prevent mother-to-child transmission and access to antiretroviral treatment has partly led to the increase in life expectancy since 2007. Last year, life expectancy at birth was estimated at 61,5 years for males and 67,7 years for females and continues to rise. Infant mortality rate has also declined from an estimated 56,5 infant deaths per 1 000 live births in 2002 to 22,1 infant deaths per 1 000 live births last year. Similarly, the under-five mortality rate declined from 79,0 child deaths per 1 000 live births to 28,5 child deaths per 1 000 live births between 2002 and 2019. In the last decade effective ARV therapy has resulted in HIV becoming a manageable illness. Hence, HIV-infected individuals now have a longer lifespan. However, they remain at high risk of acquiring vaccine- preventable diseases throughout their lives. Dr Soofie said there is a need to educate people about the importance of vaccination, particularly for the most vulnerable members of our society.
