The Westrand cops are looking for a man whom they believe
might assist with investigation. A 28-year-old Uber driver was allegedly robbed and hijacked
by two unknown males. The incident occurred on Monday at Flower road near R28 in
Bekkersdal, West Rand. The Uber taxi driver allegedly received a request from his
app to pick up two males from Baragwanath in Soweto to Randfontein. And while driving, the suspects instructed the victim to
turn at R559 and then Flower Road. He was threatened with a firearm and instructed to stop. His head was covered, and both his hands were tied before he
was thrown inside his boot. Gauteng SAPS spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun
that the suspects then drove with the Uber driver and later dropped him on the
open veld. “He was assisted by an unknown male and reported the matter
to the police,” said Masondo. He said a case of hijacking is underway and the police
believe that the male in the picture might assist with investigation. “Anyone who might have information about his whereabouts is
asked to contact the nearest police station or report the matter to the Bekkersdal
SAPS on 011 755 8040/8069 alternatively contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111,”
said Masondo.
