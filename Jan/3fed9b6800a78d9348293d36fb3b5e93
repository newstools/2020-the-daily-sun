 TWITTER went ablaze this week when popular cartoonist, Rasta, came up with an image that he claims is a portrait of Kaizer Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung.But social media activists, especially those who support Chiefs, called the popular artist to order arguing that the cartoon looks more like that of "Nkunzi" - a popular Uzalo actor, Masoja Msiza. Rasta normally takes advantage of popular event or funerals where he would be given a stall somewhere to do his thing, but most of the time he gets it wrong, and gets a tongue lashing.   Rasta has always been popular for his controversial portraits that sparks conversation and arguments. But does he care? NO!
