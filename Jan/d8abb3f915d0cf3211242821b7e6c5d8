It is no secret that unemployment is rife in SA and the state of the economy is not good. Most job seekers don't even have money to get to their interviews due to the financial struggles they endure. Now Trusted Interns together with Uber are giving first-time job seekers free rides under the banner #GiveTheYouthAchance. "Part of our purpose as an organisation is to democratise access to jobs for the youth so we phoned Uber and we asked if they would be willing to help us solve the problem and fortunately they were,"  Jaryd Raizon, founder of Trusted Interns told 702 "We are currently sitting at about R35 000 worth of free rides and now we are saying to the employers of South Africa: Now that you know that this is a problem, please help us. Come to the party. Contribute so we can get more youth to meet with you." he added. "We are willing to give up to something like R400 per trip for individuals. We understand, based on where people live . . . especially people with poor access to economic opportunities would need a lot more to actually get there." - Nduduzo Nyanda, country manager of Uber said.
