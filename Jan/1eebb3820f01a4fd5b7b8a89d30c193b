FOR six years madala Nkgasi Radinakanyana (62) has been living in a small shack attached to a toilet and is very unhappy! Residents of Botshabelo section F said he lives alone and sells wood. They said the ward councillor drives past the madala’s shack every day but has done nothing to help the old man. When it rains or gets cold, the madala sleeps in the toilet. “I’ve given up hope. I don’t have connections to get a better place.  “I’ve made peace with the fact that my funeral will be held where I live – inside this toilet.” The madala didn’t know where his family is. Neighbour Serame Moeletsi (41) said they have had two ward councillors who have seen how madala lived. “I love the ANC, but our own ward councillor drives past every day and turns a blind eye.” Another neighbour, Vusi Mokhehle, said they had seen the madala living with rats for a long time. “He was given a ready-made shack but it wasn’t secured to the ground and got destroyed. “I’m a builder. I would build him a house if someone would donate materials.”  Ward 27 councillor Khedamile Kholomba said he gave the madala a ready-made shack, which he destroyed. “I’ve been reporting this matter but nothing happens. This is his site. RDP applications are a long process. “We have to arrange for him to be taken care of.” Free State human settlements spokeswoman Senne Bogatsu said: “A house will give him security and stability. “The process will start if he qualifies to own a house.”
