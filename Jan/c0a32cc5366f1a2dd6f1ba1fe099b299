MAGDELINE and her son are lucky to be alive. The roof of a church flew off during a storm and landed on neighbour Elsie Nero’s shack, killing her. Magdeline said the roof bounced on her shack before landing on Elsie’s shack. The roof belonged to Worship Tabernacle Church, right next to Magdeline’s shack and opposite Elsie’s. Daily Sun published the story on Monday. At the time, church pastor Lydia Mokone said: “It’s not only our roof because roofs were coming from different directions.” Magdeline Pitso (51) from Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung believes her ancestors and God protected her and her 21-year-old son. “I was with my son when the storm started on Friday. “The church roof hit my shack roof before bouncing to Elsie’s shack. “I was sad and shocked when I heard about her death. “I believe the roof could have killed me or my son.” Magdeline’s husband Andrew (54) said he was at work when the incident happened. “We loved Elsie. May her soul rest in peace.” Ward 12 councillor Mantsane Mohulatsi said: “On Monday we visited the family, along with Mayor Olly Mlamleli and Co-operative Governance MEC Thembeni Nxangisa. “A bigger shack will be given to the family and we’ll help with the burial. “We have an estimated 300 affected families in the ward and some were taken to community halls for temporary shelter.”
