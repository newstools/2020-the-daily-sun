THE Absa Premiership title race is far from over and you cannot write Bidvest Wits out of it. This is the stern warning from Clever Boys coach Gavin Hunt following their draining 0-0 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns in their league game that had a lot of potential but delivered very little. Kaizer Chiefs have been leading the pack for the better part of the season and everyone is proclaiming that the Naturena lads, who are celebrating their 50th birthday, will win it. But Hunt insists that it’s still early days to declare who will win the title. The Clever Boys coach is not ruling out the possibility of his team unseating the Glamour Boys at the top, despite having collected 27 points from 27 games. Hunt punched and kicked everything in front of him at Loftus after they failed to take advantage of the fumbling Brazilians. “We haven’t even turned the corner, just yet,” Hunt said. “We have not even played 15 games. There are still many games to play and anything can still happen.” Wits have played 13 matches, three fewer than Chiefs. “It’s a long way to go... you can’t write us off and declare Chiefs champions – no ways.” Hunt laughed off the decision to make his goalkeeper Ricardo Goss Man-of-the-Match despite him saving his team from conceding. “What did the goalkeeper do? I don’t think that he is the right choice for the best player on the field. I thought his kicking was poor and he didn’t come out for crosses. I thought that many other players could have won the award.”
