A BIG surprise awaits Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi when she touches down on Mzansi shores next weekend. The 27-year-old model and beauty queen, together with media personality Bonang Matheba, are the faces of the Sun Met 2020 taking place at Cape Town’s Kenilworth Racecourse on Saturday. But while her return is eagerly-awaited, one Cape Town artist has put pen to paper in a tribute to the EasternCape-born beauty queen. Themba Mkhangeli has drawn a portrait of Zozi, as she’s affectionately known, using a ballpoint-pen. Zozi, who’s now based in New York, is expected to land at the Cape Town International Airport next week to much funfare ahead of what’s been dubbed “Africa’s Richest Race Day”. In a recent interview, Zozi said: “I can’t wait to feel the energy, when I get home, which will be the first week of February.” This week, the 25-year-old artist said like many South Africans he couldn’t wait to meet Zozi, an advocate for natural beauty who’s also against gender-based violence. Said Themba, whose work is on display at the Legacy Collection Gallery in Cape Town: “It’ll definitely be an honour to meet her and present this portrait to her.” He said when he heard the news of Zozi coming to the Sun Met he decided to do “something special” for her. The self-taught artist from Nyanga township in Cape Town, who uses a ballpoint-pen for his artwork, said: Zozi is an inspiration to the youth.“Zozi has shown that your background doesn’t determine your future. As long as you focus and work hard the sky is the limit. This week Mkhangeli told the SunTeam he was delighted to finish the artwork ahead of Zozi’s arrival in the Mother City.“The portrait now only needs a frame. It would please me to see her pack it in her luggage back to New York.” Last year, Themba wowed Western Cape premier Alan Winde when he drew his portrait. Winde posted it on Twitter with the caption: How Amazing is this guy!?So incredibly talented. Thank you, Themba. This made my day.
