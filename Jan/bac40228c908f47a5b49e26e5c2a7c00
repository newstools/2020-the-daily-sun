MOGALE City Mayor Patrick Lipudi was laid to rest yesterday. His funeral service was held at Johanna Botha Park Rugby Stadium before he was buried at Sterkfontein Cemetery in Krugersdorp. Among the guests were Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, Environment Minister Barbara Creecy and deputy finance Minister Mondli Gungubele. Mourners described Lipudi as a person dedicated to his work, while Archbishop Bhekumuzi Mdlalose said he loved God and worked for his people. “He believed so much in the power of prayer. When things were not going well, he’d call us pastors and we would pray together,” said Mdlalose.  Creecy said Lipudi was not afraid to make harsh decisions that created enemies, as long as they benefitted people. “He worked hand-in-hand with others very well. He never looked down on anyone,” she said. Makhura said that he last saw Lipudi in November and he wasn’t well. West Rand district commissioner, Major-General Fred Kekana, said working with Lipudi was easy. Neighbour David Nkwe said he felt like he’d lost a brother. Lipudi died at the age of 59 in the early hours of Sunday morning after a short illness.
