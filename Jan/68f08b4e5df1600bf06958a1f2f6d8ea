KWAITO juggernaut Zola (real name Bonginkosi Dlamini) might have to wait a bit longer to find closure in his housebreaking case. This after the Don’t Cry hitmaker was dealt a blow when unknown tsotsis allegedly broke into his Melville home, north of Jozi. And almost six months after the incident, cops are still searching for the suspects. Police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters confirmed that they are investigating a case of theft general. “A case was opened and no arrests so far. The search for the suspect(s) continues,” she said. Police in Brixton, Joburg, are investigating a case of general theft after the 42-year-old star opened a case in July last year. According to police information seen by the SunTeam, thugs helped themselves to his clothes estimated at R2 000. Read his statement to the cops: “Complainant alleged that on 2019/07/20 at when he locked the house and left. On the same day at 2.10pm he noticed that his window was broken and inside the house there was a brick that shows the object used to broke (sic) the window. Police needed for further investigation.” This was not the first time the South African Music Award-winning artist was hit by thugs. He also reported a case of theft out of a motor vehicle in 2016 at the same police station. When the SunTeam solicited comment from Zola, he denied opening a theft general case at the Brixton Police Station. He also denied that unknown tsotsis had helped themselves to his clothing. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t know anything about opening a case, and my house was never broken into,” he said.
