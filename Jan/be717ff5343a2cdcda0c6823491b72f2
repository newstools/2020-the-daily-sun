POLOKWANE City head coach Clinton Larsen has warned his players not to underestimate Orlando Pirates. The two sides clash in an Absa Premiership encounter tonight at Peter Mokaba Stadium (7.30pm). City are brimming with new found confidence after their morale boosting 2-0 win over Chippa United at home on Saturday. Said Larsen, a former Pirates midfielder: “The good thing is we come into this game full of confidence after our win against Chippa United at the weekend. “Pirates are sleeping giants and we can’t take them lightly. ‘Pirates have quality players and they can burst into life at any given moment. We respect them. But we will give it our best shot.” On the other hand the inconsistent Soweto outfit come into this clash from a disappointing 1-1 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic in a league match played on Saturday in the Free State capital. The good news for Larsen ahead of this crucial clash is the return of their captain Jabu Maluleke from suspension. The 37-year-old veteran midfielder missed the Chippa victory. .Larsen, the former Celtic and Golden Arrows coach used Puleng Tlolane in Maluleke’s midfield position, who impressed him against the Chilli Boys. “Tlolane is a versatile player who can play in any position,” said Larsen. “We knew with Maluleke out we had to use him and he did well.” Bucs coach Josef Zinnbauer will be hoping his defence have learned from the mistakes they made against Phunya Sele Sele. Bucs defenders lacked concentration and conceded a goal with nine minutes remaining. The German-born mentor will be banking on the likes of their leading goal scorer Gabadinho Mhango, Tshegofatso Mabaso and Justin Shonga to beat Rise and Shine. The last time the two sides met in a league match last November, the Soweto giants beat City 3-2 in a thrilling encounter played at Orlando Stadium. Victory for City will boost their chances of moving further away from the relegation zone.
