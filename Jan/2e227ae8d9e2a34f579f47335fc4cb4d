THE Municipal Demarcation Board has called on citizens to participate in public consultations on the draft of electoral wards in preparation for the 2021 local elections. The board’s urged all residents to participate in how their wards are set up and will be run before the local government elections. Its chairman, Thabo Manyoni, was briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday on their readiness for the elections. He said they’d be hosting public consultations across the country from next month to April. He said the consultations would give residents the platform to choose what kind of ward they’d like. “We are here to ensure South Africans exercise their democratic right by making sure the voting process runs smoothly,” he said. He said through the consultations, they needed to know the number of people in a ward and ensure the wards were manageable. “When the consultations commence, we will request municipalities to provide a suitable venue in their areas and invite stakeholders within the municipality to attend.” Deputy chairwoman Mbali Myeni said one of the core mandates was the ward delimitation process. She said this was a crucial step towards deepening local democracy and promoting spatial transformation within communities. “This process is necessary to lay a solid foundation for the delivery of free and fair elections. It’s important we have no influence in the determination of the formulae and number of councillors in a municipality. We can’t reduce or increase the number of councillors determined by MECs.”
