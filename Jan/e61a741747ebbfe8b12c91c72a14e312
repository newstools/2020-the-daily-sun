THE Mercedes
Benz W204 C63 AMG is so powerful it burnt its tyres. In a video
that has surfaced on social media, a man can be seen sticking out through the
Benz sunroof while it does a burnout. As it
continues to do the burnout, the tyres catch fire. The W204
C63 AMG came with a 6.2 V8 engine that packed 336 kW and 600 Nm of
torque with a 250 km/h top speed.
