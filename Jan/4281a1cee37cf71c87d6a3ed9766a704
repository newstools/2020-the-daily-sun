BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki and team manager attended the 2022 Fifa World Cup draw in Cairo, Egypt on Tuesday. The duo then took some time off to visit the famous pyramids and took the opportunity to do get to grips with some camel riding. The coach got his tactics spot on when he got onto the camel for the first time. Ntseki and Ramajoe's two-pronged attack on camel back was top notch and we're hoping they will leave our opponents Zimbabwe, Ghana and Ethiopia eating dust when we meet them in the qualifiers later in 2020.
