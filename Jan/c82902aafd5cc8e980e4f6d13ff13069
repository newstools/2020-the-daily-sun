The information derived from it would be used to shape the department’s public transport and scholar transport policies. “We also want to establish whether households have access to places of work, educational institutions and health facilities,” he said. “Good public transport policy needs to be informed by sound statistical data to measure impact and policy intervention. “Transport planners will use the report to assess road infrastructure, affordability of public transport and how far people travel from home to work,” Maluleke said.
