AN ARGUMENT on Sunday night between a father and son ended in a hospital shooting! During the fight, the son allegedly stabbed his father, who was rushed to hospital, where things got even more heated. The father (51) arrived at St Rita’s Hospital outside Jane Furse in Limpopo, with his second wife at 2am yesterday. Shortly after their arrival, his son (24) and first wife started assaulting the second wife in the ward. According to a staff member, the father, a taxi owner, arrived at hospital with severe wounds to his head and stomach. “While his wife and son were attacking his other wife, he removed a drip from his hand and went to a taxi parked outside. “He came back with a gun and shot at them.”  A neighbour said it was not the first time the father and son had fought. “Last month, we separated them in front of the house as they fought over shoes.” The father apparently built a two-room house for his second wife a few years ago and moved in with her. Limpopo health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said MEC Phophi Ramathuba had called for a thorough probe of the incident.  “A woman was shot in the chest and the right arm and was transferred to Polokwane Provincial Hospital, while the son’s in a stable condition at St Rita’s.” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the father was charged with attempted murder after handing himself over to the Nebo police.
