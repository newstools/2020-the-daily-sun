  BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga hosted a
meet-and-greet breakfast for the top 30 matrics of 2019. Pupils from different provinces were accompanied by parents
and teachers to celebrate their achievements at Vodacom World in Midrand,
Joburg. They were among the 790 405 pupils who wrote the final exams
for the national senior certificate last year and came out on top. The
glamorous event was also attended by education MECs from across the country. Motshekga told the pupils they had proven themselves to be
the best. “Go out there and show it. We are proud of you and thank you
for not disappointing us,” she said. The minister said they had brought the matriculants to
Joburg simply to congratulate them. “We invested our hope and trust in you and you did not let
us down. We are still investing in you. Please don’t let us down,” she said. Motshekga advised pupils who were still at school to always
work hard. “In my whole life, I’ve never seen a child who comes to me
and says prayer helped them pass. It’s hard work that will help you,” she said. Motshekga thanked everyone who supported the pupils,
including parents and teachers. She said the country’s pass rate had stayed
consistent, which she was proud of. Abbey Mokgwatsane from the Vodacom Foundation Board also
congratulated the top achievers and promised to continue supporting educational
events.
