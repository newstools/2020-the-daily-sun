SEVEN years after Sanele May ploughed a truck into six taxis, killing 24 people, the victims’ families are still in pain. However, the families say they don’t blame the May, originally from Swaziland, for the tragic accident that took place at Field’s Hill in Pinetown, west of Durban. Three of the families from the Mlaba area in Hammarsdale on Saturday told Daily Sun they believed the accident was beyond May’s control. Zandile Mncwabe (41), whose fiance Mduduzi Nyaba (36) was killed, said whether or not May was released or kept in prison, it made no difference to her life. She said Mduduzi was the breadwinner and since he died, she had been surviving by plaiting people’s hair.  “I didn’t know May was released but whether he’s free or in jail, I’m still hurting,” she said. Nombulelo Nompula (59), whose daughter Ntombifuthi (22) died, said she didn’t blame May for her daughter’s death. Buyisile Chonco (40), whose brother Hlanganani (39) died, said: “The truck owner should be blamed.” May was released from Umzinto Prison on Wednesday after spending seven years there. He returned home to Swaziland. The SunTeam tried to contact him but sources said he wasn’t ready to speak. Peace Piche, the founder of the Sanele May group, said: “May was being swamped by media requests and has asked for a bit of space and privacy. He is overwhelmed.” May was charged with 24 counts of culpable homicide, two of fraud, one of entering the country illegally, two of being in possession of a fake driver’s licence, one of operating a vehicle without a valid professional driving permit and one of failing to comply with a road traffic sign.
