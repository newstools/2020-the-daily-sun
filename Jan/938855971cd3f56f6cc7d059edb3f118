PROSPORT International boss, Mike Makaab, has confirmed that Knowledge Musona is destined to stay on in Belgium where he is currently training with Belgian First Division A KAS Eupen at the Aspire Academy. Eupen confirmed on Thursday that the Zimbabwean is training with them with hope of winning a contract. The 29-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs striker has been left frustrated by his club RSC Anderlecht where he has not been playing. "The offensive midfielder and attacker of RSC Anderlecht arrived in Doha on Wednesday evening and will be tested at KAS Eupen," the club said in a statement. "As a national player of Zimbabwe, Musona has scored 19 goals in 27 international matches. In the Jupiler Pro League, he played 112 matches for KV Oostende, scoring 41 goals and 18 goals." Makaab said he has only read in the media about Mamelodi Sundowns' interest in Musona "but nothing concrete". "He still has two years with Anderlecht..." Makaab explained. This casts a spell of doubt whether Downs will end up winning the deal to sign him after being overtaken by Eupen. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane has also expressed his interest in the player, but looks like his backroom staff did little to make effort in securing the striker.
