ZODWA Wabantu’s fans feel she has lied to them. Last January, the dancer posted a video on how to remove dark spots known as kiwi from between your thighs. She claimed the spots could be removed with just spirits and a facecloth. But fans were disappointed when she recently posted a video of herself using a machine to remove kiwi. Fans soon took to Twitter to ask why Zodwa said one thing but did another.  Tha.simelane wrote: “Hawuuuu Njani manje coz you told us to use spirits wathi siyasebenza to remove i kiwi.” Sanele.mthombeni said: “You said the spirits also played vital role in removing kiwi?” Dermatologist Dr Ncoza Dlova told Daily Sun using spirits was actually dangerous and could make your skin darker. Ladies you've been asking why I don't have Kiwi between my Thigh's. Well that's my Kasi Treatment,Remedy????

The only thing that helps is losing weight. Applying spirits actually makes it worse,” she said. “It causes inflammation, which is itchiness and redness on your skin, resulting in your skin becoming darker than it is. This is just caused by obesity. Some people find it in the neck as well.” Zodwa promised to comment on the matter, but hadn’t responded to the SunTeam by the time of going to print.
