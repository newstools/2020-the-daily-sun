RADIO and TV host Bridget Masinga is leaving Kaya FM after four years. But not everyone is sad to see the back of her. Yesterday, radio fans took to Facebook to celebrate the news. Bridget’s last show will be on Thursday, but her replacement will be announced in March. Kaya chief content officer, Neil Johnson, said Bridget had contributed massively to the station’s vision. “We wish her the best in all her future endeavours, which will be nothing short of fantastic,” he said. When asked for an interview, Bridget’s PR company On Point referred the SunTeam to a statement, saying she was not speaking to the media. She wrote on her Instagram account: “After four years at the Home of the Afropolitan, it’s time to move on to the next adventure. Thank you to you, the Afropolitan, for making my journey so enjoyable. It has been quite a ride! A luta continua.” Bridget started her radio career on YFM and joined Kaya in 2016, hosting an arts focused show at night. She later moved to the midday slot with B-Side, which she turned into a lifestyle show.
