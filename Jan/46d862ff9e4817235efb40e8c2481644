CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink reckons their 2-0 win over Bidvest Wits is a much needed turning point for his charges. This was the Dutch mentor’s second victory since he replaced Benni McCarthy in November last year. His first win was on 5 January in Cape Town when they beat Baroka FC 1-0. Riekerink hopes the win will inspire his players to overcome relegation haunted Black Leopards in a bid to move away from the bottom half of the table. The teams will battle it out in an Absa Premiership match at Cape Town Stadium on Friday (3.30pm) Ajax are three points ahead of Leopards, Baroka, Polokwane City and AmaZulu who are all tied at the basement on 17 points. “We showed under difficult circumstances that we can play. I think we deserved to win and we were the better team. It gives us a boost because there is a lot of teams on 17 points, so it keeps this small gap. Hopefully in our next game we will keep this rhythm.” Riekerink is not worried that they will face Lidoda Duvha without three key players including defender Craig Martin who accumulated two yellow cards which resulted in a red card against Wits and is suspended. Leopards go into the match with their heads held high having held log leaders Kaizer Chiefs to a 1-1 draw in Thohoyandou at the weekend. “The referee gave Craig two very soft yellow cards. From where I sat the opponent just collapsed and my player tried to get the ball. The second one, okay it (yellow) was due, but he was also trying to get the ball. But we have more than 11 players, Taariq Fielies will not play, I think Dove (Edmilson) will not play, so we will have to make some changes.”
