WHEN the rain clouds gather in the sky, Duduzile Hlengwa knows she won’t sleep that night. The 50-year-old from KwaMashu L section, north of Durban, knows she’ll spend the night trying to dry the rainwater in her house. What’s even worse is that the sewerage pipe next to her house has burst, making the sewage flood her house as well. Duduzile said reporting the problem to the eThekwini Municipality and councillors hasn’t helped. “I don’t know where to go to get help. Maybe if Daily Sun calls them they will help me,” she said. She said because of this problem, she now lives alone as her family has moved out of the house. “I’m worried my grandchildren will get sick due to the sewage water. I’m unemployed but I’ve had to change my furniture many times.” She said she now sleeps on a sofa she got from her neighbours because her bed was damaged. “I’m worried I’ll eventually get sick. All my furniture has been damaged, and I’ve put bricks under the fridge to keep it out of the water. “When I see clouds gather I worry as I know it will rain and the smelly water will come into my house.” Duduzile said councillors promised to move her to the transit camps while the problem was being fixed, but it didn’t happen. Councillor Simon Khuboni said he couldn’t remember her case but would contact her and assist her.
