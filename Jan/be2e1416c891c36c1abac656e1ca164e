NOW that the festive season is over, last year’s matrics will now shift focus. In just a few days, they will find out if they passed or not. The Independent Examinations Board said pupils from private schools would receive their results on Tuesday while government schools would release them the following day. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will announce the national results on Tuesday and matrics will receive their individual results a day later. They can get their results in a number of different ways, including checking newspapers. Private school pupils can send their exam numbers to the examinations board on 35135 to receive an SMS with their results. Pupils from government schools can get their results in the same way by sending an SMS with their ID and exam numbers to 35658. Rufus Poliah, head of assessments at the department, warned the public of people selling fake matric certificates. He said this threatened the reputation of the exams and brought up questions of security. “The department is aware of members of the public who are fraudulently producing and offering to sell fake matric certificates. Umalusi is the only legal entity through which the department issues matric certificates. “The certificates carry security features and members of the public engaging in this practice will face the might of the law as this amounts to fraud,” he said.
