IF you don't believe in miracles, this is the perfect time
to start believing. A man who was riding a bicycle, miraculously survived being hit
by a truck. In a video that has gone viral on social media, the truck
can be seen turning at an intersection and hitting the man and his bicycle. The man can be seen trying move with his bicycle, but his
efforts seem to be less powerful than the truck. He then falls under the truck, but miraculously survives the
incident.
