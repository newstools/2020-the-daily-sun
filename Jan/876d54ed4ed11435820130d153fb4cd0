ALLAN Clark says he never joined Black Leopards to take over Cavin Johnson’s job as head coach. Johnson was suspended on Monday following a meeting with the club management which took over five hours. Clark added that he does not think he betrayed his best friend, Johnson, by replacing him as interim coach on Monday. Johnson's suspension is as a result of Lidoda Duvha's poor form that have seen them go a number of matches without a win. The drama unfolded last Friday when Johnson apparently declined to heed to the management's recommendations on which players to select for their game against Cape Town City. Leopards ended up losing the match 1-0. Prior to this, Johnson who took over from Luc Eymael in December last year, Leopards held log leaders Kaizer Chiefs to a 1-1 draw, but their worst was  4-2 loss to Bloemfontein Celtic. But on Monday Leopards chairman David Thidiela wasted no time in appointing Clark as the new man to help the Venda-based side to help them survive relegation. Clark told SunSport: “Cavin is still my best friend, I have worked with him for many years as his assistant. “My intention to come here at Leopards was to support Cavin not to take his job. It was the club’s decision to appoint me. I was shocked to hear that he was suspended."
