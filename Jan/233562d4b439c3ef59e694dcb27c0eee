THE only relative Mimi Nkonyane knew was her mum. And two months ago, she was left an orphan when mum Maria Nkonyane died at the age of 56 after complaining of pain in her legs. The 26-year-old from Cyferskuil, North West, told Daily Sun she believed she had relatives in Winterveld in Tshwane, and in Ermelo in Mpumalanga. However, she didn’t know exactly where they lived. Mimi said her mother’s death on 7 November left her with many worries. “I’m still grieving and now I have to deal with her debt, which she left unpaid,” she said. Mimi said her mum owed R4 926 on a double bed she bought in August. She also owed R2 800 on the stand they were living on. Mimi said she was looking for her mother’s siblings. She said her mother always told her they used the Buthelezi surname and their names were Bampoon, Jadile and Moobi. She said she wanted her family to help her pay her mother’s debt. Mimi’s boyfriend Johannes Khoza (41) said he had been trying to help her but it was difficult. “I’m the breadwinner and I’m also struggling to help with other needs,” he said.
