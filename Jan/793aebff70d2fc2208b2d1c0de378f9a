LAST year hip hop musician Tshego Ketshabile released his debut album, Pink Panther. His fans loved it! The star is getting ready to go on his Pink Panther tour of all nine provinces. Speaking to SunBuzz, the US-born rapper said he was working on releasing his yet-to-be titled second album this year. “I’ve been in studio since 2 January, working on new music, and soon I will be releasing a single titled On You. “But I’m focusing on my upcoming tour, which will be all over Mzansi, and I can’t wait to interact with my fans.” Tshego said as an artist and creative, he didn’t box himself and didn’t like being boxed either, which was why he was also jumping on the amapiano bandwagon with the remix of a track titled No Ties. “When I first heard the song, I was in a club. I loved everything about it and I wanted to buy it. “And the producers were gracious enough to offer me a collaboration, so I’m working on remixing it.” There are a few great artists he said he’s keen to work with. “I’ve been in talks with Busiswa, Prince Kaybee and DJ Maphorisa about featuring them on my upcoming album. “Basically, the idea is to work with everyone I think is talented and has something to offer,” the 29-year-old said. Dates for his Pink Panther tour have yet to be confirmed, but he said it should be around May.
