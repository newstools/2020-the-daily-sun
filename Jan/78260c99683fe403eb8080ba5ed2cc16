Tweeps were left wondering when The Queen’s Rami Chuene 'T-Gom' was draped in a bride-to-be sash. The inquisitive followers flooded Rami with tweets, asking her if she is getting married and some congratulating her. Rami took to Twitter to clear the speculations, telling her followers that she's not getting married. "No, I’m not getting married. Stole the actual bride-to-be’s sash because I’ve never had one. Next week I’m going to a baby shower, I’ll steal the ‘It’s a boy!’ sash too. The well wishes were too beautiful though, thank you!"
