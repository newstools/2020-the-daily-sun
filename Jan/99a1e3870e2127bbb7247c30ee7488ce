HAVING set the cat among the pigeons by upsetting Absa Premiership log leaders Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend, SuperSport United hit a bump of their own on the road. They were held to an entertaining 2-2 draw by a spirited Maritzburg United outfit at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday night to stall their charge to the top. United had signaled their intent to challenge for the title when they defeated leaders Chiefs 2-1 in Mbombela a few days earlier. However, in the Team of Choice, they met a team that was high in confidence following their impressive come from behind win in the KwaZulu Natal derby against Golden Arrows last time out. SuperSport, who ran out 2-0 winners thanks to goals from Kudakwashe Mahachi and Sipho Mbule the last time the two sides met, were hoping for more of the same. And they got off to a flying start with Mahachi putting them in front as early as the 2nd minute. It was not until the second half that Maritzburg restored parity through Judas Moseamedi. But Evans Rusike restored the hostsâ€™ lead in the 75th with a neat finish past helpless Richard Ofori in the Maritzburg goal. That lead, though, did not last long with the Team of Choice responding almost immediately to level the scores. Thabiso Kutumela was on hand to tuck away a 78th minute penalty to bring the KwaZulu Natal outfit back into the match
