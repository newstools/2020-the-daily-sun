There is so much partying and young people have become uncontrollable when it comes to alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse among teenagers is a growing problem. We have to bring the situation under control because it seems young people only find pleasure in boozing. Some are not even ashamed of drinking publicly, in the streets. We can’t let them develop drinking habits at a young age. Underage drinking affects everyone, regardless of age or status. People who start drinking at a young age are likely to abuse alcohol throughout their adult lives. Many teenagers don’t realise that binge drinking has serious consequences such as alcohol poisoning and dependency on booze. It’s important that we, as parents and elders, give teens information that will empower them to avoid these problems. It starts with us preventing them from engaging in underage drinking. Let’s teach our kids about the dangers of alcohol.
