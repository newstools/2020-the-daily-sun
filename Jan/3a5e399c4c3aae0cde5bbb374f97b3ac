clip that is now circulating on various social media platforms. "Such conduct is in direct contravention of the SAPS
Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Regulations," said the Provincial
Commissioner. People on social media condemned the policeman. Russel said: “This is unacceptable. We cannot allow this to
go on. This guy has lost his mind.” TheAnonymous_said: “So law abiding citizens should not have
firearms to protect themselves, but instead we should entrust officers like
this to uphold our law?’’
