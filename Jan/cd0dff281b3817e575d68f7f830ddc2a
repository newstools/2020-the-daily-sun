LIMPOPO education authorities closed the primary school and merged it with another. On Wednesday parents blocked the gates of Boselakgala Primary School, to which their kids had been sent to from Witlig Lower Primary in Mohlajeng Village, outside Polokwane. READ: WATCH: PERVERT PASTOR BUST! The parents complained that the building housing Boselakgala Primary was unstable, and that it would endanger kids’ lives. They didn’t understand why the kids were moved from Witlig, which had enough room and was in far better condition. Witlig SGB chairman Frans Kgoshiyadira said parents wouldn’t accept the department’s decision. “The school we’ve been merged with doesn’t have enough classrooms, water or toilets,” he said. He said the closed school had its own water pump and toilets.  “We’ve witnessed incidents in which innocent pupils lost their lives because of poor infrastructure,” he said. He said parents sent several letters to the Limpopo Education Department but received no response. Parent Maria Poopedi was unhappy with the department’s decision. “Our children deserve a school with better infrastructure and sanitation,” she said. “The department is undermining us. That can’t be entertained.” READ: LIFE FOR RAPE GANG! But Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo said when merging schools, officials looked at enrolment numbers and not the quality of buildings. Makondo urged parents to allow pupils to access their classrooms without disruption. “The matter is receiving the necessary attention and senior department officials will speedily attend to it,” he said.
