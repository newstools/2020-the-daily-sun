Fifteen people were injured on
Monday morning after a taxi rolled on the N3 near the Bergville Toll Plaza. The accident happened 20km outside
Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring
said paramedics had been dispatched to the scene shortly after 04h00. "A taxi was found upright on
the side of the road after rolling from the opposite side of the highway.
Several passengers had been ejected from the vehicle and were found lying in
the fast lane. "Medics assessed the patients
and found that four people had sustained critical injuries, while 11 others had
sustained minor to serious injuries," Meiring said. The victims were treated for their
injuries, and the critically and seriously injured were provided with pain
relief medication before being taken to nearby hospitals for further care. This is the third accident involving
a taxi in KZN in four days. On Sunday, 10 people died when a
mini-bus collided with a BMW sedan on the R34 between Dundee and Vryheid. On Friday, six women and one man
died in a minibus taxi crash on the R102 between Umhlali and Salt Rock in
Durban. The deceased were among 22 people travelling in a Toyota Quantum when
the driver lost control and the vehicle rolled down an embankment. SOURCE: NEWS24
