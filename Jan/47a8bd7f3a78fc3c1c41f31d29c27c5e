STEPHEN Mzangoa is the founder of Motswako Milling, but his passion for agriculture started when he was still young. Raised by a dad who was a cattle farmer and a mum who loves cooking, in 2011 Stephen had an idea to create a new brand of Mageu. But after doing his research, he discovered that the market was not ready. Back to the drawing board, Stephen had an idea to create a new brand of maize meal.  “All that was left was to find a farmer who would be able to supply me with high-grade maize meal, and I found a reliable farmer in the Free State, my home province,” he said. “I named it Motswako Maize Meal because it resonates with black people.” At first, Stephen struggled to hook up with a farmer with reasonable pricing. When he did, he wasted no time and launched his product into the market. Said Stephen: “We provide the best, nutritious, cheap, but high-quality maize meal products for the consumer.” He said since the launch, his product has been well-received. “We pride ourselves in the quality of our product because we use high-quality vitamins to boost the product,” he said. Stephen, who hails from Clarens in the Free State, said his biggest customers are from Limpopo, Free State and Gauteng. “The aim is to make sure my maize meal is available nationwide by the end of this year.” He told the People’s Paper that his toughest customer to please was his mum, Maphakiso, who’s also a great cook. “When she told me that my maize meal was good quality, I was excited because my mum knows her stuff and is not the one to be easily impressed,” he said.
