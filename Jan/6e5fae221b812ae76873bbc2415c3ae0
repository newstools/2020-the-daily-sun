DRIVEN by passion, they saw the need and they fulfilled it! Three nurses, two retired and one still working, opened a private clinic in Mamelodi East in Tshwane last Monday. Residents rejoiced, knowing they would no longer wait in long queues at government health facilities. Paulina Mafatshe, Mabu Sekhaolelo and Veronica Mogashoa have worked in the nursing field for many years, and have known each other for a long time. Paulina said they were due to retire soon but after a year of meetings, they opened their own clinic. “I’m pleased people are keen for the clinic to start operating,” she said. She said they were encouraged by doctors because they saw that the three women loved their work. “We got funding from our children and family, but we are struggling with medication because it’s expensive. “But we’ll get there,” said Paulina. Veronica, who does the admin, said the facility would be run by nurses for now and they were working with three local doctors in Mamelodi. Mabu said they hoped the clinic would have everything they needed to run as a normal health facility within five years. She said they also hoped to create jobs for the locals. “We want to turn the clinic into a medical centre and help pregnant women.” She pleaded with government and business people for funding. Mosima Mathatho (50) said she takes chronic medication. “I no longer take days off work to go to the clinic. There’s never a queue here and the nurses are like family already. “Most people can afford to come here and it takes the workload off public clinics.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said it was legal to run private health facilities.
