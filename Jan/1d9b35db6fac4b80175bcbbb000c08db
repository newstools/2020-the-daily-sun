I go into the deep dam and he comes to me. “I can feel the snake’s presence every time I’m in a river and the snake always guides me. “He tells me what to do and I follow his orders.” The traditional healer and prophet claimed he had his first encounter with the snake in 2011, and since then he’s never been the same.

Bongani said the rich, the poor and sick people, and even church leaders, are his clients.
