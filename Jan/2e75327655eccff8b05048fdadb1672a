THE FNB Calabash Stadium was packed for Prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s big crossover bash on Tuesday. The service, now in its fourth year, took place at Tshwane Events Centre last year. In the early afternoon, worshippers started flocking to the stadium. People from at least 30 countries attended. By midnight, thousands of worshippers were chanting “I receive Papa” all over the packed stadium. Earlier threats circulated on social media that there would be a march against Bushiri’s crossover service, known as The Night of God’s Open Hands, but it went on uninterrupted. Bushiri, leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church, said he didn’t expect such a huge number of worshippers would attend. “There was so much spiritual negativity I never knew it would fill up like this,” he said.  “The reason the enemy put so much force into this is because he knew there’s never been a night more important in your life than this.” Bushiri said: “In 2020, get ready to be on top. “You will experience a big breakthrough this year. “I saw the hand of God lifting you up. God is raising the ministry to a standard it has never been,” said Bushiri, as worshippers cheered. He called one man to the front and prophesied. He said: “God is lifting this man. God is taking you to a place you’ve never seen. “I saw a meeting in Asia where you’re going to minister to many people. When you come back from this meeting, you’ll never be the same again.” Worshippers who watched the crossover service live on the church’s Facebook page welcomed the prophecies. Hawa Kamara said: “Today is the best day for me. Thank you God of Bushiri.” Yvrose Philippe said: “I am going to be free from demonic attack.” Andrew Blessing said: “I thank you God for the grace upon my father, Prophet Bushiri.”
