ORLANDO Pirates will look to pick up from where they left off before the Christmas break when they resume what has generally been an underwhelming Absa Premiership campaign. They travel to the Free State for a meeting with Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (3pm), hoping for a bright start to the year. The Soweto giants, under new mentorÂ Josef Zinnbauer, showed encouraging signs in their last match against Black Leopards at Orlando Stadium. They managed to pick up only their fifth win in 14 matches as they walked away 3-1 winners on the day. And now after a few weeks break, they are back in action as they go searching for their first back-to-back wins this campaign. Bucs occupy fifth place in the league standings and will be determined to continue climbing up the table. Pirates are looking to do a double over Phunya Sele Sele, whom they overcame in their season opener at Orlando Stadium back in August.
