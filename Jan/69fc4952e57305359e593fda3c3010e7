The country experienced some of the worst forms of abuse and killing of kids and women this past year. Violence against children and women is inhumane.  Something needs to be done urgently to put a stop to it. Men, who’re now being rightfully labelled as beasts, need to change their mindsets. In most cases, it’s us men who inflict pain on and kill the most vulnerable members of society. As men, we must be in the forefront in the war against gender-based violence. Women and children are fragile and can’t defend themselves. That’s why I say we’re the ones who hold the key to ending the scourge. Like it or not, women deserve respect, protection and love from men. Government also needs to come to the party and make sure perpetrators are caught, tried and convicted. ) Letter by Shanai Allie, from Randburg
