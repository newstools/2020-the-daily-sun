HE FELT it was the end of him when he lost his job six years ago. But his wife supported him through the hardships. Now Pastor Kennedy Mthimkhulu wants to honour Idah (53), his wife of 11 years with a dream wedding. The 55-year-old father of three from Letlhabile in Brits, North West, is pleading with SunReaders to help him raise funds for the wedding. “Our wedding was small and I promised to gift her with a big anniversary celebration for our 10th anniversary and buy her the most beautiful ring. But I couldn’t fulfill that promise because I lost my job,” he said. Pastor Kennedy said although his wife didn’t pester him about the anniversary, he felt she deserved it for all the good things she did for him. “I haven’t been at peace since our 10th anniversary passed. I feel I have failed her again, even though she has done everything for me. “I will be happy if I can make her dream come true. She deserves it,” he said Idah said she understood that her husband could’t afford to give her the anniversary he promised. “He is a good man and has done everything he could to support me and our three children. Although I’d love to wear a white wedding gown and celebrate with family and friends, I know we can’t afford it now,” she said.
