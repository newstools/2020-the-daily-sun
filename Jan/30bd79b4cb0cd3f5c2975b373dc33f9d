THE DA’s federal executive has upheld its legal commission’s decision to remove Gauteng member of the provincial legislature, Nkele Molapo. She was axed after it emerged she had allegedly leaked information to EFF leader Julius Malema.

Molapo was charged while she was still a councillor in Tshwane. She allegedly sent Malema a screenshot of a discussion from the DA caucus WhatsApp group about a council sitting in 2018, which was expected to deal with former city manager Moeketsi Mosola. The screenshot read: “The ANC will back us in the voting to suspend the city manager I think and so would the EFF as I don’t think either have the capacity, will or appetite to run the city before the national election.” DA federal chairwoman Helen Zille confirmed it was recommended Molapo’s membership be terminated. She said the decision had been emailed to Molapo and a letter was hand delivered yesterday. READ: TWEEPS ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY MNAKWETHU! Zille dismissed claims the party was making an example out of an outspoken, young black woman, saying Molapo had been found guilty of very serious offences. “No party can have core information leaked, especially when things are on a knife’s edge like they are in Tshwane,” she said. “I don’t care if you are 96 or 16, black or white, or anything in between, you sent confidential information to the leader of a party diametrically opposed to your own.”
