Although pop diva Mariah Carey was late for Dolly Parton's bikini challenge, she did it in style. The challenge started by the 74-year-old country singer involved posting four images on Facebook, Tinder, Instagram and LinkedIn. The We Belong Together hitmaker posted her images under the caption: "Fashionably late." This set the internet ablaze with comments about her. At 49, the mother of twins Monroe and Moroccan still looks good. Get you a woman who can do it all ??
