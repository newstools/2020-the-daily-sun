THE South African Under-20 Women’s team (Basetsana) coach Jabulile Baloyi has named her 21-woman squad for the first round, first leg Caf 2020 Fifa Women’s World Cup qualifier against Zambia. The squad had their first training session yesterday at Mark’s Park training grounds in Joburg, as both Baloyi and her technical staff began preparations ahead of their departure for Zambia on Thursday. The match is scheduled for Nkoloma Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Baloyi, who is former Banyana Banyana player, said she was happy with the talent she had assembled, adding that her technical staff will work hard to get the team ready. “This is the only Safa national squad that is yet to qualify for a Fifa World Cup and I want us to be the first ones to achieve that objective,” said Baloyi. “We will work tirelessly as the technical staff to make sure that we push for a positive result in every match.” Baloyi, who also led Basetsana to the AUSC Region 5 Games championship title back in 2018 in Botswana, stated that she was happy with the level of international experience present.
