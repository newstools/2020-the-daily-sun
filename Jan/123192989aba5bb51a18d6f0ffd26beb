EDITH Makapan was shocked after a big round stone mysteriously damaged her house. Edith said the big stone rolled all the way from the park, about a kilometre away. Edith (39) from Kalafong, near Atteridgeville in Tshwane, said she wasn’t home when it hit her house. “I went to the shops for a few minutes and came back to find neighbours standing in front of my gate. “When I asked them what was going on, they said a big stone hit it,” she said.  “It damaged the house, the pillar that holds the house structure and water pipe. My house now has cracks.” But no one saw the stone roll into Edith’s yard. “Neighbours said they only heard the gate falling, but no one knew how the stone got there and why.” She couldn’t sleep at night after what had happened.  “There’s another loose stone in the park and I have sleepless nights thinking it might finish us.” Edith said she was glad no one was injured. Councillor James Ndlovu was aware of the matter. “I saw the stone and called the director of parks at the City of Tshwane to make them aware of the matter,” he said. He said the city sent officials to observe what had happened. “I’m going to give the family the contact details of the legal department where they can submit their claims,” he said. “These people need to be compensated for the damage.” Ndlovu said the department had promised to investigate.
