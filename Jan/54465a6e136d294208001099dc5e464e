ANC branches in eThekwini have released their slates in preparation for the long-awaited regional conference. Supporters of former mayor Zandile Gumede want her to return as chairwoman, while opponents want Thabani Nyawose to take the position. The conference, which is taking place in March, is seen as Gumede’s last chance to save her political career. She has been stripped of her powers as mayor and chairwoman by the ANC KZN leadership. Her regional executive was disbanded after she was arrested on charges of corruption in April. After her court appearance last week, Gumede announced her slate. Her supporters want regional youth league chairman Thembo Ntuli as her deputy and Musa Nciki as secretary. Speaking to supporters outside court, Nciki told the crowd out of 110 branches in eThekwini, 89 were on his faction’s side.  Nyawose’s camp responded on Monday afternoon by releasing its slate. He wants provincial youth league secretary Thanduxolo Sabela as his deputy and Bheki Ntuli, who was secretary in the disbanded regional structure, back in the position. One of Nyawose’s campaigners told the SunTeam Gumede was dreaming as nominations had not opened yet. He said at their camp rally at the Botanic Gardens in Durban on Saturday, 110 branches were with them so he didn’t know which branches Nciki was talking about.
