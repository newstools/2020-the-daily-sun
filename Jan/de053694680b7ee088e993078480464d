THE arrival of Josef Zinnbauer at Orlando Pirates has given the Buccaneers faithful a huge sight of relief. Since the arrival of the German mentor, who started his stint with a 3-1 victory over Black Leopards, Pirates are yet to lose a match. In the five matches he's been in charge, Zinnbauer has managed to win for and draw once and that saw Pirates climbing up the Absa Premiership table to the fifth spot. After defeating Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 at the sold out Orlando Stadium midweek, Pirates completed their perfect week with another emphatic 3-1 victory over Highlands Park on Saturday evening. In-form Gabadinho Mhango continued with his fine displays as he was on the score-sheet yet again increasing his league goals to 12 this season. Thembinkosi Lorch and Paseka Mako were also among the goalscorers when Pirates punished Highlands Park. Pirates came to this encounter on the back sad news of the news of club boss and PSL chairman Irvin Khoza wife Mantwa having passed away on Friday. Despite all that the players managed to deliver their A performance to secure maximum points on the day. Mlungisi Mbunjani who came in as substitute scored the consolation goal for the Lions of the North who have now lost eight games in 19 league outings this season.
