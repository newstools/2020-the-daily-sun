MAMELODI Sundowns increased the pressure on Kaizer Chiefs in the race for the Absa Premiership title. This after they beat AmaZulu 3-0 at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. Sibusiso Vilakazi and Themba Zwane were on the scoresheet for Downs as they walked away victorious. Zwane scored a brace while Vilakazi netted the other goal in an impressive performance by the Brazillians. The Tshwane giants narrowed Chiefsâ€™ lead at the top to four points following their 2-1 loss to SuperSport earlier.
