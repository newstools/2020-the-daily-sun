IT’S hardly been six months since new BMWs were launched by the Joburg Metro police to fight crime. Now three thugs are behind bars after they cloned a 320i BMW used by Metro cops. On Friday, a shoot-out ensued between cops and suspects in Midrand, Joburg. One of the suspects was hit in the hand. Metro cops spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the thugs used a cloned vehicle to commit a crime.  Minnaar said the police were informed the car followed unsuspecting victims from banks and then robbed them. He said three cases, which happened this month, were reported. “The K9 Unit officers intercepted this BMW as the suspects were following victims in Midrand. Then a chase ensued and there was a shoot-out. The suspects lost control of the car and the officers arrested three male suspects. Two illegal firearms were also recovered. None of the officers were injured,” said Minnaar. It's not everyday that you see a VW legend in a revving competition with a Porsche.  The suspects were being detained at Midrand police station and were expected to appear in court soon. In August metro cops, Joburg introduced 87 new BMWs at their head offices in Martindale, Joburg. Minaar said cars aimed to increase police visibility and were handed over to the freeway patrol unit.
