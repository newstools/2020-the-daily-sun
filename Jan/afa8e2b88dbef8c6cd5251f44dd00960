THE man who made headlines for being clocked driving 309km/h will face the music. Over the weekend, he was arrested at a funeral in Limpopo. And today, Siphumulile Mncube appeared in the Midrand Magistrates Court where he was released on R1 500 bail. He was charged with reckless and negligent driving and going against the National Road Traffic Act. The case was postponed to 13 February. In a video he recorded, which went viral, the 36-year-old speeds in his Audi TT on the N1 southbound in Midrand, Joburg, while a passenger encourages him to go faster. Gauteng traffic police spokesman Obed Sibasa praised investigating officer Bongani Khumalo for arresting Mncube. He said he was not only being arrogant, but also disrespecting the law. “The speed at which he was travelling at was unacceptable, unruly and arrogant. You can’t drive at that speed on a public road. The worst part is that he recorded himself.”
