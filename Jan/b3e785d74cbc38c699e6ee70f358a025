MAMELODI Sundowns are back to winning ways. The defending champions defeated Tshwane rivals SuperSport United 2-1 at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday. The win saw them reduce log leaders Kaizer Chiefs' lead at the top of the Absa Premiership standings to seven points. It was Sundowns who got their noses in front in the 32nd minute through Themba, Zwane, who marked his return to the team with a goal. It was not until the second half that SuperSport had an opening on goal with Kudakwashe Mahachi brought down in the box. The Skipper, Dean Furman, calmly slotted past Dennis Onyango to draw United level. Determined to get back to winning ways, Downs retook the lead in the 64th minute through Thapelo Morena and would hold on for dear life. Sundowns will now take a three week break from league action as they turn their attention to the Caf Champions League where they will face Angolan side Petro De Luanda on Saturday. SuperSport next face Chippa United at the same venue on Friday (8pm).
