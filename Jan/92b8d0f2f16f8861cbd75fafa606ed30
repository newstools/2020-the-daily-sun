THE community of Giyani in Limpopo was left in shock by a murder this week. A 65-year-old man was allegedly strangled by his wife and two sons after they accused him of being responsible for their bad luck. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: “On Wednesday at about 8am, the trio allegedly strangled him. “This came after one of the sons allegedly complained that his father bewitched him so that every time he married a woman, she would not stay long.” Resident John Ngoveni (36) said a few weeks ago, one of the accused was seen chasing his wife down the street with a panga. “I think the fact that he fought with his wife and had been changing wives might be the reason he accused his father of witchcraft.” The victim’s daughter (30) claimed her father died of natural causes.  She said he had been sick for a long time and she was shocked to see a police van arrive at the house instead of a hearse. “The police instructed us to stop the funeral parlour from taking my father’s body. “They then took the body and arrested my mother and brothers,” she said.  “As a family, we believe the post mortem will show my mother and brothers had nothing to do with the death of my father. “My mother is a pensioner and my father spent most of his time herding his cows. There were no issues at home.” Mojapelo said a 62-year-old woman and her two sons, aged 35 and 45, appeared in the Giyani Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of murder. They will make another appearance on Tuesday.
