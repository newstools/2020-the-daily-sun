The deaths of at least 18 initiates during the summer initiation schools in the Eastern Cape are too much to stomach. Initiates die at both legal and illegal initiation schools. The harm inflicted on initiates is horrendous! Initiates die every year, yet no one is arrested and punished. How many children must die in the bush before we put an end to this? Initiation school surgeons literally get away with murder in the name of culture. The police seemingly know who the perpetrators are but never make arrests. Something ought to be done to stop these deaths at initiation schools. Firstly, parents must stop taking their children to illegal circumcision schools. Secondly, provincial governments must take drastic measures to prevent more deaths and suffering. The onus rests on the Eastern Cape government, in particular, to look at the issue of summer initiation schools. This is where a large number of initiates die.
