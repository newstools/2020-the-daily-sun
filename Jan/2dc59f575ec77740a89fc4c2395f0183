I’m happy we could celebrate together with my children. “The R2 000 donation will be put to good use for my pupils. “It’s the start of the year and we need to buy a lot of things.” The store’s marketing director, Andrew Mills, said: “We’re proud of Zozibini and we’re proud of Nadapu for the amazing work she does every day at the school. “Who knows, maybe the next Miss Universe will come from Dutywa.”
