BLACK Leopards coach Cavin Johnson says they are not scared of run away leaders Kaizer Chiefs. The two sides clash in a crucial Absa Premiership encounter at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Although Johnson is still yet to win a match for Leopards since he joined them last month, the 61-year-old is confident that his team can bring the high flying Amakhosi down to earth by handing them their third defeat of the season. The Soweto giants will be aiming to stretch their lead to 12 points ahead of second placed Mamelodi Sundowns. Ernst Middendorp’s team are currently leading the pack with 41 points from 17 matches. “Chiefs are doing well and are fighting to win the championship,” said Johnson. “The fact that Sundowns lost to Orlando Pirates on Wednesday will make Chiefs to want to win this game more. But we are not going to this game scared of Chiefs. “We have our own plan and this is a must-win for us as we are playing at home. We need a win to move from the position we are on. We can’t afford to make any mistakes.” He added: “I believe in my players. We have a strong team capable of getting maximum points tomorrow. All we have to do is to play our normal game and believe in ourselves. “It will be a tough game, but we are looking forward to it.” Johnson is aware defeat could put him under tremendous pressure as Leopards chairman David Thidiela is an impatient man when it comes to results.  Lidoda Duvha are second from bottom, tied on 16 points with bottom side Polokwane City, all on 17 matches. The good news for the Joburg-born mentor is that his star players Mwape Musonda and Robert Ngambi are back for selection. The duo have been out with injuries. “We had the whole week to prepare for this clash which was good for me, and the team,” said Johnson. “Everyone is doing well and wants to play – including Musonda and Ngambi.”
