THE world is celebrating the crowning of South Africa’s third Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi – and Boxer Superstores in the Eastern Cape are celebrating another queen in Zozibini’s mum, Philiswa Nadapu. Philiswa, the principal of Bangweni Primary School in Idutywa recently received a surprise visit at her school from the Boxer Eastern Cape team headed by Regional Manager Sobs Dlima. “Everyone is proud of Zozibini, but we are also proud of Philiswa,” said Sobs. “It takes a strong woman to raise a leader like Zozibini and we wanted to let her know that we love her, and we are proud of how she has raised such a powerful woman.” Sobs and his Boxer team arrived unannounced at the school. “We wanted to give her a “royal’ cake and provide for the school too,” said Sobs. “These youngsters are inspired by our new Miss Universe and they are fortunate to be taught by Zozibini’s mother.” Philiswa thanked Boxer for the surprise. “I didn’t expect this! I’m happy that we could celebrate together with my children. The donation will be put to good use for my pupils as it’s the start of the year and we need to buy lots of things,” said Philiswa. Sobs also donated a R2 000 Boxer Gift Card to the school. “We are proud of Zozibini and we are of Philiswa for the amazing work she does every day at the school. Who knows? Maybe the next Miss Universe will come from Idutywa,” said Boxer Marketing Director Andrew Mills.
