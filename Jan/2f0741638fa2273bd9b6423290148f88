UNIVERSITY of Pretoria coach Zipho Dlangalala says the club signed Tshepo “Skhwama” Matete because he is a “special player”. The 28-year-old dribbling wizard joined AmaTuks two weeks ago and made his debut in the GladAfrica Championship this past weekend when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Free State Stars at Tuks Stadium. Matete is mostly known for his showboating skills and many do not believe that he is a team player who can win games for a club, but more of an entertainer. However, Dlangalala said they saw something special in the former Baroka player. “We signed him because he is a special player,” Dlangalala told SunSport. “He has been with us for two weeks now. What people say is their opinion, we as a club saw talent and we liked what we saw and decided to sign him. “He joined us with an experience of having played in the NFD and Premier Soccer League (PSL). He has also played in Africa (Caf Champions League with Township Rollers, Botswana).” He added: “When a player is talented and we believe in him, we are going to sign and play him despite their age. You can see with (Collins) Mbesuma (34), he is still playing for us.” Dlangalala said Matete will play at left-back: “He is a defender and I believe he will also give us a boost in attack.” Matete last played in the PSL in 2017 playing for Baroka. When his contract was terminated by the Limpopo-based outfit, he went to Botswana to join Rollers. The dribbling wizard has been without a professional club since his contract was terminated by Rollers in June 2018. After 18 games in the Championship, AmaTuks are in eighth position and Dlangalala says everything is possible in the remaining games. He said: “All teams in the top eight can still win the league. We are separated by small margins, anything is possible.” On Saturday AmaTuks play TS Sporting at the Kabokweni Stadium in Mpumalanga (3.30pm)
