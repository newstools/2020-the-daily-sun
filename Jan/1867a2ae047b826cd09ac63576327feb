South Africa will attract more investment overall if it invests in tourism, International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor has said. Speaking at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Pandor said potential investors were much more interested in the country after they had visited it. South Africa attracted "huge interest and great admiration", she added."I think that my observation is that South Africa still enjoys a great deal of interest, particularly from business leaders outside South Africa," she told journalists. "A number of participants [in discussions at the forum] were persons who either had recently visited South Africa or had prior experience of Africa."  Visiting helped potential investors visualise ways to get involved, she argued.      Meanwhile, the 2019 Tourism Business Index was at its second-lowest in nine years, reflecting a drop in tourists from both local and international markets.  But in his State of the Nation Address in 2019, President Cyril Ramaphosa set a goal of achieving 21 million tourists by 2030 – equating to 6% compound growth rate.  In addition to communication, it was also crucial to invest in infrastructure, Pandor added.  "A number [of people] commented on our infrastructure as being a positive to attracting business. We must improve and maintain this in order to remain attractive," she said.   https://www.fin24.com/Economy/South-Africa/pandor-tourism-the-key-to-investment-in-sa-20200124
