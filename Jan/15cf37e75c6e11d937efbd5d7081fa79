MZANSI celebrities always go all out for their kids. And over the weekend TV presenter LootLove and Sizwe “Reason” Moeketsi hosted a picnic for their twins, Sisi and Zano, who turned 1. The party themed Minor League Gardens, which is similar to one of Major League DJz twins Banele and Bandile Mbere, was a great success. Luthando “Lootlove” Shosha shared on social media that she was grateful for the turnout. The presenter wrote a heart-warming message that read: “Had the most beautiful day celebrating a big milestone! #MinorLeagueGardens was a complete success! Much love to my incredible team for literally making magic happen! P.S the girls didn’t even care. "Had the most beautiful day celebrating a big milestone! #MinorLeagueGardens was a complete success!
