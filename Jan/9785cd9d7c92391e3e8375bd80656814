FORMER IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s family is in shock after clothing and jewellary worth millions went missing from the household. The items belonged to Buthelezi’s wife Irene, who died in March. Buthelezi’s son Zuzifa said they made the discovery while preparing for the cleansing ceremony. Zuzifa confirmed the items were worth millions, saying there was no break-in and they suspected the people who stole the items did it when Irene was gravely ill. “We suspect these items were stolen by people we know and while the princess was still alive,” he said. “We were cleansing her items as it’s a custom that when someone dies, their items and belongings have to be left unused for at least a year before using them.” The prince said, “they had since opened a case of theft at the local cop shop. “My father is very saddened by this,” he said. IFP spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said it’s a family matter so he wouldn’t comment. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of theft was opened after clothes and jewellery were stolen and the matter is being investigated.
