 Chiefs will celebrate their 50th birthday tomorrow (Tuesday) – and they will do so with a year of celebrations, paying tribute to the loyal supporters, phenomenal players, dedicated staff and partners that have helped make the club one of the biggest in the world. Ahead of the major milestone, the club has launched a striking 50th anniversary logo and also an iconic commemorative jersey. “Over the five decades since the establishment of Kaizer Chiefs, we have been humbled that the club has been embraced by millions countrywide, across the African continent and around the globe . It has not been an easy journey, but all 50 years have been golden, and we are grateful to all those who have played a role and sacrificed so much for the club’s success,” says Chiefs chairman, Kaizer Motaung.  The new classic all-black jersey, with its gold V-neck and gold band around the sleeves, is a tribute to the club’s formative years in the 1970s. Over the coming weeks, in a campaign unveiling the new jersey the club will pay tribute to its legendary former players, long-serving staff and some of its dedicated supporters countrywide. The new commemorative jersey, the club’s third jersey of the season, will be available to supporters from today at the Kaizer Chiefs Village and all Kaizer Chiefs and major retail stores.
