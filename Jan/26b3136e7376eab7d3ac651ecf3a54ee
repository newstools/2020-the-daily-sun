MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has slammed striker Tokelo Rantie whose whereabouts are NOT known after the Brazilians gave him a lifeline with a three-year contract. "It's shame about Tokelo, he is missing the party," said Mosimane on SuperSport after their 3-0 win over AmaZulu on Saturday night. "In an open game like this, Tokelo should be running and scoring the goals to get his confidence back. Like Aubrey Ngoma we don't want to play him when it is difficult. We want to play him when it's open." Mosimane added: "Tokelo is a sad case. We cannot tolerate it if you're ill-disciplined, then you cannot play at Sundowns. We have got too many games and too much travelling to deal with. So, we cannot police anyone and if training sessions disturbs his life, then he needs to choose something different that is better than coming to training - let him do that...that's it!" Rantie has been Missing In Action since December last year, leaving Mosimane very disappointed and let down. The speedy striker was also released by Turkish club Genclerbirligi and Cape Town City recently.
