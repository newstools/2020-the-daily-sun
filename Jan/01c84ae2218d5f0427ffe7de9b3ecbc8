BAROKA FC coach Dylan Kerr has finally received his work permit and will be in charge of his first game on Saturday (3.30pm) when Bakgaga visits Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium. The Englishman has been a spectator in the stands since he joined the club earlier this month when he replaced Wedson Nyirenda. On Tuesday, an excited Kerr confirmed to SunSport that he received his work permit on Monday. “Finally,” Kerr stated with a sigh of relief. “Now I can shout from the bench. "I got my permit on Monday and I think it came at the right time just after our win over Maritzburg United. Now I will build on that going forward” The former Black Leopards coach conducted his first training on Tuesday morning.Kerr has a lot to do considering that Baroka are not in a good position in the Absa Premiership. They are 13th on the log, three points above the drop zone. With the remaining 10 games in the league, Baroka will be fighting for survival. Since Baroka were promoted to the PSL from the national First Division at the end of 2015-16 season, they have always found themselves in the relegation dogfight. On their first season, they survived via the relegation/promotion play-offs. Again, this year they are in the same space with just three points ahead of AmaZulu who are rooted at the foot of the table, and fellow Limpopo mates Polokwane City and AmaZulu who all have 17 points. Kerr says relegation is not on their mind. He said: “I am not setting any targets, I just want to see the team collecting many points as possible and move from the position we are in."Play-offs or relegation are not in our minds, we are not thinking about that. "At the moment we look at taking the performance we showed against Maritzburg to Highlands. I heard Owen da Gama (Highlands coach) saying that they are going to hammer the next team that comes to Makhulong.”
