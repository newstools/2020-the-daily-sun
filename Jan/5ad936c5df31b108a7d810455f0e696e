SENIOR NFP members are expected to dump the party to join the Abantu-Batho Congress (ABC). Former NFP Umvoti Councillor Philani Mavundla announced on Friday that he’d formed the new party. Mavundla told Daily Sun on Sunday he decided to form his own party because the NFP has failed to end factions and unite. He said he had joined the NFP because he thought it was a vehicle to help people get services, but instead the party spent most of the time fighting in court. “I expect senior politicians to join me on this journey. “People will be surprised to see familiar faces sitting next to me when we launch next week. We’re going to surprise many during the local government elections next year,” he said. Mavundla said he has left his position as ward 7 councillor, but would contest the by-elections in April. NFP provincial leader Vikizitha Mlotshwa said by announcing his party, Mavundla had already expelled himself from the party in terms of its constitution, which states if a member joins another party or forms his own party, he immediately becomes a non-member. A senior provincial NFP member said no one from the party would blame Mavundla for starting his own party, as he tried his best to unite factions in the NFP, but failed. He said he wouln’t be surprised if many other members followed Mavundla. Mavundla was Umvoti mayor under the ANC and resigned in 2015 after he fell out with the party leaders. He joined the NFP in May last year and in August, won the by-elections for the party. NFP national secretary-general Canaan Mdletshe said the party was not concerned about Mavundla’s leaving. He said the party was like an ocean that cleansed itself of rotten elements.
