FRUSTRATED parents have lashed out at the principal of Khesethwane High School. The principal is accused of tribalism after it was announced the school would be phasing out xiTsonga as a subject. Some xiTsonga speaking pupils were forced to register Sepedi as their home language at the school. Those who didn’t want to study Sepedi were referred to other schools in neighbouring villages where xiTsonga is taught. Angry parents in Mawa Village, Block 12 ,outside Tzaneen have held two meeting with school management to restore the xiTsonga subject. This as the village mostly has xiTsonga and Pedi speaking people.  Fanie Mhlongo (53) said he wanted to know why xiTsonga, which is taught at the primary school, was being phased out at the high school. “If we allow the subject to be cancelled, it’s going to affect us big time in the near future,” said Fanie. “This means we’ll have to take our children from this village to schools far from their homes because one man doesn’t want the xiTsonga subject.” Audrick Ngobeni (55) said it was clear the principal wasn’t a fan of the xiTsonga language, as he’s Pedi. “Tsongas were the ones who first populated this village but were forced to vacate to Dzumeri area during the apartheid era. “We won’t allow the principal to phase out the subject,” Audrick said. “Last Monday, another pupil was referred to another school after they rejected his registration, saying the school no longer offered the xiTsonga.” Limpopo Education department’s Sam Makondo said they would send investigators to look into the allegations.
