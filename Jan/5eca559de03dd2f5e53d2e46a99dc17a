THE SPRINGBOKS have been nominated in the Team of the Year category at the 2020 Laureus World Sports Awards to be held in Berlin next month. The news was confirmed on Wednesday as the lists of final nominations were revealed by Laureus. The Boks, who won the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, will be up against tough competition from Jürgen Klopp’s Champions League-winning Liverpool side, the USA women's football team who won the women’s World Cup, six-time Formula One world champions Mercedes-AMG Petronas, the first Canadian team to win the NBA Championship, the Toronto Raptors, and two-time FIBA World Cup winners, Spain's men’s basketball team. The Springboks won the category at the 2008 Laureus Awards having triumphed at the 2007 World Cup the year prior. "You have to remember when we went into the 2019 Rugby World Cup we were only ranked fifth or sixth, but as the competition proceeded we really got together as a team and we realised how we could unite the country. It became a bigger cause than just winning a competition. To be nominated for this award is unbelievable," hooker Schalk Brits said of the honour. - Sport24
