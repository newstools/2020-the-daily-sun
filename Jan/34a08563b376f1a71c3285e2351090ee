GOGO Eunice Mbuyisa (65) was shaken after her grandson gave her hot klaps on Monday and took off. But now the gogo from Obanjeni, northern KZN, is fuming after the cops arrested Mondli (21). She was disappointed after the cops opened a case of assault against him. “We told them we were opening a missing person’s docket,” she said. She was angry because she told the cops her grandson was mentally unstable when he hit her. She was taking him to hospital because his mind was not working properly when he hit her. “For the past two weeks he was saying strange things and I decided to take him to hospital,” she said. “His mind was not functioning well and he started beating me.” Gogo said Mondli wanted them to walk home instead of taking a bus. She had told him it was too far and he started slapping her. “A group of men came to my rescue and he ran away. “We turned to cops to help us find him. “But now they’ve opened an assault case.” She said her grandson spent a night in jail. “We’re not going to go to court because I never opened a case against him.” Mondli’s sister Nontobeko Mhlanga (28) was disappointed, saying the family had explained to cops that her brother was ill. “We thank the fire department, who saw him after cops dropped him off at the Gingindlovu main road,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Eshowe police arrested a man for assault.
