IT IS a new year and decade, which means new beginnings too! Perhaps you are in the market for new wheels as well or you have to buy your first car? Although buying a new car can be an expensive exercise, there are some great wallet-friendly choices. Also cheap doesn’t mean nasty and they may be small cars but it doesn’t necessarily mean a compromise on space and comfort. Here are the three cheapest cars in South Africa, all with a price tag of below R150 000. Suzuki Celerio – From R142 900  We all know that Suzuki is rocking it the past few years and its budget fighter is the Celerio. It has been around in its current guise for a few years but this means that it is a tried and tested number that won’t disappoint either. Powering the Celerio is a three-cylinder 1,0-litre engine with 50 kW of power and 90 Nm of torque. It has a five-speed manual transmission, but there is an automatic option available too. The safety package includes two airbags and ABS brakes. Also, if your budget allows it you can opt for the higher-spec Celerio 1,0 GL with a price tag of R159 900. Mahindra KUV100 K2+ – From R142 999  With quirky styling and an SUV-like design the Mahindra KUV100 is one of the more distinctive cars in its segment. The entry-level model is the K2+ and under its bonnet is a 1,2-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine which delivers 61 kW and 115 Nm, while it also has a five-speed manual transmission. Safety features include dual airbags and ABS with EBD. The KUV100’s elevated driving position gives you an expanded view of the road while the easy-to-read meters enhance driving pleasure. Renault Kwid – From R144 900  The Renault Kwid is top-seller and since its launch in 2016 it has clocked almost 28 000 sales. Recently Renault gave the Kwid a major makeover giving it quite a striking appearance. Still powering the Kwid is the familiar three-cylinder 1,0-litre petrol engine developing 50 kW and 91 Nm of torque. The entry-level Expression model also has ABS brakes and front airbags. Also worth noting is that Renault offers the Kwid with one year of comprehensive insurance, a two-year service plan and five-year/150 000km warranty.
