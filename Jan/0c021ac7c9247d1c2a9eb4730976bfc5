FORMER Kazier Chiefs and Orlando Pirates  Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates development player Mihlali Mayambela h his move to Israel’s Bnei Yehuda. The 23-year-old winger joins the Israeli Premier League outfit from Portugal’s SC Farense . Mayambela who is the the younger brother to Cape Town City's dribbling wizard Mark, moved to overseas in 2016 when he joined Djurgardens from Cape Town All Stars. In his overseas stint, the player has spent most of his playing times on loan with the likes of Degerfors, Brage and Farense. Following the loan spells, Mayambela moved to Farense in July last year but he failed to impress in Portugal as he finds a new home in the Middle East. Reports suggest that the skillful winger joined Yehuda on a short term deal as he is hoping to make his mark in Israel in the next six months as he looks to secure a permanent move.
