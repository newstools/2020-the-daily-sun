He also confirmed that striker Bradley Grobler is also staying put at the club amid rumours that he is on his was to Orlando Pirates. "The Aubrey Modiba Modiba move to Sundowns has been called off," Matthews told reporters on Friday. "I've been anticipating that Aubrey might be going to Sundowns. If he left, I would have been forced to buy another person. But because Aubrey is staying, we don't need to have somebody else. Our business is done basically.""Yes, we've had talks with Sundowns about Aubrey, they haven't got anywhere. Actually the talks are off that's basically where we are at. "From our side, we couldn't agree terms with Sundowns. Apparently the player couldn't agree terms either. That deal is 100% off. We won't be doing anymore business""I don't have any other moves planned. I have to deal with extensions especially with the fact that Aubrey is also staying. I'll be focusing on that. Aubrey Modiba coming back from an injury we will be like a new signing. We should have enough in the tank to finish this season. We are not looking to let players go"Meanwhile, Matthews has reiterated that Grobler will not be leaving the club amid links with Pirates."We will be extending Bradley Grobler's contract but we don't really need to because he's got two and half years left on his contract anyway," said the Matsatsantsa CEO."But we have offered him an extension on his contract. But it is not something we were worried about. He got two and half years and he is not for sale. So, he is not going anywhere."
