Zimbabwe government workers have rejected a 97% salary increment that was tabled by their employer saying the offer fell far too short of their demands. The southern African country is experiencing hyperinflation that has seen salaries of government workers significantly eroded. Annual inflation was estimated at 481.05% in November 2019 although government says only the monthly inflation at 17.5% is a true reflection of price increases. Prices in Zimbabwe are indexed to the US dollar which is trading 17 times more than the Zimbabwe dollar.The workers are thus demanding that their salaries be indexed to the US dollar as well.Before the the new offer of Z$2 015.(R1 672) the least paid government worker earned Z$1 023 (R849). Workers union chairperson Cecilia Alexander said workers had rejected government's offer outright. "It does not speak to the current economic climate as it does not take into consideration factors such as inflation.""We still stand by our position that our salaries should be indexed to the exchange rate."Workers are set to meet Monday next week to map their way forward which might result in an industrial strike if demands are not met. ~Fin24
