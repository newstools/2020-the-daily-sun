SA's Zozibini Tunzi is well on her way to becoming a proper New Yorker. Miss Universe 2019 ordered her first-ever hotdog from a street vendor in The Big Apple. In the video tweeted from the official Miss Universe Twitter account, the 26-year-old walks up to the vendor, and orders a New York-style hotdog with "ketchup" and mustard. Leaving the tomato sauce and braised onions for when she touches down on home soil! She also upgrades her order to a "jumbo" as she shows off her muscles to the camera. Zozibini, who moved to New York after being crowned Miss Universe 2019 in December, also tries a chestnut and says: "It's good."Â  While nibbling on the chestnut, she jokingly asks: "How much is it? Before I get arrested." It's custom for vendors to sell roasted chestnuts during Christmas time in New York. Zozi digs into her hotdog off-camera, and we're patiently waiting for the verdict on the "best hotdog in the world."
