SuperSport United goalkeeper Ronwen Williams has signed a new four and a half-year deal at the club. Williams has been with the club for 19 years and according to SuperSport CEO Stan Matthews, is a 'poster child' of the club. "In many ways, Ronwen is the poster child of the club. He represents so much of what we stand for in terms of trying to give maximum opportunity for talented young players to shine," Matthew was quoted by the club on Twitter "He joined us as a 12-year-old having to live miles away from his parents in an unfamiliar environment and has worked his socks off to be Bafana Bafana number 1, PSL goalkeeper of the year and an integral part of the last 6 trophies he has helped us win." The 27-year-old has worked his way in to the national team set-up, taking the number one jersey from former Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Darren Keet at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The shot-stopped has made over 300 appearances for Matsatsantsa and has won 12 caps for Bafana."SuperSport United is pleased to announce that Ronwen Williams has signed a four and a half-year contract extension which sees him at the club till 2024," read a statement on the club's official Twitter account.
