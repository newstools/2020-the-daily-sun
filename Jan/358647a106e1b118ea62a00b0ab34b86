Cape Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink was happy to admit that his side did not do enough to deserve anything out of their clash with log leaders Kaizer Chiefs. The Citizens fell to yet another defeat, beaten 3-0 by Amakhosi at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Riekerink, who has had little success with the Mother City outfit since replacing Benni McCarthy, believes his team will come good. Although they were second best against Chiefs, he was pleased with certain aspects of their game. “I think we created a lot of opportunities,” said Riekerink. “We switched the ball very well, used the spaces well. But the story of the game is that with three high balls, we conceded three goals. “I think our team deserves the complement for the way they found the solutions. We created enough opportunities to score but we didn’t. “And we know it is about the end score, you never get any points for how you play the game. But we showed in most parts of the match that we did well.” The Dutchman, though, gave credit to Chiefs for how clinical they were in front of goal, something his team were not able to do. Amakhosi scored all three goals from headers with Leonardo Castro, Samir Nurkovic and Eric Mathoho nodding past hapless Peter Leeuwenburgh in the City goal. "Football is about scoring goals and if they score three and we score zero, it's good they deserve to win,” added Rikerink.
