It's been a good year for the Beyhive. Beyoncé gifted fans with her Netflix special, Homecoming, an Instagram feed of her best looks and The Lion King Soundtrack. That last one she literally named, The Gift. Now, in a reflective video, she's also giving fans a rare looking into her private life with photos of Sir and Rumi – and the twins are so grown up! In a clip of their second birthday, shots with the dog filter and a never-before-seen iconic family photo, Beyoncé says "Cheers to 2020!" with Sir and Rumi.
