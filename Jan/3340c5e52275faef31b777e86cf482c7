A post shared by  Rolene Strauss (@rolenestrauss) on Jan 10, 2020 at 3:00am PST  Siyabonga 'Slikour' Methane and Melissa Wilkinson Former Skwatta Kamp member Siyabonga 'Slikour' Methane and wife Melissa Wilkinson are expecting their first child together.Melissa shared the news on her Instagram account and dad also seems to be very excited about the incoming addition to their family. As boys we fascinated by how much money or how many luxury cars or material things others have. You then get married and your fascination becomes of something money can’t buy.....time. When you hear other people say they’ve been married for 20 to 30 years you look to them with so much fascination and respect for that time. Marriage doesn’t kill our dreams,love or innocence nor does it remove the challenges, temptations,distractions,complacency or any of our sins. Ironically it puts them all on a spotlight and it’s a path to confront our strengths and weaknesses with someone who has the time and faith to see you find the best version of yourself in the journey of life, with love being in the middle of it. So @melissa_iam my friend, my love it’s only a year of us supporting each other to be the best version of ourselves. As long as life wakes us up every morning it will be a life time task, i don’t only ask for time but the love to be constantly in between us in this journey of highs and lows. Happy First Anniversary and blessings to more time and love.
