MAPULA Dolo’s success is proof women can achieve anything they set their minds to. She manufactures indoor, outdoor and garden ottomans using old tyres, which are selling like hot cakes. The 38-year-old from Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, told Daily Sun she believed behind every old item was something new waiting to be made. “My products are special, eco-friendly and unique.” Mapula said when she first started out, she did a lot of research and spoke to people who’d been in the business for years. “This was because I believe in learning new things and exchanging ideas with other people,” she said. She said she painted her ottomans in colours that would blend with the spaces the customers wanted them in. “As I sometimes find it difficult to choose colours for my clients, I give them the opportunity to come up with their own combinations,” she said. “Watching furniture manufacturing videos on YouTube helped me advance to another level because I get to learn new things every day.” Mapula said she always dreamt of being a businesswoman but being unemployed pushed her to follow her dream. “It all started when I transformed my mum’s old tyre into an attractive ottoman, which left everyone in the community speechless,” she said. “I believed in myself and knowing I could do my best was a huge motivation.” Mapula said she collected tyres from dump sites and asked residents for old tyres. She said she’d been in business for a year and she was happy with her progress. “I want to empower the youth through my success because I believe every individual has a great idea.”
