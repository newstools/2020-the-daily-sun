BUSINESSWOMAN Shauwn Mkhize is not giving away R50 000. On Saturday, a fake Twitter account in her name offered people who wanted to start businesses R50 000 if they followed her, retweeted and told her what their business would be. While people were sharing their ideas, Shauwn took to her real account and said the tweet was fake and causing confusion. Shauwn was not available to talk to the SunTeam but her personal assistant, Samantha Ngubo, said it wasn’t the first time someone had impersonated her. “In addition, as part of marketing, I’d like to buy them tiny little golf shirts for their first school concert.”
