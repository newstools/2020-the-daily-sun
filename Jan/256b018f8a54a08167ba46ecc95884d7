RESIDENTS of Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, have demanded that cops offer them protection. This comes after a 19-year-old tsotsi allegedly stabbed a 58-year-old man to death at Itireleng Residential Care Facility for the Disabled late last month. Residents said the man was later seen hanging around in the area but fled after they called the cops. A woman (42) said two days later, the man tried to kill her son. She said: “On 30 December, my son was playing with friends when he met a man who chased him with a knife. He screamed his head off.” “My son went to a neighbour’s house and described the man as having a mohawk and a black glove on his left hand. My child was traumatised.” Community leader Tshepo Matlaela (43) said they were living in fear that a serial killer was on the prowl. Acting social development MEC Panyaza Lesufi said the victim had been living at the care facility since 2012. “We regret the incident, and are making a plea to families to support relatives in institutions and to assist them to be integrated into their families,” said Lesufi. “In this case, social workers on various occasions tried to reunite the deceased with his family, but the family refused to take him back.” Ga-Rankuwa police said they were investigating a murder case but no arrests had been made yet.
