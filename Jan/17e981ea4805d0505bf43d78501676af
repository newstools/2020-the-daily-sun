Dar-Es-Salaam, Tanzania ~ HUMAN rights groups want the World Bank to withhold a US$500 million (R7,3 billion) education loan to Tanzania until it lifts a ban on pregnant girls from attending school. The World Bank board of executive directors will this week vote on the loan to fund Tanzania’s secondary education strategy. Zama Neff, children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch, said: “The World Bank should use its leverage from the loan until Tanzania lifts its cruel ban on pregnant girls attending school.” Tanzanian schools routinely force girls to undergo intrusive pregnancy tests and permanently expel those who are pregnant. In 2017, about 5 500 pupils were expelled. However, previous estimates indicate that close to 8 000 pupils were forced to drop out of school. In some instances, authorities have arrested pupils for falling pregnant. President John Magufuli has vowed to uphold the ban throughout his term. His first term ends this year and, he’s favourite to win a second term with elections set for later this year. – CAJ NEWS
