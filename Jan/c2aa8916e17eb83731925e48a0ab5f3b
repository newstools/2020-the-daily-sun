THE trial of the pastor accused of raping boys at his church started in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court in Tshwane yesterday. The 32-year-old pastor was charged with two counts of rape and one of sexual assault. The matter was postponed to tomorrow. Two of the victims spoke to Daily Sun outside court. The victim (21) said: “It’s sad because he might continue this evil deed.” He said he was scared of the pastor as he hadn’t seen him in a long time. His mum said they were tired and wished the trial could end. “It’s crazy because there are people who still trust him. We’re now the black sheep of the church. Congregants pass us like we’re their enemies. It is so sad,” she said. The mum said there were other victims, but they feared the pastor. “Many boys were abused and are unfortunately not free to come out. But we believe they will after the pastor is taken to jail,” she said. She said the victims needed help as the abuse affected them badly. “Many are now taking drugs, while some abuse alcohol. All we want is for these boys to get help,” she said. The victim’s brother said the family was shattered. “Our lives are on hold. We’re always in court.” He said the matter affected his brother. “He lost out on his studies last year and it looks like he will again this year because this trial might take long.”
