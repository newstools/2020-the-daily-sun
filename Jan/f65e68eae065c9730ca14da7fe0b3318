“I thank you my love. You left me with a lot to hold on. ”Those were the final words of Dr Irvin Khoza, the chairman of the South African Premier Soccer league (PSL) and Orlando Pirates boss.

Mantwa died last Friday due to short illness.She was laid to rest yesterday (25 Jan) at the West Park Cemetery after her funeral service that was held at Orlando Holy Cross Anglican Church in Orlando West.  The church became small for the scores of people who had come in numbers to say their final goodbye to mama Khoza. Many people had to wait outside the church where there were tents erected, fitted with speakers and TV screens for them to see what was happening inside the church. Prominent people attended the funeral.They included the likes of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, Police Minister Bheki Cele, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, businessman Patrice Motsepe, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa and Eff leader Julius Malema amongst many.
