A horrific dog bite left a womanÂ with pubic hair growing on her face after a skin grafting operation. Crystal Combs was bitten by a pitbull when she was 9 years old and a chunk of her cheek was torn off. The Dr's who performed the operation at the time took the skin from Crystal's groin to help heal the wound. Crystal says years later, hair started growing on the patch.  On the episode of E!'s Botched, Crystal said since becoming a mum she's more self-conscious than ever. Crystal asked the doctors on Botched! to do what they can to minimise her graft.They explained that it is a risky procedure and it is "actually deceptively complicated". Dr Dubrow explained that skin graft is very close to critical anatomic structures like the nose, the cheeks and the eye but thankfully, the operation was successful and Crystal was only left with a thin scar on her cheek.
