Orlando Pirates head coach Josef Zinnbauer was delighted with his team's first-half performance against Polokwane City but wanted to see more after the break. The Buccaneers cruised to a 4-1 victory over Rise and Shine at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday thanks to a first-half hat-trick from Gabadinho Mhango, with the fourth slotted by Ben Motshwari on the stroke of half-time. Zinnbauer was impressed by what he saw from his charges in the first 45 minutes, but the Buccaneers lost the second half 1-0 as Mohammed Anas found the back of the net, which frustrated the German tactician. "This is the football we want to see. But we had two halves. We had the first and second half. The first was very good and the second not so good. But I understand a little bit the players, they had two games in three days," Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV. "We have next weekend a very big game. But I hope the players understand me when I get tomorrow to comment on the second half. "First, we need a little bit time. We are improving the team a little bit at the moment. And then, maybe the players (thought) we have four goals, we (can) go a little bit back and not so many steps. "Then the opponent came because they have nothing to lose then it's not so easy to come back in the game. That's the thing." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
