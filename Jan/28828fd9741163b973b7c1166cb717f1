THE family of Morgan Malebye of Makapanstad wants justice. The 50-year-old father of three died at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Tshwane on Wednesday, after he was allegedly beaten by Bangladeshi businessmen. His brother, Tshepo (44), said their aunt found him lying on the floor of their house last Monday. “She said he couldn’t talk but looked like he was beaten. She called me and we called an ambulance to take him to the hospital,” he said. Tshepo said the family investigated what happened after his brother died. “The neighbours told me he was attacked by Bangladeshis, so I went to their shop. They said my brother threw sand in their shop but they didn’t beat him,” he said. Tshepo said his family was not xenophobic but he wanted the Bangladeshi businessmen removed from the area. “We’ve been living with these people for years, but they have stepped on our toes this time. “It’s painful and we are not condoning xenophobic attacks, but we just want them to move.” According to Tshepo, residents were angry about what happened. “They said they are waiting for us to bury Morgan and then they will take action,” he said. Tshepo said it seemed his brother knew he was going to die before the incident. “On the first of this month, he made peace with all the people he wronged,” he said. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said a 24-year-old man was arrested for murder. “He appeared in the Moretele Magistrates Court last Thursday and was due to appear again yesterday,” she said.
