BIDVEST Wits duo Ricardo Goss and and Sameehg Doutie have been charged with misconduct after they allegedly assaulted match official. The Premier Soccer League confirmed on Thursday that two Wits players have beenÂ charged for their part in allegedly assaulting referee, Masixole Bambiso. Goalkeeper, Goss and midfielder, Doutie were involved in a quarrel as Wits were beaten 2-0 by Cape Town City on 18 January. Goss was subsequently shown a yellow card, while Doutie walked away scot-free from the scene. However, the League's prosecutor Nande Becker will now take retrospective action.
