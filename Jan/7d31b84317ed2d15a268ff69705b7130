GOSPEL star Sipho Makhabane’s quest to see an accident-free Easter weekend has taken off again. Big Fish, as Makhabane is popularly known, and his partners Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency launched their Annual Easter Prayer Festival on Friday. According to Sipho, the aim of the pre-Easter prayer festival that takes place at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga was to conscientise the community about the danger of road fatalities. Explained Big Fish: “Over the years, there’ve been many death on our roads and, as concerned citizens, we’re playing our role to call on people not to speed on the road.” Sipho said the Friday event was to launch the campaign to urge people to be careful. “Everytime we approach Easter, we count dead bodies on our roads and it is a concern,” Big Fish said. “As Christians or religious belivers, we need to play our role and pray.” He called on community and religious leaders to pray. “Many people take these things lightly until it hits home. You’ll think you’re not affected until you lose someone you love on the road.” Sipho said this year’s prayer would take place on 4 April. “It’s an all-night prayer with a strong gospel line-up,” he said. “It includes Sbu Noah, Zaza, Thobekile, Thina Zungu, Omega, Israel Mosehla, Shongwe and Khuphuka. Bishop I Makamu will be the guest speaker.” He said they’d also pray for gender-based violence.
