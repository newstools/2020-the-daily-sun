THE Madondos are grateful to be alive! They escaped death after lightning struck a tree in their yard during heavy rain on Sunday night. READ: WATCH: LOVER IS MY ARMS AND LEGS! Vusumuzi Madondo (52) from KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, told Daily Sun they heard a loud bang. “It sounded like a gunshot. We rushed outside and a tree branch had fallen on the house.” The damage to the roof was right above a bedroom. “We’re relieved that no one was injured.” He said the tree had been there for many years and had caused problems before. “A few years ago we got someone to cut off the branches but it still grew.”  They want eThekwini Municipality to cut it down. “We’ve told ward committee members about it,” he said. “When they were campaigning during the elections in 2016, we wanted the tree cut down but they never came back to us. One day this tree will kill someone.” WATCH: I MEET MAMLAMBO! Councillor Mondli Zwane said he’d assist the family. He said: “Our teams are assessing the damage. We’ve not received reports of fatalities.”
