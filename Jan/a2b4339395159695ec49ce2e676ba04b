Philasande told Daily Sun living without parents was painful. “There are days when we go to bed on empty stomachs. I sometimes ask God why my father dieEven though we struggled, someone took care of us even though he did not workd,” he said. Philasande will be in matric this year., but will only get his results next week. “We’re asking anyone to buy us uniform and maybe get us a proper place to stay because our living condition is bad,” he said. “We live here because we don’t have anywhere else to go.” Khaya dropped out of grade 8 last year because his uniform was old and kids used to tease him. “I would have dropped out even if my father was still alive because he couldn’t afford to buy uniform for us,” he said. Khaya said he wanted to go back to school even though he was old. The brothers said they were grateful to their neighbours for giving them food.
