Advocate Nompilo Kholeka Gcaleka has been appointed the Deputy Public Protector for a period of seven years from February 1, 2020.  President Cyril Ramaphosa made the appointment in terms of Section 2 A (1) of the Public Protector Act 23 of 1994 on the National Assembly's recommendation. "President Ramaphosa thanked Advocate Malunga for his contribution in the office of the Public Protector and service to the people of South Africa," the Presidency said in a statement on Friday. Gcaleka was a special advisor at National Treasury and the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was during these stints that she acted as Malusi Gigaba's legal advisor during his controversial tenure as finance minister. She was also previously a deputy director of public prosecutions in the National Prosecuting Authority, under disgraced former National Director of Public Prosecutions Menzi Simelane, and a senior state advocate. Ramaphosa, in wishing Gcaleka well on her new role, said he is "confident she will execute the responsibilities before her with diligence and commitment".  In December, the National Assembly approved the recommendation to appoint Gcaleka.  While the ANC parliamentarians on the justice and correctional services portfolio committee lauded her for the way she handled her interview, the EFF and the DA both raised objections about her integrity for continuing to work under Gigaba even after he was found to have lied under oath.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-president-appoints-nompilo-kholeka-gcaleka-deputy-public-protector-20200131
