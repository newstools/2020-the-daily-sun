COMEDIAN Pastor Mjosty is demanding money from maskandi artist Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele. He said Mthandeni was booked to perform at the Goduka Music Festival in Umlazi, south of Durban last month, but never arrived. On the day of the event, Mthandeni posted on his Instragram page that he would not be taking part in the event because he was drunk. Mjosty said Mthandeni charged him R10 000 for his performance.  “I paid him the full amount but I was disappointed when he failed to come and perform. Instead, he posted on Instagram that he was drunk and would not be coming,” he said. “I didn’t make him sign a contract because I trusted him. Since he has proven he cannot be trusted, I want my money back. Every time I contact him, he gives me attitude. “The one time he asked me how much I’m worth so he can buy me. I’m truly disappointed in him because I have always treated him as my brother. I honestly don’t understand why he’s doing this to me.” When Daily Sun asked Mjosty to show proof of payment, he said: “I don’t think that would be necessary. It would give him undue credit. I feel he is using us to get publicity.” Mthandeni said he never intended to take part in the event. “The event was not on my level. I sent the Instagram post to mock them. Even if I took part, I would not do it for R10 000. I usually charge between R50 000 and R70 000,” he said. “But I understand that Mjosty is old and hungry. He must just come forward and I’ll give him a job.”
