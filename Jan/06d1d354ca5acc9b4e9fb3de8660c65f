Five people died after a Petrol tanker and a sedan collided on the N1 highway south of Polokwane last night. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said four died at the scene and the fifth one later succumbed to injuries in hospital on Wednesday morning.  All five deceased were in the sedan. The driver of the petrol tanker, which caught fire after the collision and partially burned, was taken to hospital. He was alone in the vehicle. Mojapelo said the KIA sedan with five occupants allegedly swerved into the opposite lane (south-bound) and collided with a tanker which was traveling in a southerly direction. The deceased are unknown at this stage. A case of Culpable Homicide has been opened by the police in Westenburg on the outskirts of Polokwane. The cause of this accident will be determined by the ongoing investigations.
