GAUTENG Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile has slammed the torching of a Mamelodi councillor’s office over the weekend. He said angry residents burnt down the office of Tshwane ANC Councillor Mmina-Tau Marishane on Friday night. During a visit to the area yesterday, he said residents were angry over the occupation of a block of new flats in Mamelodi extension 5, sparked by the city evicting people illegally occupying the flats. “We can’t allow lawlessness to define our approach to addressing the housing backlog in the province. It’s on this basis that we will continue to evict those occupying houses illegally,” he said.  Maile called on residents to use proper channels to raise grievances. “We condemn this criminal act by faceless individuals. We call on police agencies to catch those responsible. We also call on residents to work with the police.” The MEC said burning down public offices also attacked government’s pledge to fulfil its promise to build people decent houses.  ANC regional spokesman Bafuze Yabo pleaded with the city’s administrators to go about their business in a way that protected councillors. He said delayed allocation of the new units seemed to have sparked the occupation.  “It’s our view that city administration should have handled the allocation with urgency. The lazy pace at which allocations were processed caused the attack.”
