QUEEN Elizabeth has summoned her grandson Prince Harry for a crisis meeting today. She wanted to discuss future plans for him and his wife Meghan after the couple’s shocking announcement that they wanted to step back from royal duties. Harry’s father Prince Charles and his brother Prince William will also attend the meeting at the queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, said a palace source. Former US TV actress Meghan will try to join via telephone from Canada where she returned last week to rejoin the couple’s baby son, Archie. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex surprised the royal family on Wednesday by announcing they wanted a new working model to allow them to spend more time in North America, and be financially independent. They didn’t consult the Queen or members of the family before making their announcement on https://sussexroyal.com, a move which hurt the queen and other royals, said a source. – REUTERS
