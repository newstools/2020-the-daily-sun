Former Black Leopards boss Luc Eymael has revealed that he has turned down an offer from Absa Premiership side AmaZulu FC. Eymael was at the helm of Leopards for just three months earlier in the season before resigning. And since his resignation, the Belgian mentor revealed he has been in talks with Usuthu but he said the deal could not materialise as the club delayed in offering him a contract. Surprisingly, AmaZulu coach Jozef Vukusic joined Usuthu three months ago in September last year, and Eymael is giving an impression that the club is ready to wield the axe on the Slovakian. Eymael, who joined Leopards from Egyptian side Tala'ea El Gaish, said AmaZulu bosses offered him a deal and advised him to wait for them until 12 January, but he said he could not wait. "I don't want to wait," he said. However, Eymael's South African representative Mike Makaab distanced himself from the AmaZulu allegations. "I know nothing about AmaZulu," said the Prosport International boss. "I only represent Luc locally and I don't know anything about AmaZulu, and I don't want to talk about it."
