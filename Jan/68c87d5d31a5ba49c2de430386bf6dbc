MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane prefers to chase rather than being chased in the fierce Absa Premiership title race. Kaizer Chiefs appear to be running away with the league title with a healthy nine points lead at the top of the summit. But Mosimane said that is where he wants them and he is adamant that chasing down Amakhosi will take his charges out of their comfort zone. Speaking ahead of their big league showdown with rivals Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm), Mosimane said he has Chiefs where he wants them. It’s time now for the defending league champions to bring their A-game, according to Mosimane. Tonight’s game against the Buccaneers is too big to lose. The Brazilians have collected 32 points from 16 matches while Chiefs lead the way with 41 points, having one game more than Downs. The Brazilians are hoping to make use of their game in hand to put more pressure on Amakhosi. Mosimane explained how the title is won: “I want to chase, that’s what am good at. When you chase you are putting pressure on the team at the top. If they don’t have the mental capacity, then it’s just a matter of time before they collapse and that is when we will pounce.” He revealed how he successfully chased down Pirates and snatched the league title away from them in the past season. He wants to use the same strategy to topple Chiefs. He added: “Last year I enjoyed chasing Pirates because I knew that their boys had never won a league title before. But with Chiefs it is a bit different because Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiant, Eric Mathoho and Willard Katsande have a bit of experience having won the title before. But the others have not won it before and don’t have the experience to hang in there.” Mosimane is counting on the experience of Hlompho Kekana and Denis Onyango. “Don’t undermine the role that experience plays because we have plenty of it at Downs. I know how to deal with a team on top,” he said.
