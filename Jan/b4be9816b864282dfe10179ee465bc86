THE January transfer window period has yielded positive results for three South African players – Darren Smith, Ayabulela Konqobe and Bantu Mzwakali. The players’ agent Raymond Pienaar confirmed the transfer of striker Smith, formerly with SuperSport United, and ex-Ajax Cape Town’s Konqobe, who have both moved to Ekenas IF in the Finnish 2nd Division in Finland. “They have both signed short-term contracts with an option to renew. The club have a young Spanish coach (Guillem Santesmases) and is very ambitious to win promotion this year,” Pienaar said. Mzwakali has moved on to join IK Brage on a short term contract too in the Swedish Superettan League. Smith made his debut for Ekenas IF at the weekend when they played against IF Gnistan. They lost the game 4-0. “It is a very good team that is always challenging for promotion to the top Allsvenskan League, though they are sixth on the log. “Mihlali Mayambela was playing there (Djurgardens IF) before moving to Portugal. “It is long overdue for both these boys to challenge themselves abroad.” Orlando Pirates graduate Yanga Baliso is also set to move before the end of the week. Others who are in the Scandinavian leagues are Keanin Ayer and striker Tashreeq Matthews at Varberg, Vaughan Miller is with Vartans IK, while Langelihle Mdletshe plays for Rosengard in Division 2.
