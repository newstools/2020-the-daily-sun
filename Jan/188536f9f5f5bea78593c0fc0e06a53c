Mshiyeni Fosi, a community member and principal at Goso Forest Junior Secondary School, said: “We decided to start building the school so the department could see we were serious and hoping they’d assist us. The school will be for grade 8s and 9s.” They had decided to name the school Majuba Senior Secondary after their late chief, who came up with the idea. “We have asked each family to buy 10 bricks. Those who work were asked to contribute R1 000 to pay the builder,” he said. Zimasa Gidana (38) said the school would save them money on transport fare. Education spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said a plan to build a new school took years.
