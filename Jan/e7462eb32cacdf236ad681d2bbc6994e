COSATU general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali has accused the ANC leadership of lying to the dead. Ntshalitshali was speaking at a wreath-laying ceremony at Avalon Cemetery in Soweto yesterday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of SACP leader Joe Slovo’s death. “In 2018, they promise every year when we commemorate him they would be here but none of them is here today,” he said. Gauteng SACP chairman Joe Mpisi agreed, saying it was not right. “When they have events we always make sure we’re there but they can’t return the favour. It’s wrong,” he said. Mayor Geoff Makhubo said if the leadership lied to the dead, bad things would follow them. Delivering the keynote address, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande described Slovo as a true soldier. He said Slovo hated racism with a passion. “He wouldn’t approve of what America is doing in Iran,” he said. On behalf of the family, Slovo’s widow, Helena Dolny, thanked the party for continuing to honour his legacy. At the time of his death in 1995, Slovo was national chairman of the SACP. He was general secretary from 1986 to 1991. He was also a former uMkhonto weSizwe chief of staff. He was one of the drafters of the Freedom Charter and was the first white person to be elected to the ANC’s NEC at the first consultative conference in Zambia in 1985. He served as housing minister in Nelson Mandela’s cabinet until his death. ANC had not commented at the time of going to print.
