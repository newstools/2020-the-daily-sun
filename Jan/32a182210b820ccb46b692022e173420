IF Knowledge Musona can become available, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says he won’t hesitate and he’ll definitely grab him. Speaking after his side's 3-0 win over AmaZulu at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday evening, Mosimane added that Musona, a proven goalscorer in the PSL, would be a valuable addition to his side. Reports have been awash that Musona is unsettled at Belgium side Anderlecht and is likely to see his contract terminated during this January transfer window. The 29-year-old’s contract with the club ends in June 2022, with whom he joined from Andile Jali’s former club KV Oostende in July 2018. But he has contributed little for the Belgium giants. “Will you love to have Musona if he’s available? Yes, of course,” said Mosimane without any hesitation. “Why not if he’s available? He’s the kind of player that I’ll take because I know he scores goals, and he’s fighter, he’s like Khama Billiat, he’s strong, his attitude is right, he’s a good player.” Musona spent the second half of last season at Lokeren, another Belgium club on loan, where he scored just one goal in six appearances. So far this season, he has yet to play for Anderlecht. His future being in question doesn’t come as a surprise that he might be offloaded. If he indeed sees his contract terminated and then joins Sundowns, it would most likely take him a bit of time to get in shape and full fitness. But that is a risk Mosimane is willing to take. “If we can get him, yes, why not. I’d love to have him,” Jingles added.
