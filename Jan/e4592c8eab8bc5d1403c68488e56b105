DAN Dliwayo (26) realised he couldn’t stand hunger any longer so he decided to do something about it. Dan from Mkhuhlu outside Hazyview, Mpumalanga, now made people beg for more when he performed his dance moves at malls and taxi ranks dressed in a wig and women’s clothing! Dan told Daily Sun he wore women’s clothing because they made him stand out and helped him show his acting talent. He grew up in poverty and was raised by a single parent after his father left them. “We had to sleep on empty stomachs and that opened my eyes. I decided to use my talent and started singing and dancing. “I now make a living by entertaining crowds at malls and taxi ranks. I also move around the country to show my talent.” He said some men would sometimes forget he was also a man. “They get horny when I dance,” he said. “Some men don’t realise I’m a man until they touch my boobs, but I just laugh it off.” Known to his fans as Mr Dee, he said whenever he travelled to other provinces he ensured he left a mark and made a name for himself. He said on a good day he made R500 and when the money was enough, he sent it back to his family to support his wife, child, mum and two siblings. “I love to dance and sing. I’m taking my talent to places like Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Eswatini.” He said he sang about his life story and dreamt of releasing an album soon. “I love what I do,’ he said.
