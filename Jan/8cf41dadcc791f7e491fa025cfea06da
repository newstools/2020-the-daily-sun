FORMER Orlando Pirates coach Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic, who left the country in a huff, on the eve of an important match against Highlands Park in August last year, was back in the country. He attended Irvin Khoza's wife, Ausi Mantoa's funeral in Johannesburg on Saturday. When Micho left the Buccaneers abruptly, the SAPS were extensively quoted in the media saying that a case of sexual assault was opened against the Serbia-born coach at the Norwood police station. Micho disputed the allegations leveled against him. On Saturday, Micho was among those who were present to pay their last respects to Ausi Mantoa. The funeral was attended by A-listers of Mzansi. He was this week appointed as the head coach of the Zambian national team, fondly known as Chipolopolo. Efforts to reach Micho on Saturday proved unsuccessful.
