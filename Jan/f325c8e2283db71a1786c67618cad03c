Speaking about Pearl Thusi’s role as the lead actress in the series, Netflix vice-president of international originals Erik Barmack said: “Taking talent like this and telling stories to the rest of the world puts Pearl in the same category as other strong female characters like Claire Underwood in House of Cards and Jessica Jones.” Queen Sono was in production for over eight weeks, and was shot in 37 different locations in Africa, including South Africa, Kenya, Zanzibar and Lagos.The all-African cast and crew also includes Vuyo Dabula, Enhle Mbali, Loyiso Madinga, Abigail Kubeka, and Khathu Ramabulana.
