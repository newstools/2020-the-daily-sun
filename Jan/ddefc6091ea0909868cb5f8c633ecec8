Veteran music promoter and artist Vusi Leeuw wants to stretch his contribution into the growth of music to greater heights. Leeuw, who is known as the pioneer of musical festival Moshito, said he is joining internationally renowned Warmer Music as A&R manager this month. “When they approached me and shared their strategy, it was in line with my values that is the main reason I bought into the idea,” he said. He also said that he was highly motivated by continuing his contribution towards the development of South African and African music. He is credited with building the careers of household names including Toya Delazy and kwaito group TKZee. “I’m really excited to join the Warner Music family. I believe there’s such a dept of talent in South Africa and I’m looking forward to contributing to the creation of the next generation of artists and the growth of the industry,” he added. Leeuw created a reputation for himself while working at both multi-national music companies Sony Music and EMI, as well as independent label 999 with musician Arthur Mafokate. He also revealed that the stable boosts the likes of pop sensation Zahara and the duo Locnville.
