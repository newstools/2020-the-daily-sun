LITTLE Joy Vellem is proof that dynamite comes in small packages. The 11-year-old pupil at Generaal Beyers Primary School in Tshwane came home last week after winning two platinum medals at the World Acrobatic Championships in Thailand. Over the past two years, Joy has won 22 medals for acrobatic dancing and shows no signs of slowing down. Joy, originally from the Eastern Cape, said God had given her a talent for dancing. “This is the beginning. I want to be the best dancer and make my country, community and family proud,” she said. Joy said when she was five, she fell in love with dancing. “I want to be part of the Olympics one day, and my advice to other children is that they must not be scared to use their talents,” she said. Her dad Aaron (47) said Joy had always loved gymnastics, which led her to dancing. “We’re proud of her and she does well in school too,” he said. Joy’s mum Bongiwe (41) said she was very grateful to have such a talented child. “My child is the first person in the family to be a national champion,” she said. The parents thanked the Sheila Flaherty Academy of Dance for training Joy. They said Joy would also participate in the American Dance Awards in July, and in September she will travel to Australia for the Acrobatic Championships. Bongiwe said she believed her daughter would go very far.
