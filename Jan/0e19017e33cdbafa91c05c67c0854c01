AT LEAST nine people were confirmed dead and thousands were forced to evacuate. This after a severe flood hit Indonesia’s capital Jakarta as residents celebrated the New Year. Tens of thousands of revellers were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year’s Eve fireworks on Wednesday. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo on Wednesday said that monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 90 neighbourhoods and triggered a landslide in Depok, a city on the outskirts of Jakarta. Wibowo said the dead included a 16-year-old high school pupil who was electrocuted while more than 19 000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached up to three metres in several places. The victim’s father, Al Latif Ilyas Darmawan, said rescuers were unable to save his son, Arviqo Alif Ardana. “I did not know what had happened until his younger brother came and told me that his brother had died. When I arrived at the scene, people said my child was electrocuted when he was holding a lamp-post hoping to be rescued,” said Darmawan. Warning of more flooding, Governor Anies Baswedan told reporters that after conducting an aerial survey over the flooded city, as much as 370 millimeters of rainfall, more than three times the average amount was recorded in Jakarta and West Java’s hilly areas, resulting in the Ciliwung and Cisadane rivers overflowing. He said about 120 000 rescuers have been sent to evacuate those affected. – REUTERS
