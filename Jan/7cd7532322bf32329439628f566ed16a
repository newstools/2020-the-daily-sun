POLICE Minister Bheki Cele dropped everything and rushed to Alexandra. This came after residents of the kasi gathered outside the local police station on Thursday to protest, leading to rubber bullets being fired. The residents were furious about cops allegedly killing innocent people. They said the latest victim was newly-wed Samantha Radebe (29), who was killed during a shootout between cops and thugs on Wednesday. Protesters claimed Samantha was shot by a cop who had also killed resident Sizwe Mbokazi in 2017 in a similar situation. They said he had shot other people as well. Resident Mxolisi Magwaza said: “He is always chasing criminals and innocent people are dying in the process.”According to witnesses, the thug who was being chased by the cops was not armed. Mazwi Mbatha (39) said: “He wasn’t shooting. He just ran in Samantha’s direction and this cop decided to shoot even though there were bystanders. “That’s exactly what he did to Sizwe and many others. His is an assassin in police uniform. We want him gone.” Councillor Tefo Raphadu said many lives had been lost at the hands of the officer. “He deserves to be in orange overalls and not a police uniform,” he said. Samantha’s brother Morena Mathane (35) told Daily Sun she died exactly a month after she got married.“This is bad. We hope we will get justice for her,” he said. During his visit to the kasi, Cele promised Ipid would investigate the incident. He was accompanied by Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko.
