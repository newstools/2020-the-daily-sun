RESIDENTS of Katlehong in Ekurhuleni are at war with foreigners. They want them gone and want spaza shops to be owned by Mzansi people. The clash led to a shoot-out on Sunday morning, which left one foreigner hurt and another moered and burnt. Residents said the clashes started in September and the situation was now worse. A resident told Daily Sun two men broke into her spaza shop on 27 December and told her to close it down. She said she was scared, but wasn’t surprised as the clash between residents and foreigners was the talk of the kasi. “I didn’t want trouble, so I closed my shop. They didn’t take anything. “They just left me with the warning,” she said.  Another resident said he was threatened to never have a foreign tenant or else they would burn his house. “This is actually the second time. The first time was in September. I won’t allow them to come back because my life is at risk,” he said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Mathapelo Peters said Katlehong cops were investigating an attempted murder case. She said a 24-year-old man was about to open a shop at Thuthukani Shops at Mnisi Section in Katlehong, when a white Toyota Corolla with tinted windows parked a few metres from the shop. “One man came out with a gun and fired three shots. The suspect got into the car and the driver speed off.” No one has been arrested. The station’s acting commander, Colonel Phakama Gcaza, appealed to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect to contact the office of Katlehong detectives on 011 617 3686. “Alternatively, they can call Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Gcaza.
