MTHUNZI Mazibuko (62) wants to spice up people’s love lives. He created Akulaleki Mawunembiza, which he said would set the bed on fire. The madala from Mzimhlophe Hostel in Soweto has been selling Akulaleki for more than five years. This after he lost his job. “I had nothing to help me survive and thought of a business I could start,” Mthunzi said. He said he remembered how his mkhulu used to cook imbiza back home in KZN. “I used to help him get the herbs, crush and mix them, and cook imbiza. I do the same,” said Mthunzi. He sells the 2-litre bottles for R70. “I started small and people spread the word. I now have more than 100 clients who buy regularly,” he said. “We gave it the name Akulaleki when many of my clients told me they couldn’t sleep at night as all they wanted was a poke. “My wish is for this business to grow until I one day have something like a pharmacy where I sell different traditional herbs. I’m not a sangoma but a herbalist.” Client Mandla Maphumulo (40) said: “My marriage nearly ended when I couldn’t satisfy my wife in the bedroom. “I was told about this imbiza by a friend. After drinking it things changed. Today, me and my wife are the happiest.” His wife Nompendulo (36) said: “My husband is the best. Whatever he drinks, I don’t want him to stop. It has made our home warm.”
