SHADRACK Sindane was horrified when he was approaching home over the weekend and found a huge plume of smoke rising from his yard. As he got closer, he found his three-bedroom shack covered in flames. The 74-year-old from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, soon realised the disaster happened because the area didn’t have electricity. Shadrack said his children were cooking on a paraffin stove which exploded. “My daughter came out to fetch water from the tap, and when she returned there was a fire,” he said. “She said it happened so fast that by the time neighbours arrived to help, the flames were out of control.” He said no one in his family had a job and they relied on his grant. “I’m worried about how I’m going to raise the money to have the shack rebuilt,” he said. Firefighters came to the scene but arrived too late to save the shack. “We lost clothes, beds and food. We have to start all over again,” he said. However, he said he was grateful that none of his kids died in the fire. “I’m grateful to God for sparing my family. When I first saw the smoke and realised it was coming from my house, I almost fainted,” he said. The damage could be worth about R20 000. “I’m appealing for second hand building materials and old furniture so we can rebuild our lives.”
