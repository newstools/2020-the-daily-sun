MAMELODI Sundowns have terminated striker Tokelo Rantie’s contract, with immediate effect. This after the Bafana Bafana international and Bournemouth man had gone AWOL for a month. “The standard at Sundowns is high for a professional footballer and there is a zero-tolerance for ill-discipline,” said Legal Executive Yogesh Singh on the club’s website. “Of course, players are human and we will first go through counseling to correct a player’s behavior but there is a line and when that is crossed we do not compromise the dressing-room for any individual player.” Sundowns had given Rantie a lifeline with a three-year contract, despite having previously been in the wilderness following a troubled time at Cape Town City. Rantie was on trial with the Brazillians for over two and half months with coach Pitso Mosimane eventually deciding to gamble on him. That gamble, though, has not paid off, leaving Mosimane very disappointed and let down. "It's shame about Tokelo, he is missing the party," said Mosimane on SuperSportTV.
