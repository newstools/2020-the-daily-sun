SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is aiming to throw another spanner in the works and upset Mamelodi Sundowns for the second time this season. These two Tshwane giants lock horns in what promises to be a titanic Absa Premiership derby at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm) with both sides in contention to pip leaders Kaizer Chiefs for the title. The defending champions, Downs are second on 32 points from 16 matches - a point ahead of third placed ?Matsatsantsa who have played two more games than their city rivals. Amakhosi lead the field with 41 points from 17 matches. When these two sides last met, SuperSport got the better of Sundowns in the MTN8 semi-final second leg at the same venue (2-0 to win 3-1 on aggregate) last September. SuperSport went all the way to claim the trophy after defeating Highlands Park 1-0 in the final. “It’s a derby, a tough game, that is how it is,” said Tembo who was relieved that his side didn’t have a midweek match. These sides are not done yet. They’ll meet again in the Nedbank Cup last 32 next month after they were paired together in the draw last week. Tembo added: “Sundowns are a very strong team. But this match is just like any other football match we play, it is another very competitive game. In the league, it is about getting the three points. In the cup, it is about progressing to the next round.” SuperSport will be without Teboho Mokoena as he’s suspended. The 22-year-old, who has been key this season in the heart of the midfield along with captain Dean Furman, picked up his fourth booking in their 2-0 win over AmaZulu in Durban last Sunday. This will open the window for Sipho Mbule, who has been substituted in three of SuperSport’s last four matches. This comes as a surprise as Mbule has been a stand out player for SuperSport, just weeks after claiming the Player of the Month award in December. Tembo says there’s “lot of competition” in the team and he wants his players to be on their toes all the time. .
