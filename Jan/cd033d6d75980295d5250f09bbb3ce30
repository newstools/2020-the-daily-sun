SHIRLEY Kaliko cares about women. The 26-year-old hosted a women’s breakfast in Unitas Park, Vereeniging, on Saturday. She told Daily Sun she was the only child at home and didn’t have any sisters she could talk to.

Shirley said she had found sisters at the breakfast event. “We’re bound by the word of God and we trust each other.” She said she wanted to change the stereotype that women were not united. Mampho Motsoane (26) from Sebokeng zone 6, Vaal, said the event gave her courage to open up to the other women as she realised she wasn’t the only one going through a lot. She said she had bottled up her problems for years. “I have never spoken about my problems. I could relate to them and they did not judge me. I also love the fact that they draw their strength from God whenever they have problems,” said Mampho. READ: RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING!
