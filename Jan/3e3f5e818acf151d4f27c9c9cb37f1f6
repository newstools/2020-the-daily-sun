A
new year, new decade, new intentions, new resolutions…we all start the year out
hoping to make much needed life changes but very soon these become a distant
memory. The good news is that we are only a few habits away from success, says
Helene Vermaak, Business Director of corporate cultural experts, The Human Edge. 
A new study* has revealed that the most important factor to career success in
2020 is habits, surpassing decisions, natural talent and even luck. The
study revealed that nearly 46% of participants attributed their career success
to having the right habits. Meaning, that an individual's simple, routine
behaviour was more than twice as critical to their success, than even the
decisions they made.  Natural talent only came in at 24.6%, being far
outweighed by habits.  And, only 6% of participants credited luck to their
success. "So,
if you are looking to make some changes in 2020, kick it off by establishing
some habits that will help you achieve the success you are looking for,"
advises Vermaak.  The below three tips are a starting point to learning
new career habits: Participants of the study
were also asked about the habits they attribute to their success and
surprisingly these were less valiant and uncomplicated.
"The thing with habits is that in most cases they will trigger a series of
habits that become powerful and make impactful changes in our lives," says
Vermaak. Some
of the participants habits included: Vermaak
says that by adopting and creating some new simple habits you can
change your workplace performance. If you or your team require assistance in
learning the skills to adopting new habits, The Human Edge will be launching,
later this year, the internationally acclaimed training course The Power of
Habit, based on the New York Times bestselling book of the same title by
Charles Duhigg.
