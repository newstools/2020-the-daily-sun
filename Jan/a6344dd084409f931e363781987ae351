Afro-soul vocalist Mlindo The Vocalist has been involved in yet another terrible car accident. It apparently happened in KwaZulu Natal yesterday, as pictures showed his black Mercedes-Benz van overturned. His manager Nyiko Bilankulu confirmed Mlindo was in an accident but wasn’t injured. “He is okay and we can confirm the car was badly damaged and it’s probably a write-off. It was our car that we used for his touring trips.” This accident comes just a month after the singer nearly died when he was involved in another accident in Durban. Bilankulu said the singer wasn’t badly injured and would be discharged from hospital in a day or two.
