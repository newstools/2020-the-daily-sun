It's a debate as old as time - does Cape Town or Johannesburg have the worst traffic? While one has much longer distances to drive, the other has very few entry points into the city centre. But popular GPS tracker TomTom has updated their index for 2019 - and Cape Town has come out on top - or bottom, depending on how you look at it. Position: Out of a list of 416 cities, the Mother City ranks in 101st place with a 32% congestion rate, with a 1% increase from last year. Least traffic day: The day with the least traffic was a Sunday on 11 August in 2019 with a 7% congestion rate. Worst traffic day: The worst traffic took place on 25 October on a Friday - it was a weekend that the city experienced torrential rain with localised flooding. It had a congestion rate of 59%. Best time to avoid traffic: According to TomTom, you can save five hours per year for a 30-minute commute if you travel before 07:00 on a Monday morning. Time lost in rush hour per year: Six days and 10 hours. Position: The City of Gold is 20 positions below Cape Town in 121st place, with a congestion rate of 30% - the same as last year. Least traffic day: Joburg only had 4% congestion on 26 December last year. Worst traffic day: The traffic that killed Joburgers took place on Valentine's Day on a Thursday, with 60% congestion. This could have been due to Stage 2 loadshedding implemented on that day. Best time to avoid traffic: You can save six hours per year for a 30-minute commute if you travel before 07:00 on a Monday morning. Time lost in rush hour per year: Same as Cape Town - six days and 10 hours.

Worst traffic day: A 53% congestion rate was achieved also on 14 February - same as Joburg - probably also because of loadshedding.
