READ: I FEEL FOR ALGER COACH – MOSIMANE Madala Alex claimed he fought and killed a crocodile on his farm in March 2006. Alex made headlines when he claimed to have fought a 2,7 metre crocodile at Mlumati River in Nkomazi, KZN, after an epic five-hour battle. The 67-year-old, who has been admitted to Shongwe Hospital, told Daily Sun that because of the heat, he decided to cool off in the river. “I took my clothes off and when I turned back, I realised that something had grabbed me. I turned back and saw the crocodile. It had bitten off part of my bum,” he said. “I tried pushing it away with my elbow, but we both fell down. “I watched the crocodile walk away.”  After the attack he crawled to the road to ask for help because he was scared it would come back. He said he believed he was saved by God because the crocodile could have killed him. He said the crocodiles also tried to attack his dogs on Saturday. Alex said he would have killed the crocodile if he hadn’t been in such pain. “But this is becoming a problem. The struggle between myself and the crocodiles is not over. I declare war.”
