THE DA in eThekwini has called on the ANC to explain whether
Mxolisi Kaunda or Zandile Gumede is the mayor. This comes after a photo was posted on Facebook of executive
committee members Thanduxolo Sabelo, Mpume Sithole, Ntokozo Sibiya and Sipho
Kaunda at a meeting being chaired by Gumede. The caption of the photo posted by Sabelo read: “Today we
met with the leadership of the ANC to account on the work we are doing in the
municipality.” DA eThekwini leader Nicole Graham yesterday told Daily Sun
it was shocking to see committee members reporting to Gumede, who was recalled
as mayor and regional ANC chairwoman. “It’s concerning that after residents were told the new
leadership would be cleaning out corruption and running the city differently,
they are still accounting to Gumede, who is facing corruption charges,” she
said. “This means they are still implementing Gumede’s agenda,
which means she is still running the city from behind.” Graham said it looked like the ANC had brought Gumede back
through the back door. She called on the ANC to clarify Gumede’s status in the
municipality. Sabelo said Gumede was the deputy convener of the Regional
Task Team, which meant as councillors, they still had to report to her. He said
Gumede had to chair the meeting because convener Kwazi Mshengu was running
late. The meeting apparently took place on Monday. ANC provincial spokesman Ricardo Mthembu said administrative
and political positions were different and should’t be confused.
