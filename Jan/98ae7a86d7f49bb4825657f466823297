PRECIOUS Mogale feels the justice system has failed her. The 29-year-old from Soshanguve block X told Daily Sun she didn’t feel safe after her ex-fiance was released from jail.  He allegedly tried to kill her. She said he shot her on Christmas Day after he found her with her new man. “We were sleeping and heard a knock on the door. “I knew it was my ex because he always came here late at night,” she said. “He became angry when he saw my new man. He drew a gun. “My boyfriend also drew a gun and they both fired shots. My ex shot me in the chest. “I couldn’t believe it. I was shocked and confused. “I just saw blood on my T-shirt and realised he had shot me.” Precious said she broke up with her ex because he was abusive. “I got fed up when I lost my baby because of stress. I knew then I was done,” she said. She said she was scared her ex would come back to finish her off. She was disappointed in the justice system. “I have bullet wounds and my neighbours witnessed everything. What other evidence does one need?” she said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of attempted murder was opened. “The suspect was arrested and had been in custody. “He appeared in court on Tuesday. The case was not placed on the roll because of lack of evidence.” NPA spokeswoman Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane said she’d check what had happened with the case. “She must approach the court for advice if she feels it was unfair and start by applying for a protection order,” she said.
