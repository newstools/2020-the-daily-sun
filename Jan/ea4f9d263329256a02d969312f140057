CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink has a brave warrior in midfilder Thabo Nodada. The Citizens have not been at their best this season, even the new coach in his three months since he arrived in the country, has not been able to turn things around. But Nodada said changing their attitude and being arrogant could help them salvage the situation. “The team is not winning, the position is not in our favour and it’s been testing times,” Nodada said during the club’s media open day. “I think at this point grabbing someone (teammate) on their chest and smacking them will probably do more than speaking. “That is the type of anger and attitude we need right now. “We need a bit of arrogance. To get some of that arrogance back will do us good. “It will get everybody believing in their ability and knowing they can do it.” City are currently occupying position 13 in the Absa Premiership with 17 points from 18 matches. They are just a point above Polokwane City, who are languishing at the bottom of the table with 16 points. On Saturday they host title contenders Bidvest Wits in a league clash at Cape Town Stadium at (8.15pm) Nodada said they will need to fight Wits with everything to ensure The Citizens register their fourth victory of the campaign. He stated: “Wits are in the title race, so we are expecting a fight for the three points from them. “We do not have any other option but to fight back.
