ANGRY parents have threatened to block roads if they don’t get help. On Monday parents from Klipgat in Odi district, Tshwane, marched to the Gauteng Department of Education’s local offices to vent their frustrations. They complained about the slow pace of admissions for the 2020 academic year and called for the online registration system to be scrapped. They said they applied for their children’s admission early but had still not received any feedback. Parent John Khosa (43) said: “Our kids need to be admitted. We came here to get answers.” Elizabeth Maboela (49) said she submitted all the forms in May. “On 30 November they placed my child at a school far from the area,” she said. Tiisetso Masilo (30) said her kid was also placed at a faraway school. “How do you expect a small child to travel to another area on her own?” She said the department had told parents to come back on Monday. “But we need to buy school uniforms now,” she said. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “The MEC is finalising all admission appeals and will respond on 14 January. “Late registration for grades 1 and 8 will open on 15 January and close on 24 January. All pupils will be placed soon.”“Parents must note that the outcome of the appeal is final. The parents who submitted appeals to other government offices other than the office of MEC for Gauteng Education will not get a reply as indicated in the regulations
