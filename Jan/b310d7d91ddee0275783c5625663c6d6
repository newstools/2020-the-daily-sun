Five un-roadworthy scholar transport were impounded on the
first day of school. On Wednesday while school children were making their way to
various schools – Joburg Metro officers were also conducting roadblocks. Metro spokesman, Superintendent Wayne Minaar said the
operation was targeted at scholar transport vehicles. He said they needed to ensure that children were transported
to school safely, and traffic rules were obeyed. The operation on Albertina Sisulu Road in Troyville led to
five scholar transport vehicles being impounded. “The vehicles were unroadworthy and unlicensed,” said
Minaar. He said: “Alternative arrangements were made by the owners
of these vehicles for children to be get to schools.” Minaar said these operations will continue over the next few
weeks. He added: “This is to monitor that all modes of transport
are roadworthy, and children are not overloaded.” January last year, thirteen school children were left
injured when their scholar transport vehicle collided with a bus in Soweto. In August 13 more pupils in Kolomeng village, North West
were involved in an horrific accident near a sharp curve.
