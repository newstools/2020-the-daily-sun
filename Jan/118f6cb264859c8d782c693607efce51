Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has explained his reason for taking midfielder Andile Jali off at half-time in their 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates on Wednesday evening. Jali had picked up a yellow card five minutes before the interval, meaning he would be on thin ice for the second-half. Mosimane felt he had to protect the team from going down to ten men and subsequently, opted to introduce Tiyani Mabunda at the start of the second stanza. The Brazilians coach he felt that Jali could not detach himself emotionally from the match against his former side. "I don't want to play ten versus 11, that's it. He was too emotional for this game, too temperamental for this game," Mosimane told SuperSport TV after the game. "He wanted it so much, it means a lot to him, I sacrificed him because I'm looking after him and I'm looking after the team and I didn't think that a sub (substitution) on 'Sugar' (Tiyani Mabunda) will affect any result because 'Sugar' came on and played well. "He might be upset with himself Andile because he could've done better and contributed a little bit more on the game. "AJ (Andile Jalie), I had to protect him because I need him. He comes from a difficult situation. It's been a tough week for him also. "He just goes to the match and I should support him and help him. He comes here (to Orlando Stadium) first time since he joined Mamelodi Sundowns. "He gives everything in the match. You saw the foul. I just don't want to play 10 against 11. I needed to protect him and also protect the club." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
