KZN education officials are worried that pupils cross dangerous rivers when going to school. Pupils at Ekhamanzi Primary and Mphelandaba High schools near Greytown have been pleading for footbridges to help them cross Ekhamanzi River. A photo showing Ekhamanzi Primary pupils taking off their uniforms and crossing the knee-deep river to get to school was published in 2011. At the time, the department of transport promised it would act on the matter, but earlier this month a photo surfaced on social media showing pupils still faced a similar problem. On Sunday, the department announced it had solved the problem in the uMzinyathi district, KZN Midlands. Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said MEC Kwazi Mshengu held an urgent meeting with affected districts. “In the uMzinyathi district, there are 53 pupils in two schools,” said Mthethwa. “The department has made provision for scholar transport. “In the uMgungundlovu district, there are 93 pupils at two schools: Mphelandaba High with 35 pupils that will be accommodated at Matatane High, and Ekhamanzi Primary with 58 pupils that will be accommodated at Dalton Primary.” Mthethwa said funding would be sourced from the reprioritisation process, which meant initial projects the department had committed to now no longer would be fulfilled. “It was the view of the MEC that resolving these cases was a top priority to avoid any possible deaths,” he said. He said a task team had been formed to audit the entire province in relation to any similar cases. It would report to the head of department on a weekly basis.
