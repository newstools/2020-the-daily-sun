AMAZULU general manager Lunga Sokhela showed a big smile and didn’t deny that his club is monitoring the situation of Black Leopards midfielder magician Lesedi Kapinga. In fact, Usuthu, behind the scene, are tempting Kapinga to join them either during the January transfer window or at the end of the season. What makes it also interesting is that, Kapinga, who has been talk of town as he has turned heads due to his brilliant of form, will see his contract with Venda-based club come to end in June. It is the situation that also Sokhela is aware of which will make it easy for them or any other suitors, that he’s liable to sign a pre-contract with the club of his choice right now. SunSport understands that Kapinga is not interested to extend his deal with the Leopards and has made it clear to the club’s management. Another player that is linked to AmaZulu is Siphelele Magubane. Magubane parted company with Usuthu’s provincial rivals - Golden Arrows on Wednesday. “He (Magubane) is a good player, there’s no doubt about that,” said Sokhela with a smile. “Kapinga is also a good players, those are good players. Whether or not they’ll be coming here, I don’t know. But those are top players, you can’t deny that. “But these are players that have been linked (to us) via the media, but we are openly saying those are good players. “Kapinga, we hear that his contract is coming to an end in June, which is interesting. Magubane now has his clearance.” AmaZulu are in desperate need of someone to help them in the final third. Thus far this season, they have been relying heavily on Bongi Ntuli, who scored twice against Cape Town City on Wednesday to take his league tally to ten. Remarkably, all goals, barring one, have been scored by the former Mamelodi Sundowns striker as AmaZulu have scored eleven goals in the league this season. The other solitary goal was scored by Butholezwe Ncube. So far the Durban-based outfit have only signed Slovakia-born striker Miloš Lacny.
