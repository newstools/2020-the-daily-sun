I would like to appeal to the government not to go ahead with its comprehensive sex education programme. We already have enough problems at our schools as it is. Sex education will just add to these. By giving children sex education, they will think we’re saying it’s okay to have sex and have children before matric. That would lead to the country producing fewer matrics and affect the availability of critical skills. The move would ultimately result in more kids on the streets and increased poverty levels. Such a situation would result in a high crime rate in Mzansi. Sex education at schools is a very big NO! ) Letter by Tsepo Mhlongo from Orlando East
