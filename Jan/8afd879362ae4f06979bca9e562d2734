 THEY don’t have IDs and are worried this might affect their kids’ future. Sisters Nono (31) and Maria Phiri (36) from Stinkwater near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said their mum was originally from Swaziland, while their dad was South African. But they both died before they could get IDs. “Our mother died in 1990 and our dad died in 2015. He tried to help us get IDs before he died, but Home Affairs officials said it was impossible because he was not married to our mum,” said Maria. “It has been over 10 years of trying to get IDs. It hasn’t been easy and we’re starting to lose hope,” she said. Maria said what hurt the most was that they couldn’t get jobs and their kids couldn’t go to school. “We tried to send them to school, but they didn’t accept them because they needed both our IDs and our kids’ birth certificates,” she said. Nono has three kids and Maria has one. “They always ask me when are they going to school like other kids. “I don’t know how to answer them and it’s so sad to see them watch other kids go to school,” she said. Nono said they also didn’t know how they were going to survive. “There’s no income in the house, but we’re surviving by God’s grace.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “The women must go back to Home Affairs with someone from their dad’s side of the family so they can do blood tests to prove they are related. We will then investigate the true identity and if it matches, they will get their IDs.”
