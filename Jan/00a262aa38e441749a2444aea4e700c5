MURDER accused Vusi Sehlabela will hear if both the charges he faces will be heard at the same time. His next appearance will be on 30 January. The Nelspruit Regional Court in Mpumalanga heard yesterday that the second murder investigation was complete. The 36-year-old from Marite Village, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, appeared for the first time in the court after his case was moved from the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe. He wasn’t asked to plead to the first charge of shooting and killing Daniel Mokoena (40), who was married to his sister Fridah Khaune (31). The incident happened after the couple had an argument and the accused intervened. He allegedly killed his brother-in-law at a local tavern in May 2017. While out on bail he allegedly killed Patrick Mhlanga (41) during a road rage incident at Madras Village in April 2018. He was bust in July 2018. Several warrants of arrest were issued when he didn’t appear in the Mhala Regional Court. But when he was rearested and the trial was set to resume, Fridah was shot eight times and died in September. She was about to give evidence about her husband’s death. Prosecutor Kedibone Bareng told the court the case had been moved to Nelspruit after state witnesses were unwilling to continue with the trial at the previous court.
