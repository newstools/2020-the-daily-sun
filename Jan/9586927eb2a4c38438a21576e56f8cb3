BAROKA FC are not pushing any panic buttons... just yet. Bottom of the log Baroka face a tough Absa Premiership Limpopo derby against their struggling neighbours Polokwane City at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) in what could be a make or break clash for both sides. Bakgaga were beaten 1-0 by Golden Arrows in Durban on Wednesday to remain bottom with 14 points from 17 matches while Rise and Shine are 14th with 16 points after also completing 17 fixtures. Baroka assistant coach Matsimela Thoka vowed they will turn things around against City. He admitted the derby was a “must win” game for them as they also aim to register their first league home win this season. “The results are not coming but there’s no need to panic. We just have to dust ourselves off and move on,” said Thoka who is in charge on a caretaker basis until new coach Dylan Kerr gets his work permit issued. “We have to try and collect many points as possible to move away from the bottom. The boys just need motivation and need to believe in themselves. I can assure you we’ll get it right.“ "But it doesn’t help when we keep on losing  We are playing well but the problem is that we are not scoring.” The crisis of failing to win at home has been going on for the last two seasons. Baroka won only two of their 15 home matches last season.
