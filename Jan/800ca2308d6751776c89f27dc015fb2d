OWEN Ndlovu shook the entertainment world when he lodged a court interdict to prevent Ukhozi FM from announcing the top 10 songs of the year and the summer song as planned on 31 December. But the matter has been withdrawn from court. Owen said he saw no need to prove or explain in court that the voting method was his property. READ: WATCH: NYAOPE BOYS TRASH FUNERAL! Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Owen said withdrawing the matter didn’t mean his fight with the public broadcaster was over. “My lawyers are busy with the papers. I want to sue the SABC, and Ukhozi FM in particular, for the damages,” he said. “The SABC made me a bad person to the listeners. I was threatened and suffered from stress. “I received no income and I’ve undergone abuse. My lawyers are still calculating how much they’ll be suing the SABC for. They must pay.” He said Ukhozi FM must not announce the top 10. “If they announce it, I will sue them for theft. People voted for the top 10 and the voting method is my idea.” Listeners usually vote for the SABC summer song of the year on the broadcaster’s 18 radio stations. Each station then selects its own top 10 based on the station’s airplay. READ: MASTER KG ROBBED R120K AT GUNPOINT! The broadcaster’s acting spokeswoman, Mmoni Seapolelo, said Ndlovu is responsible for all the legal costs incurred by the SABC in defending the case. “SABC has always maintained it has no legal obligation to Ndlovu’s company, Michael Owen Ndlovu Productions, contractual or otherwise.” About the announcement of the top 10, the SABC was no longer restrained from announcing the results of any votes or polls relating to the competition. “SABC will issue a statement regarding the announcement of the audited results,” said Mmoni.
