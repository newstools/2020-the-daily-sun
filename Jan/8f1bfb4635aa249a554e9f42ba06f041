ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini on Sunday called on young men to fight gender-based violence. He was addressing about 280 initiates at the ulwaluko homecoming ceremony in Kokstad, southern KZN. “I call on all of you to take a stand against this ugly scourge, which seems to be taking its toll,” said the king. He urged the boys to protect women and children. He called on government to recognise both traditional African knowledge and Western medicine in the fight against HIV. Zwelithini said since he revived the ukusoka tradition in 2009, more than one million men across the province had been circumcised. “Since the inception of this programme, our province has not had a single incident where a young man has lost his life because of ukusoka,” he said. KZN Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka praised the 10-year death-free initiation record. “We’re happy to see young men undergoing the practice of traditional circumcision in a safe and hygienic environment,” Hlomuka told Daily Sun. “We’re happy to see these men being taught about the responsibility they have in building communities.”
