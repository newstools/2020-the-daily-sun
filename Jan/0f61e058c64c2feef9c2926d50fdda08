Eskom chair Jabu Mabuza unexpectedly resigned on Friday, president Cyril Ramaphosa announced. In the wake of his resignation, Eskom will also get a new board, the presidency said. "In his resignation letter, Mabuza apologised for Eskom's inability to meet the commitment it made to the president, the deputy president and the relevant ministers at a meeting on December 11th 2019 to avoid load shedding over this period," the presidency said in a statement    Instead, South Africa has been hit by daily load shedding for the past week.  Eskom has not managed to keep unplanned breakdowns at below 9,500MW - the level at which it is forced to consider loadshedding - for a single day since December 4, 2019. Unexpected bouts of loadshedding in January - a time of low electricity demand - was triggered by the failure of a conveyor belt feeding coal from Exxaro’s Grootegeluk mine to the Medupi power station in Lephalale, Limpopo.The 7km-long coal conveyor belt is supposed to transport 4,000 tons of coal per hour to Medupi. The belt first started giving problems in October, when the tail-end of the belt suddenly snapped and twisted, with the weight of the coal damaging the machine. "Government continues to support the measures being taken by Eskom to restore reliable electricity supply as a matter of priority, and is proceeding with measures to introduce new generation capacity – including self-generation – in the shortest possible time," the presidency said on Friday.It also announced that government will soon establish a "re-configured Eskom board with the appropriate mix of electricity industry, engineering and corporate governance experience".
