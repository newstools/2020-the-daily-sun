SHE was shocked when her husband chased her out of their home, telling her that her punani smelled! The woman (43) from Hebron in North West said she has been cursed. She told Daily Sun she had been with him for almost 16 years when he said she had a bad smell and he was going to move in with a younger woman. “I consulted a doctor, who said there was nothing wrong with me. I haven’t had sex since 2018, so it can’t be an infection,” she said. TWEEPS ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY MNAKWETHU! “Now I can’t keep a man. I believe someone is responsible for my troubles.” She claimed that since her husband left, things come out of her punani and it smells weird. “When I meet men they show an interest, but after three weeks they block me. I met three men but I only saw them once each.”  She said she was never intimate with them. She said when she was alone all she thought about was killing herself. “I’ve gone to sangomas and pastors, and they all told me there was a dark cloud in my life and someone cursed me, but none of them helped,” she said. BROTHERS DROWN! “I’ve seen how Daily Sun helps people and I hope a reader can help me.
