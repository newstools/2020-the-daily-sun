Ernst Middendorp admits it was disappointing to see Kaizer Chiefs squander a one-goal lead to draw 1-1 at Black Leopards on Saturday. Samir Nurkovic put the Absa Premiership leaders in front in the 11th minute of the clash at Thohoyandou Stadium but Lidoda Duvha were back on level terms as Mogakolodi Ngele found the back of the net and the hosts held on for the draw. The result gives second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns a chance to narrow the 10-point gap to seven, and Middendorp lamented the fact that his charges lost their focus at just the wrong moment to concede the vital goal. "This is the reason not to be happy about, picking a point or something like this. We wanted three. During the game more and more we pushed, we tried the field is not really allowing to plus a triangle, a diamond through the midfield," Middendorp told SuperSport TV. "Ja it took it's own dimension, anyway it's just definitely something where the opponent's half was a clearance zone, the balls were flying left and right. "Very interesting to select a defender [as Man of the Match], we have seen the performance over 90 minutes...compliment err, okay let's stick to it, good. We're a bit disappointed, there's no doubt about it. "We wanted three points, I think with a bit of more concentration in particular after we scored, at 1-0 we allowed them to come at us a little bit, overloading, left and right, we were not really sorted. Good, we corrected it at half-time, anyway, we take it, but disappointment absolutely at this moment here around." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
