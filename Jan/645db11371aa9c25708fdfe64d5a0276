THE Yobala family’s hope of finding their missing girl is in God’s hands. They hope Leandra Yobala (15) returns home alive and unhurt. She went missing on 22 October on her way to Queens Private School in Pretoria West, where she was doing grade 7. Her aunt Lisette (30) suspects Leandra was being kept somewhere around Tshwane. The family from Pretoria West told Daily Sun life was no longer the same since Leandra’s disappearance. “We pray a lot and hope we will one day be reunited with our child,” she said. Leandra is light in complexion, medium height and has pimples. Lisette said she was wearing her school uniform when she went missing. She was wearing grey trousers, blue golf T-shirt and was carrying a black bag. Pretoria West police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said: “A missing persons case was opened.” She said anyone with information should contact her on 082 822 8316 or Lisette on 073 728 5999 or 078 352 3764.
