IS it the colour of the skin or is the change in attitude that is behind Orlando Pirates’ resurgence? Club legend Jerry Sikhosana reckons it is the white coaches, who get the best out of the Buccaneers. SKhosana’s logic is informed by the fact that the team seem to enjoy success under the guidance of white coaches. And this dates back to his playing days. “Maybe Pirates needs a white coach. They do well under white coaches,” said Sikhosana. “I played something like seven white coaches at Pirates and they all did well, and I had two black coaches and we were struggling. “I don’t know why that is. Is it our mental approach towards our black coaches or is it the respect we give white coaches. "I really can’t get it because that has been a problem since my playing days. “When a white coach comes somebody wants to be disciplined and do things correctly. ”Sikhosana has heaped praise on recently-appointed Josef Zinnbauer for the notable change he has brought to the Soweto giants. Bucs are yet to lose a match since the German coach arrived last month.He has recorded five wins and a draw.
