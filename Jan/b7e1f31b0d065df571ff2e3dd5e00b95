A deaf man has sued the website Pornhub for disability discrimination claiming its videos don't have subtitles. Yaroslav Suris has filed a class-action lawsuit against the international porn site claiming its lack of subtitles is a denial of access as he has paid for a subscription, TMZ reports. According to documents obtained by TMZ, Suris says a lack of subtitles violates his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. "We understand that Yaroslav Suris is suing Pornhub for claiming we’ve denied the deaf and hearing impaired access to our videos. While we do not generally comment on active lawsuits, we’d like to take this opportunity to point out that we do have a closed captions category," Pornhub's VP, Corey Price, said.
