The 1,000-bed Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre that took just 48 hours of construction just opened in China to deal with the Coronavirus outbreak.  The Medical Centre reportedly started receiving patients at 10.30pm last night after workers spent just 48 hours converting an empty building.  The Dabie Mountain Regional Medical Centre was originally intended to be a hospital that would open in May, but faced with the growing threat of the spread of coronavirus they managed to complete the task much sooner. The death toll in mainland China following the outbreak of coronavirus has risen to 132 while nearly 6,000 people are infected, authorities have said.
