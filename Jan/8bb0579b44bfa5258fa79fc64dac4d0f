CORPORAL punishment was banned at schools years ago but parents claim teachers still moer their kids! A mum from Diepkloof in Soweto called the SunTeam to say how badly her son was beaten by teachers last Monday. READ: MASTER KG ROBBED R120K AT GUNPOINT! She said her youngest child was playing with her brother and hit him on his bum when he complained he was in pain. “He told me two teachers hit him and six other kids for doing their homework wrong.” She said the kids were each given five strokes – the boys on their bums and the girls on their hands. “This pains me because it’s not the first incident and when we report it to the school, our kids get victimised and told they’d be chased away from the school.” She said the last incident happened two years ago when her son went straight to bed after doing his homework in the afternoon. “That was unlike him. He’s a jolly child and when my mother asked him what his problem was, he said he always had headaches caused by his teacher beating him on the head all the time. When we went to the school, we were told this was not a Soweto school where kids did as they pleased.” READ: WATCH: NYAOPE BOYS TRASH FUNERAL! She was gatvol and wanted nothing to do with the school because her son refused to go back after the incident. “I want my money back because I already paid school fees for the year. I will look for another school for him. If I don’t find it, he will stay at home because he’s afraid to go back there.” Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “We’re saddened by this incident and instructed our officials to visit the school for intervention. Corporal punishment is outlawed. The parent must open a case with the police.”
