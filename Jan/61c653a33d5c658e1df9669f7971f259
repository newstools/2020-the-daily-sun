Siyamthanda said the biggest challenge he faced was the noise from other tenants. “I walked to school to study to avoid the noise,” he said. He said the road to success was not an easy. The noisy neighbours and load shedding didn’t help either. Siyamthanda got distinctions in maths, physical science, life science, life orientation, Zulu, English and geography. He said extra classes also helped a lot. “I was one of many matric pupils who attended extra classes in the morning, afternoon and even over the weekends, said Siyamthanda. “I was fortunate because Bhukulani School was not that far from my home which made things easy for me. I was always on time for school and I was never absent.” He wants to study a degree in Actuarial Science. READ: PICS: MEET THE CREAM OF THE CROP! He says he chose the degree because he loves the challenge. “There aren’t many actuarial scientists in the country,” he said. He said he has applied for admission at the University of Johannesburg, the University of Pretoria, Wits University and the University of Western Cape but he prefer the ones next to his home in Zondi, Soweto. He said: “My parents can’t afford to pay for my studies so I have applied for financial assistance. That’s one of the reasons why I worked so hard to qualify for university entrance.”
