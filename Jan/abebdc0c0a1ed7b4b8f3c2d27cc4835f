MURDER-accused Eugene Dlamini yesterday told the Mhala Magistrates Court he won’t plead guilty. The 26-year-old taximan from Rolle Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, is accused of stabbing Brian Ubombo (27) to death at a Christmas Eve party. Prosecutor Musa Makhubele told Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba the victim was stabbed with a sharp object while trying to intervene during a fight at a bar at Merry Pebble Stream Village. He was stabbed in the upper body. Friends rushed him to Mapulaneng Hospital but he was certified dead on arrival. “I beg the court to release me on bail. I am willing to hand over my passport to the investigating officer,” Eugene said. “At the moment, this court should take into account that I won’t plead guilty and the reasons will be given at the regional court later.” Sergeant Collen Nyalungu, the investigating officer, told the court he was not opposing bail. The magistrate granted Eugene R2 000 bail and the case was postponed to next month for further investigations.
