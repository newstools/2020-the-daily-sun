Otsile, who’ll enrol for a media studies degree at Wits University, said it was rare to find people who wanted to see others progress in life. His mum Stephina (39) said: “When I approached Molly about my son’s situation, she opened her arms.” Stephina said a few people readily open their pockets. “She’s a good woman with a golden heart,” she said.

Molly told Daily Sun Otsile had passed with flying colours, and therefore she had told him to give her a list of the things he needed. “I’m aware of the family situation,” said Molly. “His mum works for me and he works part time at my business.” She’d always donate to the community when there was a need. Her late mum used to help people with food, and that she would keep helping Otsile.
