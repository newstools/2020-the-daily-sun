Maritzburg United will seek to keep up their amazing record of Friday night success at the Harry Gwala Stadium when they host AmaZulu in the Absa Premiership this week. United enjoy playing under the lights in front of their own fans, and are unbeaten in more than two years at home on a Friday, since a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Free State Stars in September 2017. In that time they have played 19 matches, winning 10 and drawing nine. They even remained unbeaten through last season, when they battled for points and fought relegation through the play-offs. Their last Friday night fixture was earlier this month, when two goals in the final four minutes secured a come-from-behind victory over Lamontville Golden Arrows. It is perhaps not surprising that United have arranged five of their remaining seven home games this season for Friday nights, though their matches against Mamelodi Sundowns (Saturday, April 4) and Orlando Pirates (Wednesday, May 6) are not included. United have won two and drawn one of their last three games at home to Usuthu on a Friday night, but the visitors did win 3-1 all the way back in 2014. -SuperSport.com
