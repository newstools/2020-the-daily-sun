Controversial couple Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha have obtained an interdict to stop the airing of a TV show, which would delve into their highly publicised abuse drama. The show titled Impilo,Â  presented and produced by musician Jub Jub was scheduled to air last night at 21:30 on Moja Love. However, the court interdict prevented the channel from airing it. The show would zoom in on the couple's relationship and the infamous abuse incident that saw them lay counter assault charges against each other. They subsequently dropped the charges and since then, their relationship has been on the lips of many South Africans, who follow their lives. Bokani Moyo, Moja Love's head of channel, released a statement, in which he said due to the court order granted to the couple, the channel desisted from broadcasting the TV show as scheduled.
