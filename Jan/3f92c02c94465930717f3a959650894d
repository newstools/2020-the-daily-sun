CONTROVERSIAL Ukhozi FM presenter Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe is back on air. He was taken off for two weeks after insulting listeners on his Facebook page. He got angry when listener Potshozah Ndonga accused him of showing favouritism towards maskandi artist Khuzani Mpungose. JUB JUB GETS CELEBS TALKING! The host of the Isidlo Sasekuseni breakfast show and Sigiya Ngengoma couldn’t handle the criticism and responded with insults. He wrote on Facebook: “So if I’m favouring Khuzani, why don’t you report me to the management of Ukhozi FM so I can be fired.” When Nhlonipho Masente asked him for clarity on the issue between Owen Ndlovu and the SABC, he responded by writing: “Did we cause this nonsense? You’re drunk and full of sh**.” Although some fans supported Tshatha, others felt he didn’t behave in a professional manner. This led to his suspension. BRENDA MTAMBO: 'IF I DIE, I DIE' According to sources, Tshatha was called for a disciplinary hearing. “He admitted to his wrongdoing and apologised. He was then suspended for two weeks,” said a source. Tshatha didn’t respond to text messages or phone calls from the SunTeam. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “We can confirm that he’s back on air. “We’d like to reiterate that we’re not in a position to discuss matters relating to employer-employee relationship with the media.”
