A truck transporting booze on the M1 South before the Marlboro Drive lost its load. Joburg traffic officials advised motorists to use alternative routes, in order to avoid delays. Former City of Joburg's MMC for public safety, Michael Sun said: “A truck has lost its load on the M1 south before Marlboro.” While JMPD Chief of Police David Tembe posted on Twitter and said: “A truck has lost its load on the M1 south before Marlboro Dr. 1 lane is operational, please proceed with caution.” Cans of Castle Lager could be seen in the middle of the highway, emergency services tried to clear the road.
