BLACK Leopards defender Edwin Gyimah has vowed that Lidoda Duvha won’t get relegated. The struggling Venda-based outfit are tied with fellow strugglers AmaZulu and Baroka on 17 points from 18 league matches. The Ghanaian-born player made this statement after they held pace setters Kaizer Chiefs to a 1-1 draw in an Absa Premiership match at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. “We will keep fighting until the end,” said Gyimah, who was voted Man of the Match. “We are not going anywhere. We will still be in the PSL next season. We have a good coach in Cavin Johnson and we are starting to understand his style of play. All we have to do now is to stop conceding goals and minimise our mistakes.” Johnson was also pleased with the performance his lads dished out against the Soweto giants. “I think we played good football. We could have beaten Chiefs especially in the last 20 minutes,” said Johnson. “I hope we can continue with this kind of performance. This is what I want to see from Leopards. The only thing we need to work on is our defence.” The former AmaZulu coach hopes his goal scorer Mogakolodi Ngele’s injury is not serious. Ngele, who cancelled out Samir Nurkovic’s opener, was replaced by striker Joseph Mhlongo before halftime. “It will be sad if Ngele is out for a long period,” said Johnson. “Ngele is a quality player and has been doing well for us. Hopefully he will recover quickly.”
