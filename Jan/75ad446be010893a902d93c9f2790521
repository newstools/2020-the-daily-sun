ORLANDO Pirates could lose striker Justin Shonga in this January transfer window as clubs abroad reportedly show interest. SunSport has been reliably informed that Shonga has attracted interest from Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon and three other unnamed clubs in Turkey and another in Israel. One of the clubs have apparently written a letter to Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza, expressing their interest in the Zambian striker. But they will have to move faster because the transfer window period shuts at midnight on Friday. Insiders at Pirates suggested that Khoza is open to let Shonga move, as long as it is an international club and if it meets the player’s asking price. “The one club that I know is Sporting Lisbon in Portugal and there’s also three unknown in Turkey,” a reliable source said yesterday. “There’s also another one in Israel, but they didn’t mention the name of the club.” The 23-year-old frustrated Shonga, who joined the Soweto giants in the second half of 2017-18 season, has completely fell out of favour at Pirates this season and is hardy making it to the bench. He has featured in 10 matches this season – four of those in the first eleven, but is yet to score. This has led to Shonga’s agent seeking options for greener pastures for the Chipolopolo striker, whose place upfront has been taken by in-form Gabadinho Mhango. “I can confirm that yes we are working on something for him. “As you can see that he is not getting game time,” said Shonga’s agent Mike Ngobeni. “But let me not give away much because I’m out of the country at the moment. We are busy.” Shonga’s chances of playing any time soon look slim and what’s even worse is that he has not scored this season. Mhango, who has been the preferred man upfront, is the current leading PSL top scorer with 12 league goals.
