Miss Universe Zozibini Thunzi has revealed in an exclusive interview with Channel24, that while doing her grocery shopping list, she craved for Aromat. The South African-born beauty queen said nobody could understand her craving for Aromat. "Whenever I have to put a grocery list together, I realise how much I actually miss home - when I can't find the things I really want. The other day I wanted Aromat, and I wanted Aromat so bad. Nobody could understand what I was going through. Being surrounded by my culture, and my people is something that I will always miss the most," she told the publication. Aromat has responded to her craving and the company will be sending her some Aromat. Quoting the  article, the company tweeted: "Hey @Zozibini, we totally get it! Everyone needs Aromat when they’re busy #TakingUpSpaces – especially in the big apple! We’ve got you sorted Miss Universe wethu! iAromat iyeza so you can #ShakeTheWholeThingUp koNew York."
