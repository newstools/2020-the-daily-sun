The Hawks have rescued nine women and a 14-year-old girl
from a flat in Nelson Mandela Drive, Bloemfontein, where they were "under
the command" of a 27-year-old man. "With him in the flat were 10 ladies who are alleged to
be prostitutes living under his command," Hawks spokesperson Warrant
Officer Lynda Steyn said on Sunday. Steyn said 24 small brownish rocks were found, as well as a
journal containing a list of "prostitutes" and amounts of money they
made per day. "Condoms, and pipes used to smoke the rocks were found
and confiscated. The 10 prostitutes were rescued and taken to a place of
safety. The 10th victim is 14 years of age and she was handed over to the
social worker." The man is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein
Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. SOURCE: NEWS24
