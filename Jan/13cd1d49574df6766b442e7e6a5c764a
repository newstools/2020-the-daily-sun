MPUMALANGA Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has pleaded with Bushbuckridge residents to avoid causing unnecessary protests over sub-contractors and job opportunities. She was speaking during the sod turning and site handover to contractors to resume phase three of construction of New Mapulaneng Regional Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Wednesday. “We set aside a budget of R2,4 billion and would like to thank traditional leadership for giving the soil to residents and the department of health to build this hospital.” “This project is big and there were delays after tenders were advertised. We sat down with our premier to find solutions where in previous phases, contractors were fighting each other but we had to re-advertise and now we have three contractors that will resume with this project,” she said. “Our residents must forgive us for the delays. We want this hospital to bring relief to Bushbuckridge residents, but we want to plead with our people to avoid disrupting the project because they want tenders. “We had law enforcement and we sent a strong warning to those who want to be used by politicians. “Provincial commissioner Mondli Zuma and his team are ready to deal with any form of protest near this hospital,” said Manzini. Public works MEC Gillion Mashego said the project was started by Deputy President David Mabuza while he was the premier. “This will bring much relief in this area where before people were sent to Themba and Rob Ferreira hospitals. We don’t want these contractors to be disrupted because they’ll spend five years on this contract for the new regional hospital.”
