NOKUTHULA Mdhluli (42) yesterday morning came face to face with two men stabbing a black chicken in her yard. Although Nokuthula, from Pimville in Soweto, was shocked by the evil deed, she was not surprised. READ: WATCH: PEOPLE LOOT CASH VAN! “We all know the two evildoers. These evil acts started in December and they don’t stop. We’re tired of dead chickens and muthi in our yards,” she said. “If they’re not collecting soil from our yards, they’re hurling muthi into them,” said another resident. Nokuthula told Daily Sun she was uncomfortable walking around her yard as her neighbour’s son kept threatening the peace.  “This man came with his nephew yelling all sorts of things as if they were in a trance. They then threw the black chicken in my yard,” said Nokuthula. “I saw them talking to it and stabbing it with a spear before throwing it into my yard. I don’t know what they want from me. I never thought there was bad blood between us.” She said she had no choice but to do impinda and return the bad muthi to the sender. Another neighbour, Brenda Mbumbe (35), said the same man took sand from her yard. “I’m traumatised. If somebody takes sand that has your family’s footprints it’s dangerous,” she said. The notorious man’s mother said her son left home in 2013 without her blessings, and only came back late last year demanding her traditional stick.

Sangoma Makhosi Maliyavuza from the CRL said: “No sangoma does this. They are tainting the name of healers and terrifying the community.”
