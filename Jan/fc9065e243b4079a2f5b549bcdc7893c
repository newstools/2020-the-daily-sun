IT was bound to happen at some point!Even though sceptics didn't believe it will happen this early, but South Africa has a professional woman rugby player in Spain. Babalwa Latsha, who hails from Khayelitsha, a partially informal township in the Western Cape, joined SD Eibar Femenino as their new prop this week. Her call up will go down in history to follow on football, where South Africa has also broken all the barriers and Banyana Banyana players are today scattered across the world, doing it professional unlike in Mzansi were their sport is semi-professional. At 25, Latsha is surely an inspiration to most South African women, not only in rugby, but football and netball too.  “I believe that opportunity comes to you if you work hard and when you’re working hard, you are ready for it because you have been working the entire time,” the University of Western Cape law student told the Independent Media, in her previous interview. The Independent Media carries on that Latsha was scouted by a "Spanish scouting agency during the Springbok Women’s match against Spain in September (last year) where she was skipper." She has also found herself trailblazing a new path for South African women's sports, according to the CNN: "Whether I like it or not, this is not about me as an individual. It's about the person who looks at me and thinks, 'Maybe I can do the same,'" she said, speaking in a manner that evokes wisdom beyond her years. "In my heart that is what it's about." Her move to Spain comes at a time when the South African national women's team have qualified for the 2021 Rugby Women's World Cup in New Zealand. The Springbok Women, formed in 2014, secured their special place in the New Zealand after thrashing Kenya 39-0 in their final qualifier in Brakpan.
