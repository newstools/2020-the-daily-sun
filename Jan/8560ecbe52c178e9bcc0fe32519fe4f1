BAROKA FC coach Dylan Kerr has revealed is frustrated as he is struggling to obtain his work permit. The Englishman Kerr has been a spectator in the stands as he waits for his work permit‚ despite his appointment having been announced four weeks ago. Kerr took over the reins from Wedson Nyirenda at Bakgaga. Talking to SunSport on Wednesday, the frustrated mentor said he does not know what is delaying his work permit, however, hoping that by Sunday when Bakgaga host Maritzburg United at Peter Mokaba Stadium he would be on the dugout. “I was supposed to get it last week, now I’ve been told next week,” said Kerr. “It’s frustrating because I can see what is lacking in the team, but I cannot do anything about it until I get my permit. Waiting this long is not good for the club, for the players and the fans who are supporting this team.” Kerr has been a spectator in Baroka past four games where they lost to Cape Town City, Golden Arrows Stellenbosch with a 1-0 score line in all the matches. He was also on the bench when they defeated Polokwane City 1-0. The former Black Leopards coach has a lot on his sleeve as Baroka have scored just once in their last five matches. He added: “The team is playing good football and all the three goals we conceded were from set pieces. "I know what I need to do when I get there start working.”
