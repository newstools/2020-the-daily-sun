BULLYING, vandalism, gangsterism, indiscipline, intolerance, and corporal punishment are the most common problems in schools across Mzansi. And they all have a negative impact on learning and teaching. According to Tshepo Mphokane, one of the two Ke Moja Coaches in Diepkloof, many young boys are hooked on dagga in most primary schools. Tshepo is one of two members of The South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca) based in the area. “Dagga is one common drug found to be popular at this level of schooling. “Primary schools usually have big numbers of beginners. “At high school one drug that has found its way in is crystal meth.” So far there are 24 schools in the area, though each one of us is allocated one school, in case there are challenges at the other schools in the area one of the two of us has to attend to it,” he said. Ke Moja Coach’s main purpose is to teach schoolkids about the dangers of drug usage during Life Orientation periods at both primary and high schools in Diepkloof. Those who need professional help are then referred to Sanca for more help. Once every quarter, together with members of SAPS, they conduct body searches at schools to check those who sell or smoke drugs. Dangers of Drug abuse.
