 A woman was shot dead in Mokopane by her partner, before
turning the gun on himself. Social Development spokesperson Witness Tiva said another
woman was raped and injured in the incident and was admitted to hospital. The two victims are employees of the South African Post
Office in Mokopane. The incident happened at Extension 17 in Mokopane. MEC for Social Development Nkakareng Rakgoale said: “What
pains me is that the victim is yet another breadwinner and yet another
contributor to services to the people of the province. “We have to understand how these murders and rapes are
affecting the psyche of our people and the economy at large," said
Rakgoale. She said it is absolutely unthinkable to hear of yet another
such murder, after visiting the family of a victim in a separate incident just
yesterday. Rakgoale said the women and children the province are under
siege. Social workers have been deployed to provide psychosocial
support to all involved in this latest tragedy.
