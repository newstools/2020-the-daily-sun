 THE new boss of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa says
PRASA is a broken organisation! The PRASA Administrator, Bongisizwe Mpondo, said this when
he was addressing stakeholders on Wednesday in Block BB in Soshanguve next to
Mabopane north of Tshwane about the organisation's operation. Mpondo said the organisation was put under administration by
the Minister of Roads and Transport, Fikile Mbalula, last year December. Mpondo who started his 12-month job on 9 December said the
first three months will be to restore stability and order in the organisation. "We want to get the service where it should be in all
our corridors in the country. “We also engaged with stakeholder’s leadership on the on the
issues of time frame and recovery," he said. The PRASA Administrator said that they will be commissioning
projects and they hope that the projects will be completed in one year and
business to continue as usual. He said he would like to hand over a stable PRASA and
sustainable one to the minister. "We will be able to build the network and re-establish
the service." He said they want the organisation to provide good services
to commuters. "We brought executives on board to clarify the issues
and listen to stakeholders. "We want to provide credible information to our
commuters." Mpondo added that PRASA needs to identify key interventions
that can be undertaken in a short and long time period, our plans must be
realistic and double. "If one works at PRASA and fails to articulate the
mandate given to ensure we transport our commuters and give them a pleasant
commuter experience in a better manner then we have a problem in
existence," he said On security PRASA said they will put drones and install
fences on the criminal hotspots and also roll out cameras.
