THE family of two sisters accused of killing their mum earlier this month believe the sisters planned the evil deed for two months. Wanter Dlamini (62) was kidnapped, assaulted, raped and strangled three weeks ago. Her body was found dumped in the bush in Barberton, Mpumalanga. Wanter’s two daughters allegedly fetched her from her house and killed her. Her body was found by a passerby the next day.  According to reports, the two sisters and three other suspects murdered Wanter in the hope of claiming an insurance payout. The insurance policy was apparently taken out in November in Wanter’s name. One of the daughters was bust on Monday and appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The other was arrested on Tuesday and appeared yesterday. They will be back in court on Wednesday for a bail application.   Speaking to Daily Sun, Wanter’s niece (60) claimed the sisters previously tried to poison their mum twice. “We believe they planned this for a very long time,” she said. “We knew one of the suspects was dating a gang member, but we never thought she’d turn against her own mum. “They never showed their evil sides until the investigation revealed they were part the plot.  Wanter’s other daughter also believed there was a previous attempt to poison her mum. Wanter’s cousin (71) said the family was in pain. She told the People’s Paper: “We’re hurt. We’re not coping. Wanter was everything to us. “She dedicated most of her time to helping the family and was kind. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said more arrests were expected.
