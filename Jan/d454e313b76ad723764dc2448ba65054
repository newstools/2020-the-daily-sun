Actress Cleopatra Simelane is relishing her role as transgender in upcoming featured film Feminine Lotus. The former Isidingo actress plays Vuyo who is on a journey to transform his gender amidst struggles and contention from family and friends. “The film is part of a ten-feature series and a star on this one that talks about the stereotypes and the hurdles transgender people are made to go through in society,” she said. She adds that the role was challenging and was helped by doing research in preparation of it. “The hardest part though is when I didn’t understand what the director wants in terms of how to behave on set.” She said the character conflicts with his sister as she refuses to accept his decision to change his gender, this brings about more conflict in the family. Another film the starlet stars in is The light Bulb Moment where she plays Betty, the nerd. “The character is a stereotypical person who always does things by the book and refuses to challenge herself and her beliefs,”  she added.
