I was alone and scared to death,” he said. “They were all over the room, searching for any valuable items. I couldn’t scream or fight them as they were armed. I let them take whatever they wanted.” Nathi said the ordeal happened very quickly, but it felt like it was forever. “I didn’t know what to do. I’m angry but grateful at the same time. I’m angry that they invaded my space, but grateful they didn’t harm me,” he said. Nathi said he believed his attackers were sent by a jealous person. “I could tell they were sent by someone close to me. They had private information about me.” READ: 'AFRIKAANS SHOULD BE DROPPED' He said he didn’t open a case. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “We always encourage people to open a case even if they don’t think their items will be found. In most instance,s the finger prints can trace and locate the culprit. In this case, I’d advise the artist to go and open the case.”
