 Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited Modiri
Secondary School in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Pretoria, on Thursday after a video of
a girl bullying a fellow pupil did the rounds on social media. In the video, the teenager is seen pouring a thick white
liquid over another girl's head and hitting her over the head with the empty
carton before walking away. Both are in school uniform and are watched by other pupils. Lesufi addressed parents of the school on Thursday and
discussed the way forward. In a statement, Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona
said the bully had been suspended with immediate effect. He added the victim will "receive the necessary
counselling and support from the psychosocial unit".  "[The] parents of the victim [are] advised to monitor
her and inform the district if there's a need for intervention." The parents were also advised to open a common assault case
with the police, while "MEC Lesufi undertook to escalate it to the
province", Mabona said. The school governing body was advised to provide reasons why
it should not be disbanded in the coming week. "Learners were encouraged to respect themselves and
come back to school [on] 31 January 2020," Mabona said. SOURCE: NEWS24
