THE Dlamini family needs help. On Saturday, the family from Esikhani in Empangeni near the KZN North Coast lost all their belongings in a fire they suspect was caused by a burning candle. Madala Buhle Dlamini (76) said they suspect it fell over on the day of the incident. “We think the wax melted and the candle fell and caused the fire.” He said when the incident happened, he was in the sitting room and his wife Thalitha (76) was bathing in the bathroom, while their kids were in the bedroom, next to where the fire started. “We couldn’t see there was fire in the house as everybody was minding their own business. We were only alerted by our neighbours across the road that we needed to get out because the flames were coming out through the roof,” said Buhle. He said they then ran for their lives. “We lost all our belongings, including clothes, furniture and important documents such as IDs,” said Buhle. He said they’d appreciate any assistance from kind-hearted people. Councillor Sammuel Mthembu said: “I know about the matter. It was brought to my attention a while after it happened. “The municipality offered fire department assistance. “According to my knowledge in the few years that I have been with the municipality, no further help can be given to the family who has experienced such tragedy. “The municipality only comes in when several homes have been destroyed and the entire area would be declared a disaster area after the disaster unit assessment.”
