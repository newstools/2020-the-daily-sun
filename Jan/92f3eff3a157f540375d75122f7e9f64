DA MP Cameron Mackenzie was shot and wounded in the shoulder on Tuesday night. He was attacked during an attempted hijacking in Joburg. DA chief whip Natasha Mazzone said yesterday that Mackenzie had recovered well from surgery. “We’re offering him and his family support and love during this horrendous ordeal,” she said. She said the DA was horrified and outraged at the shooting. “This attack has proved yet again that no one in South Africa is safe and that crime affects us all,” she said. “South Africans live in perpetual fear. “No place and no person is safe. Our economy and our people suffer daily because of the scourge of crime and we call on the SAPS to act swiftly to bring the perpetrators to justice.” She said the incident was a reminder that the fight against crime remained a top priority. “We must continue this fight on behalf of all South Africans to ensure that our country is made safe, our people no longer live in fear and that criminals are prosecuted and brought to book,” Mazzone said. “Our thoughts are with Mr Mackenzie and his family, and with all South Africans who have suffered at the hands of criminals for too long.” Mackenzie was a councillor for the DA in Joburg before he became an MP in 2014. – NEWS24
