“I THANK you, my love. You left me with a lot to hold on to.” These were the words of South African Premier Soccer League chairperson and Orlando Pirates boss Irvin Khoza. He was paying tribute to his late wife Mantwa during her funeral service held at the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Orlando West, Soweto. Mantwa died last Friday due to illness. She was laid to rest at Joburg’s West Park Cemetery yesterday. The church became small for the scores of mourners who were there to say their final goodbyes to mama Khoza. Many mourners followed proceedings inside the church via speakers and TV screens from the marquees. The funeral was attended by politicians, including ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, Police Minister Bheki Cele, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, businessman Patrice Motsepe, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa, EFF leader Julius Malema, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and Kaizer Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung, among others. The Orlando Pirates Choir also featured in the programme. Speakers described mama Khoza as someone with a good heart and who always wore a beautiful smile. She was also praised for her business acumen and described as abehind-the-scenes person. Khoza, also known as Iron Duke, said his wife believed in prayer. He said she always strived to make an impact on others. Khoza also took the opportunity to thank the people of Mzansi for their continued support during the family’s difficult period. “We received your messages of condolences and they gave us comfort. I thank you,” he said. Family member, Marcus Xaba, said mama Khoza would be sorely missed.
