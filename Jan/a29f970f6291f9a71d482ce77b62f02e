AFTER climbing to the top of the GladAfrica Championship table over the weekend, Ajax Cape Town are eager to remain there. The Urban Warriors went to the summit of the Championship, the country’s second tier of professional football, after they convincingly defeated promotion rivals Uthongathi FC 3-1 at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium at the weekend. Ajax replaced the KwaZulu-Natal-based side at the top of the table. The Urban Warriors are on 31 points, one ahead of the Cane Cutters. Encouragingly, they a have a game in hand as they completed their first half of the season. Said Ajax chairman ?Ari Efstathiou: “Now we have to focus on the next game which is Steenburg United away at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. “Our coach Andries Ulderink has got the players working as a team. It is looking good because we are playing well and scoring goals.” Meanwhile, Efstathiou is still not happy at to how his team ended up in the second tier of professional football. He said Ajax, who are competing in their second season in the lower league, should not be in the Championship in the first place. Ajax were demoted after they were found guilty of using their former player, Tendai Ndoro, who was ineligible to play for them. Ajax was Ndoro’s third club in one season, contravening Fifa rules which says no player can play for three clubs in one season. They were then deducted points and then finished last in the table and automatically relegated. “Ajax should be in the PSL, we shouldn’t be in the GladAfrica Championship,” stated Efstathiou. “It was a travesty of justice at the time but the powers that be decided. It happened, we moved on. We shouldn’t be here, it caused a lot of damage to the club. “For any PSL team spending two years in the NFD (now GladAfrica Championship) is a very difficult thing, not many would survive because it is a dog fight.”
