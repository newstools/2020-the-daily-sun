Twenty-nine people were arrested after a bus was torched. The charges include cases of public violence, malicious damage
to property and Assault GBH, following the violent protest that erupted in
Ga-Shongwane 3 Village in the Villa Nora area outside Lephalale. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said it is
alleged that residents in the area went on a rampage at around 02:30, by
barricading the D3110 road between Ga-Shongwane 3 and Abbotspoort Villages with
stones and branches and eventually obstructing buses transporting workers. Mojapelo said the police were called on arrival, one bus was
already torched. Residents were allegedly protesting over service delivery in
the area. The Public Order Policing members (POPs), were deployed in
the area to stabilise the situation and twenty-nine suspects aged between 19
and 56 were arrested. During the arrest, the police were pelted with stones and
one member was seriously injured. The Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo Lieutenant General
Nneke Ledwaba, condemned the violent protest. The situation has now returned to normal, but the public order
police are still monitoring the area.
