An eThekwini Metro Police constable
is the prime suspect in the murder of his ex-girlfriend, 29-year-old Zinhle
Muthwa. Constable Ndumiso Khumalo, 30, who
is attached to the City's multi-operational response unit, appeared in the
Umbumbulu Magistrate's Court on Monday, National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)
spokesperson Natasha Kara said. She said he faced charges of murder
and defeating the ends of justice. He is still in custody and will
return to court on January 13, when he intends to apply for his release on
bail. Outside the court, a host of
supporters were present, including some from the IFP and ANC. IFP Women's Brigade chairperson
Thokozile Gumede said more had to be done to curb gender-based violence. "We are here to support the
family. Enough is enough. We cannot go on anymore. We have done all we could.
We have made campaigns and marches. We need to find a solution, something that
will be a permanent solution." Gone missing Muthwa's bruised body was found in
Umbumbulu on New Year's Day with a gunshot wound to the head. Her body was
recovered at Ndaya Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, News24 previously reported. She
had head injuries and multiple bruises. Her parents positively identified
her body on Thursday. Media reports indicated that Muthwa
had initially gone missing after someone in a white car picked her up in New
Germany. Umbumbulu detectives, led by their
station commander, followed up on information regarding Khumalo's involvement
in the murder and later arrested him. They recovered a firearm which was
believed to have been used in the murder. Muthwa's initial disappearance
sparked an outcry on social media with fears of gender-based violence in the
new year. Protests against gender-based
violence reached boiling point during the #AmINext movement in mid-2019. SOURCE: NEWS24
