LORNA Maswanganye was supposed to graduate last month after going to thwasa in March, but it didn’t happen. This was after she and her gobela had a disagreement over money. The 47-year-old from Meadowlands, Soweto, said she had to abandon her calling because the gobela deceived her. “He took my money and went on a boozing and shopping spree. I gave him my bank card and pin to prepare for my graduation, but he used it to buy food and booze,” she said. Lorna said there was about R18 000 in her account, which she had saved for when the thwasa process was over. “He used R15 000 and I want my money back,” said Lorna, who worked as a cashier.  Lorna said she confronted the gobela after she discovered that he used her money. “He said I won’t have to pay anything and he’d settle everything,” she said. But Lorna said the gobela later changed his mind and refused to pay her back. “He wanted me to put more money. I want my money back. I don’t care about ukuthwasa anymore.”  The People’s Paper has seen Lorna’s bank statement for the period, which shows cash withdrawals and transactions made at KFC, Musa’s Place, Chicken Licken, Mvulani Tavern and Zito’s Inn, among others. The gobela denied the allegations and said Lorna gave him her pin so he could withdraw the money she owed him for her training. “I’m an inyanga and I’m not fake. I don’t steal and never did. I won’t pay back a cent,” he said. “Why should I pay her back the money when she owed me for training her?”
