Believe it or not, the luxury double cab segment is booming with demand for high-end bakkies. One such double cab is Volkswagen’s Amarok Canyon, which SunWheels had the pleasure to test drive. The Canyon joined the Amarok line-up in 2019 and is set apart with a refreshed look and new features as well as additional exterior and interior styling elements. It is a special edition model. It is only available in a striking “Honey Orange” metallic exterior paint with matte black door handles, a grille painted in black with chrome trims, partly chrome-plated body coloured exterior mirror housings, widening wheels arches painted in black, new design matte black styling bar, matte black side tubes with unique Canyon decals as well as snazzy 17-inch Aragua alloy wheels. On the inside the finish is top-notch. It has has partial leather seats with orange-coloured stitching, seat belts with orange-coloured seams, a multi-function steering wheel with colour seams, pedal caps in stainless steel and a auto dimming interior mirror. A comprehensive list of safety equipment is standard.  At the heart of the Amarok Canyon is a potent 3L V6 TDI engine with permanent 4MOTION all-wheel drive. This engine generates 165kW of power and 550 Nm of torque. The Amarok’s diesel engine is one of the most refined bakkie engines you’ll find and it is a decent performer. The engine itself is smooth and the Amarok handles more like an SUV than a bakkie. Though the Amarok is pricey it is impressive in every aspect and really likeable.
