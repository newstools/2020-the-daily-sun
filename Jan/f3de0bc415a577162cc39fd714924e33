A good dupe is a bargain shopper's dream come true. We now see expensive brand dupes everywhere either online or at retail shops and the latest Bottega Veneta cult mule dupes are taking the internet by storm.   If you can't afford the high end mules, Topshop has got you. We have seen The New Age fashion Icon Rihanna rocking them and we cannot help but want a pair. "These square toe leather mules are designed in a statement-making bold blue shade, making you the centre of attention in style." the website explains.
