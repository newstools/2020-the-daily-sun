THE nine men brought nothing but terror to Gauteng’s West Rand. They were each sentenced in the South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday to 38 life sentences for rape and murder, and more than 100 years for robbery for crimes committed in the community of Tshepisong in Kagiso from 2015 to 2016.

Handing down sentence, Judge AJ Mogotsi said Thomas Tivane, Makamu Mapedje, Alex Mabuya, Boavida Chilengue, Gito Maguele, Jordan Bila, Antonio Timbe, George Mabunda and Jeremias Sithole showed no remorse. He said they wouldn’t have assaulted and raped the victims if they were only after money.    A 28-year-old victim told Daily Sun: “I had fought with my boyfriend and decided to go home.” She was waiting for someone to fetch her when four men dragged her into the veld. “They beat and kicked me while one was raping me. They took turns.”  She became a police reservist hoping to find the rapists herself. A 23-year-old victim and her friend were dragged into a veld. She said: “I tried to fight but they hit me with a hard object. They took turns raping me.” Joseph Baloyi (56) said he lost his wife in 2016 after she was raped by the men. “She had gone to buy airtime. When she came back she was injured. She told me she’d been raped. She died in hospital.” READ: ‘MASHONISA MUST BURY GOGO!’ Daily Sun learnt when Joseph testified last year, one of the accused laughed when he cried. Some of the accused were heard hurling insults at the victims who packed the gallery on Tuesday.
