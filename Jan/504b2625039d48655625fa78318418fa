GOVERNMENT must legalise and support zama zamas. This is the view of Action Aid South Africa and the University of the Witwatersrand research unit in a report launched yesterday in Joburg. READ: LIFE FOR RAPE GANG! The organisations said government should remove focus from criminalising zama zamas and instead penalise multinational mining companies abusing mining laws. Shawn Lethoko and Millicent Shungube of the National Association of Artisanal Miners said the country was losing R7 billion from the 6 000 abandoned mines in the country.  Action Aid’s Sifiso Dladla said the government should make a distinction between illegal mining controlled by international syndicates and poor people looking to survive without permits. Pontsho Ledwaba of the Wits researchers said a network of Lebanese were making a lot of money from buying diamonds in Kimberley. Ledwaba said some dealers claimed to have made between R1 000 and R2 000 for each diamond. One even said she sold a stone for R1,2 million. “Fortunately in Kimberley, illegal miners have been licensed. They have banded together and formed formal co-operatives called Batho Pele that sell their proceeds legally. In the gold sector in Gauteng, depending on effort, some claimed to have made between R10 000 and R50 000 a month from gold.” She didn’t understand why what happened in Kimberley couldn’t be done in other parts of the country. READ: I CAN’T KEEP A MAN! The study was done in Kimberley, Carletonville and Vlakfontein. According to Ledwaba, claims that zama zamas were mostly foreigners were found not to be correct, as their study showed 71% of the 1 179 respondents who took part in the study were South Africans. Dladla said South Africans were disadvantaged in territorial wars as they were not organised gangs like foreigners. “Instead of arresting, government should be decriminalising and formalising.”
