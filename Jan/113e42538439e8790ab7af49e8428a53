AN MPUMALANGA mother was stabbed several times, allegedly by two unknown suspects in September. No one was bust for the attack and now the 35-year-old believes the police have failed her. Zanele Gama from Fernie Village in Empuluzi told Daily Sun she didn’t know why she was attacked. “I was watching Generations: The Legacy when two men got into my house. One of them called out my name and as I turned to look who he was, he grabbed me. He started to choke me and then he stabbed me several times. “I screamed for help and they ran away,” she said. Zanele was stabbed on her face, arm and neck.  “I have a disability because of this incident. My hand doesn’t work now. Even today I don’t know what is happening with the case. “My attackers are roaming around the streets, while I’m scared to even go out because I don’t know what they’re planning after I survived the attack. I fear for my life and that of my family,” she said. Zanele said if the attackers came back and killed her, cops should be held accountable. “I provided them with everything, but they didn’t do anything. If they come back, police must take the blame.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an assault case was registered. “The complainant told the police she didn’t know who assaulted her, hence the case was closed,” he said.
