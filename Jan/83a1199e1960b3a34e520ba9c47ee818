BISHOP Vusi Dube and his church are known for controversy. But it seems like he has taken things to another level and church members have a new way of worshipping. Dube has turned a church into an entertainment spot. Dube, invited DJ Tira to come and spin the decks on Sunday. A video that is circulating on various social media platforms shows DJ Tira spinning the decks and Dube takes earphones from him. It further shows Dube taking over from the Afrotainment boss and rock the decks, playing the song Thank You Mr DJ. Church members seemed to have forgotten that they are in church but screaming and dancing.  In previous years, Dube who also served as an ANC Member of Parliament in KZN, was highly criticized for visiting the entertainment zones such as night clubs to preach. He also invites Durban artists to perform in his church. Tira is one of those who posted a video on social media with the caption: "This church is too much."  Speaking to Daily Sun, the controversial Bishop said that he values the talent that the youth has. "God gave us different talents and I am happy to see people make use of what God gave to them. Having DJ Tira in my church does not mean that I have changed to the club. â€œI want the youth to come and enjoy themselves without going to un-holly places where they can fall into sins," said Dube.
