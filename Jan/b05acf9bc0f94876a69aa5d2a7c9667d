ORLANDO Pirates have announced their first moves of the January PSL transfer window. The Buccaneers have loaned out defender Justice Chabalala and midfielder Tebogo Tlolane to Bloemfontein Celtic and Maritzburg united for the remainder of the season respectively. The duo have struggled for game time the beginning of the season and have since been afforded opportunities to get game-time elsewhere. Chabalala, who arrived at the Soweto side from Free State Stars in 2016, previously spent six months on loan at Chippa United in 2017 but has failed to cement his place in the Bucs setup over the past season and a half. Tlolane who joined Pirates from Chippa United after impressing while he was still at the PE based outfit will be looking at regaining his form that saw Bucs signing him from the Chilli Boys.
