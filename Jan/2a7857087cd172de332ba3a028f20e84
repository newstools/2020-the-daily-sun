POLICE in Mpumalanga have launched a manhunt following a murder. Dwyne Nguyuza (30) was found dead at midnight on New Year’s Eve in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge. According to reports, the EFF branch co-ordinator was celebrating with his wife Buhle Ncube (28) and family at their home when an unknown man entered their yard. The suspect shot Dwyne several times and went on to shoot Buhle before fleeing the scene together with two other suspects. Buhle is in hospital after being shot in the leg and the three suspects are still at large. Distressed uncle Elmon Ndobela told the SunTeam Dwyne, his wife Buhle and his cousins were celebrating to usher in the new year when a car with three occupants inside approached. “It was 12am when Dwyne, his cousins and wife decided to move closer to the gate to burn fireworks. “Immediately after he burnt the fireworks, an intruder shot him three times in the chest and he collapsed. “His wife was shot in the leg as she was trying to save her dying husband in her arms. His killers sped off in a sedan. “We’re really saddened by the untimely death. His killers must be brought to book.” EFF provincial chairman Collen Sedibe said they were deeply disturbed by the death of one of their fighters. “Starting a year by losing a disciplined, committed fighter isn’t good. “We’re looking forward to the police leaving no stone unturned. They must catch his killers with immediate effect so they can face the law. “Our deepest condolences go to the family, friends and fighters.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “The victim died upon arrival at a local clinic and his wife was shot once in the leg. “She’s receiving medical attention at a local hospital. “The motive for the attack is unknown and there have been no arrests.” Cases of murder and attempted murder were under investigation.
