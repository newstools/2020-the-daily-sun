COPS in Cape Town are on the hunt for a suspect who disappeared with a two-month-old baby boy after posing as a social worker. The suspect allegedly lured the mum of twin boys to an office in Parow, where she disappeared with one of the kids. According to police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut, the incident happened last Thursday. Traut said the mum was approached by the suspect at their home in Khayelitsha on Wednesday, where she introduced herself as a social worker. The suspect then returned on Thursday and asked the mum to accompany her to the suspect’s alleged office in Parow. “She asked for the babies’ birth certificates. “She returned the next day and accompanied the mother and the children to Parow in a taxi. After stopping at the alleged office, the suspect got out of the vehicle with one of the twins and fled with the child,” said Traut. He said cops were investigating the matter and were calling for the public to help them find two-month-old Kwahlelo Tiwane. Anyone with information should contact Detective Sergeant Joy Sumsodien of the Bellville FCS on 082 522 1095, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
