FORGOTTEN Lucky Mohomi is edging closer to the exit door at Mamelodi Sundowns. The wantaway midfielder heads the list of players who are set to be loaned out to make way for January transfer window targets. Mohomi has been on the radar of SuperSport United and a deal for his transfer to the cross town rivals is understood to be imminent. The Mamelodi-born midfielder hasn’t featured for the Brazilians so far this season, the last of his only two appearances having come in the Nedbank Cup competition a year ago. Matsatsantsa have unsuccessfully tried luring the 28-year-old previously. But this time they are encouraged by the fact Mohomi doesn’t appear to be in Downs coach Pitso Mosimane’s plans, though that is down to injury setbacks. Mohomi’s management team have previously been quoted as saying they are hoping to get him to United, who have shown interest. Mohomi joined Downs from Free State Stars four year ago‚ but has only played two official matches for the club. He has admitted to being frustrated at the lack of game time, and has been keen on a loan move. Also on the list is Sammy Seabi, who could be send out on a six-month loan to re-establish himself and prove he still has a competitive spirit. The injury to Rivaldo Coetzee, who can operate as a centre-back or as defensive midfielder, has also left a gap in the team. The former Bafana Bafana defender faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines, recovering from an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Tokelo Rantie’s departure has presented coach Mosimane with an opportunity to bring in another striker, with Knowledge Musona being heavily linked with a move to the Tshwane giants.
