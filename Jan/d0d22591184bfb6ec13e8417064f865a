RESIDENTS gave him the name Ngulube, which means pig in Zulu. Ngulube is suspected of having broken into many houses ekasi, helping himself to food, and then stealing TVs and other valuables. But on Monday this most wanted thief was bust by cops. Relieved residents of Duduza, Ekurhuleni, said Ngulube deserved to rot in a jail cell. “He’s been terrorising us and we wish they lock him up and throw away the keys,” said a resident. Sergeant Harry Manaka said the 25-year-old suspect was found in an abandoned house in Duduza. “Ngulube was wanted by cops for a number of cases including housebreaking and theft, business burglaries and aggravated robberies,” said Manaka. He said the arrest came after Ngulube had robbed a resident of Phumla Mqashi in broad daylight. “It took cops days to trace him. He was finally caught at his hideout, an abandoned, filthy house. “The owners of the house left it 10 years ago,” said resident William Mvelase. “It was vandalised and is now a den of thieves.” Last year residents burned the house after several people had been robbed by thugs who stayed there. “We want the owners to come forward because furious residents will end up demolishing it,” said Emelda Mtshweni. Duduza station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Bheki Mhlungu said: “The community of Phumla Mqashi in Duduza expressed relief following the arrest of Ngulube. “The police and community will continue working together in the fight against crime.” Ngulube also faces charges of malicious damage to property and resisting arrest.
