The man who pointed out the body of missing 12-year-old
Michaela Williams lived nearby and had served time in jail for rape, according
to someone involved in the search. "She lived two doors away from him. The killing appears
to be premeditated because the timing and everything was too
coincidental," the Western Cape Missing Persons Unit's director Candice van
der Rheede told News24 on Friday. "He was convicted of rape and sentenced to 20 years but
came out about a year ago." Williams was last seen at her Crane Street residence in New
Horizon, Grassy Park, on Tuesday and was reported missing in the early hours of
Wednesday morning. She was seen in the company of a man who lived in the same
street. Van der Rheede said that when Williams' mother got out of
the bath, she looked for her daughter and couldn't find her. Her mother Beatrice Adams told the Cape Argus that she had
hoped her girl would be found alive and was heartbroken when her body was discovered
at a dump. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said various
people searched for her and a 48-year-old man was interviewed after vital
information was received. "The interview led to him pointing out where the body
was in Schaapkraal, Philippi." A post mortem was conducted on Thursday but the results have
not yet been released. The man was supposed to appear on a murder charge in the
Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Friday but would now make his first appearance on
Monday. Further charges could be added. "I am sick to death of all these killings," said
Van der Rheede, who had also searched for slain Courtney Pieters, 3, and
Chanelle McCrawl, 10, before setting eyes on their bodies. "It's heartbreaking. The community in Pelican Park are
very close knit. They are very, very angry. We need the death penalty." SOURCE: NEWS24
