UK Spotify has made playlists and a podcast for dogs to listen to in their owners’ absence. This came after finding that about 74% of UK pet owners play music for their animals. The Swedish audio-streaming business company said it had launched a podcast featuring soothing music, “dog-directed praise”, stories, and messages of affirmation narrated by actors to alleviate stress for dogs who’re home alone. The playlists offer tracks selected by algorithms to match pets’ characteristics. Spotify said it found in a survey that one in four pet owners play music for their pets to listen to when they were away from home, with 42% of owners saying their pets had a favourite type of music. – REUTERS
