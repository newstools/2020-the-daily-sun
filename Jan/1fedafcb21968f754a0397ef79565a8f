KAIZER Chiefs are not looking over their shoulders. That is the view of their regular penalty taker Daniel Cardoso. Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns reduced Amakhosi’s lead to four points after their 3-0 victory over AmaZulu last week to blow the Absa Premiership title race wide open. The Soweto giants dropped points when they lost 2-1 to SuperSport United at the weekend. The gap could be cut to just one point if Sundowns beat Bidvest Wits at Loftus Versfeld in Tshwane tomorrow night (7.30pm). Amakhosi will be in action against Highlands Park in a sold-out encounter at the FNB Stadium on Wednesday night (7.30pm). But their tough as teak defender  Cardoso says his side is not worried about Sundowns or any other team in the league. He claims that his side is not even thinking about winning the league at the stage of the season. Said Cardoso: “The moment you start to worry about the team behind you, that is when you start to lose focus. We are not thinking about Sundowns or thinking about winning the league title.  We choose to focus on ourselves and take it one game at a time. We are not even thinking about the gab.”
