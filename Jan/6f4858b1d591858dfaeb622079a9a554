BAROKA new coach Dylan Kerr says he is ready for the challenge ahead in his quest to help Bakgaga avoid relegation and finish in a respectable position in the Absa Premiership. Kerr replaced Wedson Nyirenda who resigned after the team’s poor form in December. And due to permit issues, Kerr missed five consecutive Premiership games against Cape Town City, Golden Arrows, Polokwane City, Stellenbosch and Maritzburg United. He was frustrated by having to watch from the stands. However, on Tuesday the Department of Home Affairs finally approved Kerr’s permit and he will be in charge of the Ga-Mphahlele based outfit for the first time against Highlands Park in a league match on Saturday at Makhulong Stadium (8.15pm). “I am so happy I can finally do my job officially,” said Kerr. “But now the hard work starts and the pressure is on. But I am confident that we will move from the position we are on and do well.” Kerr is well known for masterminding Black Leopards’s escape from relegation last season when everyone was expecting the Venda-based side to be relegated to GladAfrica Championship. And this time he ie expected to do the same with Bakgaga. Baroka are 13th on the log with 20 points from 20 league matches after registering their second win of 2020 beating Maritzburg United 2-1 on Sunday at Peter Mokaba Stadium with their assistant coach Matsemela Thoka at the helm. Kerr now needs to mastermind Baroka's safety in the top flight. Last season, Kerr helped Leopards avoid relegation after everyone have tipped Lidoda Duvha to go down to championship. And now Baroka chairman Khurishi Mphahlele is expecting the same from the former Kenyan giants Gor Mahia coach.
