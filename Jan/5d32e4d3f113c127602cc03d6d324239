A
KwaZulu-Natal family is reeling from a horrific home invasion after three men
robbed them at their farm and raped their teenage daughter, police said on
Tuesday. Police
spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police were in search of three men who
accosted a family in Kranskloof, Glendale, north of Durban on Thursday, January
9. She said
the family were at their home when they were accosted by the men wearing
balaclavas and armed with a knife and crowbar. "The
suspects tied the victims with extension cords, threatened to kill them and
took four cellphones and a laptop." They then
forced the 19-year-old daughter to drive them to Umvoti Plaza, where they
ordered her to withdraw cash. "They
instructed her to drive towards Tinley Manor, where two males raped her and
ordered her to drop them off at the corner of the R102 and Glendale Road and
left on foot, telling her to go." Mbele said
police were investigating charges of robbery, rape and theft. "Anyone
with information should come forward to police." SOURCE:
