PATRONS at the Poppy's Restaurant in Melville started their 2020 on a tragic note. This is after two women aged 30 and 40 were killed in a drive by shooting after an hour South Africa celebrated the arrival of the new year. Six other people were rushed to hospital after they were also shot at the same restaurant. According to the police it is reported that a BMW SUV approached from 7th Avenue and suddenly, multiple shots were allegedly fired from the BMW at patrons who were sitting outside the restaurant. In a statement, Police spokeswoman Mathapelo Peters said out of the six people who were injured in the shooting, two of them were in a critical state. "Police have opened two cases of murder and six attempted murder cases," she said. The incident prompted a reaction out of the Gauteng Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela. He has condemned the incident that has marred what started off as peaceful celebrations by revelers in Johannesburg to cross over to the New Year. Mawela has further urged the investigators to ensure that no stone is left upturned in ensuring that the suspects are found and brought to book. Police are urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspects, to report to the police by calling the crime stop number 08600 10111 or by giving a tip-off on the MySAPS app, anonymously if they so choose.
