THE truck driver found guilty of killing 24 people in an accident has been released. Sanele May came out of Umzinto Prison yesterday after seven years in jail. The crash happened at Field’s Hill, Pinetown in Durban. May (31), from Swaziland, drove a truck which lost control on Field’s Hill and ploughed into six taxis in 2013. He was bust and charged with 24 counts of culpable homicide, two charges of fraud, one of entering Mzansi illegally, two of being in possession of fake driver’s licence, one of operating a vehicle without a valid professional driving permit, and one of failing to comply with a road traffic sign. May pleaded guilty to the charges. Sanele May Group founder Peace Piche posted on Facebook: “Sanele has been released from prison. The day we have all been waiting for has arrived. He admitted this morning that it feels like a dream.” Piche thanked those who supported May. “A huge shout out to everyone who stuck by his side with visits, finance, messages, prayers and support,” he said.
