MICHAEL Mokoena (35) claims to have learnt everything a man needs to know about women. “I don’t think there’s anything I can’t deal with,” said Michael from Sebokeng, in the Vaal. “I no longer get dumped. I’m the one who’s doing the dumping.” Michael has self-published a book titled Casanova Method, which teaches men how to handle women. It came out in October. He claims to know the switches that must be flipped in a woman for her to feel attraction. “Women tend to be attracted to men who’re loved by other women. Guys who’re in a relationship or are married attract women the most,” said Michael. He said women love a leader.  “If you can lead men, it shows you can lead a relationship. Nothing turns a woman off more than a man who can’t make decisions,” he said.  He said now that he understood women, he was ready for any challenge he might face. In his book, he claims charisma is a hypnosis women choose. He said for a man to be charismatic he must be, among other things, confident, optimistic, assertive, articulate and trustworthy.  “You’re loved only as much as you are useful to a woman! This includes your wife of over 15 years,” he writes in chapter three. Sthembiso Dube (33) said Michael’s book helped him understand women better. “I’ve learnt that I need to be a leader. I used to let people order me around, but I’ve realised I need to be firm,” said Sthembiso. Billy Mavundla (39) said he’d never be dumped again. “I didn’t even know women actually cared about men being protective of their loved ones,” he said.
