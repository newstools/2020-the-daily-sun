HE WAS trying to save a 16-year-old boy from drowning in the trench but slipped, fell in the water and also drowned. The incident happened on Wednesday when Makgola Motaung (35) was passing by the trench. It’’s close to the river where Musa Mbele (8) also drowned on Saturday. Makgola heard boys screaming and when he went to investigate, they told him their friend was drowning. The incident has angered residents of Bluegumbosch in QwaQwa, Free State. They claimed this was not the first time a child had drowned there. They said Tumelo Lephoto (13) also drowned in 2017. Residents asked the municipality to fill up the trench, but that never happened. Makgola’s relative Lehana Letseola (50) said: “I watched as Makgola drowned, but couldn’t help him. “He died in front of me.” His aunt Nthabiseng Kotela (37) said the family was heartbroken. “My nephew was the breadwinner. “He was humble and died trying to help. He leaves behind his wife and three kids, and we don’t know who’s going to look after them.” Tumelo’s mum, Matshidiso (43), said the latest incident opened old wounds. “The municipality did not want to take responsibility. They must close the trench before it swallows more people,” she said. Councillor Teboho Mohlekwa said: “It was left by a contractor building roads. After the incident in 2017, I reported the matter to municipal officials and they promised to close it, but it never happened. “I met the municipal officials today (yesterday) to take out the water and close the trench. We visited the family and will wait to hear if they need any help.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said cops opened an inquest docket after the incident. Both bodies were recovered.
