JOMO COSMOS captain Ange Lebahi believes the club is “too big” to be fighting for relegation and challenges his teammates to bounce back stronger this year. Cosmos are currently sitting precariously in 15th position on the GladAfrica Championship standings and are facing the dreaded axe. Ezenkosi would be following in the footsteps of Moroka Swallows and Santos as some former PSL teams to be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League. Lebahi is aware of the gravity of the situation they find themselves in. He claims players are ready to fight tooth-and-nail to avoid going down the same route as the Dube Birds and the People’s Team, Santos. “As players, we’re worried about the situation,” said the 35-year-old Ivorian defender. “Cosmos are a big team and deserves better. Honestly, we shouldn’t be fighting for relegation right now. “We should be fighting to regain promotion to the top flight. We’re letting the brand, our supporters and boss down. “Ours is to fight hard and bring the club back to where it belongs, at the top.” Cosmos will have a chance to turn things around when they face inconsistent TS Galaxy at Olen Park in Potchefstroom today (3.30pm). Lebahi is confident Cosmos, who survived relegation by the skin of their teeth on the last day of the season last term, can pull off yet another great escape. “The only positive out of this at the moment is we have the needed experience and know how to pull ourselves out of these kinds of situation,” said Lebahi. “As players, we’re ready and willing to put up a fight. The boss always speaks to and motivates us.” Meanwhile, bottom-dwellers Royal Eagles will also be hoping to turn their fortunes around when they travel to Mpumalanga for a clash against TS Sporting at Kabokweni Stadium today (3.30pm). Like Cosmos, Eagles have this season managed only two wins in 15 attempts and are the favourites to go down, baring a miracle.
