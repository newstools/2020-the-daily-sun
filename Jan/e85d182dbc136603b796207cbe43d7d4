RAYMOND Zondo has once again raised concern about the competency of his legal team. State Capture commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo did so during the testimony of PricewaterhouseCoopers forensic auditor Trevor White, as he was explaining the payment to a senior cop by KZN businessman Thoshan Panday. Panday has been implicated at the commission for having fleeced the SAPS of millions for alleged inflated tenders, some of which were during the 2010 World Cup. White yesterday couldn’t fully explain payment to a senior cop, which clearly showed Panday had made it. This led to Zondo pointing out the evidence was not providing a clear story. It took the legal representative of the senior cop, identified only as Ngobeni, who pointed out to Zondo that documents filed at a high court were clear on this. If the commission’s legal team had bothered to ask for high court documents, they would have been better informed. Zondo raised concerns that the commission legal team was not guiding investigators to gather information as they should. Advocate Susan Wentzel said she was only informed about this at the end of Monday’s proceedings. Zondo said: “It might well be that the legal team didn’t know, but the investigators should have. I would have expected you to ask the investigators. “You, the legal team, are driving this by presenting the evidence.” White yesterday also told the commission of how a KZN businessman organised the waiver of a tender for a multi-million rand water project, from which he got a kickback. He said days after the tender was “rubber stamped”, more than R1 million was paid to Kuboni Attorneys on the instruction of Sipho Thabalala, who was head of KZN Treasury.
