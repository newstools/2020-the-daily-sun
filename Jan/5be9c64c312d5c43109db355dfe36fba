Other workers said they need their money before Friday and have no patience to wait any longer. The workers who works at the waste management, electricity department, City Parks, water and sanitation are the ones affected. The leader of Labour Brokers which is under City of Tshwane, Austin Mailula, said these workers are absorbed by the City. He said they are waiting for salaries and uniforms. "We are still discussing and negotiating with workers on their matters,” he said Mailula said the workers will be paid this week and will receive their uniforms. "The delay was caused by political and municipal administration. “There was corruption in the City,” he said The leader of Labour broker said they want to retrain all the Human Resources officials and some of the administration workers out of the department. "We were seriously under pressure and it was a bad thing for the workers not to get paid the past two months," he said. Mailula said the families of the workers also went through tough times during festive season as there was no money for them. Tshwane's MMC for Human Capital and Shared Service Corporate, Richard Moheta, said it is important for workers to be paid. "We must not name other people's names. “Tomorrow I will seat with officials so that you get paid," he said
