SEASONED financial journalist Sikonathi Mantshantsha has been appointed to one of the trickiest positions in the country – spokesman for struggling Eskom. “His appointment is a firm step from our side to strengthen our efforts to improve Eskom’s image, to add another layer of success to our media response strategies in order to be more direct and proactive when engaging with media and other interest groups,” Eskom’s CEO Andre de Ruyter told employees earlier yesterday, according to a statement. Mantshantsha, a fierce critic of Eskom in recent years, has become known in journalism circles for his probing questions at the power utility’s media briefings. Speaking to CapeTalk’s Kieno Kammies last month after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that sabotage had contributed to load shedding, Mantshantsha said that, in his view, the true saboteurs were “the empty suits that are running this country. That is where the sabotage is happening”. He confirmed he’d be starting on 1 February. Mantshantsha has worked at a number of financial publications, including FinWeek and Fin24.com. – NEWS24
