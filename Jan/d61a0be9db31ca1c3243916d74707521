Legendary Maskandi musician, Ihashi Elimhlophe, whose real name is Bheki Ngcobo celebrated his 60th birthday in style. The award-winning musician turned 60 on the 28th of December, and upon celebrating the milestone, he also renewed his vows to the love of his life MamNgcobo, Linah Ebony.  The Ngcobo family took to Instagram to share how they party. And if it is anything to go by, we all wish we could be adopted by them. The couple has bred a family of artists, two boys, and two daughters who are musicians, dancers and in the entertainment industry, which is no surprise why the celebration was lit. It is indeed true when they say age is just a number, in the video shared by Ntombi, who is the oldest daughter, Elimhlophe was dancing like a youngster, doing the popular gwara gwara to the pouncing cat. In 2019, he toasted his illustrious music career that spans over 40 years with a release of his 29th album, Ama Waza Waza. READ: THE LEGENDARY IHASHI ELIMHLOPHE DROPS NEW ALBUM!
