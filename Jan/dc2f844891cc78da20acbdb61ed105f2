TO say Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was delighted to have Themba Zwane back in his team, would be an understatement. The 54-year-old could not stress enough the importance of his star midfielder to the Brazilians outfit. Zwane, who missed Sundowns' narrow 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates last week, was back in the team against SuperSporet United on Sunday. The 30-year-old showed just how big a miss he was for Sundowns as he played a key role to help them to a 2-1 win over their Tshwane rivals. And Mosimane could not stop singing his praises. "Whenever Mshishi is around, he plays the music. You know the story," Mosimane told reporters after the match."Look at the midfield today. It's more like we have one man or two more people extra in the midfield because of Mshishi's movements. Him, Vila and Sirino, they combine well. When these ones are on song, you see the Sundowns play."Mshishi is very important to us. We can't talk about why he didn't play against Pirates, it's gone."
