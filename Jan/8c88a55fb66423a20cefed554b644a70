THE women want love, but their men want Wi-Fi! SunReaders from Joburg and Soweto are complaining. READ: MASTER KG ROBBED R120K AT GUNPOINT! Xoli Msimang (36) from Brixton, Joburg, said: “My man is always at the Wi-Fi hotspot and we don’t spend time together.” She said her husband went to the Wi-Fi hotspot at the Brixton library. “I followed him. When he went to the library I thought he was cheating with a schoolgirl. But he got to the library and started playing with his phone.”  Xoli said when she eventually asked him, he said he was looking for a better job. Nontokozo Mtshali (33) said: “When my husband comes home from work he puts down his bag and goes to the Wi-Fi hotspot. He comes back late at night to bath, complaining that he’s tired.” She said the Wi-Fi must be disconnected. Joyce Mahlangu (40) of Brixton said they live as single women while their men are busy with the free internet. “For us to win them back, the Wi-Fi must be closed.” Lihle Zuma (28) from Diepkloof, Soweto, told Daily Sun her man goes to the bus station where there’s free Wi-Fi.  “He stays there all day. I wonder who he’s chatting to. It’s probably his nyatsis. I wish they’d cut the Wi-Fi,” she said. READ: WATCH: NYAOPE BOYS TRASH FUNERAL!
