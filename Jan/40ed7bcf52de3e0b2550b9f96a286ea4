The Premier Soccer League (PSL) domestic January transfer window is officially open and as usual, several players are being linked with other clubs. Some team have already began their shopping while others are still biding their time in securing their top targets. Mamelodi Sundowns are known to be usually active on the transfer market and this one could be no different, if recent reports are anything to go by. The Tshwane giants have been linked with a move for former Kaizer Chiefs sharp shooter Knowledge Musona, whose contract with Belgian outfit Anderlecht, is reportedly set to be terminated. But could Musona be what Sundowns need as they look to defend their Absa Premiership title? It would appear so given they are fairly short in attack following the departure of Argentine Emiliano Tade and the disappearance of Tokelo Rantie. As a result, Pitso Mosimane is looking for more option in attack to share the load with the likes of Mauricio Affonso, Gaston Sirino and Themba Zwane. And in Musona, Downs would be getting a proven goal scorer in the Premiership after his exploits in the colours of rivals Amakhosi.
