DR Malinga is a man of many talents, and making people happy is very close to his heart. That’s why he’s opened Lingas Resort, a water park in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane. Dr Malinga told Daily Sun: “People ekasi needed something like this, especially on sunny days.” He was supposed to launch the resort in early December but had to postpone because of heavy rain. “We launched it on 24 December and people loved it,” said Dr Malinga, whose real name is Goodwill Malinga.  He said construction was ongoing. “We’re still going to build rooms and a conference centre,” he said. He wanted to help talented local artists get exposure. “Not only will local artists perform here, they’ll also get an opportunity to record music in a studio I’m going to build here. “It will be a platform to sign new good artists.” Dr Malinga held a Lingas Crossover event on New Year’s Eve and said the turnout was great. “Local acts like Nelly Mawaza and other talents performed at the event,. “We had a family picnic during New Year’s Day, where families came in their numbers.” Malinga performs for free on people’s birthdays. “I make my fans and people around here feel special, so I sing for them on their birthdays,” he said. He wants to build more resorts in other areas.
