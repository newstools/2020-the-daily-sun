BIG boost for Maritzburg United as coach Eric Tinkler confirmed that defender and turned central midfielder Siyanda Xulu is now fit for selection. Tinkler declared Xulu is available for selection later tonight when they host Cape Town City at Harry Gwala Stadium (8.pm). Xulu, whose contract ends at the end of the season, suffered an ankle injury against Bloemfontein Celtic on 8 November. In all, he missed nine games, including the win over Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout semi final and also the final against his former club - Mamelodi Sundowns. The defender then returned against AmaZulu on the 17 January but was only fit to be be on the bench “We were very very thin in the central of defense because we only had Rushine De Reuck and Nazeer Allie,” said Tinkler. “I was relieved that they didn’t get any injuries. Otherwise we would have been scrambling.” While Xulu also missed the 2-1 loss in the Maritzburg’s previous game against Baroka FC, there were more good news on that day. Phumlani Ntshangase returned from the long-term injury and came on in the second half. Tinkler said both of these players’ return came at the time when the season is reaching its business end. “I’m just happy that all of them are available for selection because we are getting down to the last ten games of the season ,” revealed Tinkler. “It makes my job more harder, which is what you want.” he chuckled.
