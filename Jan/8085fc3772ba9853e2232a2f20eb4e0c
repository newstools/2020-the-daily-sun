Local TV personality Minnie Dlamini is taking advantage of the summer sun and heating up our timeline with beachside bikini photos. Sharing a photo of herself on the beach, wearing a dark blue bikini, Minnie looked at the year ahead, writing: " 2020 I turn 30! Celebrate 10 years in the entertainment industry, and I got my body back." In recent years, Minnie's weight has been a hot topic, and in 2018 she shut down the chatter for good, writing on Instagram: "No matter your size, shape (or pregnancy rumours) love your body, celebrate it!" Minnie's famous friends took to the comment section, commenting on what a role model she is, including DJ Zinhle, who called Minnie an "inspiration." Minnie is kicking off 2020 on a high note after tragedy struck at the end of 2019 with the death of brother Khosini. SEE THE TWEET HERE: 2020 I turn 30!
