NOT sure what resolutions to make? Don’t worry, someone else has come up with some for you. Chris Wood, executive for Nedbank Card Issuing and Payments, has put together tips to help you set and work towards your money goals this year: The most important step towards achieving your money goals is to make sure you’re managing your money well on a day-to-day basis. It just requires awareness of your spending, saving and credit behaviour. The word “budget” strikes fear into many. But budgeting doesn’t have to mean setting up complicated spreadsheets or spending hours pondering your finances. Budgeting works because it’s a great way of compartmentalising your money so you have a clear idea of what’s coming in and what’s going out. Smart money management is making sure you’re not paying more for banking than you have to. There are many ways to do this, ranging from ensuring you have the right bank account, package and fee structure for your typical banking usage, to always trying to use your own bank’s ATMs to withdraw cash, choosing online or cellphone banking for your transactions instead of going to a branch, and making the most of your bank’s rewards programme. There’s a common misperception that all credit is bad for your finances. However, while it’s never a good idea to get yourself into so much debt that your repayments start to impact your financial well-being, a well-managed credit can be a great way to achieve your money goals. One of the most common goals people set involve local or international travel. Here, too, a credit card can be an effective way of helping you. Most credit cards offer valuable free travel insurance.
