MARITZBURG United defender Kwanda Mngonyama said they are determined to end their losing streak against KwaZulu-Natal neighbours Golden Arrows. The clubs meet in a spicy KZN Absa Premiership derby at the Harry Gwala Stadium tonight (8pm). Abafana Bes’thende have dominated this fixture having won six of the last seven matches against The Team of Choice. The last time Maritzburg defeated Arrows was in March 2016. “It is important for us to get three points as we are at home. We know that Arrows have been beating us for the past few years. In every game we are now playing in the second round (of the league) is like a cup final,” said Mngonyama, who is set to be deployed in a wing back role in coach Eric Tinkler’s preferred 3-5-2 formation. But Arrows go into this game having lost their last three league matches before the end of 2019. Maritzburg, who ended 2019 with a 1-1 draw against log leaders Kaizer Chiefs, are eighth with 18 points from 14 games. Arrows sit a position above their local rivals with 20 points. Tinkelr wanted 20 points. This match starts a crucial month for Maritzburg. Including the Arrows game, they will play six league matches and they will need to pick up points in order not to be sucked into a relegation dog fight like they were last season when they survived by winning the relegation play-offs. Tinkler agrees with his hard running defender that his charges have to start the New Year with three precious points. Said Tinkler: “It is very important we have a strong start against Arrows at home and we need to obviously win that game.” Tinkler said January was a big month for the Team of Choice. The difficult period is when they face SuperSport United on 8 January at Lucas Moripe Stadium and two days later they meet Chippa United in East London.
