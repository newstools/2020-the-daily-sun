Actress Simphiwe Ngema is finally moving on from the pain of losing the man she loved dearly. Her husband, Dumi Masilela, was gunned down in Alexandra during a hijacking four years ago and later died in hospital.While Simphiwe will never forget Dumi, she is finally summoning the strength to move on with her life and accept that he is no more. Taking to her Instagram account, the Isidingo star shared an emotional message, in which she said:"I've chosen to accept he's not coming back." She wrote: "I’ve let go of what could’ve been and I’m starting to live in what is and making a reality of what could be. It hasn’t been easy but I’ve had to let go of a lot of 'if onlys'. I’ve become the man I wanted to marry and I’ve chosen to accept that he’s not coming back but my life doesn’t have to be stuck in what could’ve been. Here’s to making all my dreams come true." Ironically her character, Phindile  in SABC3's Isidingo, is getting ready to tie the knot with Sechaba Moloi.However, while it may seem she is ready to mingle, Simphiwe told Daily Sun that she is not yet ready to date. "I'm not ready not to date - I was just saying I've accepted that he is gone," she said. I’ve let go of what could’ve been and I’m starting to live in what is and making a reality of what could be. It hasn’t been easy but I’ve had to let go of a lot of “if onlys”. I’ve become the man I wanted to marry and I’ve chosen to accept that he’s not coming back but my life doesn’t have to be stuck in what could’ve been. Here’s to making all my dreams come true??.
