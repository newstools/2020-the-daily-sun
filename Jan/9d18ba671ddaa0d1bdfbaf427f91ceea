STRUGGLING Polokwane City head coach Clinton Larsen is not worried about his team’s position on the log. Rise and and Shine are sitting at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table and Larsen knows that his team needs to improve or else they could find themselves playing in the GladAfrica Championship next season. City, who have been in the top flight for seven years are 16th with 16 points from 18 league matches. City have won five, drawn one and lost 12 matches. The Limpopo side have lost more league matches than any other side in the 16-team league. However, Larsen is not giving up his fight to help City maintain their Premiership status. “The league table changes week after week,”said Larsen after his side’s 1-0 defeat by Baroka in the Limpopo derby played on Saturday at Peter Mokaba Stadium. “I am not looking at the position we are on the log. We have a target of 30 points and we are working on that. I am confident that we will achieve our 30 point target and we will be safe.” He added:”There are still many games to play and the response I am getting from the boys is amazing despite not winning games. It is just a matter of time before we start winning.” The former Orlando Pirates midfielder was also full of praise to their new signing Kabelo Mahlasela. Mahlasela joined Baroka on a six months loan from Kaizer Chiefs last Thursday. The 28-year-old midfielder made his debut against Baroka. “We want to sign players who will add value to the team and Mahlasela is one of them,” said Larsen. “He is very talented player and all he needs is game time. I am sure that when he is 100 percent match fit, people will see the best from him.” In their game against Bakgaga, the former Golden Arrows and Chippa United coach said:” It was a good performance despite losing. We dominated the game and we just couldn’t convert our chances. The fact that their goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze was Man-of-the-Match says it all. The boys gave their best but it was not our day.”
