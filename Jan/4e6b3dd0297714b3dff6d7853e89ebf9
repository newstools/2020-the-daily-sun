 Controversial soccer hanger Sjuku was caught on social media ranting about Ntante Thuso Motaung. And his remarks received a serious backlash from many people. In the two minute video that went viral, Sjuki is not shy to express his feelings about Ntate Thuso - who is constantly criticising people for being broke - as if he has money himself. “Why are you always wearing the same blue and white shirt always,” asked Sjuku. Skuju also implied that Ntante Thuso is delusional. “He probably has money in his mind but we don’t see,” says Sjuku. Others quickly jumped into Ntante Thuso’s defence, calling Sjuku into order. One guy said, ‘We tired of you, you can’t even fix your dental formula but you busy going for your elders.” The user went on to say that he sleeps at his mother’s house. “You don’t even have your own place, you sleep in your mother’s kitchen,” he added. No disrespect but i just had to say this, it's the truth after all! And only few will understand #asbonge?? madala needed to be told ayi always say bad things about the youth never build....
