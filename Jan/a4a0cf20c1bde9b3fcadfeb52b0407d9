PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng is on a mission to bust fake church leaders. The leader of Incredible Happenings Ministry said he had proof and was ready to make it available to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “They are guilty of things they do in the dark, which are against the laws of our country and against Christianity. “Their biggest fear is me exposing them,” said Mboro at a media briefing at his church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, yesterday. Mboro said he has been targeted by fake pastors who wanted to divert attention from themselves because they feared being exposed. He was responding to claims on social media that he had reportedly said he saw prominent South African politicians in hell and he has killed Satan. It was also claimed he was selling tickets to heaven. Mboro said the pastors from Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mzansi were working together to destroy him. “There are many Facebooks posts from ministers who have published defamatory articles about me on websites they have created.” Mboro said the church ministers were involved in criminal activities which included rape, sexual harassment, fraud and intimidation. “They take money from the poor who go to loan sharks and banks to borrow money because they are promised blessings that never come,” he said. “I’ve made a decision to approach the president with the rot I have found about these men who should be in jail.” Mboro said there should be a commission of inquiry into fake pastors. “I have all the necessary proof to back up what I’m saying,” he said.
