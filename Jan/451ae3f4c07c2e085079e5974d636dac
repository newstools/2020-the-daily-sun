Anew year, like previous years, requires us to be disciplined. If one applies basics such as persistence, resilience and perseverance in their day-to-day struggles, your goals can be easily accomplished. Only you can turn your life into what you have been dreaming of. Being passionate about what you believe in is also important. It will push you to reach for your goals. Look around you and be inspired by the opportunities and mistakes people make. Read books, listen to motivational speakers and, most importantly, take action. I couldn’t agree more with author Robin Sharma’s inspirational quote: “Ideas without action are a complete waste of your finest hours.” Let 2020 be the year in which we don’t talk about ideas but about implementing them.
