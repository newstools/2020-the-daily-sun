The absence of Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena in their Absa Premiership encounter against Bloemfontein Celtic, has raised some eyebrows. Newly appointed coach Josef Zinnbauer worked closely with the second assistant coach Fadlu Davids during the game. Mokwena cut a lonely figure in Bucs 3-1 victory over Black Leopards before the Christmas break. The new Bucs coach was left to answer questions whether Mokwena was happy to work with him or not at the time. Mokwena was subdued on the bench in the win over Leopards and when Zinnbauer was asked if he was happy to work with him, he said he was on good terms with his assistant. Zinnbuaer said he has a great relationship with his second in charge and that together they would take the club forward. But his absence in the 1-1 draw against Celtic in Bloemfontein on Saturday, raised more questions. Bucs media officer Thandi Merafe said the reason why Mokwena was not present at the game is because he is on leave. Merafe said: “Mokwena is on leave. He will be back soon.” Zinnbauer said that as far as he knows Mokwena is still an important part of his technical team. Zinnbauer added: “He is still the Pirates coach and I’m happy to work with him. He is on leave and he will be back.”
