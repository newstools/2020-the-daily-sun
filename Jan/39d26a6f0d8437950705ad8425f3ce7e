FINANCE minister Tito Mboweni has invited tips from the public for his upcoming budget speech. Sun Money asked the big retail group, Shoprite for tips to help Mzansi people who are cash-strapped to stretch their hard-earned cash a little further. And they gave us the following tips: Start saving every month Plan for future purchases such as birthdays, holidays and of course the back-to-school by buying savings stamps in units of just R10 or R20 every month. Stamps can be bought, and redeemed, at any Shoprite, Checkers or Usave across Mzansi. Buy private label Get more value for your money by buying private label items such as any Shoprite Ritebrand products. These match the established brand names in quality, but at a lower price. Pay attention to unit pricing The unit price is the cost of a consumer product according to a standard unit of measure, which could be per kilogram, per litre etc. When grocery shopping, look at the unit price – included on the Product Indicator label on the product shelf – in order to make accurate price comparisons between different product sizes. For example, the unit price of a 1kg box of cereal may be higher than the unit price of a 750g box. Capitalise on crazy combo deals Bulk buys are becoming increasingly popular in South Africa, especially for large families, stokvels and schools.
