Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka wants to start the year on a high note. Amakhosi finished 2019 as the most in form team in the Absa Premiership and Maluleka wants to continue where they left off in that regard. The Soweto giants are currently setting the pace in the league with a seven point cushion at the top of the standings. And on Saturday, they have another opportunity to maintain their lead when they face Super Sport United at Mbombela Stadium (6pm). “We are eager to start the year 2020 with a win,” Maluleka told his club's website. “It’s always good to start off on a positive note. We have been working very hard at training after spending some time with our families over Christmas. Because of the work we have put in, we need to have a good start. “We did not end off the year the way we would have liked with a draw, but it’s a new year, new start and we have new ambitions.” Maluleka said they are eager to defeat Matsatsantsa A Pitori and extend the eleven point gap they have over the Tshwane outfit heading into the clash. “It’s important that we win this game,” added the Tembisa-born midfielder. “SuperSport have had some good results apart from their recent loss. They are in the top three on the log. To win against them will put us under less pressure given their ambitions and ours to do well this season,”
