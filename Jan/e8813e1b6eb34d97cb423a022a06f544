The legendary radio host Bob Mabena is still struggling to get his number back. This was after the presenter shared on his Twitter page that he was hacked on Wednesday. The tweet read: “Hello friends. My cell number has been hacked and the thugs are asking for donations claiming that I am in trouble. Pls ignore. I am fixing the problem.” The 51-year-old told Daily Sun: “I still don’t have my number back. Busy porting it back to my original service provider. How I found out was when I saw a message informing me that my porting request had been successful.” He said that he is worried because he had not asked for one. “I tried to call from my phone and I could not use it. I tried to text and WhatsApp and I still could not use it. And then it all started. I got calls from lots of my contacts asking if I was OK and why I would need R1 500,” he said. Bob said that’s when he knew that his number had been hijacked. “This all took less than 24 hours. I have done all the necessary things like talk to my contacts, my service providers, etc,” he said. Many of his followers shared that they had experienced the same thing before.
