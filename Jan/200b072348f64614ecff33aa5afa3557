THE family of Philasande Gcwabaza (20) from Gcwabaza, Pietermaritzburg, believe death was calling him. While swimming with younger relatives, Philasande drowned at Salt Rock Beach near Ballito on Thursday. His madala, Sphiwe Gcwabaza (61), said they were accompanying their gogo to work. “They asked her if they could go and swim and pleaded with her until she agreed. “If he hadn’t gone, he’d still be alive. It was as if death was calling him.” “Their gogo told them to swim for 20 minutes and come back. But one of the boys came to tell her that Philasande had drowned.” The gogo and the boy went to the seashore where lifeguards and authorities were searching for Philasande. “He was only found two hours later. He was already dead,” said Sphiwe. He said they were all saddened by his death. “We were expecting a lot from him,” he said. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said: “I, on behalf of the department, wish to send our deepest condolences.” IPSS Medical Rescue spokesman Paul Herbst said: “Paramedics and crews tried to resuscitate him, but the efforts were unsuccessful.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
