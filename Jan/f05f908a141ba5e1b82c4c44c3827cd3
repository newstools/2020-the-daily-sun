Kaizer Chief’s striker, Dumisani Zuma, has won the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month for November. Zuma’s lovely goal was one of two he scored in Amakhosi’s 2-0 win over Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The 24-year-old picked the ball up around the edge of the 18-yard area, beat two Chippa defenders and coolly slotted the ball home. Orlando Pirates duo Vincent Pule and Gabadinho Mhango as well as Andile Jali of Mamelodi Sundowns made it a close race, however, Zuma’s goal was picked ahead of theirs. Zuma has been one of Chiefs’ key players this season in their quest for Absa Premiership glory. He has scored three goals and provided one assist in the league to help Amakhosi open a nine point gap at the summit.
