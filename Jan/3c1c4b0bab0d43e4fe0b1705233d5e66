ATTENDING
school six days a week has finally paid off for these matrics at Tsogo
Secondary School in Mmakau! Pupils went
to the school to get their results with their parents on Wednesday. The school
principal, Matshepo Makgale, said they received a 96.7% pass rate and 82 of the
learners passed with bachelors. Matshepo said
she was happy, but was gunning for a 100% pass. “I am
satisfied with the results and we will apply a better strategy next year. “We don’t
want to disappoint the parents because they also support their children at all
times,” she said. One of the
pupils, Tshepang Pule (18), who managed to get six distinctions said he wanted
to get seven distinctions. “I am
relieved because I really wanted to get distinctions on all the subjects,” he
said.  A very
emotional parent, Stephinah Swaratlhe (38) said she was overwhelmed with her
son, Otsile (19) Swaratlhe’s results. “He
received one distinction and that makes me happy. “I am an
unemployed single parent and whatever the situation that we had at home,
Otsile, managed to pass like this. “I am
proud,” she said.  She said
she couldn’t sleep the previous night thinking about the outcome. “I can’t
stop crying because I was selling Kotas so that my son can become a better
person growing up and I am sure he is going to change our lives,” she said. Otsile said
he had mixed feelings. “It is a bittersweet
experience, I wasn’t expecting time would travel so fast, just yesterday I was
starting with school and today here I am going to university soon,” he said.
