ELDERS used to complain men no longer wanted to help close graves at funerals, so Pitso Maleka came up with a solution. The 43-year-old from White City, Soweto, said he started his business in 2003 after he’d left behind a life of crime and had nothing to do.  “Of course I’ve had ups and downs like any business, but I don’t have competition. Some guys tried to get into the business, but didn’t even last a year. “Today I cover more than 200 funerals in a week,” said Pitso.   He told Daily Sun he’s built solid foundations with undertakers, some of whom he’s worked with for more than 15 years. Pitso said he has 12 branches in various provinces and employs 970 people. “All I knew was that I needed manpower,” said Pitso. “I recently met an old man in the construction business, who told me he’d been watching me. “He said he’d been observing my dedication for years and that I’d been doing it on my own without any financial help from anyone. “He said I shouldn’t take it for granted because I’m helping to feed families by growing my business and employing more men.” Pitso said he was no different from his employees and worked with them. “I don’t care if it’s a high-profile funeral. I’m there to work with my team. If I’m lucky to make contacts that day, they’ll see I’m a team player and respect what I do,” Pitso said.
