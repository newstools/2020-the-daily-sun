The poster boy of South African tennis Kevin Anderson is in the country to promote the game. Anderson, who is based in the United States, arrived on Friday from Australia, ahead of his exhibition match against SA rising star Lloyd Harris at the Arthur Ash Tennis Centre in Jabavu, Soweto. The eagerly awaited match that will see an established star face off against a rising star, will be played at the home of SA tennis in the heart of Soweto at 2pm. Anderson (33), is in Mzansi as part of his ambassadorial role for banking giants BNP Paribas. The Arthur Ash Centre is a hype of activity as it is hosting the Rising star Tennis competition where more 500 primary schools from all over the country are competing for top honours. Last year July, BNP Paribas bank launched a grassroots development program in partnership with Tennis SA (TSA) to sponsor a competition that involves Primary Schools in South Africa. Anderson was unveiled as its ambassador. But he was unable to attend the event due to his hectic schedule. But today, the most prominent SA tennis player, finally graced Soweto tennis centre and he will play at a packed Arthur Ash for the first time after many years. Anderson and Harris took pictures and conducted coaching clinics with excited aspiring tennis players from all over the country. Anderson said: “I’m here as part of ploughing back to the community and to help grow the game from grassroots level. I’m excited to be on board as an ambassador. "We don’t have a lot of players at the top level from SA and hopefully this initiative will produce future stars. "We are here to influence the kids to dream of being professional players.” BNP Paris is a global banking giant that services 80 countries around the world and has been sponsoring tennis events for the past 46 years such as the US Open, Masters and wheelchair tennis. Their partnership with TSA started back in 2012 and they have made a commitment to grow the sport in South Africa for many years to come.
