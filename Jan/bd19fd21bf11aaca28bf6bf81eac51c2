Current Absa Premiership log leaders, Kaizer Chiefs have claimed the second quarter of the 2019/20 Absa Premiership Q-Innovation. This is the second successive Q-Innovation victory for Chiefs in the 2019-20 season. Chiefs won Quarter Two with 16 points from seven fixtures. Going to the previous weekend, Bidvest Wits were the only side that stood a realistic chance of upsetting Chiefs’ party but their 0-2 loss to Cape Town City on Saturday night ended their Q2 aspirations and paved a way for Amakhosi to claim top prize. Before this season kicked-off in August 2019, the Naturena lads had not won a Quarter since 2014-15 season – which happened to be the last time Amakhosi claimed the Absa Premiership title. Each side that win a Quarter gets R1,5 million in prize money. Quarter One (8 Fixtures), Quarter Two (7 Fixtures), Quarter Three (8 Fixtures), Quarter Four (7 Fixtures). Mamelodi Sundowns finished second on the Quarter Two log standings with 14 points from seven fixtures. Bidvest Wits, who came in third, also had 14 points – but scored fewer goals than Sundowns. Chippa United, who have been re birthed under Zimbabwean coach Norman Mapeza, were fourth with 13 points.
