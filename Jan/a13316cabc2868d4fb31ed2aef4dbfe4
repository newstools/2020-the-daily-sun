SENIOR National Freedom Party (NFP) leader Bhungu Gwala has
dumped the party and joined newly formed Abantu-Batho Congress (ABC). Gwala and former provincial executive committee member Bonga
Nzuza were formally introduced during a media briefing in Durban. The party was formed two weeks ago by former NFP councillor
Philani Mavundla. On Thursday, Gwala told Daily Sun he decided to leave NFP
and join Mavundla’s party as he was among the people who approached Mavundla to
join NFP from the ANC. He said he felt he should move on and focus on a new
journey. “I couldn’t take it anymore. Whenever I saw NFP members, I
was asked about court cases and not when the party launched more branches. “We came to realise that NFP president Zanele Magwaza-Msibi
was being used by other people who have no interest in the party,” said Gwala. Nzuza shared Gwala’s sentiments and said he was also tired
of spending time in court and not on the ground working for the people. Mavundla said his passion to help people inspired him to
form the party. He said it was the same reason he named it Abantu-Batho
Congress. NFP secretary-general Canaan Mdletshe said the leaving of
Gwala and other leaders was good riddance as they didn’t do anything for the
party. He said they came for positions and decided to leave when
they didn’t get them.
