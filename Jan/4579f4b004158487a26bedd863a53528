The festive season is something of the past but the spirit of giving is still with DJ Tira. The South African DJ, whose real name is Mthokozi Khathi, wants to lend a helping hand to his followers. He said, “anything is still possible". As we have entered the new decade, most celebraties are taking a break and rejuvenating from the December festivities but the Afrotainment boss is out and about, making people's wishes come true. The Malume hitmaker has taken to social media to ask users how he can assist them. “Kusengenzeka noma yini.... how can i help you?” he wrote. DJ Tira was flooded by responses, with people asking for employment, assistance in paying fees, record deals, and many more. The star has responded to a few and committed to helping them. Nokwanda Mkhize who has been volunteering at Gagasi FM reached out to ‘Malume’, asking for a paying job and Tira did not disappoint.  The DJ has committed to helping her! Giving is the key to prosperity, success, and fulfillment, if he carries on like this he will surely be blessed abundantly.
