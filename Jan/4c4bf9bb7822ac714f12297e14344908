Minenhle said she ran into problems when she went to see a nurse in the consultation room. After telling the nurse she had been suffering from breast pain since she was diagnosed with breast cancer in August, the nurse asked if she used condoms. “I told the nurse I sometimes do and sometimes don’t. I was being honest, especially since I’m sick,” she said. Minenhle told the SunTeam the nurse told her she would have to undergo an HIV test. “I told her I was afraid of needles. She then chased me away, saying I was wasting her time,” she said. Minenhle said she ended up leaving without help.
