HUNDREDS of mourners gathered at the Communio Church in Mbombela, Mpumalanga yesterday to pay tribute to the eldest daughter of Pinky and Mathews Phosa, Moyahabo Phosa (39). Moya died on Monday after a long illness. READ: SHAUWN’S SECRET OUT! Among the mourners were Deputy President David Mabuza, EFF leader Julius Malema, Graca Machel and Judge President Francis Legodi. Mabuza said Moya was an inquisitive child and she would listen to what he and Phosa were discussing while Phosa was still premier and he was education MEC. “She came to me and said she didn’t like that people were saying there was bad blood between her father and me,” he said. “I told her there was no bad blood between us.” Malema said Mathews supported many of them when it wasn’t fashionable. “We were with comrade Mathews when he turned 60 and it was nice. We should be with him when it’s not so nice,” Malema said. He said some people loved others when they were in power but erased the pictures when they were not. “I am not that type.” Machel said the family and the people of Mozambique shared in their loss. “May I suggest that you choose a star for Moya and any time your longing becomes deep, look up at that star as it will bring light when it is dark,” she said.

Now this day has come. I will never forget how she taught me that life was tough.” Moya will be buried on Saturday in Limpopo.
