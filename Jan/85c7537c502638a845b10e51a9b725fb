The Vrrr
Pha phrase is well know in South Africa even kids and gogos know it. A video of what
seems like a Golf 6R has surfaced on social media, sounding like an AK47 on
steroid. The
Japanese sports cars like the Nissan Skyline R34 or Toyota Supras are popular
for doing such stunts, but this Golf sounds like a net level Vrrr Pha.
