The Police in Thohoyandou have opened an inquest docket after
burnt and lifeless bodies of a 35-year-old mother and her 4-year-old son were
found near a graveyard in Ha-Budeli village outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the
bodies were discovered by the passer-by who then called the police. On arrival at the scene, the police found the two bodies
and immediately commenced with initial investigations. The remnant of a flammable substance and a box of matches
were also found next to the bodies. A suicide note was also found during further
investigations. The police are investigating the possibility that the
woman might have taken the 4-year-old child to the area next to graveyard,
doused him with a flammable substance and set him alight and then did the same
to herself. The Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo Lieutenant General
Nneke Ledwaba has once again condemned the violent nature in which some people
seem to be inclined to when dealing with domestic or relationship challenges. Police investigations are continuing.
