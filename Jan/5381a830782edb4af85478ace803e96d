They had received a tip-off about a fight between two herdsmen in the Stinkwater bush that happened in October. According to Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo, a witness had said the herdsmen were fighting over the number of cattle allocated to them. One of them apparently died during the fight and his body was buried in the bush. He said the witness reported the incident to a cop who lives in Stinkwater. “Police went for a pointing out and the dead man was found buried in a shallow grave,” he said. A 40-year-old suspect was arrested. Both the suspect and the dead man were apparently from Lesotho. The herdsman’s body had been taken to the government mortuary. A post mortem would be done to establish how the man had died. Masondo said: “It’s difficult to identify the injuries as the body is in a bad state. “The dead man has still not been identified. It’s only known that he was from Lesotho.” READ: ZUMA VISITS CAPITEC BRANCH WITH DUDU MYENI The suspect would be charged with murder and appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court for a bail application. Stinkwater resident Nthabiseng Tladi said it was terrifying to see the length people would go to feed their greed. “Killing a person for riches and then going as far as burying their body is evil,” she said.
