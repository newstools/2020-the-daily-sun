RESIDENTS of Olievenhoutbosch went on a rampage on Wednesday night. They blocked roads in the Tshwane kasi with burning tyres and logs, and attacked the local police station, injuring a policewoman. READ: I CAN’T KEEP A MAN! Resident Mmapula Maphotho (45) said although she didn’t support the attack on the cop shop, the police needed to pull up their socks. She claimed thugs in their area feared nothing. “They break into people’s homes in broad daylight,” she said. Michael Mbuyane said crime was out of control in the kasi. “It’s hard to find a person in Olievenhoutbosch who hasn’t been a crime victim,” he said. National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the residents started protesting over the high crime rate outside the police station on Tuesday. “Crime is never solely a policing problem. There are multiple underlying factors that contribute to crime and the police cannot solely be blamed for crime in the area,” he said. READ: WATCH: PERVERT PASTOR BUST! Naidoo said at about 9pm on Wednesday, the residents started pelting the station with stones, damaging a window and injuring an officer in the process. Her elbow was hit by a brick. Naidoo said the residents returned to the police station yesterday morning where Tshwane district commissioner Major-General Daniel Mthombeni addressed them. “We call on the community to remain calm and co-operate with us to tell us exactly what their problems are,” said Naidoo. He said no arrests had been made.
