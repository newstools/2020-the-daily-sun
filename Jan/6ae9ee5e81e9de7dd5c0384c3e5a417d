When Kaizer Chiefs founder and chairman, Kaizer Motaung, started the club 1970, he did not have the slightest idea that it would one day turn into the juggernaut it is today. Amakhosi, who are celebrating 50 years of existence this month, have become one of the biggest and most successful clubs on the African continent. Motaung, who broke away from Orlando Pirates and formed the club back in the 70s, described how that all came about and all the challenges they faced. “It was not a breakaway as people say,” Motaung insists. “My role was to bring people together and to resolve the issue I found at the club when I returned from Atlanta in the US. A lot of the guys had been expelled for things that were not too serious. Through the advise of people like Bra Les Sehume (sports editor of The World) I decided instead of getting involved in the dispute, we started organising friendly matches, thinking that will heal the squabbles. “We did not have any inkling. We started very small but the ambition was there. But we also wanted to make a mark in the country and in the continent. When we were playing friendlies around the country, we were recruiting players and I was funding the whole thing with the help of other guys like Ewert “The Lip” Nene. Having played in the US helped me with the knowledge as to how things were done. The experience from overseas taught me that we had huge talent but we were constricted by apartheid.
