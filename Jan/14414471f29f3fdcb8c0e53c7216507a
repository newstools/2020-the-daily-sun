Orlando Pirates head coach Josef Zinnbauer admits he was impressed that his side started so strongly in the 3-1 victory over Highlands Park. All three of the Buccanneers' goals came in the first half, with the first two coming in the opening 11 minutes, as Zinnbauer extended his unbeaten record at the helm to five matches. “Yes, we started good in the match. I was very surprised. We improved. We’re happy now (that we’ve) won the next game," Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV. "Now it’s time for regeneration and then the next game is coming." The Soweto giants face AmaZulu in their next game next Saturday and are now level on points with fourth-placed Bidvest Wits, who have a superior goal difference. Bongani Sam, who has enjoyed precious little game time since making the move from Bloemfontein Celtic at the beginning of the season, received praise from the German tactician after he was handed a surprise start. Bongani Sam, who has seen very little game-time after arriving at the start of the season, was given a surprise start by Zinnbauer who lauded the player’s display. “Sam made a good game. It’s not so easy I think to come in the team, in the starting line-up. I think it was not so easy for him. It was a long time ago, it’s the first game that he is playing now,” added Zinnbauer. SPORT24
