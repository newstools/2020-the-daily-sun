THE head pastor of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church’s branch in George in the Western Cape has been suspended. Pastor Samuel Dulungana, from the national office of the church led by Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, yesterday announced Goodwins Mwalughali had been suspended. “The suspension is in relation to the investigation and subsequent arrest on rape charges against the pastor,” He said the church had a zero tolerance policy against gender-based violence . “We’re following this case with interest to ensure justice is done.”  Yesterday Daily Sun reported the pastor allegedly raped a woman (24) next to the pulpit and pleaded for forgiveness in a recorded phone call. She said she was dragged to a couch next to the pulpit and raped after she was invited by the pastor to attend a prayer session on 28 December. Mwalughali was bust on Friday.  In a letter to church leaders, he denied the rape, saying it was a mutual agreement. “The guilt she felt and advice from my assistant pastor and wife led to the rape case,” he said. CRL Rights Commission chairman David Mosoma said the church’s response was appropriate. “They aren’t defending the pastor. This is what needs to happen in every church.” Not In My Name secretary-general Themba Masango said the organisation didn’t want perpetrators pretending to be pastors. “The law must take its course without any interference.”  Founder of Movement Against Abuse in Churches Solomon Ashoms said: “It shows he is not a true man of God, just like Bushiri himself, whom I consider to be a fake prophet.” Mwalughali appeared in the George Magistrates Court yesterday. His case was postponed to Monday. On Sunday night, the church was set alight. An arson docket has been opened but no arrest has been made.
