BULELANI Majeke (35) wants his attacker to pay for what he did. Over the weekend, Bulelani from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, was called a moffie at a local shebeen and attacked. “I asked him why he was calling me that. He said he wasn’t referring to me,” Bulelani told Daily Sun. “I said, ‘you said it after seeing me’. I told him I wanted to teach him a lesson. He hit me with an empty Castle Lite bottle.” He had merely wanted to tell him off so he wouldn’t victimise gays again. He was bashed on the head and face and fell. He reported the attack to cops, and they took him to the hospital to get stitches. “I went back to the tavern with detectives, and they arrested him.” WATCH: MAYOR MOERS FAMILY MEMBERS! Bulelani and the suspect live in the same area. “I want the courts to teach him a lesson so he doesn’t call people moffies and beats them up again.” Colonel Andre Traut said: “The case was reported and a 26-year-old bust. He appeared in court on Tuesday.”
