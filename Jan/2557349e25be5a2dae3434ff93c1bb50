ORLANDO Pirates supporters are curious to find out as to why recently-demoted coach Rhulani Mokwena was not on the bench when they drew 1-1 with Bloem Celtic on Saturday afternoon. Fadlu Davids lined-up alongside head coach Josef Zinnbauer at the Dr Molemela Stadium. Pirates opened the scoring via Gabadinho Mhango in the 14th minute. Sphelele Ntuli equalised with what will be a contender for Goal of the Season. Pirates are now on 21 points after 15 match and their fans will be eager to know why Mokwena was not part of the team.
