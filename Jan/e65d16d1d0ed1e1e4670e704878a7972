THE social development department has opened its gender-based violence command centre to those who’re anxious about their matric results. The department said as the class of 2019 receive their results on Wednesday, depression and suicide rates were likely to rise. Spokeswoman Lumka Olifant urged matrics and their parents to make use of the centre to receive counselling and support from social workers. She appealed to parents to look out for signs of depression. “The command centre can be reached toll free on 0800 428 428. Callers can request a social worker to contact them by dialling *120*7867# for free from any phone.” She said deaf callers could contact the centre over Skype. “They must just add ‘HELPMEGBV’ to their contacts and a social worker will accept the invite and call them back,” she said. Olifant said grant beneficiaries would no longer be means tested by NSFAS when they applied for financial assistance. The department reminded all matrics to not abuse substances after receiving results. “It’s also important to remind candidates that don’t succeed that the basic education department’s second chance matric support programme is available to give pupils the second opportunity to sit for exams.” Meanwhile, Umalusi has approved the exam results. Speaking in Tshwane on Friday, CEO Mafu Rakometsi said there had not even been question paper leaks. But it raised concerns about the drop in candidate numbers in mathematics and the increase in maths literacy candidates. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is due to announce the national results tomorrow and individual results will be available the next day. Spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said: “We’re meeting with Umalusi for the final meeting and will be in a position to continue with the printing of the statement of results.”
