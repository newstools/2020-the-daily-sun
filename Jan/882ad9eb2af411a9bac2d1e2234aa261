Eskom says that stage 2 load shedding will continue during Sunday until 5am on Monday morning. The utility announced on Saturday evening that it would have to implement stage 2 load shedding from 10pm on Saturday following an "unanticipated conveyor belt failure at Medupi power station". In an update on Sunday morning it said that while the conveyor belt had been repaired, the incident and the loss of additional generation units caused it deplete its emergency diesel and water storage levels, which it needs to restore as SA heads into the working week on Monday. A broken conveyor belt at the power plant was a major factor behind the implementation of power cuts in October. "Our teams continue to work tirelessly to return units back from planned and unplanned outages.Â  Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages," it said. "We remind customers that load shedding is an essential and controlled measure to ensure that the integrity of the grid is not compromised." In mid-December, President Cyril Ramaphosa has said that said Eskom management had given him an assurance that the utility "should not be in a position to have any form of load shedding" between December 17 and January 15, 2020. Eskom has not yet said whether it will have to institute power cuts in the week ahead.
