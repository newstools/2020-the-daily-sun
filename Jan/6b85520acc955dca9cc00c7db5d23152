IT’S a well-known fact that the Volkswagen Polo Vivo is loved by Mzansi people. But the Renault Kwid is one car that has been on the receiving end of much criticism, at some point people on social media referred to it as a car made from leftover parts. It might be a car that’s strange looking, but the sales figures sing a different tune. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) the Kwid has been receiving much love over the festive season – with over 1631 units sold, ending up in second position. The Volkswagen Polo Vivo, however, took the throne with 1779 units sold, which made it the best-selling passenger vehicle. In third came the Toyota Etios, followed by the Volkswagen Polo in the fourth position and the Toyota Corolla/Quest in the fifth position. Naamsa says the motoring industry domestic sales ended 2019 on a high note with over 41 698 units sold, recording a 4,2% compared to the total new vehicle sales of 40 020 units during the corresponding month of December 2018.
