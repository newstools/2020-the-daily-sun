IT seems
like there’s lot of Mabena’s in this country, and the just keep on disappointing
us! A video of sSAPS officials
performing a drill at the funeral of the late businessman ntate Richard Maponya
has surfaced. In the
video, the officials can be seen trying to perform the drill, however things
don’t turn out the way they wanted. Instead of
them turning in the same direction, they have a Mabena moment and two of the
face the wrong direction.
