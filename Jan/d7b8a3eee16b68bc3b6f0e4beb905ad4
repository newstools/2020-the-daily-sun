MANWADU Tshilidzi got the honour of eating breakfast with Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. The 16-year-old former pupil of Mbilwi Secondary School in Sibasa, Limpopo, was among the top 30 achievers of last year’s matric class and got seven distinctions. Speaking to the SunTeam at a celebratory breakfast at Vodaworld in Midrand, Joburg, Manwadu said she was over the moon. She said she wanted to study to become a doctor. “It was hard work and determination that got me here. I will put the same effort into my tertiary studies and become the doctor I’ve always wanted to be,” she said. Manwadu said her matric year wasn’t easy. “I never slept. Three hours was more than enough. I chose to forget about friends a bit and focus on my studies. Friends always want to have fun but I told myself the fun can wait this year,” she said. Manwadu said she lost her father in grade 10 and he always encouraged her to work hard. “I wasn’t serious before then, but after his death, I started being serious. I wanted to make him proud,” she said. Lomso Dumezweni (18) from Nyanga High School in Ngcobo, Eastern Cape, was another top achiever. He said life had been hard since his father was retrenched in 2013. Lomso said it was then that he decided to work hard to ease the pressure at home. He told Daily Sun: “I want to continue working hard until I get what I want. I want to change the situation at my home and in the community I come from,” he said. Lomso said he woke up at 3am every day to study. “I looked like a fool at first but today, I’m the one laughing,” he said.
