THE Jeleni family apparently installed themselves as headmen and changed the name of their village in Limpopo from Makumeke to Jeleni. Chief Patrick Mavambe (49), who is responsible for the village, said the family removed the Makumeke Village sign and installed their own. “They didn’t approach the commission dealing with disputes around traditional leadership.” He said they didn’t inform the royal house of Mavambe about reclaiming the village from headman Mxadzi Maluleke. Albert Jeleni (48) said processes to reclaim their village failed and Mavambe didn’t respond to them. “The headman sells land and doesn’t respect residents. We’re standing firm and want the village back.” Albert said his family gave up their position in 1956 after his madala died and the Makumeke family took over as regents. Mxadzi (36) said the Jeleni family would do anything to gain power. “Albert Jeleni is causing problems. People removed the signs they installed.” Godfrey Baloyi said the Jelenis had divided the village. “Albert convinced people and this has pitted our people against each other.” Motupa Selomo of Limpopo Traditional Affairs said: “The headman is appointed by the chiefs. It’s their responsibility to deal with disputes.”
