Three foreign nationals have been arrested for allegedly
stealing tower batteries and cell phones. The suspects who are between the ages of 28 and 35 were
arrested in a Toyota Quantum. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they
received intel about a Quantum with a trailer carrying six occupants, that was
travelling from the Eastern Cape to Zimbabwe. “The vehicle was spotted along the R101 road at Shell garage
while refuelling and was taken to the nearby Weigh bridge to be searched,”
Mojapelo said. He said upon arrival at the weigh bridge, the Quantum was
searched and cops found two hundred and seven brand new cellphones, five tower
batteries, three solar panels and two laptops to the value of R900 000 that
were concealed inside a trailer with luggage.  Mojapelo said the occupants could not disclose the origin of
the items and did not have the receipts. Cops confiscated the stolen items including the Quantum and the
trailer. The other three occupants were reportedly released because
they were just passengers travelling home and could not be linked to the stolen
items. The suspects are expected to appear in Polokwane magistrate
court soon.
