THE case of murdered businessman Wandile Bozwana has been postponed. Gauteng North High Court in Tshwane has decided the case will return to court on 27 July. Bozwana was allegedly killed by feared Mamelodi businessman Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela and his accomplices. Khekhe remains in jail since his R50 000 bail was withdrawn after he was accused of leaving the country for Mauritius. Police bust him while he was apparently preparing to go to Dubai. After Bozwana’s murder in October 2015, the case has had several delays. Heavily armed police were seen inside and outside the courtroom as Mathibela and his co-accused Sipho Hudla (34), Matamela Mutapa (40) and Bongani Khumalo (36) appeared on Friday. The case was postponed so both the prosecution and defence could prepare their cases for closing arguments. Last year, the court completed a trial-within-a-trial over the admissibility of pointing out suspects and confessions. This included CCTV footage that allegedly showed the accused and Mathibela committing the crime. His instructing attorney, Solomon Mkhabela, disputed the content of the footage allegedly showing Mathibela pointing at people. This year, the court will decide if alleged confessions by Mathibela’s co-accused would be used in the main trial. Mkhabela said Mathibela never made any confession.
