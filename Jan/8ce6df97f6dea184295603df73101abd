Seasoned comedian Mojak Lehoko is getting his bag of funny tricks ready for the upcoming Cape Town Comedy Festival. The Joburg-based funnyman has come a long way since performing at Cool Runnings in Melville, Joburg, where he built a name for himself and was subsequently nominated for a Comic’s Choice Award. “The performance will take the form of commentary and bouncing jokes between us and also teasing the audience,” he said. The name of the show is titled Bafunny Bafunny, which sees international comedians including Alonso Bodden and Stuart Goldsmith in a comic frenzy against some of Mzansi’s finest such as Loyiso Gola and Mo Mothibe. “We did a similar setup in New York last year so it will be interesting to see how the local audience will receive it.” The dynamic stand-up comedian said he would also like to be more involved in work behind the scenes. “I want to produce more stand-up shows and be more active in the film space, and I am hoping that the South African comedy scene continues to grow,” he added.
