A COP’S 4-5 has left many women across Mzansi curious and excited. A photo of the cop was posted on Twitter on Monday evening, where the shape of his 4-5 could be seen through his trousers. Now the ladies are looking for the cop and want to test if the 4-5 is as good as it looks. “More cops should show more of these so the country will be at peace. “If we have more of these, I promise you, there won’t be any crime from women. Mzansi women will behave super well,” she tweeted. But Mzansi men had a different view. “He probably inserted a banana or huge carrot in there and our girlfriends are getting fooled. He needs to be disciplined. You can’t post such and get away with it. He’s a police officer. He needs to be appropriate every single time,” he said.
