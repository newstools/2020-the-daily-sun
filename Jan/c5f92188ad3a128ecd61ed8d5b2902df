WE ALL know that when schools re-open, there is always total chaos on our roads. And the Automobile Association (AA) shares a few tips to remind everyone using public roads to be extra-careful. Said the AA in a statement: “While government has a major role to play in making our roads safer, motorists also have an equally important role to play. “In addition to ensuring that all roads are safe, motorists are encouraged to set good examples for the next generation of road users.” The AA also urges all motorists out there to play a role in making Mzansi roads safer for all. In addition, the association stressed the need to understand the importance of putting safety first.
