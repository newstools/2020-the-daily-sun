THE legendary boxer who used to inject fear into the hearts of his opponents has hung up his gloves forever. Peter “Terror” Mathebula (68) died at Leratong Hospital in Kagiso, Mogale City, on Saturday night. The family confirmed his death to Daily Sun yesterday. His heartbroken wife, Emma, said she had lost a great friend. She said: “I feel like I’m alone in the world right now. He was my close friend. In fact, he was everything to me. He suffered a lot when he was sick. “I could see he was really in deep pain. I went through every step with him as he went in and out of hospital. “I will miss him dearly, but there is nothing I can do because it’s God’s will.” The People’s Paper found the family huddled together at their home in Mohlakeng near Randfontein, still trying to digest their loss. His mum Magdeline said although her son was sick, she did not expect to bury him. “God does His things His own way. There’s nothing we can do. I was hoping he will bury me, rather than the other way round,” she said. Terror’s sister, Dianah Tlhale, said her brother was a loving person who loved joking with everybody. “He loved jokes so much that he even made everyone laugh in hospital. My brother and his wife were so much in love. It was a marvel to witness their love,” said Dianah. One of the famous moments in Terror’s career was when he made history in 1980 by becoming the first black world champion after snatching the WBA title in the United States. The family will announce funeral arrangements during the week.
