NOXOLO Tlanya (57) was on her way to the church service, but it turned into a trip to hell! Gogo Noxolo was walking with four kids to church in Houtkop, Vereeniging, on Sunday when they came across four monkeys. One of the monkeys bit her on the right leg.  “They came out of the yard and headed for the children,” she said. She went to the gate to ring the bell so the owners could come and get their monkeys.

A woman came from the yard, holding a stick and looking as if she was also scared. “She said she had also been bitten by the same monkeys. They apparently belong to her daughter-in-law.” Noxolo said the woman took her to hospital but never apologised for what the monkeys did. “The only thing she said to me was ‘please don’t sue us’.” After leaving the hospital, Noxolo was advised to go to the police station but was sent away. “They told me I must go to the SPCA because those are wild animals, despite me telling them they belonged to someone.” Yesterday, a taximan referred her to the Vereeniging cluster, which called the station and told them they should help Noxolo open a case. She wanted the monkeys to be locked up permanently or taken from the owners for the safety of her children and other people.

At time of going to print, she was still trying to open a case. A Vereeniging SPCA official didn’t know anything about the case as the police hadn’t approached him. The owner of the animals’ phone rang answered. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters advised Noxolo to open a case of keeping of vicious animals.
