DESPITE his stellar form this season, Maritzburg United’s young centre back Rushine De Reuck is not yet ready to play for Bafana Bafana. This is according to his coach Eric Tinkler, who insists that although De Reuck has grown in leaps and bounds, he still has “quite a bit to learn” before he can don the national team jersey. The 23-year-old from Kleinfontein in Cape Town has been a revelation for the Team of Choice this season, putting in a string of fine performances. He was one of the key performers in United’s impressive Telkom Knockout run which ended in a heart-breaking 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns in the final. Tinkler is convinced that De Reuck has a bright future ahead of him and will be a big player for Bafana in the next few years, however, for the time being, he needs to focus on improving his all-round game. “I think it’s still a bit early to talk about the national team,” said Tinkler. “He still needs to grow a little bit. He still needs to be pushed a little bit in certain areas of his game. But is he knocking on the door there? I definitely think so. I look at the options that are currently there and he’s the future. He’s only 23, he is one for the future, definitely.” De Reuck, according to Tinkler, showed just how much more he still needs to learn in United’s hard-fought 2-2 draw against SuperSport United in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday. “That was his worst performance for us,” said Tinkler. “I’m being brutally honest with you, I thought he struggled against Bradley (Grobler) but I know he’s better than what he was against SuperSport. We are 16 games into the league, he’s entitled to one bad game. But we know his quality.” De Reuck’s impressive performances this season have led to the KwaZulu-Natal outfit tying down the youngster to a fresh four year contract to keep other teams from snatching their prized asset. “They can sniff around all they want, he’s not going anywhere,” Tinkler insists. “He’s got a four-year contract. Tough.”
