PREMIER Stan Mathabatha yesterday visited ANC supporters who survived a horror crash on Saturday. Five women including the driver were killed and 16 passengers were injured when a bus they were travelling in overturned at Ga-Sekgopo Village, 80km from Polokwane, on Saturday. The ANC supporters were on their way to the party’s 108th birthday celebrations in Tzaneen. All the injured were rushed to Mokopane Hospital. Three of the injured have since been discharged. Mathabatha, accompanied by a number of MECs, said all the remaining 13 patients were in a satisfactory condition. “We’ve already met all the relevant departments regarding this matter. We’ll await the Department of Transport to finalise its investigation into the accidents,” he said. “We have people from the Road Accident Fund here to help bereaved families with burial arrangements. We’ll attend the deceased’s funerals on Saturday.” Survivor Welheminah Matlou (32) described how the horrific accident took place. “I heard the bus driver telling someone the brakes had failed. “The bus started swerving from side to side before it overturned. “I saw someone’s brains landing on my shoes. “I’m still traumatised by that accident. I’m still shocked by what I witnessed on the day.”
