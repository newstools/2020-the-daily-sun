MATHEWS Phosa and his family decided to keep their late daughter’s illness private as she was getting the best medical care and they felt it was a personal matter. The former Mpumalanga premier’s eldest daughter, Moyahabo Phosa (39), died on Monday at Nelspruit Mediclinic after a long illness. Her sister, Tshepiso Phosa (28), told Daily Sun her sister was admitted to hospital in September. She recovered but was readmitted on 5 January. “The dialyses had affected her health and she couldn’t fight any longer,” said Tshepiso. “Her body was not strong but she fought for a very long time. She started treatment two years ago.” Tshepiso said she had to cancel her flight to Port Elizabeth after she received a call from her mother Pinky, informing her Moya’s heart was beating slowly and she was not responding to the dialysis machine.  “I last saw her on Saturday evening. It was the first time she didn’t recognise me. Even though she was sick, she’d always recognised me. That’s when I knew something was seriously wrong. She was in a lot of pain,” she said. Tshepiso said she’d remember her sister for the way she taught her how to plan her life on a personal, school and career level. “I miss how she used to calm me down. I miss how she was a loyal person to me and trusting.” Her memorial service will be held tomorrow at Nelspruit Communion Church and her funeral will be held in Pholeni, Limpopo.
