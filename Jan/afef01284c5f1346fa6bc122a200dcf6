Former Dbn Nyts member, Lwazi "Slozet" Yokwana says the group died when he and Samkele Maphumulo left. This comes after Sunday Sun reported about Cebo Ngcobo leaving the group. Cebo apparently left because of the arrogant attitudes of band members Wandile “Choco” Tshabalala and Kabelo “Kaybee” Masenjane. He said he was done being disrespected and controlled. On Sunday, Slozet posted on Facebook saying Dbn Nyts was done and had been since he and Samkele left the group.

Cebo told Sunday Sunthings had been bad in the group but became worse when he lost his car and Choco and Kaybee made a jokeof it. “I lost my car last year and became the joke of the group.That hurt me because we come from different families and I have more financial responsibilities, but they saw my loss as a joke and mocked me for using taxis. But the main reason for leaving was when we lost respect for the music and each other. This year, I want to go my separate way and start afresh with my career.”
