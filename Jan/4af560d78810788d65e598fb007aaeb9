NEARLY a year after Matwetwe actor Sibusiso Khwinana (25) was murdered, his alleged murderer will finally stand trial. The trial of Julius Lucas (35) will start in the North Gauteng High Court tomorrow. Lucas allegedly stabbed Khwinana to death during a robbery at Sterland Mall in Arcadia, Tshwane, in March last year. He appeared in court briefly yesterday, but the case was postponed to tomorrow to allow the court to obtain the services of a Swahili interpreter. The start of the trial was previously delayed to secure Lucas legal representation. He previously made use of a private lawyer. But after the case was transferred to the high court for trial it was revealed he would have to apply for legal aid. Sibusiso’s father, Nelson, said the family wanted justice and would accept nothing less than a life sentence. He said Tebatso Mashishi, Kwinana’s Matwetwe co-star, was still struggling to come to terms with his friend’s death. “Tebatso is not coping as they were together when it happened. He was with him until the paramedics arrived,” Nelson said. Sibusiso and Tebatso were at the corner of Pretorius Street and Steve Biko Road when Lucas allegedly accosted Sibusiso and demanded his cellphone. Sibusiso was allegedly stabbed during a tussle.– NEWS24
