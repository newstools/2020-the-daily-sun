FOLLOWING allegations of nepotism
and corruption at the Polokwane municipality in Limpopo, SANCO members blocked
the municipal entrances. On Monday members of the
communities, rate payers and job applicants who were not hired were called by
EFF and SANCO to the municipality to seek answers to stop the appointment
processes. There are allegations that family
members and friends of those close to the municipal leadership were hired. EFF Chairman in Limpopo Jossey
Buthane says the appointments of the employees at the municipality must not be
according to party faction lines, but for all those who applied. He said their visit to the
municipality was to get to the bottom of the allegations which ate shocking. "It is not only the members of
a certain party faction that get hungry. There are lot of people who need jobs
irrespective of their political affiliation. “The resources in this municipality
does not belong to the party or Thembi Nkadimeng as the Mayor, they belong to
the people of Polokwane. “We can't allow our people to be side-lined
because they are not into a certain faction," said Buthane. After meeting with municipal
management, Buthane said there must be a formal investigation into the
municipal matter. "We have agreed that
Cooperative Governance Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs must start
with the forensic investigation within 14 days. This municipality is corrupt to
the core. Next week Friday we will be marching to this municipality to root out
corruption. “We are going to apply for this
march and we want to get the list of those who have applied for the houses and
never get them. We want to see the municipal database and fix this
problem," said Buthane. Municipal Spokesman Thipa Selala said
the municipality will compile a report after meeting all stakeholders and complainants
about the allegations.
