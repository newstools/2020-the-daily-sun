American actor, writer, producer, and director Tyler Perry has revealed that he does not have a writers room. He shared that he writes his own shows. Tyler shared a video on Instagram showing a pile of scripts. In the video, he says: “I don’t know if you know this but all shows on television have a writers room and most of the time there are 10 people, 12, whatever that write on these television shows, I have no writers room. Nobody writes any of my work. I write it all. “I wrote all of these scripts by myself in 2019. What’s my point? Work ethics,” he added. WORK ETHIC!! Come on. Let’s go get 2020!!!
