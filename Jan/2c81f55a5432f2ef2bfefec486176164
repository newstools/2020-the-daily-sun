SAA, the embattled national airline, seems to be in its
death throes.  Although no official announcement has been made, indications
are that government could finally jettison the entity, which has suffered
losses of more than R30bn over the past 13 years.  SAA was established in 1934 and will be 86 years old on
February 1. It is one of the oldest commercial airlines in the world.  In the strongest indication yet that the flag carrier will
soon cease to exist in its current form, the airline has put nine of its
airplanes up for sale, including Airbus passenger planes used on long-haul
flights. According to Business Insider, some of the planes are used on busy
international routes, including Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Munich and Perth.  National Treasury has also not yet provided bridging finance
of R2bn the company needs to continue its operations. Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni on Thursday morning did not want to commit government to the airline’s
future, saying everyone should “keep their fingers crossed” while Treasury
looks for funding.  SAA needs the bridging finance by January 18 – that is,
Saturday. If it cannot secure financing by then, the airline will have to cease
operations. Government will also have to take an immediate decision on the
company’s future on that date, including the form SAA’s winding down will take.  Indications are also that should SAA be forced to cease
operations, in line with the laws and regulations guiding business rescue, that
Mango – SAA’s low-cost subsidiary – will continue to service the main domestic
routes. SAA will immediately stop flying to domestic destinations.  https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/saa-in-death-throes-as-weekend-deadline-for-its-survival-looms-20200116
