EVERY year, ArbiterDJ partners with Emfuleni Municipality to give back to local communities. This year, the Now or Never community project donated 200 pairs of school shoes, stationery packs and bags to kids from Phumas’bethane in Sharpeville, Vaal. Parents accompanied their children to the handover at Nkalimeng Leutsoa Library on Tuesday. Councillor Penny Sengoatsi praised ArbiterDJ for the initiative. “We’re grateful to have a young man who cares about others and goes out of his way to help our children. His great work proves we can all contribute towards the kids’ future,” said the councillor.  ArbiterDJ, whose real name is Ramokabai Sefatsa, said pupils with worn-out school shoes or no shoes at all suffered from low self-esteem, which affected their academic performance. “We realised many children needed school shoes, with many not even going to school because they didn’t have any. “That’s why we started this project four years ago,” he said. Every December, ArbiterDJ hosts the Now or Never Music Festival in partnership with the municipality to raise funds for charity. The DJ said they decided to bring the project to Phumas’bethane after they came across a kid wearing his mum’s boots. “We were preparing for last year’s edition of the music show when we came across this young man and realised there and then we needed to help,” he said.
