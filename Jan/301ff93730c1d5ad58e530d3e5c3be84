HIGHLANDS Park have been dealt a blow after one of their goalkeepers got injured and was operated on. SunSport has learn that goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni suffered bad knee injury and he’s set to be out of action for up to four months. This will come as a huge blow for the former Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, who joined the club at the beginning of the season from Mamelodi Sundowns. He was looking for more game time when he left the star-studded Tshwane giants. Highlands official Brad Kaftel confirmed the sad news but said they were not panicking as they have enough cover. That is because veteran goalie Tapuwa Kapini has recovered from an injury that saw him miss the first half of the season. “Ngobeni injured his knee,” said Kaftel. “But we’ve got enough cover. Kapini is back from injury and we also got Marlon Heugh and Kyle Peters to choose from.” On top of Kapini, Peters and Heugh, the Tembisa-based club can also call upon former Nigeria and Moroka Swallows goalkeeper Greg Etafia, who came out of retirement during the off-season to sign for the club. Meanwhile, midfielder Makhehleni Makhaula, who picked up a serious knee injury against Orlando Pirates in the MTN8 quarter final in August, has resumed light training. He’s most likely to be back in the Starting XI before the end of the season.
