THEY say lightning never strikes the same place twice. But Bonginkosi Ndlovu (50) from Malvern, Joburg, has proven this saying wrong. He won the Checkers grocery vouchers competition for the second time. Bonginkosi first won in July 2018 but never stopped entering the competition. And he won again this year. He told Daily Sun he entered the competition for more than six years before he won in 2018. “I never skipped a week without sending my entries. It became part of my life,” he said. “I didn’t stop when I won.” Bonginkosi said he couldn’t believe it when he got a call saying he had won again. “I wasn’t expecting this second win so soon,” he said. “I thanked my God because I had been praying for a miracle. “I didn’t know how I would buy school uniform for my sister’s kids, who I’m looking after. Now that I’ve won, everything will be sorted. This is a good start to my year.” Bonginkosi said he was Daily Sun’s number one reader. “I love the People’s Paper. I enjoy reading the stories.”
