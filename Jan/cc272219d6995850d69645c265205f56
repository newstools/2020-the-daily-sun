Beyonce Knowles-Carter's highly anticipated Ivy Park Adidas collection has finally landed and fans are buying it in droves. The singer has been working tirelessly to promote the collection, which is a collaboration with Adidas. As pert of her publicity drive for her collection, the superstar gifted some of her industry peers such as singer Ciara and actress Reese Witherspoon with some Adidas regalia. Taking to her Instagram account, which has almost 200 million followers, the Lemonade singer thanked her die-hard fans for braving snowy and raining weather to purchase her collection. Wrote Beyonce: "I want to say a huge thank you to all of the incredible human beings who stood in those long lines in the snow and rain. All the beautiful people who waited in the waiting room online. All of the friends and family who took the time to film videos and dress up in the unboxing. I am humbled, grateful and proud. Y’all look so good in your IVY PARK. I love you deep. B". I want to say a huge thank you to all of the incredible human beings who stood in those long lines in the snow and rain.
