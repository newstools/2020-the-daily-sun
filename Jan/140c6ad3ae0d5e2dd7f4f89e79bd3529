After the incident, angry residents destroyed the mielies, saying they provided thugs with a place to hide. “We told these people not to plant mealies here,” said resident Sannah Mogotsi from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. “But they keep planting and we’ll carry on destroying them.”  Field owner Martha Manganye who also planted sugar beans, sweet potatoes and nuts, said they planted in rows so people could see if anyone was hiding there. “I’ve been planting here for many years. This field help us feed our families. They’re killing our business.” Resident Boas Mashego said people should force the municipality to cut the grass. The grade 12 victim said she was going to morning classes when a thug came out of the maize field.
