THE cemetery is where the dead rest peacefully. But some young couples, who don’t want to be disturbed, use cemeteries as meeting places. Daily Sun recently spotted two couples at Avalon Cemetery in Soweto. One couple sat on the grass next to a grave while the other were locked in a tight embrace. They wouldn’t speak to the SunTeam, except to say they didn’t want to be seen ekasi. “Now you as well want to bother us!” said a young man. A security guard at the cemetery told Daily Sun he often sees people chilling at the cemetery and tries to chase them away. “We failed. They told us this was the only peaceful place they could find and they were going nowhere,” she said. “We eventually stopped trying to get rid of them. They kept coming back.” She said the couples had said people ekasi thought they were being disrespectful when kissing in public, so they chose the cemetery as their lovers’ lane. “We had no choice but to leave them alone,” she said. Another security guard said couples chose Avalon because it felt like a park. “There’s green grass that’s nicely cut and trees that provide shade. It’s a nice place to chill.” But sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye said chilling at the cemetery was not a problem, as long as the lovers were not doing anything bad, such as poking. “The problem starts when the couple wants to be intimate,” he said. “That will anger the dead and bad things will happen to them.”
