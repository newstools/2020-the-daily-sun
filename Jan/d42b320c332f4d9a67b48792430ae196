AUSI Mantwa Khoza was as important to the Khozas as she was to the Orlando Pirates FC family, the EFF said on Friday. The wife of Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairperson, Irvin Khoza, reportedly died on Friday following a short illness. Conveying the party’s condolences to the Khozas, spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi wished Khoza comfort as he mourned. Said Ndlozi in a statement: “To lose a wife is to lose a life partner, a love companion and a friend. It is the end of a significant part of oneself, the end of an entire life in you. The pain Dr Khoza is going through can never be fully expressed in words. “To the children and the rest of the family: a mother is a powerful tree, providing shade of comfort in good and bad times. To lose a mother is thus one of the greatest of losses anyone can ever experience. We feel their pain and pray for great strength for them. “Finally, we express our condolences to the entire Orlando Pirates FC family, Mama was as important to them as she was to the Khoza family.” The ANC in Gauteng also conveyed its condolences to the Orlando Pirates owner and his family. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Khoza family during this difficult period.” The PSL, in a statement, said it would observe a moment of silence ahead of this weekend’s Absa Premiership, GladAfrica Championship and MultiChoice Diski Challenge fixtures. – News24
