Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa is one person who never misses a chance to honour Mzansi stars. Nathi took to social media to share a special message about two late legends, Hugh Masekela and Oliver Mtukudzi. The two music stars passed away on this day in different years. The 53-year-old from KZN shared that their legacies will continue to live with us. The tweet read: “On this day in 2018 & in 2019 the world lost two giants of African music, bra #HughMasekela & bra #OliverMtukudzi. Now reunited as brothers in the heavenly realm, we hold on to their everlasting legacies of music that knew no bounds & was the heart & soul of an Africa united.”
