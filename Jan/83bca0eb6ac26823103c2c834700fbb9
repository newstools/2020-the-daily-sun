The African National Congress (ANC) has joined millions of South Africans in wishing one of the most successful soccer outfits in the country and the continent, Kaizer Chiefs, a happy birthday as it marks its 50th golden anniversary on Tuesday. Formed during the height of apartheid in January 1970 by soccer maestro Kaizer ‘Chincha Guluva’ Motaung, the club became one of the unifying symbols that helped bring people together across racial barriers. “We pay tribute to this giant of African football club fondly known as the Phefeni Glamour Boys or Amakhosi Amahle by its passionate supporters,” read a statement from Mzansi’s governing political party. “Reaching half a century is a historical milestone which should be celebrated.  We commend Kaizer Motaung for the vision he had in setting up the football club which in many ways has been a defining feature of South African football. “As we celebrate Kaizer Chiefs’ “Golden Jubilee” we also pay tribute the club’s former and fallen soccer legends whose sterling contribution to the success of the team cannot go unnoticed.” Interestingly, the ANC will be celebrating 107 years of existence on the 08th of January, just a day after Chiefs turns 50.
