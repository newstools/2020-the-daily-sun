Police officers have seized a gold-plated AK47 and other
guns and ammunition during the arrest of an alleged "notorious" drug
kingpin in Phoenix, Durban.  Officers from various units arrested the kingpin, his wife
and another suspect at Wareham Place on Friday, said Kwazulu-Natal police
spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker.  He said they had seized two pistols, a shotgun, an automatic
rifle, five magazines, 10 cellphones, 3 digital video recorders and 287 rounds
of ammunition.  They also confiscated 12 000 heroin capsules and R19 371 in
cash. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General
Khombinkosi Jula said: "This notorious individual has been on our radar
for a while.  "We will continue to pounce on such parasites who feed
on the weak and desperate members of our society. We repeat our call for
citizens to refrain from supporting such individuals and continue to report
illegal activities to police."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pic-notorious-durban-drug-kingpin-found-with-gold-plated-ak47-20200127
