CHIPPA United head coach Norman Mapeza admitted his side were lucky to travel back to Port Elizabeth with three points after edging Black Leopards 2-1 on Wednesday night at Thohoyandou Stadium. Said Mapeza: “I think it was a good game and sometimes in football you need luck. I am happy with three points.” Leopards travel to Bloemfontein Celtic for their next league match on Sunday at Dr Molemela Stadium (3.30pm) while the Chippa host Maritzburg United tomorrow at Sisa Dukashe Stadium (3.30pm). The loss at home plunges Leopards and new coach Cavin Johnson closer to the relegation zone. Lidoda Duvha are 13th with 16 points only two points better off than bottom club Baroka who have played a match more. Johnson blamed school boy errors for the defeat. Thabo Rakhale gave the Chilli Boys the lead 30 seconds into the match. And their winner was netted in the dying seconds by Phumlani Maziya. Said a disappointed Johnson: “We were so poor. These kind of mistakes are unacceptable to me. We could have easily won this game.” Leopards players were at each other’s throats after the game with some players in tears as they could not believe they lost a game where they could have at least earned a point. “If they are fighting they should fight. “They will sort it out themselves,” said the angry Johnson. Lesedi Kapinga scored for the home side’s goal.
