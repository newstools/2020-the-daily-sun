KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has issued a “hands-off” warning to Mamelodi Sundowns over Siyabonga Ngezana. This is after the defender was linked with the Tshwane outfit. Ngezana is one of the club's prized academy assets, having come through the ranks with the likes of Happy Mashiane, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, Siphosakhe Ntiya-ntiya and Njabulo Blom. However, the 23-year-old has not been a regular feature for Amakhosi this season. He has only made six league appearances. When quizzed about him being linked with Sundowns, Middendorp said: “There’s no way Ngezana is in our plan. “He’s very much part of the plans at Kaizer Chiefs and for the future. I’m very happy to have him. “He played in Port Elizabeth (versus Chippa United). He played in the other games as well and played fantastically well. His big advantage is his age. “I think at a certain time (He will play). It is very, very crucial now. "We have other players like Happy Mashiane in the setup. Nkosingiphile Ngcobo and Njabulo Blom are not only training but are also involved with the MDC team.”
