CELEBRITY inyanga 3 Seconds has given the SABC an ultimatum. The controversial healer from Empangeni, northern KZN, has vowed to make the public broadcaster suffer if it fails to announce the summer song of the year by next Wednesday.

He’d not say what action he’d take. His threats came after the winning song was not played as usual on New Year’s Eve after SABC partner Owen Ndlovu was granted a court interdict against the annual competition. According to 3 Seconds, whose real name is Thulani Nkwanyana, many people had spent thousands of rands on airtime to vote for their favourite songs. 3 Seconds said he’d been campaigning for Ntencane to win the competition as he had influence in maskandi circles. In a video that surfaced on social media this week, Owen begs 3 Seconds not to let him suffer. The furious inyanga said: “I met Ndlovu after I’d been contacted by several people who were very angry with him. These people even threatened to take his life.
