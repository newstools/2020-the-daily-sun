Eskom has denied telling municipalities that stage 8 load
shedding is imminent, describing media articles claiming this to be "erroneous
and incorrect". In a statement on Tuesday, the power utility said that while
it has developed contingency plans for a severe supply constraints this does
not mean that it is planning to implement stage 8 load shedding, which would
see up to 8 000MW shed from the national grid. "The likelihood of reaching Stage 8 is low," it
said. The highest level of
power cuts Eskom has yet implemented is stage 6. "When Stage 6 load shedding was implemented in
December, not all metros or municipalities had published their extended load
shedding schedules," said Eskom in a statement. "The Association of
Municipal Electricity Utilities therefore engaged most of its members to
confirm their compliance to the code – i.e. whether stages 5 to 8 had been
published by those Metro’s that had not yet done so." The utility said in a separate statement that it is not
planning power cuts on Tuesday, as emergency reserves would likely be adequate
to supplement a shortfall in generation capacity on should the need arise. SOURCE: NEWS24
