Gauteng medical negligence claims have increased from R21.7
billion to nearly R29 BILLION. This has been revealed by the DA Member of Parliament, Jack
Bloom. He said this was according to the latest edition of the SA
Health Review which cites previously unpublished Treasury figures. The increase is from the 2017/18 financial year to 2018/19. Bloom said: "This is a very worrying 33% increase in
claims which now total more than half of last year’s R50.8 billion Gauteng
health budgets. Bloom said the Gauteng Health Department paid out R424
million for 54 medico-legal cases from April to September, last year. "This has crippled cash flow as law companies have
resorted to attaching the Department’s bank accounts to ensure payment,"
said Bloom. He said: "There is a terrible human cost in these
negligence cases for which no amount of money can be a real compensation. "The continuing rise in claims shows that hospital
conditions are not improving in Gauteng, which is ill-prepared for Government’s
proposed National Health Insurance," said Bloom.
