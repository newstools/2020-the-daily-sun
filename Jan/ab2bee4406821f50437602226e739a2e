A 16-year-old Grade 9 girl who was reportedly forced
into marriage in the remote rural area of Ngxangxasini, Mpindweni, in Ngcobo
has been rescued and taken to a place of safety in an undisclosed location,
Eastern Cape police have said. According to police spokesperson Brigadier
Tembinkosi Kinana, a tactical response team (TRT), Ngcobo detectives, the
Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) and the police's Mounted
Unit assisted in the operation. "This follows a bitter struggle between the
police and the community of Mpindweni, who had already mobilised in
anticipation of the arrival of the police. Despite insults and revolts by the
members of the local community, the police remained calm, but determined to
ensure that the child is rescued from the situation," Kinana said. An estimated 115 million boys and men around the
world were married as children, Unicef said on Friday in its first ever
in-depth analysis of child grooms. Of these, one in five children, or 23
million, were married before the age of 15. The girl's biological parents were summoned to the
Ngcobo police station on Wednesday to meet investigators and discuss the
child's future. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General
Liziwe Ntshinga said: "As the police in this province, we recognise the
constitutional right of people to their culture and customs, but when that
right is abused and found to be in conflict with the rights of a girl child to
education and childhood, we have an obligation to step in and rescue the
situation. And that is what we have done in this particular situation." Ntshinga warned those who were hell-bent on forcing
young children into marriage to refrain from the practice. SOURCE: NEWS24
