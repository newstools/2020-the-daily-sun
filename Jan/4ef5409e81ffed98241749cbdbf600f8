SINCE 2009, DJ Shimza’s been using his annual one-man show to bring joy and hope to kids in orphanages – and this year’s no different. With the proceeds from his Christmas show at Mehlareng Stadium, Shimza brought smiles to young pupils’ faces. He handed over 2 000 pairs of school shoes yesterday at the packed Rabasotho Community Hall in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. His one-man show usually begins with a daytime children’s charity party, and later on artists are called onto the stage to perform. The Akulalwa hitmaker, whose real name is Ashley Raphala, was accompanied by Mayor Mzwandile Masina, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and Sport, Arts and Culture MEC Mbali Hlophe.  “Nothing inspires me more than when a person like Shimza thinks of giving back to his community,” said Masina.  Pupil Ntando Ndlovu (15) told Daily Sun he was very grateful. “I hope to make my parents proud when we go back to school,” he said.  Parent Nomsa Nkuna (44) said the DJ was a role model who inspired children to do great things. Shimza told Daily Sun he was planting a seed so children would do good things in their communities one day. “I hate seeing a child going to school with broken shoes,” he said. “I believe education is the key for them to change their lives.” Shimza said he was expanding the show to other countries. “I’m in the process of hosting a show in Mozambique and another one in Portugal,” he said.
