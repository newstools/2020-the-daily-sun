A number of civilians injured during communal violence have been killed after militants attacked an ambulance carrying them to hospital. Some health workers survived the recent incident that occurred north-west of the country, where two opposing groups have been fighting. The killed civilians had been transported in an International Rescue Committee ambulance. “Aid workers and humanitarian services should never be a target, especially an ambulance carrying patients,” said Martin Omukuba, South Sudan director at the rescue committee. “There is nothing more horrific than attacking an aid vehicle that’s attempting to rush injured civilians to a hospital to save their lives,” he said. According to the committee, South Sudan remains one of the most dangerous places for aid workers, with a total of 115 killed since the outbreak of violence in December 2013. – CAJ NEWS
