 DJ and radio personality, Lerato Kganyago, has spoken out about the heartache caused by a recent break-up. Lerato took to Twitter and shared a series of tweets about the death of a four-year relationship she was in. The DJ said she would cry at work, after events and even more at home. She said she thought the man was the love of her life. One of the tweets read: "I remember doing links, playing a song, crying my life away during the song and coming back on air, laughing like nothing happened! Always wearing sunglasses in studio so your colleagues donâ€™t ask you too many questions!" It appears as if the separation cut deep. "Going to events, looking all glam, giggling with everyone, posing on the red carpet and a few hrs later getting in the car, crying like someone died before switching on that ignition, to drive back home to do more crying," read another tweet.  She said she is happy now though.
