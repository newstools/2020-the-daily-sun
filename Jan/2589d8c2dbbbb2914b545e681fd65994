ENOCH Mpianzi’s memorial service is expected to take place tomorrow. The 13-year-old’s family said the service was being organised by the Gauteng Education Department and Parktown Boys’ High, and would be held at the school. Speaking to Daily Sun, Enoch’s grandfather Sebastian Motha said the family wanted justice. His comments came after Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced that school principal Malcolm Williams had been suspended before an investigation took place. “We appreciate the work the department has done so far, but we want to see arrests taking place against those found to have acted wrongly,” said Sebastian. “The law firm appointed by the department should get to the bottom of this matter. We need to find closure by knowing how Enoch died.” On Friday, Lesufi said the orientation trip Enoch died on had not been authorised by the education department. “The school had made an application to the district to approve the trip. By the time the school embarked on the trip, the district and the head office had not approved it, thus making it an unauthorised activity,” he said. Lesufi said teachers who were on the trip would be charged individually if they had been negligent. Last week, the Human Rights Commission stepped in to assist the family. EFF leader Julius Malema also offered the services of Attorney Ian Levitt and advocates Tembeka Ngcukaitobi and Laurence Hodes. Sebastian said the family was considering the offer. Enoch will be buried at Westpark Cemetery on Saturday.
