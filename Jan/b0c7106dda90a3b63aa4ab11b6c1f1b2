THE Mtsweni family started the new year with heavy hearts after their daughter Simphiwe was found dead on Sunday. The 25-year-old’s half-naked body was found near Zamani Primary School in Mpumalanga. Her uncle Silas (46) said Simphiwe’s body was found at a local school playground by a herdboy, who raised the alarm. Silas from Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga said his niece left home on Saturday but was murdered on her way home early on Sunday. “We’re devastated.We’re asking questions about the motive behind the murder. “Some people said they saw her walking alone, coming home. Nobody knows where the murderers came from.” Her body was found lying face-up. Her throat had been cut, and her breasts were cut as well but not completely removed. “The person who did this evil thing wanted to make sure she was dead,” he said. “Her T-shirt was ripped and she was naked.” He said people on their way from a traditional ceremony recognised her. “That person called our neighbour, who gave us the bad news. “We rushed to the scene and found it was our niece.” Simphiwe’s mother Thembeni (43) said she had little to say. “Part of me is broken. My heart is aching,” she said. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a murder case had been opened. He said no arrests had been made so far.
