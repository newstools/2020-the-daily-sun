Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has cooled suggestions that they are challenging for the Absa Premiership title. Bucs, who have managed to turn their season around since the German tactician’s arrival, are quickly climbing up the table. A few weeks ago, they look like they would barely crack the top eight, however, their recent resurgence now sees getting mentioned in the conversation for the title. They won their fourth match in a row on Saturday evening when they defeated AmaZulu FC 1-0 at Orlando Stadium. The result saw them climb up to fourth on the Premiership standings, 12 points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Zinnbauer, however, believes it is still too early to be discussing the title as his side are only just getting back to their best. “Title race, what title race?” asked Zinnbauer. “No, we can’t be talking about challenging for the title. We are not ready. We are still trying to build a strong team here. It’s too early to start talking about the possibility of catching up with Chiefs, or fighting for the title. “What I know is that the team is slowly regaining its confidence, and we are taking things one step at a time.” The German mentor is yet to lose a game since he took over at Pirates. They next travel to Port Elizabeth for a clash with Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3. 30pm) hoping to make it five wins on the trot.
