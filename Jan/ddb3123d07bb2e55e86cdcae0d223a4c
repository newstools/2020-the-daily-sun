Ringing in the new year, Sphelele wrote on Instagram: "This has indeed been a confusing year for me. However, I'm grateful for its ups and downs. Found a hubby and we are now expecting which this was something I never expected." The soccer player commented on the photo of his glowing wife, writing: "mine." The couple's relationship was marred with controversy in 2019 when Itu went public with the romance, only a few months after professing his love to ex-girlfriend Sbahle Mpisane - who was still in recovery following a near-fatal car accident. In her latest Instagram photo, Sphelele shows off her bump, wearing a bikini on the beach.
