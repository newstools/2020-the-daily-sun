ABUJA, NIGERIA A COURT has sentenced a church accountant to 18 years in jail for defrauding his congregation of N15,5 million (R595 600). The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission secured the conviction of Ibrahim Aku of the Church of Brethren in Nigeria before Justice Nathan Musa of the Adamawa State High Court in the northeast. Aku was facing a six-count charge bordering on forgery and obtaining money by false pretence committed between 2016 and 2018. Church members generated the money through offerings, donations and tithes. The convict was entrusted by the church to deposit the revenue into the church’s account with banks, but converted the money to his own use. He forged bank stamps to balance the financial books of the church. Aku was prosecuted using the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act of 2006. He pleaded guilty to the charges. Musa sentenced him to three years for each of the six counts. There is no option of a fine. – CAJ NEWS
