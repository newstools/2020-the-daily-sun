HEAVY rain and floods are threatening the already fragile food security situation in the country. Floods came at a time Zambia was experiencing the worst drought since 1981. Gwembe and Siavonga areas in the south are among the hardest hit by the recent rain. Mambwe and Lumezi areas in the east, and Lusaka, faced flash floods earlier this month. Before the floods, more than 2,3 million people were expected to be severely food insecure during the lean season from October last year to March this year, with at least 430 000 of them in serious need. The situation could deteriorate in the coming days with Zambia expected to experience heavy rain, according to the country’s meteorological department. A delegation is planning to assess the extent of damage in the affected areas. – CAJ News
