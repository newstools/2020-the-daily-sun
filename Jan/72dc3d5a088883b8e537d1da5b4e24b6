Amakhosi are celebrating their 50th anniversary today and they are taking the celebrations to their fans all over the country. Expect plenty of champagne and cakes today as one of the biggest clubs in Africa celebrates a huge milestone. Butit will be down to real business for coach Ernst Middendorp and his charges as they look to consolidate their lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table. The club are celebrating their birthday week by giving the fans free tickets to watch the game and all the tickets have already been snapped up. A huge crowd of 84 000 is expected at the Fifa World Cup venue on a midweek game. Amakhosi are still searching for their first win of the New Year after they were stunned 2-1 by Tshwane giants SuperSport United at the Mbombela Stadium last week. Amakhosi will be without their lanky striker Samir Nurkovic, who poses aerial threats to oppositions, due to suspension. The Lions of the North are a inconsistent side and you don’t know what to expect from them. Amakhosi edged them 3-2 in a five-goal thriller in their first game of the season at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa, but Highlands will be hoping to spoil their party. Middendorp said the loss to SuperSport was not a train smash. The German tactician rued the absence of his tall striker Nurkovic but said that he would come up with a plan. Said Middendorp: “We have a number of good players in our squad and we will fill the gap.” Perhaps the biggest fitting gift to chairman Kaizer Motaung would be to deliver the championship title after being on top of the log for so long. When asked if he can lead Amakhosi to the league title, Middendorp said it’s doable. “This is a team that should challenge for the league title every season. They don’t have to fight for the title because of the 50th anniversary celebration, it should be a regular thing.”
