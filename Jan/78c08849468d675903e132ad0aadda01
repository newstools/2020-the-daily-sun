Leeds star Ezgjan Alioski has stoked the fire ahead of their trip to Arsenal and told The Mirror website that the Gunners are "not so special". The Whites visit the Emirates to round off the third round of the FA Cup full of optimism. The game starts at 10pm on Monday. He said: "It’s a nice stadium, it’s a big club, but it’s not so special to go there because it’s Arsenal," the Macedonia international told a press conference.  But Alioski, who is likely to start on the flank tonight, doesn't see their win over the Red Devils as anything to get excited about insisting Leeds could do the same this season. A draw with West Brom at the Hawthorns on New Year's Day kept
them top of the Championship with Marcelo Bielsa seeing his side lose just one
of their last 15 games. Alioski added: "I see the result versus Manchester
United, but this United, even we can beat them. This is a cup, it’s different.
The difference is that they’re [Arsenal] in the Premier League, we are in the
Championship, and it’s nice to go there and show them who is Leeds." - The Mirror.co.uk
