ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule reassured the nation that state-owned enterprises would never be privatised. He said these entities and the country may be facing hardships, but the ANC Lekgotla and NEC still felt they should not be for sale. He was addressing the media at Luthuli House, Joburg, yesterday on the outcomes of the NEC and Lekgotla meetings over the weekend.  “The SAA should be retained as a national airline, which will require substantial restructuring. “Cabinet should take the operational decisions needed to achieve that aim,” said Magashule. ANC NEC member Tito Mboweni called for the privatisation of some SOEs. Magashule said: “Comrade Tito was part of the NEC meetings when these resolutions were taken. When you are a member, you abide by the resolutions of the organisation. Once the NEC takes a decision, you toe the line.” However, he said individuals within the ANC had the right to voice their personal opinions.  Magashule was flanked by other NEC members, Enoch Godongwana, Thoko Didiza, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Dakota Legoete and Lindiwe Zulu. He said the process to root out corruption must continue so state structures serve the people. Dlamini-Zuma said government could not be judged by the failure of 40 municipalities out of 280. “Fixing local government is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. Not all smaller municipalities are able to raise their own funds. They also don’t have necessary professionals like engineers and accountants. “What makes their problems even worse is their infrastructure is ageing,” said Dlamini-Zuma.
