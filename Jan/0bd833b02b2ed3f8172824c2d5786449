WESTERN Cape Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela is happy the festive road deaths have dropped. He said last month the province recorded 111 road deaths, against 167 the previous year. The highest number of deaths were of pedestrians at 50, followed by passengers at 30 and drivers at 21. Four cyclists and four motorcyclists died, and one person fell off a vehicle. Madikizela said the decrease was due to the road safety programmes held last month. “Key contributors included more effective driver fatigue management, operations to stop driving under the influence, control of reckless and negligent driving and speed enforcement operations,” he said. Madikizela said although the festive season had ended, traffic cops needed to remain alert as schools reopened. He also called on residents to stick to the rules of the road. “I call on all residents to please put road safety first. Let’s all share the road space safely in the interests of every person on the road – drivers, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists,” he said. “We expect high traffic volumes in the province before the return to school and call on everyone to play their part to ensure they reach their destinations safely.” Madikizela said there were 184 arrests for violating the rules of the road. The most arrests were for reckless and negligent driving at 55, followed by possession of fake documents at 44, speeding at 29 and 18 arrests for not being documented.
