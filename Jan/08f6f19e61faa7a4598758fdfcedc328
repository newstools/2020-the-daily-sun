Charged Power came with a solution for recharging batteries with their Micro-USB rechargeable batteries: just plug them to any USB device.  "We wanted to create something sleek for our customers to prevent the excessive battery waste that comes with buying electronics at this time of year, and also to save them money” stated one of CHJGD’s design team told MYbroadband.
