A Mexican man reportedly suffered a three-day erection after taking a stimulant "used for breeding bulls". The man, who has not been named, was reportedly hospitalised after taking the sexual stimulant while preparing to have sex with a 30-year-old woman. The man purchased the stimulant in Veracruz, according to reports. Doctors told La Rep√∫blica newspaper that he had taken a sexual stimulant, used by farmers in that region to invigorate bulls for insemination.
