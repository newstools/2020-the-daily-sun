SHEF and the Kitchen is finally heading overseas for its first gig outside Mzansi. The five-piece band from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, will perform at Saraang, an annual cultural festival that takes place in Chennai, India, from 8 to 12 January. The band – made up of Siphiwe Hlophe, Freddy Mathethe, Khanyisile Mlenzane, William Mathethe and Mzwakhe Dlamini – will perform and network with musicians from Canada, Japan, China, the US and India. Siphiwe, popularly known as Shef, said they were looking forward to sharing their music with the rest of the world. He said their upcoming performance will be their first in India and they were planning to make a good impression that will pave the way for more gigs abroad. “We’re excited about starting the year on a high note. This opportunity has humbled us,” he said. “We can’t wait to play our music outside Mzansi. “The band will get a chance to teach the people about South African music, as well as the love and passion we have for our craft. “In the process, we will gain followers from all around the world.” Shef said the band released their album, The First Recipe, and had been working hard to become a household name. He told SunBuzz he was very proud of the band for refusing to give up when their journey got rocky. “We are very proud of the work we’ve done to make this performance possible,” said Shef. “When we started, performing on the global stage was one of our biggest priorities. “Because of our hard work and persistence, that moment has finally arrived. “It won’t be easy, but we are looking forward to making history.”
