The boys have reached the end of
the journey and they are now men. For them it has been a long,
four-week journey, which all came to an end over the weekend. On Saturday as dawn broke on the
chilly morning in Kuilspruit, just outside the Vaal, dozens of barefoot
initiates gathered to prepare for their all-day ceremony. The 15 young men had spent the
night in a small shack on a farm which belongs to initiation chief, Ntate Neo
“Majantja” Motloung, waiting to reunite with their families. Finally, they had left to their
homes, happy to be man.
