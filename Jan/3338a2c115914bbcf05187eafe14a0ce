Now that we are back to reality and pampering ourselves, there has been a big panic in the beauty Industry concerning eyelash extensions. It has been reported that there has been an increase in lash lice which might be caused by eyelash extensions. ABC13 reports that there is a huge majority of unlicensed beauticians which might be adding to this growing panic due to the fact that they do not follow the correct hygiene procedures. Please donâ€™t let your eyes get like this. It is extremely dangerous and unsanitary for me to work on lashes like this. ALSO that buildup can become a LIVING organism. You do not want lash lice ???? Please CLEAN your lashes. The health of your eyes are more important than trying to make the extensions last. PS. CLEAN LASHES LAST LONGER !

According abc13, it's an occurrence in Houston for the glues used in salons to contain formaldehyde, which is illegal. If you are unsure of what your salon uses, the TDLR recommends that you ask to see the glue. About 40-50 percent of people will have a reaction to glues containing formaldehyde.  "A less experienced technician will apply to a group of lashes, which tends to cause clumping and pulling on those lashes, and tend to make them fall out earlier," said optometrist Brad Owens.
