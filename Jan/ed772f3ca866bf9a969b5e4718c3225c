AFTER the festive season’s bingeing, this is the right time to go on a diet and to eat well. Gert Coetzee, founder of The Diet Everyone Talks About, said the food we eat doesn’t only affect our well-being, but has an impact on our mental wellness too. Said Gert: “Eating healthily gets easier when you’re in sync with your body. It helps to be aware of what happens inside your body and your mind. “Learn to embrace mindful eating. Be aware of and accept your relationship with food.” Here are some of Gert’s healthy eating tips:  Cut out addictive foods and drinks: Being addicted to foods that contain caffeine, sugar, alcohol, carbs and dairy can take a toll on your life. “When you try cut out addictive foods, you might start to crave healthier food options. Explore your food    habits: When you’re aware of your food habits, you’re able to identify the reasons behind eating what you eat. Identify which foods your body needs and how consuming it will benefit your overall health. Avoid emotional eating: Are you eating because you’re hungry or you feel eating will take away the sadness, frustration, loneliness? Listen deeply to your body’s signals for hunger. Watch your food portions: Whether you want to maintain a healthy weight or want to lose weight, controlling your food portions is as important as sticking to a healthy diet. “Big portions of food contribute to discomfort and indigestion. Managing your food portions helps prevent bloating. Small portions also help you lose weight. Avoid distractions: Being distracted while eating disallows you to listen attentively to your body’s dietary needs. Get into the habit of sitting down and enjoying your food.
