Metro FM breakfast show host Mo Flava is lending a helping hand to struggling students who cannot afford to pay for their studies. The Soweto-born DJ started the campaign in 2008 and has sent hundreds of young people to school to study media-related fields. “I’m giving school leavers media studies bursaries. You have to have matriculated in 2018 and 2019. "The bursaries will cover tuition and textbooks. You can only study at Boston Media House in Sandton, Pretoria or Durban, you need to WhatsApp your matric results to me, I will then shortlist a group of candidates that I will interview for the bursary," he said. He added that the idea came from realising that a lot of young people can’t afford to study the careers of their dreams. “They can do whatever they like within the aspect of media, we have had students from all over the country including places like Taung,” he added. He said students can WhatsApp their details to the following number to stand a chance to be shortlisted: 0812687518
