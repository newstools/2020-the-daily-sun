SELLO Mangwana wants to change how people see his kasi. The 34-year-old from Nyanga in Cape Town told Daily Sun: “People are afraid of this area, but I want to change that through my music.” Sello recently won an Ukhonukamva Award. “I won for my gospel gqom and I’m proud because people were criticising me when I left kwaito. “I hope the award will encourage the youth of Nyanga,” he said. Sello said when he switched from kwaito to gospel in 2016, people said it was the end of his career. He said he switched when became a born-again Christian. “I couldn’t just play any kwaito as I was changing my ways and the music I was playing needed to change as well.” He said Nyanga youth needed to help change the image of the area. “We’re the murder capital and that won’t change until the youth own the space and make a change.” He said he was preaching the word of God through his songs. “Growing up in Nyanga is a challenge, but it’s our area and we can’t do anything about it except work together to bring change in the kasi.” Mzukisi Manqina (30) said he loved Sello’s music. “I wasn’t sure he’d succeed but he proved us all wrong.” Sello, who has two kwaito albums under his belt, said “I have a new gospel gqom album, Making Jesus Famous.”
