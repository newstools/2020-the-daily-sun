MEMBERS of South African National Civic Organization blocked Polokwane municipality entrance claiming that corruption at the municipality is at its core. There are allegations of nepotism with claims that some workers close to the municipality leadership brought their boyfriends and family members who were appointed. They are demanding that the recent post appointments to be stopped. Chairman of SANCO in Limpopo Champ Sepuri says in order to save the municipality from further embarrassment and possible collapse, they demand the immediate reversal of this Job for Pals appointments. "We need a new process of recruitment and appointment in an open and transparent manner. We also call on the MEC for Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (COGHSTA) to appoint an independent investigator to probe the recruitment and selection of those on the verge of appointment and take appropriate action against implicated municipal officials. We further call on the ANC to take action against its leaders at all levels that have brought the party into disrepute through this scandal including the member of the top five of the ANC in Limpopo. In simple but severe terms, heads must roll," he said. Spokesman for Polokwane municipality Thipa Selala says the municipal leadership will meet with the complaints and their grievances before they comment much about the allegations.
