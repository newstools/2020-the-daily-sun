WITH less that three months coaching in the Absa Premiership, Cape Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink has landed himself in hot water with the Premier Soccer League. The coach who rep[laced Benni McCarthy at the Citizens is set to face disciplinary action for the first time since his arrival. The Dutch coach contravened the NSL Compliance Manuel after he failed to attend to his post-match commitments after their 1-0 victory over Baroka earlier this month."The Premier Soccer League has charged Cape Town City coach Mr Jan Olde Riekerink with contravening the NSL Compliance Manual (Media Manual) and not honouring his post-match media commitments," read a statement from the League on Wednesday.He is now expected to appear in front of the PSL DC next week Wednesday, 22 January 2020 to state his case and face possible sanctioning. City have had their fair share of run-ins with the League's prosecutor this season, having had former coach Benni McCarthy and midfielder Mpho Makola facing the DC.
