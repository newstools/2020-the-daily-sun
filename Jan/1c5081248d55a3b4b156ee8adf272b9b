MZANSI men are at it again. It’s January and they’re already planning an imaginary Men’s conference event. It’s been trending on twitter and ideas are flooding in. Last year, the planning of the mysterious Men’s Conference happened in February, this year it seems to have started earlier than usual. Some have been confirming their presence and sharing their ideas.  This year’s Men’s Conference guests include the man who dominated December with his Amapiano tunes, DJ Maphorisa, the Mzansi blesser who made headlines in 2019, Ronald Muchengwa and the tiger, Gwede Mantashe. Some have been throwing ideas of what should be discussed.  “Let’s make sure we strictly discuss this issue of men abandoning their children while living fancy lives and driving fancy cars. It’s a shame that we as men condone such behavior. This needs to stop,” Lehae tweeted. The idea of discussing violence against women and children appeared the most. Msimelomnyama tweeted: “This year we should discuss how we deal with those that break our man code. We’re supposed to be protectors not causing pain and suffering. Men who consider themselves trash shouldn’t bother attending,” he said. Mpilo is concerned about the issue of being Friendzoned. He wants nothing to do with it and wants it to be discussed at the conference. “Can a gentleman that managed to escape Friendzone or Family zone address us. we’re struggling,” he tweeted.
