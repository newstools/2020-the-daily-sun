A total of 147 schools in the province were damaged by storms in November. Motshekga said her department had put up mobile classrooms for all the schools so learning and teaching would not be disturbed when schools reopen next week. Ministers and officials visited Zashuke High School in Bulwer and Mlozana Primary School in Umzimkhulu, which were damaged by a storm and strong winds over Christmas. “The public works department is buying building material,” said Motshekga. Dlamini-Zuma said she’d make sure the procurement process was sped up so pupils don’t learn in mobile classrooms for long. She was working on a plan to ensure disaster management teams responded immediately.   Zikalala said the province had experienced more than 400 disaster incidents since June. He said more than 3 000 houses had been damaged, affecting 38 000 people across the province. READ: MASTER KG SPOILS HIMSELF!
