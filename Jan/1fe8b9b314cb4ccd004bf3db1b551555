THE Ntsumpula brothers from Hombe Village in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, sometimes went to bed on an empty stomach. So they reached out to SunReaders for help. Their story was published in the paper on 10 January. Ntombi Rasmeni, manager at Hungry Lion in Lusikisiki, read their story and contacted Daily Sun. “I read their story and I was touched. I shared the story with the employees and asked that we donate something to the family,” said Ntombi. The staff raised R1 900. “We know it’s not much, but it will make a difference,” she said. Ntombi was grateful to the staff, saying she couldn’t have done it alone. One of the brothers, Philasande (20), was shocked to receive the money. “It still feels like a dream. We don’t have words to say how grateful we are for the support we’re getting,” he said. “I didn’t know the paper was this powerful because we are not only getting help from people near us, but from people in other provinces. We are grateful to Daily Sun.” The brothers also received money from people as far as Cape Town to buy school uniform. Ingquza Hill Mayor Bambezakhe Goya and human settlements officials visited the brothers and promised to look into their situation.
