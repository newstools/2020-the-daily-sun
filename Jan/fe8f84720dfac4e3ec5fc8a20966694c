HIGHLANDS Park coach Owen Da Gama is going nowhere, the club have confirmed. Following their humiliating 4-1 drubbing at the hands of rookies Stellenbosch FC in the Absa Premiership this past weekend, speculation regarding Da Gama’s future at the club has been rife. However, the Tembisa outfit have confirmed that they still maintain faith in Da Gama and his vision for the club, adding that they will be giving him their full support. "We are fully behind the coach, his vision for the team, the entire technical team and are confident of his turnaround strategy that he’s working on to redeem the club in the next coming matches,’’ said club director and shareholder Sinky Mnisi in a statement released by the club. Mnisi added that the blame for the recent run of poor results falls on the whole team and not just on Da Gama’s shoulders. “The team takes collective responsibility for all that has transpired and is currently hard at work to look to redeem itself and appease supporters,” the statement continued. Highlands will face Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday (6 pm) desperate to redeem themselves and get back to winning ways.
