SHE used to ask her friends to check who was outside before she left the house or hospital. This was because she was embarrassed that she was using a wheelchair. But she’s now rehabilitated and has accepted her condition. Nomvula Ndaba (21) from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, said she didn’t want the community to see her in a wheelchair. “Some people like judging or coming up with their own stories. They don’t know that disability can happen to anyone, at any time.” Nomvula said she was shot seven times in her right arm and back on her way from fetching water while visiting her gogo in Brakpan in 2017. “There was a community protest over land. People were fighting over stands.” Nomvula said doctors managed to remove six bullets, but one is lodged in her spine cord. “I was told it was risky to remove it as I might not be able to walk again. For now the sensation is back and I can feel my legs. I can walk using a walking frame. The big challenge is that my knee nerves are not strong enough for me to stand for a long period,” Nomvula told Daily Sun. She said she hoped everything would go well as she was going to study hospitality this year. Nomvula plays wheelchair basketball for Thelle Mogoerane Hospital. She started playing in 2018 as part of her physiotherapy and is now an all-rounder. “I prefer to score and have already received three trophies and two medals.”
