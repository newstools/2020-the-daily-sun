THE Lord’s house has become a thugs’ playground. According to House of God Ministry Fellowship member Sonnyboy Baloyi, evil people ekasi were jealous of the congregation. The 57-year-old told Daily Sun they found their church’s damaged tent in Mamelodi East extension 11 in Tshwane on Friday. “This is evil. How could people do such a thing to the house of God?” he said. Sonnyboy said he suspected jealous people were responsible. “We’ve been experiencing similar problems since 2017,” said Sonnyboy. He said the church’s red and white tent was stolen in December 2018. Carpets, robes and iron rods had been stolen. “Maybe they don’t want us to use their mobile toilet, but we clean it after using it. “We’re a church of God. We’ll forgive if they confess.” Youth pastor Tshepiso Mogano appealed to the community to watch over the tent. He urged them to respect the church. Community leader Kgadi Mashitoa (46) suspected the tent was destroyed by wind. “We always safeguard the tent and no one is fighting the church,” he said. “When their red and white tent was stolen I phoned them. “This time I couldn’t because my cellphone is broken.” Beauty Maimela (28) said sharing their toilet with the congregation was not a problem. “No one destroyed the tent. Strong wind is to blame,” she said.
