TSHWARELO Letsoalo dreads going back to school. The 12-year-old Tshwarelo from Soshanguve block T in Tshwane is training to become a sangoma. The young thwasa dropped out of school. Her gobela, Mapula Rakale (64), said she was at first reluctant to train Tshwarelo when she came to her in 2018. Mapula had then pleaded with her ancestors to wait for Tshwarelo to grow, but they had only given her a year’s grace period. “Her parents brought her back last year,” said Mapula. She said Tshwarelo was unconscious. “The ancestors refused to wait any longer,” she said. “I had to take her in. She’ll graduate at the end of the month and thereafter help people.” Rakale said she wished Tshwarelo’s school teachers could explain to her fellow pupils what an ancestral calling really is. Her dad William said he became aware of his child’s calling when she was 10. “She’d tell us things about ourselves,” he said. “Her fainting at school forced us to take her to gogo Rakale.” Eucation spokesman Steve Mabona advised Mapula, as a guardian, to approach the principal. “It’s difficult to control how pupils behave towards another,” she said. “But the principal or the SGB could perhaps talk to them.”
