The late youth  television presenter Akhumzi Jezile might be gone but his legacy still lives on. The presenter’s friends seem to have shared a special bond together. On Wednesday, the presenter was supposed to turn 31 years. His industry buddies went all out and visited the Westpark Cemetery, Joburg. Musician MaBlerh took to social media and shared the photos they took when they visited the graveyard. He wrote a special message on Twitter: “Happy 31st birthday BAkhumzi. To us, you still live on and we will celebrate you!.” The singer was with actors and presenters Siphesihle Vazi, Clement Maosa, Nolwazi Shange, Dr. Musa Mthombeni and Andile Ncube. There is also the Akhumzi Jezile Foundation that aims to improve road safety in Mzansi. The foundation was founded in August in memory of actor Akhumzi, who died in a car crash in 2018. It is run by Alex Hlabangane.
