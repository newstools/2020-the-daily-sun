IF HE gets a wheelchair, he could get out of the house. And if he could get out of the house, his wife could look for piece jobs. This is what Matuwana Simayile (62) who’s been trapped in his house in Joe Slovo in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, believes. He suffered a stroke 10 years ago that left his left side badly injured. His wife Nombuyiselo Simayile (59) said their lives changed for the worse. “I’m the one who looks after him. We need a wheelchair so I can take him outside and he can see what’s happening around us.” Matuwana said staying indoors is stressful. “I see how difficult it is for my wife. I’m thankful to have her. “Besides taking care of me, she is also trying everything to put food on the table.” Nombuyiselo said during the day she asks her four children to go outside when Matuwana wants to relieve himself. “But at night I have to help him while they’re in the house,” she said. She said she collects bottles in the area. “It’s the only job I can do because I can’t go far and leave him alone.” Nombuyiselo said a wheelchair would change everything. “I stopped lifting him because he’s heavy. “The last time I tried taking him out I dropped him. We really need help.”
