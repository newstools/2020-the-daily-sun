WITH the Premier Soccer League (PSL) domestic January transfer window officially open from Thursday, the cheques are already out. AmaZulu have waste little time adding some firepower to their team, strengthening their attacking options. Usuthu have secured the services of Slovakian striker Milos Lacny on an 18-month contract with the option to extend at the end of next season. The 31 year-old most recently played for SKF Sered in the Slovak Super Liga where he scored four goals in 12 outings. The well-travelled Lacny, who has played in countries like Czech Republic, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan, will bring a wealth of experience to the KwaZulu Natal outfit. Along with Maritzburg United and Baroka, AmaZulu have scored the least goals in the league (9) and will hope Lacny shares the scoring load with Bongi Ntuli.
