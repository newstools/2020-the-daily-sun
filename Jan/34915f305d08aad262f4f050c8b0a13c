 THIS morning, the SABC was  forced to apologise to millions of  listeners after Umhlobo Wenene went off air unexpectedly. This apparently was due to a  an explosion at a power substation near the SABC premises in Port Elizabeth. According to SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo, following the disruption of broadcast services, the station was broadcasting from the outside broadcast vehicle and the technical team was working on fully restoring the broadcast service.The explosion that happened in Newtown Park, Port Elizabeth, has caused a major power outage, leaving large parts of the city without electricity since last night. It was not yet known yesterday when the power station would be fixed but technicians were working hard to fix the problem.
