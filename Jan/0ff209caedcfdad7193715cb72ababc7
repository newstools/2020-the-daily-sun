Khwezi Ndlovu took big risks to get to where she is today. The 26-year-old Isithembiso actress from Clermont in KZN said she left home for Joburg with nothing but her love of acting. She told SunBuzz that after wanting to for a long time, she figured she should do something to finally pursue it. Moving to Joburg was the first thing that came to mind. She said: “In 2016 I went to an audition, and although I didn’t get the part, the production company loved me and said they’d call me for another role for a show that was coming up. “Months passed and nothing happened, so I thought they’d forgotten about me and moved on. I started auditioning for other roles, but nothing was coming up, so I decided to move to Joburg and stay with a friend. “I had no plan whatsoever, but I knew I’d be a step closer to realising my dreams. “A week after I arrived in Jozi, I got a call from the production house that had promised to call me. I’ve been with them ever since.” Khwezi, who plays Vivian on Isithembiso, said she fell in love with acting in high school. “When choosing subjects in grade 10, I chose drama and did it throughout until grade 12. “When it was time to go to university, I wanted to continue with it but my mum would always say no. “So I studied social sciences at the University of KZN and graduated in 2017. That’s the same year I left for Jozi to pursue my acting career.” Although Isithembiso is coming to an end, Khwezi said we’ll see more of her on our small screens. She said: “I want to work with a lot of productions. I love being on TV.”
