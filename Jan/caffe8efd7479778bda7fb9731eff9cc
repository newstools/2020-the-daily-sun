AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa is demanding urgent police action after yet another brutal killing of a union leader at the weekend. The branch leader at Sibanye-Stillwater platinum operations, Mahamba Ngomti, was gunned down outside his home in Rustenburg, North West. He was walking towards his car after receiving a phone call. “There’s easy access to guns. Why is the death sentence not brought back? I can’t understand,” said Mathunjwa. “Rapists and murderers enjoy custard and jelly in prison, while victims of crime can’t even afford black tea.” He sent Amcu’s condolences to the loved ones and colleagues of their late comrade.  “The state should dig deeper into their resources to find the culprits. They must investigate everybody, without exception, including the presidents of the unions,” he said. Mathunjwa said when they hired private investigator Paul O’Sullivan in 2017, he was the first to be probed. Mathunjwa said if they hadn’t hired him, no arrests would’ve been made and nobody would’ve been sentenced in the other murders of union members.  Last year in June, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria sentenced two assassins to prison following attacks on the same branch leadership of Amcu. One of the culprits was handed a life sentence plus 70 years, while the other accused was sentence to 45 years. Mathunjwa called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to spare no resource in investigating the latest murder. “It’s important the culprits are brought to book as swiftly as possible. Amcu will co-operate with law enforcement to ensure justice is served.”
