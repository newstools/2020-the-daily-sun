SINGER Zahara is trying new things and has started acting. She will be starring in a film called Mbali: The Movie. The movie, which was the idea of actor Luthuli Dlamini, is about a young orphan trying to find her way home. Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, will act alongside Luthuli and Nambitha Mpumlwana. She said when she was approached by Luthuli three weeks ago, she couldn’t believe it. “I immediately told my mum. She said she knew if I had not become a singer I would’ve been an actor or comedian,” she told Daily Sun. “This is because I used to teach young kids in my village acting even though I didn’t go to school for it. “Although I’ve never acted before, I know how to do it. I’m a natural. I can do impersonations.” Zahara said she was excited about the people she’d be acting with. “These are people I’ve looked up to and I’ll be next to them making a movie. I’m excited.” She said they hadn’t started shooting and were still busy with the script. Luthuli said he couldn’t share much as the film was still in the development stage. “We chose Zahara because we believe in her talent and we know she can do more than just sing. People must watch this space.”
