THE family of the late Reverend Bassie Jackals has called on people to stop circulating the video of his last moments on earth. Jackals died while delivering a very powerful sermon during the church service at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Kuruman, Northern Cape, on Sunday. He sat on a chair while preaching and congregants thought it was part of the sermon. When he fell to the ground, they clapped hands, thinking it was still an act. They thought he’d get up, but the reverend was no more. Family spokesman Bishop Dimpho Gaobee said his death had left his family, friends and church inconsolable. “Reverend Jackals, an outstanding and capable leader in many ways, was also a loving husband and father.  “We therefore ask people to be considerate and stop circulating the video as it still brings more hurt than healing to his wife and children,” said Gaobee. He said the family had called on social media platforms to permanently remove the video. He said Jackals served as a pastor of various congregations of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and was later given the added responsibility to become a presiding elder in the church. Gaobee said Jackals was due to graduate with a Master of Divinity from Payne Theological Seminary in Ohio, US, in May. He said funeral arrangements were underway and at the moment, they could confirm the funeral would be in Kimberley on Saturday.
