They’re like my children.” She said she started keeping cats in 2010 and has not looked back since. “I love cats so much and my son loves them, too. When they are around, I’m happy. My son and I take turns to feed them,” she said. Pinky said she didn’t grow up in a cat-loving family. She said she loved them because their fur felt as though it was from a teddy bear. She said keeping the cats well-fed kept them looking good. “When you look at my cats you can see they’re well looked after,” she said. The oldest cat is called Masimambisane and is the mother of seven others. The other cats came from Pinky’s friends. READ: 'HLENGIWE MHLABA CRASHED MY CAR!' She said she gave them food such as milk, meat, pap and sometimes cat food from the shops. “I kept some of Masimambisane’s kittens and gave away the others to people who like cats. I don’t mind increasing the number to even 20 because I like cats,” she said. Neighbour Nkosinathi Ncatha said he was shocked to see so many cats when he moved to the area. “I had never seen so many cats in one place. At first, I was scared of this woman. But I later understood they were just cats and she loved them.”
