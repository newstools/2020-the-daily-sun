NTOMBIKAYISE Mkhwanazi and her siblings had a very good start to the year. This is because they received a fully furnished six-roomedhouse on Tuesday. The house was handed over by Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane. Ntombikayise (29) from Thandukukhanya in Piet Retief said the new house has given them a new lease on life. She said they had been living in a mud house. “We have been struggling for a long time since our parents died. The mud house was crumbling and we had lost hope of ever getting a proper house. “No one is employed in the family and we survive on the kids’ social grants. We could not build a house with the little income as we had to use it to put food on the table,” she said.  Mtsweni-Tsipane said she was deeply touched when she learnt of the family’s plight. “I couldn’t ignore the situation the family was facing. When I learnt about their plight, I instructed the Department of Human Settlements to find someone to build them a house. “It is our job as government to make sure every citizen has a proper roof to live under. I am very happy the family’s lives have changed for the better,” she said. She said the siblings endured a difficult life since they became orphans and she thought it necessary for them to be prioritised. “It is important that environments where children are housed are improved and habitable.” Human settlements MEC Norah Mahlangu said her department was committed to delivering 6 694 housing units, servicing 5 000 sites, which would yield 11 694 housing opportunities during this financial year. They’d also be issuing 15 000 title deeds to rightful beneficiaries in and around the province.
