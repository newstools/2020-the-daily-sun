I’d like to express my discomfort with the SABC for perpetuating favouritism in the music industry. Why is it that Haka Matorokisi, Makoti and Jerusalema didn’t make its list of songs played around midnight on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day? DJ Zinhle’s song, Umlilo, was imposed on the masses. People on dance floors don’t react positively to it. Favouritism is a serious syndrome in our country. Don’t try and convince Mzansi otherwise. The streets, clubs, stadiums and many other entertainment places have decided who deserves victory.
