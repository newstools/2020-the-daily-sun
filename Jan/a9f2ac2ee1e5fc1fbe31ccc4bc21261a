The 15th edition of the Limpopo Marula Festival was launched at the Karibu Leisure Resort in Tzaneen, Limpopo, on Wednesday night. The glamorous affair was attended by top TV and radio presenter Penny Lebyane, Muvhango actors Gabriel Tumidzani, Sydney Ramakuela, as well as DJs Malwela and Khanya Mkangisa. Thousands of visitors are expected to attend a host of festivities in and around the mining town of Phalaborwa throughout the second half of next month. The activities, to be held from 15 to 29 February, range from comedy nights to music shows. Limpopo Tourism MEC Thabo Mokone promised revellers this year’s festival would be much bigger, brighter and better than the 14 previous editions. Mokone said the festival would continue to position the province as one of the country’s most popular domestic tourist destinations. “It will help to empower small businesses and inject massive capital and investment opportunities for the people of Ba-Phalaborwa Municipality and the rest of the province,” he said. Some of the highlights of the two-week celebrations include a gogos’ soccer tournament, comedy nights, a festival ala cuisine, a fun run, a talent search competition, as well as youth, jazz and gospel music festival. Most of the events will be staged at Impala Park Stadium in Phalaborwa. Mokone told SunBuzz the festival had played a huge developmental role in the district over the past 14 years. “It has created employment, specifically for the youth, through the marula fruit,” Mokone said. He said the festival was a great platform for energetic youth who’d identified innovative business opportunities centred on the marula fruit. Sho Madjozi and Samthing Soweto are two of the music stars who will grace the festival.
