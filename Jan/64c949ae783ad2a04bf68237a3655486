TOUGH-AS-TEAK defender Rooi Mahamutsa played his best football at Orlando Pirates - he was highly passionate and wanted to win each and every match. Opposition strikers knew it was going to be a tough time in the office whenever Mahamutsa was on the pitch.  He kicked opponents, he shoved, he tackled,he got yellow cards and red cards for various offences. But he will be remembered more for the kick in the nuts he dished out on former SuperSport United troublesome striker Thabiso Nkoana.
