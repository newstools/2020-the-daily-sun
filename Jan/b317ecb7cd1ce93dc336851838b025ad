He said after the crash, they went to the nearest petrol station and he was surprised to see people taking photos of Hlengiwe as he didn’t know who she was. “I took pictures of her driver’s licence, ID and car. I thought she’d honour her promise. But I feel she has disrespected and scammed me since. She has now stopped responding to SMSes and calls,” he said.  But Hlengiwe said she told Moataz to get a quotation from one of her contacts. READ: SBAHLE MPISANE MOVES ON FROM CAR CRASH TRAUMA!

I have consulted with my legal team.” Hlengiwe said her car was not damaged in the accident.
