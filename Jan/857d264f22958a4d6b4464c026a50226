KAIZER Chiefs are celebrating 50 years; they are topping the PSL table and they are entering their fifth year without winning a trophy... “After all the reflections of the year that was, entering
2020 must trigger inspiration and a sense of newness in all of us,” wrote
Chiefs head-honcho Kaizer Motaung on their website. “This is not the time to look back with no intentions of
changing some things. It is time for new beginnings and to improve on some of
the shortfalls of 2019.” Motaung added: “With Chiefs turning 50 years old this year,
we have really come a long way since the formation of this colossal brand. We
trust that the story of our club continues to inspire confidence and courage in
everyone. I wish to take this moment to recognise everyone, past and present,
who has been a part of the journey of the club.” “Chincha Guluva”, as Motaung was known in his playing days,
also paid tribute to their fans. “Our supporters have been a pillar of strength. They’ve been
faithful through thick and thin over many years. They play an important role and they too deserve accolades. “I hope that a boy and a girl from a township and village
will gain inspiration from the journey that started in Phefeni, Soweto, during
those dark days in South African history. Let 2020 awaken the sleeping giant
and let us journey together as we look forward to the year of our Golden
Jubilee celebrations.” As part of the celebrations, Chiefs have offered their fans
free tickets when they host Highlands Park on 8 January at the FNB Stadium.
