LADIES, there are four days left to apply to be a billionaire’s date! According to news agency AFP, Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has launched an online wanted ad for a girlfriend who will fly around the Moon with him on a SpaceX rocket. Applications close this Friday, January 17. The 44 year-old is looking for “single women aged 20 or over” who want to enjoy life to the fullest. It seems loneliness has driven the businessman to this idea, which will also be streamed on a TV service. “I have lived exactly as I’ve wanted to until now,” said Maezawa, who has three children with two women. “I’m 44 now. As feelings of loneliness and emptiness slowly begin to surge upon me, there’s one thing that I think about: Continuing to love one woman,” he said in the advert. More than 20 000 people retweeted his tweet which reads, “WANTED!!!- Why not be the ‘first woman’ to travel to the moon?” Yusaka will make a final selection by the end of March after going on dates with the applicants.
