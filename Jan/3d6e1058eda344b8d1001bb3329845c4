Sjava’s fans are in for a treat as they are not only getting one night with the award-winning muso but two. Due to the high demand for his one man show: A Night with Sjava will be held at the Durban ICC next month. Following the success of his One Night with Sjava that took place at Sun Arena in Pretoria last year this promises to be another spectacular show. The Afro-pop artist says he is delighted to see so much love and support. He said: “It is amazing that the people from the province I hail from are this supportive of my work. I cannot wait to give them two days of nothing but great entertainment." The tickets for what will be the award winner’s second solo show, went on sale last month. It sold out under a month and there’s over a month left before the show. A Night with Sjava is happening through Ambitiouz Entertainment in partnership with the KZN Department of Economic Development Tourism and Environmental Affairs under the leadership of MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube. The show will take place at Durban’s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Saturday 29 February and Sunday 1 March. “As the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Conservation we are proud of the role played by Sjava to put this province on the map. We are delighted to be partnering with Sjava and his team to entertain music lovers and enhance our tourist destinations and historic destinations in KwaZulu-Natal,” said the MEC. Tickets are available at Computicket from R150 to R495.
