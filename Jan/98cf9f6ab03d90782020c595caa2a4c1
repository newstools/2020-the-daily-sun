Gladafrica Championship side Uthongathi FC have brought in Thanduyise Khuboni and Siyabonga ‘Bhele’ Nomvethe. This comes after both players have been training with the club for some time. The club is chasing the PSL promotion at the end of the season, and currently lie second in the Championship standings. They are one point behind leaders Ajax Cape Town, who dethroned them at the top after a 3-1 at home at the weekend. Meanwhile, Bhele’s return might come as a surprise to many given his age. Nomvethe (42), is set to be the oldest player in the Championship. He is said to have been forced to retirement at the end of last season at AmaZulu. Bhele fell out of favour with former Usuthu coach Cavin Johnson and hence the retirement came about. The former Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs striker has always maintained his burning desire to continue to play football and said football was a gift from God. The KwaMashu-born is PSL all time goal scorer with 123 goals, 13 ahead of Usuthu's assistant coach Mabhudi Khenyeza.  Khuboni’s return sees him end two years and six months of club search. He was last on the books of Highlands Park whom released him at the end of 2016-17 season. Both players have signed six months contract with one year options to renew.
