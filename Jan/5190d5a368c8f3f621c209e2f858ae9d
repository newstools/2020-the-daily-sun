KAIZER Chiefs striker Khama Billiat has returned to training after several weeks on the sidelines, the club confirmed on Wednesday. The 29-year-old last featured for the Glamour Boys in their 1-1 draw away to Maritzburg United in December 2019. The Zimbabwe international is, however, over his injuries and have returned to full training, meaning he could be available when Amakhosi take on Royal Eagles in the Nedbank Cup next weekend. Billiat has missed Chiefs' last five league matches, where they won three, lost one and drew one, coach Ernst Middendorp said earlier he wouldn't rush his star player's recovery. He has only featured 12 times for Chiefs in all competitions this season, with a single goal and two assists to his name. Billiat could feature when Amakhosi host First Division side Royal Eagles in the last-32 of the Nedbank Cup on 8 February at FNB Stadium (6pm).
