LINDA Gcwensa wants Mzansi to know he’s NOT dead. The Ngamthanda Umuntu hitmaker’s family has been receiving words of condolences since Sunday. But it turns out concerned fans are confusing him for the Linda Gcwensa who founded award-winning group Avante. Gcwensa died of kidney problems on Sunday. Linda said calls and messages of condolences had been coming in thick and fast. “Most of them were crying and some asked how I died,” he said. “It even went as far as people thinking someone hacked my Facebook page. “Others are calling my friends to get more information about my death. “Now I know how it feels to be dead even though I’m alive! “People need to understand that I’m not the Linda who passed on. He sang gospel and I sing Afro pop. I’m fine.” Linda said he knew Gcwensa. “In 2011 I heard there was a Linda Gcwensa who sang, so I found him on Facebook and sent him a message. He gave me his address.” “I often went to his house in KwaMashu and we’d chill and talk. He always gave me advice. “He was my inspiration because he was also a songwriter. He even promised to help me record an album, but I joined Mzansi Magic’s Clash of the Choirs and other doors opened.” Linda said they last spoke in 2018. “He got sick and went to hospital. I called him and he was still fine.” Linda will be buried in Umzumbe on the KZN South Coast on Saturday.
