AKA has made it finally official that he is flying solo. Yesterday AKA came clean on the Metro FM afternoon drive show saying that his relationship with DJ Zinhle has ended. This comes after rumours about his relationship with DJ Zinhle and how they allegedly broke up earlier this year. Yesterday AKA casually dropped a bomb during his interview with DJ Naves and Sphectacula on MetroFM. The rapper has shared that he recently went on holiday and that it was the first time in years that he did so as a single man. “It’s been a crazy start to the year, I had to go away... I went on a very cold holiday. As people might have noticed it’s my first holiday being a single man for many, many years. "It was a bit different but you know it was a boy’s trip and it was all about just re-centering myself, the energies and just getting myself in the right frame of mind to continue to dominate the radio, the charts and everything else." #TheKingsSuite with @sphectacula & @djnaves A post shared by  METRO FM (@metrofmsa) on Jan 22, 2020 at 5:44am PST
