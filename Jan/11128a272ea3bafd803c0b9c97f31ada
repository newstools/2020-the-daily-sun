CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink has hinted on dropping club leading goal scorer Kermit Erasmus for Siphelele Mthembu in their next Absa Premiership clash. Riekerink admitted after their 2-2 draw against AmaZulu that the Bafana Bafana international is not yet fully fit. Erasmus was out last played in November when City drew 0-0 against Highlands Park and was substituted in the early stages of the match due to hamstring injury. However, he made his return on Saturday coming in as a sub when City defeats Baroka 1-0. On Wednesday against AmaZulu, he started but did not contribute much in the team as he looked rusty. He could not even test Usuthu goalkeeper Neil Boshoff despite getting several chances. Riekerink said: “Kermit didn’t train for two months‚ then he came back and so far he is struggling.” “But we have to give him the benefit of the doubt because he has to be game fit and at the moment he is not.” On Sunday The Citizens visit Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium 3.30pm. The Dutch mentor hinted that Mthembu could replace Erasmus.“Shaka (Mthembu) is a striker in our squad‚ so it is always a possibility. “But you cannot play with 12 players, if you play one‚ then you have to take the other one out. "Then the question is why do you take this one out?”The Citizens have not had the best of the 2019-20 Absa Premiership campaign. They are among struggling teams in the league for the first time since the club was established. After 17 matches they are occupying a disappointing 11th spot on the log. They have scored 22 goals and conceded 25. On Wednesday, City gave up a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with AmaZulu in Cape Town. “Defensively we were organised, we had a lot of duels that we won" "That was not the problem" "The problem was that we did not create enough chances" "If you have so much ball possession but only create three chances, then that is the problem,” Riekerink told reporters.
