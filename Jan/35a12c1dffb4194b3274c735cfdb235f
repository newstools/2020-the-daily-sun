ANC secretary general Ace Magashule has appealed to
disgruntled Jan Kempdorp resident outside Kimberly to hold their horses on
their barrage of complaints and devote their energies on celebrating ANC birthday. Magashule was talking to a few residents who has gathered
outside the town’s municipal offices while he was being briefed by the local
leadership. He had spent more than an hour in a closed meeting. When he emerged from the meeting the handful residents surrounded
him in anticipation of him addressing them. But Magashule was quick off the mark telling them that
the party is aware of their problems. “We know of your problems. They are not big problems,
they are smaller problems. For now we must go and celebrate. Let’s go out to
celebrate,” Magashule said before he was whisked off to a nearby informal
settlement where he conducted door-to-door visits to engage residents. Later in the day, Magashule is expected to attend a
community meeting where he will face residents.
