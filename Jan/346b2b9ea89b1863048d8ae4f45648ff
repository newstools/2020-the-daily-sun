THE United Nations has called for increased international support for Zimbabwe. This comes as eight million people, or about half the population, face hunger. The World Food Programme is planning to double the number of Zimbabweans it assists to 4,1 million but will need over $200 million (R2,8 billion) to meet its needs in the first half of this year alone. “As things stand, we’ll run out of food by end of February,” said Niels Balzer, the programme’s deputy country director in Zimbabwe. “Firm pledges are urgently needed as it can take up to three months for funding commitments to become food on tables.” To meet the increasing hunger needs of the population, the programme was forced to launch an emergency assistance programme in August. Following poor rainfall, the country is likely to face another below average harvest this year. Hilal Elver, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, visited Zimbabwe in November. She saw that women and children were worst hit by the crisis. Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic slump in 10 years. Runaway inflation has put the price of basic goods beyond the reach of most people. The programme reported that bread is now 20 times more than six months ago. Rotational power cuts have been caused by low water levels at Kariba Dam’s hydroelectric power station. About 200 000 metric tons of food are needed to help the 4,1 million Zimbabweans. Balzer said financial support from the international community was desperately needed. “While we have the staff, partners, trucking and logistics for a major surge in Zimbabwe, it’s essential that we receive funding to deliver. So many lives depend on this.” –NEWS24
