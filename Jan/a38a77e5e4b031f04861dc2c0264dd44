Three of South Africa’s music legends will take their fans on a nostalgic journey of authentic local music when they collaborate for A Night with Legends at Carnival City’s Big Top Arena on 1 February 2020. Reliving some of the greatest music moments of our time live on one stage are Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse, Ringo Madlingozi and Tshepo Tshola. Also on the cards is a special musical tribute by Mandla Ntlaks.Presented by Slice Events Management in association with Score Energy Drink, A Night with Legends is a love letter from the best loved and revered musicians in the country and a celebration of some of the biggest hits in South Africa’s history. With careers spanning more than two decades, the legends will perform songs from their impressive repertoire, from Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse’s “Burn Out” and Tshepo Tshola’s “Akubutle” to Ringo Madlingozi’s “Nkqo Nkqo” to name but a few. “We are delighted to have these exceptional artists collaborating on our stage in February. A Night with Legends is a celebration of the tremendous musical talent that exists in South Africa,” says Michelle Smith, Marketing Manager at Carnival City. “This is not only a nostalgic night of music with South African music legends, but it’s also a night of celebration. We’re celebrating the legends while they are still here to share their talent with us, while paying homage to the journey their music has taken us on through the years,” says Masilo Makgato of Slice Events. Tickets, priced at R150 per person, are available at Computicket and Shoprite supermarkets nationwide.
