Kaizer Chiefs star Lebo Manyama scored a last minute winner that must have felt like a spear in the hearts of Golden Arrows supporters at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday afternoon. GOLDEN Arrows gave their all but Chiefs fought very hard even when it looked like a draw was on the cards. Amakhosi have now opened a 10-point lead at the top pf the PSL log table - last week, they played to a 1-1 draw against Black Leopards. Chiefs' win will be sad news for the chasing pack of Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United (who defeated Chippa United 3-0 on Friday). Sundowns, who were involved in a Caf Champions League assignment in Angola, have a game in hand after playing 18 rounds in the league. Chiefs' forwards huffed and puffed against a resolute Arrows defence but deep in injury time, Manyama pounced from a rebound and his goal sent the the fans in the grandstands into a state of frenzy. Arrows coach Steve Komphela, a former Chiefs'coach was very disappointed after the final whistle.
