THERE is concern over the increasing number of South Sudanese refugees and asylum seekers committing suicide in neighbouring Uganda. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees revealed that 19 refugees had taken their own lives in the past year. There were 97 suicide attempts. The figures doubled from 2018, according to the refugee agency. It stated that although suicide was a common issue in the general population in northern Uganda, the increase among refugees in places at local settlements showed a serious need for mental health-care services for people who had fled the crisis in South Sudan. The victims reportedly lost support networks and struggled to make a living in their country of asylum. â€“ CAJ NEWS
