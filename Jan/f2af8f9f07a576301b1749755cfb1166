WHEN neighbours didn’t see the gogo walking around her yard for two days, they thought she may have visited her daughter. But little did they know the gogo was inside her house in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. Her body was discovered last Thursday by a relative who’d gone to visit her.

Her 22-year-old grandson, who had been living with her, has been bust in connection with the murder. Resident Dipuo Molokomme said when they didn’t see the gogo, they thought she had visited relatives. Another resident Simon Mpengase said: “We pray for justice. It’s not acceptable that old people are ill-treated like this.” Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said cops were called to a house by a relative who found the gogo’s decomposed body in a dustbin. The body was in her bedroom. “The murder could have happened a few days before the recovery day.” The suspect was bust on the same day when the body was discovered. He appeared in the Tsakane Magistrate Court last Friday. He’ll appear again soon. READ: 'AFRIKAANS SHOULD BE DROPPED' The gogo was allegedly killed by her grandson (22), who was living with her.
