 A
KwaZulu-Natal man linked to the murder of six people, five of whom were part of
the same family, has been arrested, the police said on Thursday. The
29-year-old suspect, whom the police have not yet named, was arrested on
December 20 by Organised Crime Unit detectives after he was found in possession
of a suspected stolen vehicle, police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said. She added
preliminary investigations showed the vehicle was hijacked in the Marianhill
area in December 2016. The driver had been shot and wounded at the time. "[The
suspect] appeared in the Hammarsdale Magistrate's Court on December 23, 2019,
for possession of a suspected stolen vehicle. He was remanded." Gwala said
detectives had linked him to the murders on December 11, when father Mvumo
Msomi, his son, Dumisani, daughters Philisiwe and Celiwe, and their cousin,
Dumisani Ntuli, were shot and killed at their home in Hammarsdale, Mpumalanga. Their
neighbour, Bongani Ndlovu, was also murdered during the incident, while a
three-year-old sustained injuries. "The
suspect will be profiled to check if he is linked to the Mariannhill carjacking
and attempted murder as well as other serious cases," she added. During the
shooting, a shotgun and 9mm pistol were used. The man
will return to court on January 9 for a formal bail application. SOURCE:
