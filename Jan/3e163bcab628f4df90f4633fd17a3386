THE teenage schoolgirl who was found murdered was discovered by her family’s dog after her family started looking for her themselves. Yesterday the SunTeam reported on the horrific discovery of the 15 year-old who had not made it to school last Wednesday. According to the Sowetan, Leticia Jansen's body was discovered by her family dog on Friday in an open veld not far from her home. Her gogo Lynette Jansen told the paper that Leticia’s older brothers went looking for her after her school and cops failed to help the family. "We had to use a family dog to look for her because we were not getting any joy from the police. "Our dog, Brown, found her lifeless body in an open space. They killed my child before her 15th birthday which was on Saturday," Jansen said. "The police failed us. When we got to the scene, she was still bleeding. "Her face was swollen and when they carried her, it seemed as if all her bones were broken. News24 reports that the family visited the scene on Saturday. It is alleged that school transport left some pupils behind and that they had to walk to school, taking a shortcut through bushes. When Jansen's grandmother reported her missing on Thursday, she was told to bring a photograph of the child before any steps could be taken. The grandmother also went to the school to report that she was missing and there she was told that Leticia was absent from school on the Wednesday - the day she disappeared. With dogs by their sides, the family and members of the community started to search for her until they found her body. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who visited the school, Graceland Education Centre, said that details of her disappearance were still sketchy. Although he was expected to be briefed by representatives of the school, no answers were given to him. "No one could give me answers [to explain] why the learner was not at school on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
