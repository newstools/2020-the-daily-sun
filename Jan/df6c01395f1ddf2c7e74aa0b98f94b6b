The once
wayward midfielder has been snapped by iDiski TV where he will be a Soccer
Analyst for the Youtube sports channel. According
to Khanye, the channel is part of Massiv Metro, a growing, urban radio station.  “They
wanted someone who can talk straight about football. They also wanted someone
who has played the game at the highest level and who understands how to read
and analyse the game,” said Khanye. Khanye will
continue with his role as player/coach for ABC Motsepe League club Ngwaabe City
Motors. “I sat down
with the chairman Kgajane David Masha and we spoke about these new
developments. I hold the chairman in high esteem and I do not want to abandon him.
He took good care of me and I am indebted to him. We had an agreement and he
does not have a problem with me doing this TV gig,” Khanye added. “I started
on Wednesday at the Orlando Pirates v Mamelodi Sundowns game. I will travel to
Johannesburg and other place whenever there will be matches. I have been idling
for many years and now I am happy things are looking up. It looks like it’s
going to be a busy year and I am excited about the future.
