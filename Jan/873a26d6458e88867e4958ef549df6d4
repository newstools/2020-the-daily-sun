UNDEFEATED World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African cruiserweight Akani “Prime” Phuzi rues the lack of local quality opponents in the heavier divisions. The heavyweight, cruiserweight, light heavy and super-middleweight divisions are so thin they do not have more than five rated fighters. Now Phuzi is looking beyond the continent for opponents after he sent his last six African adversaries packing. “There is no competition for me in the cruiserweight division. I’m hoping to get opponents from Europe for my next assignments. Because of the lack of quality opposition I can’t even challenge for the SA title if the current champion (Thabiso Mchunu) decides vacate it,” said Phuzi. “In the heavyweight and cruiserweight divisions the national title no longer carries the weight it used to. The lack of competition has contributed immensely to that situation. “In the cruiserweight we have Thomas Oosthuizen, Kevin Lerena and Mchunu who have more experience than me and are international campaigners. Other guys are below my level and fighting them would be a step back,” he said. However, despite the 25-year-old lamenting about the lack of worthy opponents locally his cross town rival Chris Thompson has been calling for the two to meet for the SA title once it is vacant. But Phuzi has already beaten Thompson twice. “We are looking at the WBA International route. I cannot fight Thompson for the third time, it would be disrespect on my name and record,” he said. “If he wants to lock horns with me again he needs to improve his ring craft. I have heard he is calling my name but what I have seen in his last three fights he is still the same guy I have beaten,” Phuzi. The talented fighter from Limpopo, but based in Gauteng, is a former amateur star who has represented his country on various international boxing events. Phuzi outpointed the Congolese Youssouf Kasango Mwanza to claim the vacant WBA regional crown two years ago and defended it twice.
