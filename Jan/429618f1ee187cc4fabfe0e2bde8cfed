This is the best description for a video dad Adin Walls shared on his YouTube channel of his adopted daughter eating sushi with wasabi. "Eh, burny! Bleh!" she says, then "More!" Despite the wasabi soya sauce burning her mouth, she keeps going back for more, and we don't really understand why - but it's so adorable! Adin told Parent24 "I took the video when she was 2, because she was being so dramatic about the wasabi, even though I knew she liked to eat it. "I just thought it was unusual for a 2 year old to like sushi so much," he said. "Sheâ€™s 7 now, and she still likes sushi!"  https://www.parent24.com/Baby/Toddler_1-2/watch-this-adorable-toddler-cant-get-enough-wasabi-20191122
