HE was called "Gautrain" because of his blistering pace that left MANY defenders as if they were just standing. Segolela was born in Polokwane,Limpopo and he was part of the Orlando Pirates squad that won the treble for two successive years.  When he arrived at Pirates, he struggled to break into the team. He was then loaned out toÂ Bloemfontein Celtic and when he rejoined Bucs, the sky was the limit for the speedy forward. After playing more than 100 matches for the Buccaneers, he was shipped out to Platinum Stars. When his spell with Dikwena came to an end, he then moved back home in Limpopo and registered for Polokwane City.
