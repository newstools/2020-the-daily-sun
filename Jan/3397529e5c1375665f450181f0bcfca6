NHLANHLA Nala is lucky to be alive. The 50-year-old from Chesterville, west of Durban, escaped death yesterday when a truck landed on its side. A load of stones hit and damaged Nhlanhla’s car. The driver apparently lost control after the brakes failed. The truck veered off the road on Ridge View Road in Chesterville and landed on its side. “I got the shock of my life, so I just stopped the car,” he said. “There was no way I could’ve driven off because the stones came from different directions and damaged my car.” Had the stones broken through the windscreen, he could’ve been killed. “I went to hospital because of shock,” said Nhlanhla. “I got the details of the truck driver and will call him to fix my car.” Truck driver Martin Lekolwane said: “Please leave me alone. I’m in hospital.”
