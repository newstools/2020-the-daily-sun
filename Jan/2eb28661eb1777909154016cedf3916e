COMMUTERS who use central line trains started the year on a tough note as the trains are still suspended due to vandalism. Residents of Langa have to walk about 3km to nearby Mutual Station to get trains from Bellville to Cape Town. Metrorail said the large-scale vandalism made operations difficult. Khayelitsha residents are affected most. MyCiti buses and trains in the area were suspended in July. Thulani Mangxola (34) from Langa, who works in Woodstock, said: “I don’t have money to take a taxi. “I bought a monthly train ticket last year because I knew I wouldn’t have money this year, but there are no trains. “I have no choice but to walk to Mutual so I can use my ticket.” He told Daily Sun he’s tired from walking by the time he gets to work. Nozipho Mtsweni from Khayelitsha said she had to get money from a mashonisa so she could go to work. “Things are hard for everyone in January, and trains used to help because they’re cheap. There are no trains and we have to fork out big money for a taxi. “You need R50 per day, yet I get R6 000 salary. A lot of my money goes to transport . I also pay transport fees for my daughter.” Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said the line was damaged by vandalism and they were working to fix it. “Critical areas were destroyed by vandalism. The impact of continuous metal theft, vandalism and the damage of essential infrastructure remains debilitating,” she said. Scott said they were working on fixing the problem.
