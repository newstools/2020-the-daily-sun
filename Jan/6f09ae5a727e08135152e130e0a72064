A botched breast lift left a 30 year old woman looking like a car crash victim. Nicole Reed told The Sun that social media made her feel incredibly self-conscious about her body and she decided cut-price plastic surgery in Turkey. "I had cheap plastic surgery overseas," a friend told me one day. By shopping around, she’d saved thousands of pounds. I'd already had lip fillers and decided I wanted breast implants. I found a clinic in Turkey that'd perform it for about £2,800 - thousands cheaper than the UK or New Zealand she told the publication in an interview. "I booked myself in. I hadn't planned on having it all done in one go, but now I was ticking off surgeries like items on a shopping list. Waking after the seven-hour op, I felt like I'd been hit by a bus. My whole body ached and I was vomiting blood." "A few days later, I noticed the wound on my breast had opened.Lifting up the gauze, I saw it was infected and filled with pus. I went straight to the pharmacist and begged them to help me.After having the stitches removed from the gaping wound, I was prescribed another dose of antibiotics.Feeling I hadn’t received proper aftercare from the clinic in Turkey, I tried to contact the surgeon. But the number no longer connected." she explained.
