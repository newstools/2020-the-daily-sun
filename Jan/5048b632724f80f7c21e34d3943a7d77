FORMER Shembe leader Mduduzi Shembe has vowed to lead congregants to Khenana Mountain, despite a court order that set him aside as the leader. He apparently announced this on Wednesday during the Mdedele service, held at Ebuhleni temple in Inanda, north of Durban.

It was the first sermon delivered by Mduduzi since the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled against him last month. A senior church member who attended the service claimed Mduduzi had said no one would stop him. The source said the former leader had also challenged police to evict him from his temple. His comments come after last week’s rumours that Police Minister Bheki Cele would raid the temple and evict Mduduzi if he defied the court’s decision. Cele’s spokeswoman Lirandzu Themba dismissed the rumours. She said the minister had nothing to do with the church or its issues. Brigadier Jay Naicker said police will be deployed to monitor the walk, just as they do with other major events. READ: MFR SOULS IN SCARY ACCIDENT! Ebuhleni faction spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe said Mduduzi made the announcement on Wednesday and had called on members to be ready for Sunday’s walk. He refused to comment on Mduduzi’s thoughts on the court ruling and described the incident as an internal matter. Mduduzi and his cousin, the late Vela Shembe, had been in and out of court since 2011. Both were announced as the church’s leaders at the funeral of Vimbeni Shembe, Mduduzi’s father.
