THE Charis Missionary Church is pleading with residents of Clayville in Olifantsfontein, Ekurhuleni, to stop terrorising them. On 30 December Daily Sun reported on the war between church members and residents. Residents were demanding a school be built on the land the church had occupied. But church spokesman Masindi Tshamunwe said they were not going anywhere. He said on 31 December, the church was supposed to have a service for more than 20 000 people but the event had to be cancelled. “We tried to communicate with residents but they dismissed us. The truck we use for cleaning was damaged by residents,” said Masindi. He said they wouldn’t move from a place just because someone disapproved. “If they have a problem, they need to take it up with the municipality.” Masindi said in 2015, the City of Ekurhuleni hosted a summit that dealt with land issues for churches and NGOs. “We were told which land was available and the procedures of getting or buying land. We applied and negotiations began in 2017. On 18 December last year, the church signed a nine-year lease.” Clayville residents said they still rejected the church. “We were not even consulted,” said resident Mzwakhe Buthelezi (43). “We don’t need another church. We have more than 10 churches.” Nikita Faku (36) said they didn’t need churches, especially those that made a noise. “We won’t rest until that lease is cancelled,” said Nikita. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said if the church had a legal document showing they owned the land, residents shouldn’t interfere. “It’s like renting or buying a house and your neighbour complains that they don’t like you. They have no say about your space,” said Gadebe. He advised the church to contact the police if they had problems. Gauteng police spokeswoman Mathapelo Peters said they were investigating a public violence case. “If the church experiences more problems, they must alert the police,” she said.
