FOR the past two days, there’s been no teaching and learning at Mariannpark Primary School, west of Durban. But today kids are expected to be back in class. The school was disrupted on Monday after parents turned away teachers, whom they accused of being the cause of the school’s challenges. The school had no principal since the suspension of the previous one towards the end of last year. It also had no SGB. A parent said the teachers now did as they pleased, and that was causing problems. “Several parents who wanted to register their kids on 13 January were turned away by the teachers. The parents were told to come back on 30 January. Why would our kids stay home for the entire two weeks?” The parent claimed on the same day the parents were turned away, the teachers were allegedly having a party. “It’s simple, they must stay home as they’re gambling with our kids’ future.” The problems in the school started in the third term last year after teachers protested, calling for the principal to leave the school. The principal was suspended following MEC Kwazi Mshengu’s visit. This was after the department discovered parents had been teaching their own kids. Another parent said they were not happy with the way the department was handling the matter. “Mshengu promised to investigate and come back to us with a solution, but we’re still waiting. The school reopened without a principal and SGB. All we can see are these teachers who don’t want to work,” said the parent. KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “We ask the parents to be patient with us. We have thousands of schools with more serious problems. Everything is a process. Parents will be given an update once everything has been finalised.”
