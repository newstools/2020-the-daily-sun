As reality shows have taken Mzansi by storm, it is clear that Kwa Mam’Mkhize is one that Mzansi will never stop talking about. Centered around the lives of the Mpisane offsprings plus their stepmother Shauwn Mkhize (formerly Mpisane) the show has had Mzansi wanting more! Kwa Mam’Mkhize debuted on Thursday night, featuring her step-daughter Sbahle and son Andile Mpisane. READ: KWA-MAM'KHIZE DEBUTS TONIGHT! Mkhize, who has recently finalised her divorce from husband Sbu Mpisane, is the daughter of the late ANC veteran and anti-apartheid activist, Florence Mkhize. Mkhize shot to fame and riches was in the early 2000s when her construction company, Zikhulise, amassed a massive fortune through building thousands of low-cost houses in and around the eThekwini Municipality area in Durban and she has since built a fortune for herself and her family. The Mpisane’s multi-million rand house has been something of a landmark in the wealthy north Durban suburb of La Lucia. The house is under 24-hour guard, with security guards posted around the property. In 2017, for Andile's 16th birthday party - which was hosted at the mansion, he was gifted with an R2.3m-valued Mercedes-Benz AMG G63 SUV. Award-winning rapper Nasty C and Babes Wodumo performed at the party. Black Twitter appeared to be in awe of the family’s La Lucia home, cars and lavish lifestyle, which has seen the family grace the front pages in newspapers for years.
