Hey MizzB I AM a 24-year-old woman with two kids. I was in a relationship with the father of my children for six years and he constantly mistreated and cheated on me. Everyone around me always told me about his behaviour but I ignored them for the sake of the kids. Our relationship turned sour and he left me for another woman and I met good a man a few months ago. My problem is that I often think and worry about my ex. ) Mama Hey Mama It’s important for you to understand that NO WOMAN IS EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT SEE HER VALUE. There was nothing that you could have done to make him this way. If a man doesn’t know the quality of partner he wants, he will find himself going with whatever is available to him. It’s important when getting out of a relationship that you allow yourself time to grieve so you don’t find yourself bleeding into new opportunities. You are strong, beautiful and an intelligent woman and when you start valuing and loving yourself, you will enjoy being with a man who will know your worth and allow your kids to inherit positive traits that you model.
