TWO people died
while three others sustained serious injuries when two cars crashed on the N1
South near Mokopane town in Limpopo. The
incident happened on Thursday, when the two vehicles, a Toyota Land Cruiser and
Toyota Yaris crashed. According
to Limpopo' police Spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the driver of Land Cruiser
allegedly lost control of the vehicle and it overturned in the process. The trailer
detached and collided with the vehicle coming from behind. "There
were six occupants in the Land Cruiser, a toddler and a 6-year-old child as
well as four adults.  The male
driver of the Land Cruiser and a woman died on the scene.” “The
6-year-old child and the two adults were taken to hospital. The toddler did not
suffer any injuries. While the three people who were in the other vehicle were
also not injured," he said. Mojapelo said
the cause of the accident that forced the driver to lose control of the car
will be determined by the unfolding police investigations. He further
stated that the front right wheel of the Land Cruiser could not be found at the
accident scene. On Tuesday
night five people died on the same N1 road after a sedan collided with a tanker
truck.
