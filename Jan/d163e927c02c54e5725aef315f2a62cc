DAVID Kodibona believes TV is a waste of his grandkids time. But he said, TV saved their lives when he allowed them to watch cartoons on Saturday. While the kids were watching TV, a bakkie smashed into the kitchen of their shack in Stoffel Park in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. The 64-year-old said he usually made the kids do chores and if they had been washing dishes, the bakkie would have killed them. MLINDO THE VOCALIST IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT! David thanked God that his grandkids were spared and escaped unharmed. He said he was at work when the incident happened and was shocked when he returned home to find that it had been hit by a bakkie. “This is hard for the family as we have just had Christmas and the children are starting a new school year.” David said he almost cried when he saw the car in his shack. SANGOMA DROWNS WITH VILLAGERS' R10K! He told the SunTeam he went to the police station on Saturday to sign an affidavit in which the bakkie owner agreed to fix his property. Bongani Mashabane (27), whose Toyota bakkie smashed into the shack, told Daily Sun he’d fix the shack.
