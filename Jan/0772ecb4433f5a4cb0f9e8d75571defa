HE’S 100 years old and his wife is still lovestruck, and wishes him 20 more years on earth. Moses Zulu from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, celebrated his 100th birthday on Sunday with his family and church members. The madala said it was all thanks to pap and spinach that he has lived a long and healthy life. “As you can see, I walk on my own and my hearing and eyesight are also good. I’m no ordinary madala. I’m as fit as a fiddle,” said Moses. His wife Esther expressed joy in having a healthy husband, who made their old age feel like their 20s.  “My husband is very calm and takes good care of his health. He urges everyone in the house to take care of themselves. He has always been loving. He gives me all the attention I need,” said Esther. Pastor Herbert Rude from Brotherly Mission Church said they were blessed to have such a wise elder in their church.  “He’s been with us for the past 15 years, and I can confidently say he’s helped to get a lot of young people in line,” said Rude. One of the teenagers at the church said they appreciated madala Moses and his contribution to the church.
