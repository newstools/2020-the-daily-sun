CHRIS Hani district has implemented water rationing as dam levels continue to drop in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, due to a lack of rain. The Department of Water and Sanitation said Butterworth and other areas in the Amathole district were most affected. “In the area of Amathole, which includes Butterworth, the reality of the river being dry at the Kei Bridge is what is being faced,” said spokesman Sputnik Ratau. He said the boreholes drilled in the area didn’t yield much water. “In the absence of rain and therefore run-off and recharge of water sources, even the ground water runs out,” he said. “With regards to the situation around Queenstown, the dam level continues to drop due to lack of rain. “The Chris Hani District Municipality has imposed water rationing to assist with water availability over a longer period.” The department will send water tankers, at a cost, to the department. The challenge of the drought can only be permanently resolved by the arrival of much-anticipated rain. Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu urged South Africans use water responsibly. “This is not a small or trivial matter,” she said. “Government, at the level of Cabinet, continues to be seized with the need to alleviate the plight that emerges from this unfortunate act of nature.” ­– NEWS24
