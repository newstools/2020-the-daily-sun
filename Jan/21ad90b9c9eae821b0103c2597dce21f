THE two young brothers have no one to turn to. Their mum died in 2015 and their sister (20) apparently took off and shacked up with a lover. The brothers, aged nine and 13, live in a dilapidated RDP in Bodibe Village, near Lichtenburg in the North West. They don’t have food and the clothes on their backs are the only ones they have. Neighbour Tefo Phadi said: “It’s sad to see kids living under such conditions. “They don’t even have blankets and sleep in a pile of filthy rags. Yet somebody misuses their grant money.” When the SunTeam confronted the sister, she said: “The problem I have with these boys is that they refuse to take a bath. “I use this as a form of punishment. I hate filthy kids.” She said she bought them clothes for the festive season, but withheld them until they cleaned themselves up. The oldest boy denied this, claiming they were denied their grant money and had no proper school uniform. “I worry about my younger brother because I have to make sure he goes to school.” he said. “We don’t want our sister to collect money on our behalf anymore. “We’d rather have a stranger with a good heart do it.” The boy’s little brother said they were scared of living alone without adult supervision. “We live in fear, especially at night,” he said. Said Mama Motswaiso of the North West social development department: “A social worker in the area will be sent for assessment and report to the relevant structure, which will make a decision.”
