THE closure of the local clinic for almost a month has hit patients hard. Intabazwe Clinic in Harrismith, Free State, was apparently shut down by the landlord. He’s allegedly being owed rent money by the provincial health department. Patients who receive treatment at the clinic have been turned away. Many of them are worried as their treatment has been disrupted. Martha Moditse (51) has been receiving high blood pressure treatment at the clinic for three years. “I’m now forced to buy my treatment at a chemist,” she said. Resident Sam Tsotetsi (38) lost his son (6) after he struggled to breath. “I took him to the clinic after an ambulance failed to arrive. I was greeted by a big lock,” he said. “Patients were standing outside, hoping the gates would be opened.” A staff member at the clinic told the People’s Paper: “We report for duty, only to sit under a tree because the gate is closed. “Since we don’t have access to patients’ files, we can’t give them the medication they need.” Acting health spokeswoman Elke de Witt said: “Services in Harrismith are rendered from a permanent structure which is very small. “To improve services, a park home was erected on land rented from the landlord. “According to information, the landlord closed the park home section on 18 December due to non-payment. “However, the main structure of the clinic remains open for primary healthcare services. “The department recognises there are challenges at the moment but has put a contingency plan in place to speedily resolve the matter.”
