Masandawana topped their Group C with 10 points from three victories and one draw. The quarterfinals take place at the end of February. Goals by Thapelo Morena and Sibusiso Vilakazi in the first half did the job for the 2016 PSL champions.But the visitors nearly delayed their qualification when Mohamed Meftah missed a late penalty that could have resulted in a draw.The Brazilians are now left with two matches against Wydad Casablanca at home and Petro de Luanda away.They will now fight for the top spot in the group against the Moroccans.The winner of Group C will play against the runner-up in Group D where there is Esperance , Raja Casablanca, JS Kabyile and AS Vita.The Brazilians have now completed the double over the North African based outfit after defeating them 1-0 in Algiers just before the Christmas recess.Sundowns recorded a 3-0 routine victory over Petro de Luanda of Angola in their opening group game and they now boast a 100% home record.Yesterday, it looked like it was going to be one of those days as they missed plenty of chances before they finally cracked the visitors’ resolute defense.They were eventually rewarded when Morena found the roof of the net from close range, nine minutes before the half-time break.Sibusiso Vilakazi, Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino had their efforts saved by the busy Mohamed Lamine in the Algerians goals. But the visitors found the equalizer against the run of play when Aimen Mahious headed home from a well taken cross a minute before the interval.But the visitors’ joy was short lived as Downs restored their lead a minute later. Vilakazi caught their defense off-guard and slotted his side’s second goal.Lack of concentration by the Downs defense allowed the North Africans to get back in the game and that made Coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane furious because they hadn’t posed any threat throughout the first half up until they found the back of the net.
