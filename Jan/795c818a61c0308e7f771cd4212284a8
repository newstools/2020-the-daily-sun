No load shedding is expected for the rest of the week, despite scheduled maintenance of two major generating units on Thursday, Eskom said. All three units that suffered an unplanned outage as a result of flooding that caused coal handling problems are back online but not at full capacity, the power utility added. Unplanned outages were at 11 780 MW as at 17:30 on Wednesday evening. Although no load shedding is expected, the system is vulnerable and this might change, Eskom said. https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/eskom-no-load-shedding-for-the-rest-of-the-week-20200115
