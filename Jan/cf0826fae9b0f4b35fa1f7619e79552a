Amid unconfirmed reports saying that coach Cavin Johnson has left Black Leopards, the Limpopo based outfit will be out to redeem themselves away when they face Cape Town City on Friday night. On Friday morning, SunSport was tipped by an informant that Johnson has resigned from the club. However, the coach crushed the rumours when was contacted stating that he is in Cape Town with the team for their crunch encounter against The Citizens. “Whoever told you that must be smoking something very strong,” said Johnson who is yet to win a match since he took over the reins in December. “I’m with the team preparing for the match I do not know what you are talking about.” Lidoda Duvha will lock horns with the Mother City-based club at Cape Town Stadium, kick-off at 8pm. Johnson’s charges will be hoping to get their first win in six matches in the league. However, their away record has not been impressive at all and if history is anything to go by, Lidoda Duvha will struggle to have only claimed two away wins in their last 32 top-flight matches, a run dating back to 2012. One of those successes was when they defeated Limpopo rivals Baroka FC 2-1 a year ago, while the other was at Maritzburg United in August. The Venda outfit has been proficient in picking up draws either, aside from those two wins in 32, they also have 22 losses in that time, including their last four on the road this season at Chippa United (0-3), Orlando Pirates (1-3), Highlands Park (1-2) and Bloemfontein Celtic (1-4). Leopards have also managed to get only two Absa Premiership wins in Cape Town in the last 16  years, both coming against Ajax Cape Town in 2007 and 2012.
