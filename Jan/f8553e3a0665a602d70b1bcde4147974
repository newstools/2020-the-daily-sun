Most worldly things are acceptable when only done or used in moderation. Things such as drinking alcohol, sunbathing and smoking shouldn’t be overdone. I’ve been observing with great concern over the festive holidays that some of us have lost our ways. The manner in which some of my neighbours and friends, as well as strangers, drank left me reeling in shock. I think a bigger societal problem we’re not dealing with properly has led to this nonsense. To make matters worse, the age limit for drinking alcohol is rarely ever adhered to. I know of a number of underage drinkers. Some of the kids I saw drinking couldn’t have been 16 – and I was very, very disappointed. In the past, every parent could call a child to order, whether they knew them or not. Guess what? I bet if one dared to try doing that now, some unruly kids could even moer you. As such, I couldn’t confront those drunken kids and give them a tongue lashing, like an adult should. We need to go back to the values that made us good people in the past.
