CONSISTENCY is the only special key for SuperSport United to unlock doors to success as they chase after runaway Absa Premiership log leader Kaizer Chiefs. Amakhosi have opened up a nine points gap between themselves and second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns. United’s cucumber-cool coach, Kaitano Tembo, has maintained his usual composure and stuck to his guns that they are taking it one match at the time. “The gap is too big,” admitted Tembo at the weekend following their 2-0 win against AmaZulu. “We need to concentrate on picking up points and be consistent in winning four or five games in the row. Probably that will help us get closer to them. But as I said, for us it is one game at the time, that is very important. But we have to keep fighting, keep going.” United are third on the log with 31 points, 10 behind Chiefs and one behind second-placed Sundowns. They will surely need to pull off a miracle to zoom past the two clubs that have been on a neck-and-neck race for the better of the first round of the season. While others are huffing and puffing, Chiefs have been true to their form and collected points. They have won 13 matches and lost two in the league from 17 games, while the rest ended in draws. Chiefs have also scored more goals than any other side, 36 in total. “Now we have to focus on our recovery, and luckily we have a week to prepare,” added Tembo ahead of Sunday’s Tshwane derby against Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. Chiefs have Black Leopards away in Thohoyandou on Saturday.
