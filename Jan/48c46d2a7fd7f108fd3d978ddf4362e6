Hey MizzB I’M a 19-year-old guy who recently passed his matric. My friends and I went out to celebrate at the weekend and I ran into this guy who’s been bothering my crush. I came to her rescue and we ended up chilling together and getting really drunk.  I woke up the next morning with a headache and feeling sick. I’m stressed because I can’t remember if we used a condom. What can I do? Hey Man Congratulations on passing your matric! Partying is fun, but when alcohol is involved it can put your life at risk for unplanned and unsafe sex. When unsafe sex is involved, then the risks of unplanned pregnancy and the risk of STIs and HIV is increased. It’s important that you visit your local clinic to get PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) and treatment for possible STDs so that you protect yourself.
