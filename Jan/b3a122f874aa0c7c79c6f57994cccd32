Nick Gordon (30), who was raised by Whitney Houston and was engaged to her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, may have died of an overdose. According to The Daily Mail, who broke this information first, an insider alleged Nick’s friends dropped him off at a hospital on New Year's Day after he had a series of heart attacks.  "It's early days but the suggestion is he was taking drugs with friends and he passed out. They drove him to the hospital, took him inside and then left him there. Whatever you think of Nick and his lifestyle, it’s terribly sad that his supposed friends just dumped him and drove away," said the insider. His family hasn't said anything as regards his cause of death. Nick was found legally responsible for the death of Bobbi Kristina five years ago. The 22-year old Bobbi was found unresponsive in a bathtub in 2012. She never came out of a coma and died six months after the incident. An autopsy showed that she had cocaine, morphine, alcohol and prescription drugs in her system. However, it couldn’t be determined if she killed herself or someone else did. Kristina's family filed a lawsuit against Gordon and accused him of giving her a toxic cocktail before leaving her for dead in a bathtub. He was never criminally charged, but he was told to pay $36 million to the Brown family.He was raised by Whitney from the age of 12 and he started dating Bobbi in 2012.
