BEING on the road over the Christmas period while other people are at home with loved ones isnâ€™t something many would want to do. But Mamelodi Sundowns players and the rest of the staff had no choice as they had a CAF Champions League date with USM Alger in Algeria. However, Downs did not allow that to dampen their spirit in the festive season as they did all they could to keep it alive on the long trip. In a video posted by Downs coach Pitso Mosimane, the players could be seen jamming to Amapiano, a sound that has captivated Mzansi in recent years. With the mood in camp kept positive despite the long travel, Sundowns went on to earn a vital 1-0 away victory in Algeria and they continue to set the pace in Group C.
