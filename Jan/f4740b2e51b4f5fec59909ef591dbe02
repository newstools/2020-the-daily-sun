 Self-confessed
killer Kevin Ndlovu told Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba that he wouldnâ€™t plead
guilty anymore because he didn't commit the alleged crime. The 21-year-old
man appeared in court on Tuesday. The court heard
that the accused allegedly told his mum in June last year that he killed his
girlfriend Nokulunga Mbatha (22) and buried the lifeless body inside the suitcase
before burying it in a shallow grave. Nokulunga was
reported missing on 2 February. Ndlovu told
the court that he wouldn't plead guilty to the crime because he allegedly didn't
kill her. "I beg
to be released on bail to look after my kids and I know that the investigation
will take time to complete." "My
mum will accommodate me in Gauteng were my life will not be danger," he
said in court. State
prosecutor Musa Makhubela told the court that DNA is still outstanding, and
bail wasn't opposed. "We have
again sent the remaining body of deceased to forensic lab and we hope if we can
postpone this case until March maybe we can have results to complete police
investigation." Magistrate
Fortune Mhlaba said the case had been postponed many times but there was still
no conclusion of the investigation. "After
the hearing state and defense evidence, the accused is a suitable candidate to
be released on bail and as such bail is granted at R5000 this case is postponed
again until to 26 March for further police investigation," said Mhlaba.
