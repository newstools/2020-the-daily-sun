BLACK Leopards have not moved an inch after their embarrassing 4-2 humiliation at the hands of Bloemfontein Celtic in the Free State on Sunday. Lidoda Duvha run the risk of going down if they continue failing to collect points. Leopards have not won a match in five outings â€“ drew 0-0 with AmaZulu, lost 3-1 to Orlando Pirates, lost 2-1 each to Highlands Park and Chippa United. Their troubles are likely to continue this coming Saturday where they have log leaders, Kaizer Chiefs, at home in Thohoyandou. This is a must-win for them if they are to turn the tables, and maybe disrupt Chiefs good run of form. The club bosses were under the illusion that their problems lie on the technical bench, but indications are that they have misread their troubles, with their latest bashing at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium putting pressure on them. It was actually an interesting match to watch where six goals were scored during this time of the season, which now calls for club chairman David Thidiela to use effectively the current transfer period, which ends on 31 January. Their new coach Cavin Johnson must be finding it hard to get the team organised after reports of the dressing room divisions, as well as allegations of interference. Siphelele Luthuli was first to score for Celtic, before Sepana Letsoalo six minutes later while and Menzi Masuku, netted five minutes before the break. Letsoalo completed his brace 10 minutes into the second stanza and Leopards scored through Chris Katjiukua and Tshwarelo Bereng.
