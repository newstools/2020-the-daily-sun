Kaizer Chiefs star George Maluleka has the honour of sharing his birthday with Amakhosi. As the Soweto giants celebrate their 50th anniversary tomorrow, Maluleka will be celebrating his 30th birthday. Tomorrow is a special day for Maluleka and Amakhosi, but the former AmaTuks star has downplayed his birthday to allow the club to shine. Maluleka said it’s an honour to turn 30 on the day that one of the biggest clubs in the country is celebrating a huge milestone. Said an excited Maluleka: “I share a birthday with the biggest club in the country, but tomorrow is not about me. I’m not bigger than the club.  Tomorrow we are celebrating the club’s 50th anniversary and everything must be about the club not my birthday.”
