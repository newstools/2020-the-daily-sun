JAPHTA Cele has promised to fix his past mistakes! The 39-year-old ex-con from Soshanguve block BB, Tshwane, was in prison for more than 13 years. He said he’s been working to redeem himself ekasi since he was released in June. He wants to help young men not to end up in jail. Japhta said he was a troubled child while growing up, and that’s why he ended up with a criminal record. “What I did was terrible and I regret it every day. After my release, I decided to help young people stay away from crime,” said Japhta. “The only way was to use my talent in music and the skills I learnt in prison.” Japhta started his own music production company, Japhta Communication and Media. He said he helps young people record music and promote it around Tshwane for free. For now, his focus is gospel. Japhta has been able to work with more than 10 young men. “I lost my way because I had no one to guide me. “I believe I wouldn’t have done what I did if I had someone showing me the right way. “However, that’s no excuse to commit crime.” Japhta said he went to prison carrying the magistrate’s words when he was sentenced. “The magistrate said: ‘Japhta, go there and study’, and I did that. “Now it’s time for me to make amends by playing my part in my community.”
