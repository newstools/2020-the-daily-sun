POLICE Minister Bheki Cele is satisfied with cops’ work during the festive season. He was speaking at the KZN police offices in Durban yesterday. He said even though they did not provide the numbers yet, crime stats showed a decrease compared to the same period in 2018. “For example in Western Cape, we noticed a decrease for the first time in five years,” said Cele. He said they confiscated 4 821 illegal firearms through police raids and roadblocks. “These firearms don’t form part of the amnesty we’ve opened until May,” he said. Cele said what still worried them was that they arrested a total of 24 827 drunk drivers on Mzansi roads during the period. “This shows that despite the campaigns we do to teach people about drinking and driving, they still don’t want to listen. This number has gone up by 4 000 compared to 2018,” said Cele. He said they closed a total of 6 124 shebeens countrywide, and 2 000 of them were in the Eastern Cape. He said even though the number of murders had gone down, they noticed most of them were committed over weekends. He said hijacking still took the lead when compared to murder. Cele said on 1 January, they arrested 223 illegal immigrants in two hours on a Durban beach. “They had no papers, completely undocumented, nothing,” said Cele. He thanked residents for working with the police to fight crime.
