Prophet Mboro wants to pray for the president, Cyril Ramaphosa.He’s inviting  everyone in an urgent prayer for the first citizen of the country, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He has been live on Facebook since 12.  He told Daily Sun that God has revealed certain things about Mzansi’s 2020 and more about the country’s president. He said he will need strength as he’s the pilot of Mzansi.“There’ll be more instability than 2019. We’re going to see more protests, more lives being lost, more job loses, hunger, disasters and we’ll move from this climate change to worse,” said Mboro.“The president needs to stand up and turn things around, this will happen through God,” he added. He said through all these disasters facing Mzansi, there’s still hope. “As a prophet, when things go wrong, I can’t run away from my own country to green pastures, I need to be here to help,” said Mboro.“Prophets know everything that happens in this country. It’s our job to ensure that we bring it to light,”He said the president needs to expect a lot of betrayal and the country needs to be ready to help him with ideas.“We want to see unity in the presidency. I have a tender with Jesus and I’m ready to help him through God,” he said. He said the president needs to stand and deal with matters. “Mzansi will help him in dealing with the issues,” he said. He said further stated that there are people without land, people are poor and Mzansi has no idea who’s responsible for the failure of the economy.“We need programs that will better people’s lives. All we see is alcohol and the entertainment industry is booming,” he said.
