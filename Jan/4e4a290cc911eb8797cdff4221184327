PRETORIA
cops have arrested four suspects in Olievenhoutbosch, following attacks on
several shops on Sunday. The
suspects were arrested after they were found in one of the shops that were
attacked on Sunday evening, by a group of people. “An
unconfirmed number of shops were damaged and some set alight,”Police
spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said. Peters said
comes after members of the public order police attended to the initial incident
in Olievenhoutbosch, where a group of people went on the rampage and raided a
number of shops alleged to be selling muti.  “At this
point, the group is said to have gone into the shops, removed muti-products and
set the products alight just outside these shops. Police were able to disperse
the group,” added Peters. It is then
reported that an even bigger crowd started later in the evening and attacked
and burnt some shops that are part of a chain of stores known to be selling
muti. The group
allegedly became violent and attacked a police nyala and the cops responded by
firing stun grenades and rubber bullets. Cops then
found another group reportedly looting a shop and arrested the four suspects.
