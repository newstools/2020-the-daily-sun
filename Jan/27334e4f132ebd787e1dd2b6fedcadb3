Bafana Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu on Thursday landed in Spain ahead of his imminent transfer to La Liga side Mallorca from Ligue 1 outfit Amiens SC. The 27-year-old will become only the sixth South African to play in the Spanish top-flight to follow in the footsteps of his fellow countrymen such as Benni McCarthy, Nasief Morris and most recently Tsepo Masilela. Spanish media captured images of Zungu arriving in Spain at 20:30 local time as he is set to finalise his move to the La Liga side ahead of the transfer deadline. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the transfer will be an initial loan deal until the end of the season with Amiens receiving €500 000 with the option of making the transfer permanent for an additional €5 million.Mallorca will be hoping that Zungu can inspire them up the La Liga table as they currently sit in 17th position on 18 points after 21 games played.
