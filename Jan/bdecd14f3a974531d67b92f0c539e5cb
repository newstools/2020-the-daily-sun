MOST schools opened without a hitch on Wednesday. But pupils at Zingisa Intermediate School in Kimberley arrived to a burning school. A staff member found the admin block on fire when reporting for duty at 7am. Ten rooms had been eaten by flames by the time firefighters arrived. Textbooks, equipment and furniture were destroyed. Witness Thabo Mathibe said: “There was nothing we could do. “The fire was too strong. We hope it won’t affect the academic year.” Parent Sipho Mosikari was walking his daughter to school when he saw fire trucks. “We had to wait until the fire had been put out so the children could go to class. “The academic year started off on a bad note and I hope books were not destroyed.” Northern Cape education spokesman Geoffrey van der Merwe said: “Besides damage to the building, textbooks, equipment and furniture were also destroyed. “Fortunately, the school has two admin blocks and the opening of the school was not affected. “We’re still awaiting a detailed report on the extent of the damage and estimated costs. “The department commends the Sol Plaatje fire brigade for extinguishing the fire before further damage was caused.” Captain Bashoabile Kale said: “We’re investigating a case of arson after the school caught fire. “At this stage no foul play is suspected. No injuries were reported. Investigations continue.”
