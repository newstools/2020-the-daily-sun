MZANSI’S national Under-23 coach David Notoane wants
the poster boy of South African football Percy Tau to be a part of his Olympic squad. Notoane says if Egypt is taking Mo Salah to the Games,
why should Young Bafana leave their most popular and influential footballer
behind? Notoane confirmed that he is intending to fill a left
back position and Tau as part of his three over-age players for the Olympic
Games starting in Tokyo, Japan from 24 July until 9 August. Notoane says Tau, who plays for Club Brugge in the
Belgian league, is the hottest property in local football. He is crossing his
fingers that he will be released by his club as the Olympic Games does not fall
under the Fifa international calendar. Notoane said: “If Egypt wants Mo Salah to boost their
squad, why should we leave Tau behind. If he is fit and available, we will take
him to Japan.  Let’s face it, Tau is an important player for club and
country, and it would be good for the youngsters to have him in the
team.”
