BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt can’t wait to have new striker Bienvenu Eva Nga on the pitch. Frustrated by his blunt strikers, Hunt has added the Cameroonian arrow to his attacking bow with hope of better luck. The Students find themselves sitting precariously in third spot in the Caf Confederation Cup group C with two points. “I can’t believe the chances we are missing. It’s a bit upsetting,” admitted Hunt. “But look, we have a new striker. He was a top scorer at Costa De Sol. He is young, he has also played in Portugal. “Look, we give our all. We play like hell. But if you don’t score, you don’t score. We had the same problem in the Champions League. We played Al Ahly, we didn’t score in two legs. It was the same in the other matches.So we haven’t scored a goal in 12 matches. It’s 0-0, 0-0… 1-0. What must I do? Maybe we should swap players, play strikers at the back and defender upfront.” Despite the poor form in the Confederation Cup, Hunt is still hopeful guts and determination will Wits through in the group stages. He added: “We still have three games to go, two away. We played really well in Mali. We had two penalties not given. I’m not scared by the away games. We can beat Al Nasr away.“But obviously we need to strengthen our attacking department. One main striker has scored one goal in 17 games. I mean what chance have you got?”
