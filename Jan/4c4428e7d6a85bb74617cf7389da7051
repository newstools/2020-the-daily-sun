SHE attends funerals and weddings wearing an apron and helps in the kitchen. On 21 December the so-called “apron thief” gatecrashed a funeral in Protea North, Soweto, and allegedly stole an iPhone 6. A frustrated Zodwa Mabaso (71) said everyone thought the thief was part of the family. She said the woman served them after they buried their family member. “No one suspected anything. She was dressed properly and wearing an apron like everyone else,” she said. “No one thought of questioning her. She was very respectful. You wouldn’t suspect she was a thief. “Our families are big and some relatives meet for the first time at funerals. We didn’t see this one coming.” When Zodwa was about to leave she wanted to save someone’s number and realised her phone was gone. “When we questioned the girls who went in and out of the room where I kept my phone, the thief was gone. The phone was eventually tracked to a wedding in Diepkloof,” she said. “One of the girls went into the church to check if the apron thief was there because police didn’t want to interrupt the wedding.” She said the thief was there, wearing the same clothes and apron she had on at the funeral. The thief fled before she could be caught. Another victim, Joseph Khoza (37) from Protea Glen, said he lost his phone and wallet a month ago at a cousin’s wedding. “We didn’t know her. When we questioned her she disappeared,” he said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said a case of theft was opened.
