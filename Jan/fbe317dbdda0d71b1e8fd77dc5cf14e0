BY the looks of things 2020 will be a great year for petrol heads. Yes, I know some of you petrol heads think I’m referring to the 2020, which is the Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTI that was nicknamed the 2020. While we still on that Golf topic, the new Golf 8 GTI will finally be landing on South African shores in the fourth quarter of the year. It’s reported that the GTI will be the first derivative to arrive on our shores, while the rest of the derivatives will follow later on. When the other models arrive, they are expected to be sold in DSG mode only.  Well… the GTI will not be the only Hot hatch arriving in the country as the beast of a hatch from Korea will also make its mark. The Hyundai i30N is expected to land in the second quarter of the year. Hyundai says the GTI rival was developed to "push the limits and discover how much fun can be had behind the wheel". That remains to be seen even though, in video that have gone viral on social media – this hot hatch will give the GTI a run for its money.  The Mini JCW GP will also be landing in the third quarter, packing 225 kW and 450 Nm of torque from the twin-turbocharged 2.0-litre mill. With the limited number run, Mini JCW GP is reported that it will be the fastest and most powerful mini ever produced.  And finally, the good-looking Toyota Corolla hatch arrived last year already, but the much sexier Corolla sedan is expected to land in Mzansi in the first quarter of the year. The Corolla has more than 50 years of being in production and has sold off more than 44.1-million units worldwide. It will be offered with the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder mill that pushes out about 126 kW and 205 Nm of torque.
