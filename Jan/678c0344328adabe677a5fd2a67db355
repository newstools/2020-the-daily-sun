Players of today are always wearing headphones, always on their cell-phones on Social Media or listening to music by themselves. That does not help build a team spirit at all.  Kaizer Motaung used to play cards with the likes Zebulon "Sputla" Nhlapo, Teenage Dlaldla, Leonard "Wagga Wagga" Likoebe and Slyvester "City" Kole. Former Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba once threatened that he will take the players'cellphones and iPods away because the players were not bonding because they were not united as everyone was doing their own thing on their cell-phones.
