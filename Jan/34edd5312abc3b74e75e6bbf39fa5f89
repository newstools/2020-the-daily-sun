R&B SINGER Cici has love on her mind. This was the sentiment among her friends, who said the ex-lover (real name Busisiwe Thwala) of record label boss Arthur Mafokate “is very happy”. Cici’s relationship with the 999 Music head honcho came to a public bitter end after a domestic abuse scandal. But the singer’s friends said her bitter past was the stuff of memories. This as she’s found happiness in the loving arms of rugby analyst Puledi Manamela, they said. Puledi is a partner at sports services firm, Selaki Sports Leisure, and an accredited agent with the South African Rugby Union. Said an insider: “She’s finally found the man of her dreams, who treats her like a queen.  “They hooked up a while ago and have been happy since. “They’ve worked hard to keep their relationship away from the media, but good things are hard to keep a secret.” Another insider claimed Puledi stood by Cici during her “break-up fiasco” with Arthur. Insisted the source: “He was there for her through trying times, when she sought justice, and that strengthened their relationship. “He loves her and she loves him. They’re happy together.” The third source was adamant that Puledi “is ready to say, ‘I do.’ ” to the Iqiniso singer. “Things between the pair are so serious. Puledi is ready to send elders to Ladysmith, KZN, where the star is from to negotiate ilobolo. “He’s madly in love with Cici and can’t wait to make her his wife. “This is why he’s already thinking about tying the knot.” Puledi declined to comment saying he is not the one who should be answering the question but Cici. Cici said she doesn’t know what the SunTeam is talking about.
