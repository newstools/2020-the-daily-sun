PRINCE Kaybee’s fans sent him love and well wishes after learning he was sick. The star had to miss his performance at the Victoria Falls Carnival in Zimbabwe on New Year’s Eve and took to Twitter yesterday to apologise. “I’d like to apologise to everyone at Vic Falls for not showing up. Got to my hotel, started vomiting and collapsed,” he wrote. “Promoter came to check up on me and a doctor was called immediately.” Fan Thabo Aubrey Monare replied with a message wishing him a speedy recovery. “You may have your plans but God directs your steps. There are no coincidences. Get well but give glory,” Thabo wrote. Snenthemba wrote: “I’m sending a little angel your way to shower you with love and care. “Your crush wishes you a very speedy recovery and a happy new year.” Sellwane said Prince Kaybee worked too hard and needed to relax. “You need to do a pregnancy test. I’m just kidding. You work too hard and, of course, the game requires that you do. But I always find that entertainers generally work themselves to the bone. Take it easy, bro, for your own sake,” Sellwane tweeted. Lerato Love said Kaybee’s body probably just needed to adjust to being in a new country. She said she hoped he’d get better soon and make Mzansi dance again. “Bodies adjust differently when entering countries. Your body needed to adjust to it first. I hope it’s nothing major.”
