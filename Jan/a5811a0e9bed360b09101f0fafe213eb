As their big day draws near, the lovebirds pulled out all the stops for their extravagant groomsmen party at the weekend. Mzansis's power couple, Somizi Mhlongo and Mohale Motaung, are sparing no expense to make sure their highly-anticipated white wedding is one to remember. The couple had their traditional wedding in September, and it was nothing short of AMAZING! READ: PICS: SOMIZI AND MOHALE'S TRADITIONAL WEDDING! The white themed with a touch of gold party was hosted at Centurion's luxurious boutique, River Meadow Manor. Renowned musician and close friend Vusi Nova, as well as the couple's friends TT Mbha and Leeroy were in attendance and were unveiled as their groomsmen. The long, breathtaking and extravagantly decorated table with gifts for their groomsmen had everyone breathing through the wound! Somizi also penned down a powerful and heartwarming message for his groomsmen; asking them to stand next to him when he gets hitched on his big day. Somizi's obsession with Red Buttoms was also palpable as he asked one of his guests to wear red buttons in order to add finesse to their group photo on the big day.
