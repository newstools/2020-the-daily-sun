THREE matrics will represent Mzansi at the Asia Youth International Model United Nations from 15 to 18 February in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Nhlanhla Mduna (17), Puseletso Lefakane (17) and Katleho Mthenjane (17), all from Tlhatlogang Seconday School in Soweto, will take part in the programme. It will help them gain leadership skills and learn more about cultural diversity. Nhlanhla said they’d be given tasks that would help them solve issues facing the country, including gender-based violence and abuse. “This opportunity will increase my mental capacity. I’ll become a strong leader who can take his place in the community,” he said. “I never thought this would happen to me but I’m thankful.” He said he wanted to study biokinetics which deals with health. “I want to help my community,” he said. His long-term plan is to start an organisation that will build young people’s leadership skills. Puseletso said she couldn’t believe she was chosen out of 11 000 applicants. “This is a dream come true. “Being able to represent South Africa proves to me that my dreams are valid and I’m going there so I can make a future contribution. It means a lot to me and my community,” she said. The pupils asked for help in paying for accommodation and a conference toolkit which includes clothes to be worn as well as diaries. They said any donations would be appreciated. According to the pupils, Vodacom was sponsoring their flight tickets.
