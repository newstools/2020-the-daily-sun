A goal at the start of the game and one at the death saw Chippa United beat Black Leopards 2-1 in an Absa Premiership clash at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday. It was the Chilli Boys' fourth victory in six of their Premiership matches as they continue to climb the PSL table under head coach Norman Mapeza. The visitors could not have asked for a better start to the encounter as Thabo Rakhale gave them the lead with a fabulous strike after just 17 seconds. The attacking midfielder picked up the ball up close to the halfway line and then went on a mazy run before producing a rasping long-range shot that beat home goalkeeper Rotshidzwa Muleka. Lidoda Duvha were stunned but rallied back and started to dominate proceedings but could not find a leveller before the half-time break. The hosts continued to control most of the game after the interval and found the equaliser in the 55th minute as Lesedi Kapinga found space in the penalty area and slotted the ball past Chippa shot-stopper Veli Mothwa. Leopards, spurred on by a large home crowd, were looking the most likely winners but Mothwa made several outstanding saves to keep the scoreline level. Chippa then won it with virtually the last kick of the game after a counter-attacking move saw Silas Maziya sent clear on goal and the winger made no mistake as he slotted past a desperate Muleka.
