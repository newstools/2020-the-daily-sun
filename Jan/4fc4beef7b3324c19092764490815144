Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi on Sunday visited the distraught family of Keamohetswe Seboko who allegedly drowned in a hostel swimming pool at Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesburg on Wednesday. His family believes there may have been an element of bullying involved after marks were found on his body. "There are a lot of things that are questionable, but the school can't give answers," Seboko's aunt, Kgothatso Stayi, told News24. "When the school was asked who was looking after the children at the swimming pool, they said the caretaker. So, we are concerned about how the caretaker is taking care of the learners," she said.Stayi also wanted to know where the teacher in question was at the time of the incident. "The principal is saying that the teacher was with the learners at the swimming pool, but how can he or she not see the body left in the swimming pool if he was there." Stayi told News24 they needed answers. Lesufi vowed to expel school staff if they were found to have been negligent while looking after the pupils. "Where it is staff-related negligence, the department will take action," he said. "If there are learners who were involved, a disciplinary hearing will be held, if you need to be expelled or banned within the schooling facility, we will do so. That is non-negotiable," Lesufi told the media shortly after his meeting with the family of the 13-year-old.Lesufi bemoaned the fact that he had spent more time comforting grieving families than doing what his department was tasked with. "I can't be issuing death certificates, I need to be issuing report cards and information that builds the education system," he said. "We are turning our schools into mortuaries and it can't be like that, we must stop that."  https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/watch-we-are-turning-our-schools-into-mortuaries-says-lesufi-as-seboko-family-seek-answers-over-pool-death-20200119
