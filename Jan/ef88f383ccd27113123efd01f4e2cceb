According to reports, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was informed of their deaths yesterday. Soon afterwards, spokesman Steve Mabona sent out a brief statement confirming the news. Lesufi dropped everything and rushed to the school to meet the staff. “We’re going to the school with the MEC to support them and get more details about this incident. We’ve already sent our psycho social unit to provide more support to the teachers, pupils and everyone at the school. Local pastors were said to have already visited the school,” said Mabona. The latest tragedy came just a day after Lesufi attended the memorial service for Parktown Boys’ High School pupil Enoch Mpianza (13), who drowned at an orientation camp two weeks ago. This month, 13-year-old Keamohetswe Seboko also drowned in the swimming pool at Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesburg. READ: WATCH: PEOPLE LOOT CASH VAN!
