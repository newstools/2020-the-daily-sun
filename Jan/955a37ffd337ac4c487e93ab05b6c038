MAYOR Bambezakhe Goya recently visited the Ntsumpula brothers to see how they could be assisted. This comes after Daily Sun published a story last week about how Khaya (19) and Philasande (20) went to bed on empty stomachs. The mayor of Ingquza Hill Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape said: “We’re grateful to the media for bringing this to our attention. We didn’t know about these boys. “We’ll be writing to human settlements because the situation we saw is painful.” Goya urged residents to also take care of the boys. “These are your kids. Continue the good work you’ve been doing.” The mayor encouraged the brothers to focus in school. “If you’re having challenges going to school, we’ll organise transport for you,” he said. Thabile Mtolo of the Human Settlements Department said the MEC directed his office to assess the boys’ home after they had been assisted with food parcels. The boys can now go to school as Nana Qokolweni, owner of Italian Tavern in Delft in Cape Town, and Zandile Kente from Uitenhage, provided money to buy uniforms. Former councillor Phazamile Ngxamile bought them clothes. Neighbour Nomadikane Vakutshiwo was grateful to Daily Sun for helping the boys. Philasande said: “We wouldn’t be where we are today had it not been for Daily Sun. “Thanks for publishing our story and to all who helped us.”
