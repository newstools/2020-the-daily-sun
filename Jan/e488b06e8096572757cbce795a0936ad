CASTER AND WIFE CELEBRATE THEIR THIRD WEDDING ANNIVERSARY The former football stars wore white T-shirts with “No to Bail” written on them. Kenny Makara, formerly with Bloemfontein Celtic, said: “We want to address social problems such as alcohol and drug abuse, as well as violence.” Former Bafana Bafana defender Edward Motale said: “We want to be there for victims of abuse. “Gender-based violence is getting out of hand.” Outside court, Nthabiseng’s mum Maria Sitai and her brother Radge (50) told Daily Sun Nthabiseng moved in with Maria in February.  She said one Saturday evening, two gunmen shot Nthabiseng four times. “Two men stormed into the kitchen and I rushed to the bedroom,” she said. She said the men shot Nthabiseng in the lower body. When she was discharged from hospital, said Maria, Nthabiseng was so terrified she moved to a secure gated estate in Meyersdal, Ekurhuleni. Investigating officer Sergeant Molefe Phadu previously told the court in the past Matome had attempted murder case against his withdrawn. He was denied bail in October but reapplied to be set free in November. Matome has been charged with attempted murder. Police last year had to reconstruct the attempted murder docket against his after it went missing a day after he was denied bail. The docket was allegedly stolen from a prosecutor’s office.
