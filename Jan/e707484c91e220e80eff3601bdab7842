In the 90s, almost  everyone lusted after former Pirate Steve "Chippa" Lekoelea  — his killer abs, good sense of style, popularity with the ladies, music and mostly his skills when it came to the pitch. He remained one of the best midfielders. But, he had his share of controversy including several run-ins with the law, his love for firewater, and strings of bad publicity including public fights. Packing on some pounds can happen to everyone — even to our favourite celebrities too. But judging by these pictures Steve is living his best life in the Vaal. The former soccer star was snapped during an outing with his friends at Lechaba’s  Lounge in the Vaal.
