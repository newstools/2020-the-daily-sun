MANY people love and listen to the music of Nurse Matlala (49). She’s released nine albums but still lives in a one-roomed house! “People should know that when they buy pirated CDs they’re killing musicians,” she told Daily Sun. Piracy has left her angry and poor. The legendary Tsonga music singer can’t even afford to pay rent for her room in Diepkloof zone 2, Soweto. Nurse said she’s a celebrity who’s living a shameful life. “People sometimes laugh at me. This is hurting and life is difficult,” she said. Nurse, who’s originally from Thapane in Limpopo, started singing in 1989. She wishes to one day buy her own car. The mum of two said she often thinks of quitting music, but her fans encourage her to continue singing as they love her songs. Nurse won the Best Xitsonga Traditional Album at the Satmas with Njekisoni, released in 2008. She said: “I’m a woman who’s full of love and I like music, but it hasn’t paid me enough to live a decent life.” Nurse released her 11-track album Xidlodlo last month. The songwriter, dancer and choreographer started her career in 1988 as a backing vocalist and dancer for the late Peter Teanet. In 1995 she was backing vocalist and dancer for disco king Penny Penny on his album. Shaka Bundu. She has collaborated with Brothers of Peace and Kabelo Mabalane. Nurse continues to collaborate, perform and dance for different artists. She has toured France, Germany and Australia. She was signed with Sumthyn Music in 2017 where she released the album Tshamela Nkambane.
