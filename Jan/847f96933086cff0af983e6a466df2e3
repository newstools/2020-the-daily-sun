Lip filler procedures have become a huge trend in the beauty market but not all people who went through it have something positive to say. Lip fillers, also known as lip augmentation, is a type of procedure that aims to increase lip fullness through enlargement using fillers such as hyaluronic acid, fat or implants. Not all of these procedures end up well as some people are left with with tissue losses and other side effects. For 22-year-old beauty blogger Cassidy Valentine, lip fillers nearly cost her lips. Cassidy told The Sun thatÂ her lip nearly fell off after hyaluronic acid was wrongly injected into an artery by a London beautician.  The Sun reports that within hours of the "botched" treatment, Cassidy was in agonising pain and terrified, with her lips swelling up rapidly. By the next morning, they were black and blue. Fortunately a kind doctor came to her rescue by injecting her for free with an enzyme that dissolves acid after they failed to "find a pulse" in her swollen lip.
