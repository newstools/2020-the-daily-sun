KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has confirmed that the club are ready to cut ties with Ghanian midfilder James Kotei. Kotei, who arrived at the beginning of the season from Tanzanian side Simba SC, has failed to make a competitive appearance for the Amakhosi. As a result, the 26-year-old is set to make way, leaving one more foreign spot for Chiefs to fill. Speaking after his side’s convincing 3-0 win over Cape Town City on Saturday, Middendorp said he did not even know the whereabouts of the wantaway midfielder. "Actually, I can't really give you an answer on where you should or could be satisfied. He was not at the training session today (Sunday)," said Middendorp. "Yesterday, he was also not, so that's the first part. I don't know where he is or what is on stake." Chiefs have reportedly already found a replacement for Kotei in Kenyan midfielder Anthony Akumu. Akumu, who was released by Zambian giants ZESCO at the beginning of the year, has been heavily linked with a move to the Glamour Boys. Middendorp confirmed that Chiefs are in the market for Kotei’s replacement, hinting a deal could happen sooner rather than later. “He (Kotei) is a player who hasn’t made it so far for different reasons and so we have to decide,” added Middendorp. “I haven’t seen any progress in different areas. There is a chance to bring another one in with a certain strength and that is what will obviously happen.”
