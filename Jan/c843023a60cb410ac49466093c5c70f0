The deputy president of the ANC and the country, David Mabuza, said President Cyril Ramaphosa was misled when he was told there would be no load shedding before the January 13. The country has been hit, yet again, by a round of rolling blackouts, despite promises from Ramaphosa that there would be no load shedding throughout the festive season. While out interacting with people during a walkabout in Diamond Pavilion Mall in Kimberley, where the ANC is hosting its annual January 8 celebrations, Mabuza was asked about government's response to the latest wave of power cuts. "They’ve misled the president, but right from the day we went there with the president I insisted on maintenance. Maintenance of these power stations is very important," Mabuza told journalists when asked if Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Eskom board had misled the president. The deputy president said the Eskom board had been "struggling to get things right", noting that there was the added challenge of operating without a full-time chief executive at one stage.
