MISS Ximhungwe 2020 Precious Sibuyi wants to tackle problems facing girls in rural areas. She said this at her crowning ceremony at Lillydale Church of Christ in Mpumalanga on Sunday. The 16-year-old grade 11 at Madlala High School said a lot of girls in rural areas fall pregnant at a young age, as a result of being involved in alcohol and substance abuse. “It’s always been my dream to be part of the solution regarding challenges faced by young people,” she said. “After winning this tittle, I think my dream has come true as I’ll be able to make a difference in communities.” This is her second title after she was crowned Miss Justicia 2019. “My plan is to share ideas with the youth, especially girls, so we can help reduce drug abuse and teenage pregnancy. “I believe if we can start a dialogue and meet after school, this may also help them stay away from trouble. “I also want to teach them about entrepreneurship so they can learn how to generate extra cash and avoid dating older men in return for the good life and expensive clothes.” Organiser Themba Khosa said the pageant was aimed at raising young girls to be leaders in their community. “We’ll continue to host these events to make a difference in our communities,” he said.
