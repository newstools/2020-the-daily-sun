Hey MizzB I AM 25 years old and am in a relationship with a woman I dearly love. The problem is that every time she goes out partying with her friends, she always cheats and lies to me. And when I confront her, she’d say she needed to cheat so she wouldn’t get bored with me. I don’t want to be alone and sometimes think of taking my own life. Please help. ) Guy Hey Guy You’re in a toxic relationship with a person who does not respect your heart or feelings. You don’t have the power to turn a promiscuous person into a faithful partner. Instead, you will find yourself emotionally and mentally strained as the success and happiness of the relationship depends completely on you. You have lost yourself in this woman and that may be where your pain is rooted. Her behaviour also puts you at risk of contracting STIs and HIV. When you know your worth and what you want from life, you will be empowered to make a decision that’s right for you. Let’s talk more.
