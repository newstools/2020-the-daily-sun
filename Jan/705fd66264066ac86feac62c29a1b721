MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has revealed why midfielder Lucky Mohomi could remain at the club beyond the January transfer window. The 28-year-old from Mamelodi has been starved of game time at Chloorkop and would have been looking to secure a move away from the club this month in search of regular game time. Mohomi is yet to make an official appearance for Downs, despite their hectic schedule which sees them take part in five different competitions. His coach, Mosimane, has revealed that potential deal for Mohomi to join Tshwane rivals SuperSport United this month, has fallen through due to reasons unknown to him. “They (SuperSport) wanted Lucky Mohomi. They pulled out of the deal. I don't know why," confirmed Mosimane. The two Tshwane outfits have had some encounters recently in the transfer window with Downs’ pursuit of versatile United star Aubrey Modiba being the headline. Matsatsantsa managed to stand firm and refused to sell their star man, whom they were able to convince to sign a new long term contract. Whether that could have had an impact on Mohumi’s failed move the other way, is anybody’s guess. “It’s football. You try and get a certain player but you can’t always get what you want,” added Mosimane.
