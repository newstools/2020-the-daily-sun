CHIPPA United coach Norman Mapeza has a plan up his sleeves to stop high riding Orlando Pirates dead on their tracks. He emphasised that his charges will need to be mentally and physically strong if they are to hand Bucs new coach Josef Zinnbauer his first defeat. The German is unbeaten in six matches, having recorded five wins and a draw. The two teams will battle it out in an Absa Premiership match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, in Port Elizabeth tomorrow (6pm). Pirates occupy fourth spot on log with 33 points from 19 matches. They are 12 points behind fierce rivals and leaders Kaizer Chiefs. On the other hand, Mapeza’s Chilli Boys aim to return to winning ways, having lost 3-0 to SuperSport United in their last league game last week. Their last win was on 8 January when they beat relegation haunted Black Leopards 2-1 in Thohoyandou. Said Mapeza: “We are playing against a very good team in the league. I think they are the most consistent team in the second round, and they have been grinding results. We are playing at home, so we should be ready psychologically and I hope the guys will come to the party.” Mapeza stressed that communication is vital. “We have to work hard to beat Pirates. We have to go out there and put more than a thousand percent effort,” said the Zimbabwean mentor. “We need to be very organised in terms of how well we defend and going forward. If there is no communication starting from the back going forward, then it won’t happen on the pitch. “Look, if we are going to concentrate much on Mhango, what about Lorch (Thembinkosi)? What about (Vincent) Pule? what about (Luvo) Memela? “We can’t put much emphasis on one player.” Chippa are racing against time for key defender Lehlohonolo Masalesa to recover on time for tomorrow’s match.
