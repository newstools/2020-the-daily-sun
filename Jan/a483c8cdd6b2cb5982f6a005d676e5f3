 THE “gypsies” of the Absa Premiership, AmaZulu, will be forced to play a match at their fourth “home” venue this season when they host SuperSport United at the Kings Park Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). The other venues Usuthu have used this season are King Zwelithini Stadium (Umlazi), Princess Magogo Stadium (KwaMashu) and Moses Mabhida Stadium. Extreme weather conditions in Durban have played havoc with AmaZulu’s main home venue, the King Zwelithini Stadium. The pitch has been deemed unplayable following a number of weeks of pitch reconstruction and rehabilitation by the Ethekwini municipality. This has left club general manager Lunga Sokhela spitting fire at being forced to move from one venue to another, stating the Ethekwini municipality has completely failed them. Usuthu are in the relegation mix and chopping and changing home venues are not helping the club. Sokhela said on his social media account: “In football, home ground advantage is very important. Last year this showed as we lost only two matches at King Zwelithini Stadium. “This year our municipality has failed to ensure our stadiums are in playable condition so now we are gypsies. Totally unfair.” The club will hold a press conference along with municipal officials today to address this issue. A spokesperson from municipality said. “It’s no one’s fault. Due to extreme hot weather conditions that we have been experiencing, the programme (the grass that is being relaid on the pitch), is taking long to respond. But the pitch is a work in progress.” It has been extremely hot in December and in early January in Durban. It is not clear if King Zwelithini Stadium will be ready when Usuthu host Polokwane City on 2 February. AmaZulu are unsure how long they’ll play home games at the Kings Park Stadium. But on the bright side, the venue holds good memories for the club. On their way to reaching the Nedbank Cup final in 2010, their first final in the PSL era, they beat Mamelodi Sundowns there in the semi-final.
