BLACK Leopards coach Cavin Johnson has no doubt that midfielder Mogakolodi “Tsotso” Ngele can rediscover his best form that saw him light up the PSL a few year ago. Johnson knows Ngele well having worked with him during their days at Platinum Stars, a club where Ngele made his name in Mzansi. The Botswana international was a consistent standout performer for Dikwena, helping them to win the Telkom Knockout back in 2013 where he was crowned player of the tournament. However, Ngele would then experience arguably the toughest period of his career during his stay with Mamelodi Sundowns which saw him make only 16 appearances and score twice. He did, though, show glimpses of his old self during his loan spell with Bidvest Wits, helping the Students to their maiden Absa Premiership title in 2016. Nglele played 23 times for Gavin Hunt’s charges during that spell and found the back of the net on six occasions. Johnson is adamant that he can help the 28-year-old get back to his devastating best again, the type of form that would most likely ensure Lidoda Duvha maintain their PSL status this season. “Tsotso is a talented boy, he is working very hard to continue improving and get his confidence back,” said Johnson. “He hasn’t played for a while. He has been out injured. He just came back. And when he came back he also had some flu so we have to be aware of those things. We don’t want to kill him. “But I think when he has played, he’s done a good job. We can build as a team. We know how good a player he is and I believe we can get him playing at the level we know he can play at.” Johnson said part of the reason why he would not be going into the transfer market this month, is because his main concern is improving the players already at the Venda outfit. The former AmaZulu coach intends to allow players such as Ngele an opportunity to impress and prove their worth in the team as he believes they have the quality. “They all need to show me why they are here,” added Johnson.
