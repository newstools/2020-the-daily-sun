 GABADINHO Mhango’s solitary goal helped Orlando Pirates beat Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday night to dent their hopes to overtake leaders Kaizer Chiefs in a bid to defend their title. Mhango caught Downs defence napping in the 30th minute when he beat keeper Denis Onyango with a low shot to grab his 11th goal of the season to the delight of Bucs and Amakhosi fans who came to rally behind them in numbers. This follows a through ball from Luvuyo Memela. The defeat means Downs are still in second spot trailing Chiefs by nine points having collected 32 points from 17 matches. Pirates have now occupied sixth spot on 27 points from the same number of matches. This was a sweet revenge for Pirates who suffered a humiliating 6-0 defeat to Downs in 2017. Pirates are now unbeaten in six league matches under new coach Josef Zinnbauer. Bucs have also ended Downs dominance over them in their backyard having failed to beat them in eight matches. The last time Bucs beat them at Orlando was in 2011 when they won 3-2 in the MTN8 semifinal. The win ended Downs six-match unbeaten run. Pitso Mosimane’s coached side  were highly motivated having beaten Algerian outfit USM Akger 2-1 in the Caf Champions League over the weekend. The Brazilians had the upper hand early on being aggressive on the ball hoping to grab an early goal. Downs defender Anele Ngcongca came close to finding the back of net in the 14th minute  as his shot hit the upright with keeper Wayne Sandilands at his mercy. Two minutes later, Sandilands produced a stunning save to deny winger Thapelo Morena the lead from close range. Downs midfielder Gaston Sirino could not believe it as his thunderous shot hit the two upright with Sandilands beaten. They next host wounded Highlands Park at the same venue on Saturday (6 pm) while Downs face Tshwane rivals SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (3.30 pm).
