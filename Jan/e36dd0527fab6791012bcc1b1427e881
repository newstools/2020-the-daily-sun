WAR has been declared on the education system! These were the words of Gauteng Premier David Makhura after a visit to Philemon Montsho Primary School in Winterveld, Tshwane, yesterday. On Wednesday parents, teachers and pupils were shocked after finding their school vandalised. Furniture, including desks and chairs, tables, tablets, electronic boards, chalk boards and trophies were among the things that were stolen. Makhura said this was the second break-in at the school, the first being in 2018. “We have a big challenge but we’ll win this war against crime. We want the community to take charge. We must protect our schools whether it’s against protests or criminality,” he said. Makhura urged the police to do their job. He said they have asked the provincial commission to look at the disruption by criminal syndicates. Police spokesman General Tommy Mthombeni said they will have integrated operations to try and restore order in the kasi. ANC Youth League Tshwane chairman Lesego Makhubela said they will have a community meeting on Sunday to get the residents to become part of the plan to fix the kasi. Meanwhile, Khutlo Tharo Secondary School in Sebokeng, Vaal, was gutted by fire on Wednesday. It is unclear what sparked the blaze, but concerned parents have questioned whether they may be dealing with a case of arson.
