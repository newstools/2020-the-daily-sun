LEBOGANG Mahlangu wants her house back from her sister-in-law Emily Shikwambane. The 48-year-old from Soshanguve block DD, Tshwane, told Daily Sun there was an agreement for Emily (50) to temporarily live in the RDP but 19 years later, she was refusing to leave. “We agreed she’d move out as soon as she got the RDP house she was waiting for. But when 10 years passed and we saw she would not be getting a house, we asked her to buy the house from us but she refused,” said Lebogang. She said she tried everything she could think of to get the house back as she wanted her kids to live in it. “I can’t have my children renting rooms when I have a house. I want her to move out. She’s old now and I’m sure she can afford a place of her own.” But Emily said the family forced her to move into the RDP as it was empty. She said she didn’t want to as she was told her house would soon be ready. “After years went by and there was no sign of my RDP house, they came and told me to buy the house. They wanted R100 000, which I was willing to pay. But then they began telling me stories,” she said. Emily said she was trying to organise a family meeting to fix the problem, but her brother and his wife didn’t want to be part of it. “They want me to be homeless so their kids can move in,” she said. Human settlements spokeswoman Zandi Gamedze said the house belonged to whoever’s name was on the title dead. She said the department’s system showed it was registered to Lebogang. “She has the right to tell the person who has been occupying the house to leave within 30 days,” said Gamedze.
