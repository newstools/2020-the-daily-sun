SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo believes local young players lack quality in critical stages of the match and need to work hard on their end product. Tembo has shown faith with the emerging young players in his team, however, he feels they need to start living up to their promise and help the team win matches. The Zimbabwean mentor was particularly critical of Sipho Mbule, who has been widely regarded as arguably one of the most talented young players in the country. Tembo, though, believes the 21-year-old, for all his talent, is not effecting games as much as he should. “Our young players need to understand that they need to play effective football,” said Tembo. “When I talk about effective football, I’m talking about him creating goals, him scoring goals. If you check the best players, you will see their numbers are good. They score and create goals. He (Mbule) is an attacking player who is very skilful. “But sometimes, he’s good on the eye without winning us games. Our youngsters need to be taught that it’s not just about entertainment, it’s also about winning games. It’s very important. “We are working with him on that because he has a lot of potential. But it’s about being effective. Creating and scoring. He’s taken his foot off the paddle in terms of being effective, we need him to be effective. “Those are the things we need to teach our young players if you want to play in Europe those are the things they look at. If you want to renew your contract, they check how many goals and assists you have. That’s the game.”
