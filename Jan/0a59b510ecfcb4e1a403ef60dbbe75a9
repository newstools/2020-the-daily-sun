TRAFFIC cops are meant to ensure motorists and pedestrians are safe and follow the rules of the road. But a cop was caught on video breaking the rules. And his actions resulted in a suspension. In the video which went viral on social media last week, the cop who is in full uniform, can be seen allegedly stealing something that looks like a cellphone from the counter of a food outlet in Pietermaritzburg, KZN. On Monday, the cop was served with a letter of suspension pending an internal investigation and a criminal case, which was being investigated by police. Head of the transport department, Sibusiso Gumbi, said the alleged act was embarrassing and tarnished the department’s reputation. “We take this video footage seriously. Law enforcement officers, by virtue of their oath, must be beyond reproach and must always be exemplary, even when they’re off duty.” Gumbi said the officer’s suspension would send a strong message that the department wouldn’t tolerate corruption and all forms of crime from their members. He said they were also working with cops to ensure the matter was speeded up.
