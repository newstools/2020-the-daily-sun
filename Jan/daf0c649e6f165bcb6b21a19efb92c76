RESIDENTS of Stinkwater are very unhappy with the City of Tshwane. They say efforts to drain stagnant water that claimed three lives are not enough. READ: SHEBELEZA: I'M NOT DEAD! Keatlegile (10) and Keamogetse Baloyi (8), as well as Romao Niguel (8), drowned last month while swimming in the water at a park. Residents were outraged by the incident and blamed the municipality for the deaths. The municipality acted quickly to drain the water, but residents said it wasn’t enough. They said the water would just collect again as soon as it rained again. Thomo Madimetja said: “Yes, the park is very dry now, but as soon as it rains, we’ll have a pool there again. They need to shut down this park once and for all.” READ: I KNOW KELLY LOVED MY HUSBAND! Councillor Aaron Maluleka said draining the water was the first step in making the park safe. “We’re planning on building storm water drains so that when it rains, the water flows out of the park instead of making it waterlogged,” he said.
