PACESETTERS Kaizer Chiefs will head into their next challenge this weekend against relegation-haunted Black Leopards, smiling from ear to ear. This after watching their closest chasers, Mamelodi Sundowns, drop more points following their 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates midweek. The result ensured that Amakhosi maintained their healthy nine-point lead at the summit of the Absa Premiership and now, they have an opportunity to stretch it to 12 points – piling more pressure on Downs, who only play on Sunday. They face Lidoda Duvha at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm), well aware that they won’t have it easy against a team eager to bounce back from four defeats on the spin. Amakhosi mentor Ernst Middendorp is expecting a gruelling affair in Venda, a notoriously tough place to go, regardless of their hosts’ recent woeful form. “We meet Black Leopards on Saturday who will be a difficult opponent even though they have lost their last three games in a row,” said Middendorp. “From our side, I am totally convinced about it, you know how it is in Venda. When you go there, don’t expect a good game. Don’t expect a quality game. It’s about making it happen. You have to do your basics right, the basics in terms of one against one. You have to start there.” Their opponents, Lidoda Duvha, are desperate for a turn in fortune having failed to pick up a single point under the tutelage of new mentor Cavin Johnson. The Venda outfit will be eager to bag the massive scalp of high flying Amakhosi – throwing a spanner in the works as far as the title race is concerned while turning their own season around in the process.
