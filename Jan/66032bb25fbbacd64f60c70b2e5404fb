 A 33-year-old man has been arrested
for shooting at police officials while they were investigating a murder in
Plessislaer, KwaZulu-Natal, over the weekend. As part of the investigation, the
officers were in Pata, Pietermaritzburg, searching for a suspect wanted for the
murder of Menelisi Mnikathi, 42, who had been stabbed in Maqeleni, Imbali. "He sustained stab wounds to
the chest and was declared dead at the scene. The team went to the suspect's
house and introduced themselves as police. One of the occupants in the house
came out and ran away with a firearm in his hand," police spokesperson
Captain Nqobile Gwala said. She said police chased after him. "Shots were fired towards the
police officers and a shootout [ensued]. The suspect sustained an injury on the
leg. He was apprehended and found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with
three rounds of ammunition." He will be charged with attempted
murder and the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. "The recovered firearm will be
subjected to ballistic testing to ascertain if it was used in the commission of
any crime in the country," said KZN police commissioner, Lieutenant
General Khombinkosi Jula. SOURCE: NEWS24
