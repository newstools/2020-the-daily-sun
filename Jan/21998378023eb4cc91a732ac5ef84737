THE discovery of the body of a baby in a dam has left a security guard and cops traumatised! The guard was patrolling an area around the Donaldson Dam near Bekkerdal, on the West Rand, on 13 December when he made the grisly discovering and called the cops, according to Bekkersdal police spokeswoman Sergeant Linkie Lefakane.

Police are still struggling to trace the family or guardians of the 18-month-old baby girl. “This saddens me because it happened just after the end of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. We don’t know who dumped this baby here, but it is inhumane,” she said. READ: RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING!

She was wearing a green track top, pink shirt, blue track pants and blue sandals with a pink rose,” Lefakane said. Anyone with information should call 011 755 8040/8069 or 08600 10111.
