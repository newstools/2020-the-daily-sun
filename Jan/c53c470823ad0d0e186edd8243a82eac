STUDENTS at North West University’s Mahikeng campus were ordered to leave the premises for their own safety yesterday. On Monday, the National Union of South African Students disrupted the campus, calling for a national shutdown. It wanted Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande to respond to 15 demands.  Scores of students were yesterday seen carrying their bags and leaving the campus. Some didn’t know where they would sleep as they had no money to go home. First-year student Lerato Mononyane (21) said she was going home in Rustenburg. She agreed with the protesters. “They have reasonable demands. I’m lucky that I have accommodation. Other students don’t. Some can’t register because of outstanding debt,” she said. A law student from KZN said she had to call a friend to fetch her. “We’re stranded,” she said. Sasco chairman Paseka Molete said: “We’re still facing issues of accommodation. Demographically, it doesn’t make sense.” Molete said the campus also had a lot of students with historical debt. He said they’d continue protesting until vice-chancellor Dan Kgwadi communicated with them. Kgwadi said: “Management has resolved to close the campus until further notice to ensure the safety and security of stakeholders.”
