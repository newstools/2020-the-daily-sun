DA federal council chairwoman Helen Zille’s tweet that there were more racist laws today than during the apartheid days was distasteful. She has been seen trending on the social media platforms. Even some of her fellow party members are angered. Maybe it’s time for Zille to consider taking a back seat in politics. Zille should be slammed for such actions. How can South Africa move forward if racial remarks are always uttered, reminding us of the past we want to forget? If the DA wants to survive, it must force Zille to retire. Divorces on the rise during lockdown! She is clearly branding herself as an apartheid and racism denialist. The suggestion that Mzansi has more racist laws now than it did under apartheid must be a bridge too far, even for her ardent supporters. We are a peaceful nation generally, but we don’t want to be reminded of the apartheid government because nothing positive came out of it. The DA’s Federal Legal Commission must get to the bottom of Zille’s tweet. This is not the first time the commission has investigated Zille’s tweets. In 2017, the commission recommended that Zille be charged for her tweets about colonialism. Let’s hope the DA will deal with her decisively this time around.
