It’s taken a whole decade for DJ Spelete to finish his album, 1st Inversion. “It’s groundbreaking, and I have no doubt no one has worked on an album this long. But the 34-year-old has no regrets. “The album has 22 tracks. I’ll release it officially by end of next month,” said Spelete. “I’ve already dropped a song, I Really Do.” His real name is Jacky Mokoatlo. His album is a mix of various genres: gqom, kwaito and gospel. “My first album reflects my journey in the music industry. I was only six when I started singing. “My uncle used to play instruments for some big artists, and that influenced me a lot. “In 1996 I moved from Polokwane to Joburg, and that’s when I started taking my music career seriously.” In 2005, he enrolled for a sound engineering and music diploma at Parktown College while also playing professional football for ­Wits University. Eventually, he had to choose between football and music. “I chose music because it’s what I was passionate about,” he said. “It was at this time that I met DJ Dino Bravo, DJ Sphiwe from Kaya FM and DJ Mphulo, who helped me kick-start my music career.” In 2009, he met Bonsai of Bonsai Entertainment. “That’s when I started working on my first album,” he said. “However, I was also working with other artists. So I couldn’t finish it. “I’m glad I waited because I managed to put my work on an international platform. “As it is, I’m a pianist for the legendary group, Amahotella Queens.” He’s been travelling the world with them for the past few years. “I’m also establishing my clothing line, Spelete,” he said. “Lockdown has afforded me the opportunity to finish my album and branch into fashion.”
