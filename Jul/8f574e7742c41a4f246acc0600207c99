Pitso Mosimane has confirmed that he is using the relative quiet of lockdown to further his coaching studies as he pursues a Caf Pro License. The Mamelodi Sundowns tactician has always been a keen advocate for coaches studying further and is backing up his talk with action. Unburdened, for now, by the usual hectic pace of Sundowns’ fixture schedule, he has been chasing his Pro License with online learning, his expected trip to Morocco for the course cancelled due to Covid-19. “I’m in the company of other great coaches from the African continent,” he told his club’s website. “Earlier today’s presentation was done by Belgium’s national team head coach, Roberto Martinez. “We got to understand how he worked to make the Belgian ‘Red Devils’ the No 1 ranked team in the world.” Two other members of the Sundowns technical team are also studying as video analysts Musi Matlaba and Mario Masha complete their Uefa C Licence. -SuperSport
