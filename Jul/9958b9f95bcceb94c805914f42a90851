FORMER Polokwane City goalkeeper, Bongani Manavhela, is lucky to be alive! He admitted himself that God saved his life and career after being involved in a serious car accident in his Hyundai vehicle on Monday. Bystanders at the scene said he is lucky to have escaped without serious injuries after the loud bang. Speaking to SunSport after been discharged from the Siloam Hospital on Tuesday, Manavhela, whose contract with GladAfrica Championship side JDR expired last month, said he is fine and survived through minor injuries after having lost control of the vehicle and drove straight onto a fence. He says he will be back training soon.  "I can assure everyone that I am fine and I am home," said the 27-year-old who will be joining a PSL team next season. "Everything happened fast and it was in the morning. I was scared that my career could be over. But I feel fine and the doctors who checked me said I shouldn't worry as I will be fine to continue playing football. God gave me another chance to continue with my football career. I will work more harder this time." "I will be joining one of the Absa Premiership team next season as we are busy negotiating and all is going well, so far," explained the former Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila goalie. "I am positive that I will be playing in the top flight next season. But unfortunately I cannot reveal the team now." A source told SunSport that Manavhela will be returning to TTM. Vhadau Vha Damani owner Masala Mulaudzi has bought Bidvest Wits and will be relocating it to Venda, and will also be renamed Tshakhuma.
