As Gauteng's Covid-19 cases spike, Johannesburg executive mayor, Geoff Makhubo, says hard lockdown will not be a solution, however, certain regulations should be looked at to curb the spread of the virus. Makhubo was speaking in Marlboro during the unveiling of land which will be used to temporarily house residents from Covid-19 hotspots in Johannesburg. "We are seeing a spike in numbers, in the last week we've had 3 000 additional infections in the province, a majority have been in Johannesburg. Hospitals "The infection rate is growing; the active cases are high, and we are worried about the capacity in our hospitals.  "But we think we have got enough beds, we've got enough quarantine sites that can withstand the pressure we will face in July and August," he said.     Makhubo added that it was possible for alcohol restrictions to be revisited. "The alcohol economy is like any other economy - the restrictions, the times it can be sold, the times that people are in the streets consuming alcohol - that can be looked at. "The idea was to buy and drink at home, but people still drink [in public] and drive around and cause accidents on the road."    "They don't do the basics, and we think that with those basic being done and being adhered to we shouldn't be seeing what we are seeing now," Makhubo said.  "For me, we will have to balance the two and I don't see a hard lockdown being a complete solution but some form of lockdown - localised, curfew at night – I think those will [be] solutions for what we are seeing today." https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/hard-lockdown-not-a-solution-says-joburg-mayor-makhubo-as-gauteng-cases-climb-20200703
