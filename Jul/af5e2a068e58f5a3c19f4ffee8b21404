The
admission of North West premier Job Mokgoro to a Johannesburg private hospital
has caused panic in the province.  The
panic started when Mokgoro (72) was taken by an ambulance from his residential area
to the hospital.  On
Tuesday Mokgoro announced that he tested positive after suffering from a mild
continuous cough.  His
spokesman Vuyisile Ngesi said the rumours that Mokgoro’s health was very sick
were malicious.   He
said the premier took a voluntary decision to quarantine at a hospital to
protect himself and those who works for him at his residential place.  “The
premier is in a voluntary quarantine for his own safety and the safety of
people who works at his residence,” Ngesi said.  He
said the premier had to be taken by an ambulance because there was no way he
could be taken there in his protectors cars.  “Because
he tested Covid 19 positive, he had to be taken by an ambulance, his protectors
escorted the ambulance to the hospital,” Ngesi said.
