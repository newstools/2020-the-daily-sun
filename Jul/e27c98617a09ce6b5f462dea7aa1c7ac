MEN of the cloth have condemned what happened at the International Pentecost Holiness Church over the weekend. Incredible Happening Ministries leader, Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, said the attack that left five people dead at the Modise church in Zuuberkom wasn’t their problem alone, but the problem of the church as a whole. “Pastors from various churches should support the church and bring some positivity. “No one should laugh at the Modise church for what happened.” He said the Church
Mandate Turn Around Movement (CMTM), an initiative he’s president of, is about bringing back the dignity of Christianity. He said about 500 pastors were already part of the initiative and the aim was to help each other. “When one pastor is struggling, we come together and see if there’s anything we can do to help. “That goes for in-house conflicts. If a pastor is experiencing such, he calls us and we try to give advice.” Mboro said pastors were embarrassing God. “The fights we have among each other are too much. They must stop. “As men and women of the cloth we need to stand together. “We mustn’t compete with each other but complete each other.” He said pastors are also human and make mistakes. “It’s better when other pastors tell me what I’ve done is wrong because we speak the same language.” Pastor Manqoba Sithole of Mission of Zion in Soweto agreed with Mboro. “We should be united as men of God. This division is making us a joke. It’s about time we change all that.” Bishop Sizwe Ndamane said: “I agree. We’ve destroyed the name of the church for too long. “We owe it to God to fix this mess.”
