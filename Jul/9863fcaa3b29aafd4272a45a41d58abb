AYANDA Patosi says Anele Ngcongca should follow him in Asia and make money instead of returning to Belgium. Patosi, who plays for Iranian side Foolad FC on loan from Cape Town City, made this statement via a Zoom press conference with the South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA). Belgian side Roeselare had confirmed the signing of Ngcongca on a two-year contract, but his agent Mike Makaab revealed that the defender renewed his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns. Ngcongca spent eight seasons in Belgium playing for Racing Club Genk. The 32-year-old joined The Brazilians in 2016 where he made 42 appearances scoring one goal. Said Patosi: “Anele should stick it out in Asia than going back to Belgium. I haven’t spoken to him in a while, but he can make as much money as he can there because he is 32 now. If something is better in Asia he should take it, that’s my advice.” Patosi says he doesn’t want Ngcongca to make a wrong move that will affect his pocket when he retires. "Anele is my older brother, I have known him for 15 years. He is doing the right thing and I will give him my support. If he leaves Downs who will pay the money that he was getting there? That is a good decision that he is taking now.” The 27-year-old Patosi says he doesn’t have any regrets to play in Asia than to continue with his career in Mzansi or Europe. “Football can take you to different directions, the direction you don’t want to go to. I wanted to go to the top four leagues in the world as I was doing well for two years ( while in Belgium) before I got injured, but I struggled to come back. I didn’t do as much to earn a move to top leagues and I could have stayed in Belgium, but I wanted to go home.”
