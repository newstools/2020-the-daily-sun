LUC Eymael says he has already apologised to Young Africans fans, as well as Tanzanians in general after making derogatory comments about football in the country.  He has accused journalists in Tanzania for having embarrassed him for being a foreigner. He will be meeting with the club management on Tuesday, 28 July to discuss settlement. Among other things, Eymael reportedly said: "I don’t enjoy your country (Tanzania). You’re uneducated people. I am disgusted. I don’t have a car, wifi or DSTV. These fans don’t know anything about football. It’s like monkeys or dogs when they’re shouting.”  The club later released a statement after their final match of the season, where they finished second, and announced the sacking of the Belgian coach.
