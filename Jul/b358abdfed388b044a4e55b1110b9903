AFTER her house burned down, Violet Motsoane (51) didn’t know who’d help her get back on her feet. This was after the ward councillor only gave the family of five one blanket, two sanitisers, flour, soap, a mask and a pair of gloves. Violet’s daughter Puleng (30) accidentally kicked the paraffin stove and their RDP in Pieterswartz, Mangaung, burned down. Daily Sun published the story on 7 July. After hearing Violet hadn’t received much help, her boss Laura Erlank from Magic Events and Wedding Venue gave the family beds, furniture, groceries, clothes, shoes, paint, doors, dinner sets, curtains and windows. Violet said she’d been working for Laura for eight years, and her boss had no complaints about her. She last worked for her in March. Violet said: “My boss heard about my crisis and promised to help. I didn’t think I’d get furniture, clothes and shoes from her. “But she also bought me new windows and paint to refurbish the interior walls. I’m speechless. She’s a boss from heaven and I love and thank her for helping me.” Ward councillor Babies Qwema said: “We couldn’t give more food parcels because they’re locked in the office of disaster and the building was closed so it could be fumigated. As soon as it’s opened, the family will be helped with more items.” Laura said even though her business wasn’t making money, she couldn’t just fold her arms and not help. Mangaung Metro power supplier, Centlec, said the family could be helped with a new power box. Spokesman Lele Mamatu said the family should get a confirmation letter from the ward councillor and do a police affidavit. “With those two documents, the family can go to our offices, where they will be assisted to get a new power box,” said Mamatu.
