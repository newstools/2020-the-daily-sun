THABA Chweu Local Municipality MMC for Corporate Services Idos Mokoena has been admitted to hospital after being assaulted by angry protesters in Graskop outside Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Mayor Friddah Nkadimeng confirmed that Mokoena was attacked by protesters on Wednesday. Nkadimeng was supposed to receive the memorandum but due to other commitments, she asked Mokoena to receive it on her behalf. She said: “I received a call from the Covid-19 Command Council Team and I had to cancel my appointment to receive the memorandum. “I requested MMC Mokoena to receive the memorandum on my behalf. Unfortunately, he was allegedly attacked before receiving it and he was rushed to hospital.” The residents are not happy with the electricity increase tariffs for 2020/2021 financial year. Thaba Chweu is one of the municipalities struggling with Eskom debt, which stands at R769 million. One of the protesters said: “On the first of June, the municipality partially began implementing a 10% electricity tariff increase along with monthly AMP charge of R184,85, which it claims is access fee that every consumer has to pay monthly prior to the purchase of electricity. “This has angered the residents and we can’t afford to pay more for electricity because many people are unemployed,” said the protester. The People’s Paper couldn’t get a comment from Mokoena. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said two suspects, aged 34 and 48 have been arrested. “They will appear in the Graskop Magistrates Court soon in connection with assault with intent to do grevious bodily harm and public violence. If people have grievances, they must use relevant channels to address their problems, not violence,” said Hlathi.
