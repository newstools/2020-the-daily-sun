A suspect has been arrested regarding the murder of Gauteng Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Provincial Safety and Security Committee, Mapiti Matsena. The 29-year-old accused is scheduled to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Monday. Mapiti was stabbed to death during an alleged house invasion at his home in Tshwane on Wednesday night. The suspect was initially taken in for questioning during the early hours of Friday morning. National Police spokesman, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, said following intensive and extensive investigations, the accused has now been charged with the murder of Mr Matsena. Naidoo said it has been determined from preliminary investigations that a lone assailant entered the house and stabbed Matsena while he was in his bedroom. "At this stage it does not appear that anything was taken by the suspect," he said Naidoo added: “The suspect will appear in court on a charge of murder and possibly for housebreaking with intention to commit murder. While the suspect has been charged, detectives are still yet to confirm the motive for the killing.” It was reported that Matsena was on the night of Thursday, 16 July 2020, with his family at their Doornpoort home in Holyhock Road, when he was allegedly attacked and fatally stabbed. The National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, General Khehla John Sitole, said: “The Acting Provincial Commissioner of Gauteng and his team acted swiftly especially in terms of the 72-hour Activation Plan and by doing so, were able to identify and arrest the suspect within 24 hours”, said General Sitole.
