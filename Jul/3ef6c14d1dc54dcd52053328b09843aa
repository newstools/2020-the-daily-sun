It took almost a month for residents of Cork Village near Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga to track down a leopard that has been terrorising their animals and putting their lives in danger. According to residents, their chickens and dogs had been going missing after they noticed the leopard’s tracks. So they decided to get rid of it for good. Resident Reason Mthimkhulu (33) told Daily Sun he arrived at home at about 9pm on Monday and parked his bakkie. He said as he was walking to his front door, he saw fresh tracks of the leopard in his yard and immediately alerted other residents. He said they started hunting for it until it was found at Sabie River.  “We risked our lives by searching for it because it was dark, but we managed to trace it where it was shot and killed after a long month of living in fear and losing our dogs and chickens at night,” said Reason. “After we noticed it was roaming the village when it became dark, we alerted the rangers at the park. But they told us it was too dangerous to be caught because it was in the community. They gave us a cage, but women who were fetching firewood in the bushes kept spotting it during the day,” he said. According to Reason, last week a 15-year-old boy escaped death after being chased by the leopard while going to catch transport to school. He said he was rescued by a villager and the leopard ran into the nearby bushes. “People were scared to walk around the village, especially in the dark,” said Reason.  Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency spokeswoman Kholofelo Nkambule said villagers should report such incidents so the relevant experienced officials could attend the situation immediately. “The safety of communities is of utmost priority and those animals are dangerous. So we appeal to the community to stop hunting such animals and rather inform the relevant authorities,” she said.
