AS Mzansi boxing gears up for professional gyms to reopen next month, trainer Harry Ramogoadi-Manaka said he will only allow fighters who use their own transport to resume training due to Covid-19 risks. Last week, the local boxing regulator Boxing South Africa (BSA) announced that professional gyms in the country are set to reopen on 1 August. South African gyms have been closed since the coronavirus outbreak four months ago. However, the long-awaited announcement did not get a warm reception in local boxing circles because of the risks involved with the resumption of training at this stage. Ramogoadi-Manaka said people using public transport are at a high risk of contacting the deadly virus on their way to the gym. “The danger is still out there. It’s risky, especially for people who use public transport. They stand a very big chance of getting the virus and infecting the others in the gym,” Ramogoadi-Manaka said. The former Commonwealth contender, who spent the better part of his fighting days in the United Kingdom, said the announcement on the reopening of gyms is incomplete. The VIP Boxing Academy mentor said BSA should have also included their plan after the fighters have trained. “You cannot say to people gyms must open without telling them when they will fight or when will fighting resume. There should have been a message as well for the promoters saying what would be next.” To emphasise on that point, he said: “All the boxers have gone for so long without a fight and without money. If they have to go back to training without any plans of earning money anytime soon would be unfair to the boxers and trainers. “The message that gyms must open should have been accompanied by the plan to start fighting in this period.” Meanwhile, Boxing SA is yet to announced which gyms will be allowed to resume training.
