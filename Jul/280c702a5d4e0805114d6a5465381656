VETERAN sports administrator Dr Sam Ramsamy has started his assignment as the facilitator at the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) elections. The 82-year-old official from Durban was appointed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) two weeks ago to oversee the controversial Sascoc elections. Ramsamy, who is a board member of the IOC and Swimming SA’s honorary president, said he would personally make sure Sascoc held free and fair elections. “I started my new role of being an elections facilitator this week and want to place it on record that I don’t back anyone to be the new leader of Sascoc,”Anyone who thinks that I have my own favourites is talking nonsense,” said Ramsamy. He said he doesn’t care who wins the elections. The elections were supposed to have taken place on 28 March at Sascoc headquarters in Joburg, but were postponed because of public spats, fighting and numerous court cases by candidates. Sascoc has until November to elect a new board, according to the IOC’s directive. The IOC intervened in the controversial elections by appointing Ramsamy to usher in the new board. Ramsamy admitted it won’t be easy, but is confident Sascoc will eventually host successful and peaceful elections. “I’ll do everything in my power to make sure all the candidates are treated fairly and that we have free and fair elections,” he said. “The IOC has entrusted me with this huge responsibility and I want to repay the faith that they’ve shown in me.” “The next big step is to contact all the presidential candidates and lay down the rules. For this to work out, we should all be on the same page.”
