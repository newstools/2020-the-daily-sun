A 56-year-old funeral parlour manager has been charged with rape after a 30-year-old woman working at the same parlour was reportedly raped inside the parlour’s office in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Thursday. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the woman reported that she was about to knock off when her manager requested her to go and buy some groceries. “When she came back from the shop, she found that her colleagues had gone home except the manager who then locked the main door immediately after she entered the office. After seeing the suspect’s actions, she went to the toilet and called her husband to alert him as she feared for her life. After that call, the woman went straight to her office and that’s when the manager allegedly raped her,” said Hlathi. “The husband arrived at the parlour’s office and she related everything that had happened to her and the matter was then reported to the police where a case of rape was opened”. Hlathi further said that the woman indicated that it was not the first time that the suspect raped her. The suspect was arrested and charged with rape. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the suspect appeared in the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Friday. He’s expected back in court on Tuesday for bail hearing. He was but remanded in custody.
