JOHANNES Mahlangu (76) didn’t show any signs of the coronavirus when he was taken to hospital in an ambulance last Thursday. But on Saturday his family, from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, heard he’d died of Covid-19. They want answers from Far East Rand Hospital. Apparently, paramedics who checked him before he left home had said he had no symptoms. Family member Zanele Sochi (38) couldn’t find him when she visited him on Friday. But eventually a male staff member said he was in ward 8, which is for coronavirus patients and was waiting for a bed. “He wouldn’t say why my uncle was in that ward.” She couldn’t tell if the man was a nurse or a porter. “We were told he wasn’t booked in on Thursday and his last visit to the hospital was in 2011,” said family member, Lillian Mahlangu (52). Lillian said her uncle visited the hospital often for check-ups, even before lockdown. Zanele said the hospital didn’t tell them he’d died. “When we went to hospital, they told us to wait until they could attend to us.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana confirmed Mahlangu was admitted on 10 July suffering from a wet cough, vomiting and body pains. Said Kekana: “He had existing medical conditions and protocol states a person with onset of respiratory illness suggestive of pneumonia is treated as a patient under investigation for Covid 19.” He was admitted in ward 8, a planned investigation unit ward. “Covid-positive patients are admitted into isolation cubicles. All necessary investigations were done, including a swab.” Sixteen hours later he gasped and was resuscitated, but died. “The family was told of the patient under investigation status and precautions to be taken for burial. Results were received.”
