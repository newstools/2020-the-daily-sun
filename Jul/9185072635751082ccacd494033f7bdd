KHANYISANI Mdunge was shot several times on his way to work. The incident happened today when the 37-year-old from Melmoth in KZN, who lived at KwaMashu Hostel, had just crossed the bridge between the hostel and E section. He died at the scene. Allegedly, a group of men suddenly came up, opened fire at him and then fled the scene. His brother Mxolisi Mdunge (27) said residents told him his brother had been shot. “I couldn’t believe it until I found him dead at the scene. He had gunshot wounds all over his body. I’m still traumatised.” He said Khanyisani used to work at construction companies. “I’m not sure where he currently worked, but he used to get transport from the taxi rank at the crossroads.” He said nothing was taken from his brother, because his cellphone and wallet was still on him. “I really don’t understand why he was killed. He wasn’t violent, or even involved in gangs or crime at the hostel, but he was killed like dog.” A resident said other people have been killed at the same spot. “Normally people get robbed here. Maybe he was shot by people who had a grudge with him as they didn’t take anything.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a 37-year-old man was fatally shot today at E section in Malandela Road. “A case of murder was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation.”
