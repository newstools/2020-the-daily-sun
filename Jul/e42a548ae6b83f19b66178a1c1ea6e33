OLYMPIC gold medalist Sir Mo Farah will compete in the 10km Cape Town Marathon Virtual Race Run in the United Kingdom, which is scheduled to get underway on 18 October. The coronavirus pandemic saw the launch of the virtual event and while Cape Town Marathon participants may miss out on the spectacle, the virtual race promises to take all the iconic elements of Cape Town's favourite marathon to its global participant base. This will be done through the race's custom-built and feature-packed app. "This year, runners from across the globe can experience the magic of the Cape Town Marathon without having to travel, while the dynamic surround sound feature within the app will allow participants to listen to the unique sounds of the Cape Town Marathon route while treading the familiar ground of their chosen race route," said Cape Town Marathon Race Director, Renee Jordaan. Cape Town Marathon chairperson, Francois Pienaar, adds that it is a privilege to host the first virtual race of its kind in the world. "We are already in the spotlight as the only race on the African continent to enjoy the prestigious World Athletics Gold Label Status, so I am really proud that the world's first truly immersive virtual marathon comes from South Africa and Africa. "I am also thrilled to confirm that World Champ, multiple Olympian and gold medallist, Sir Mo Farah, will race in the 10km Virtual Peace Run in the UK. His participation is a huge boost for the virtual race and shows that anyone can run the Cape Town Virtual Marathon, no matter where you are." The Cape Town Virtual Marathon, which also includes the 5km and 10km Peace Runs and newly-added half marathon, takes place on 18 October 2020.
