GENDER-BASED violence has become a daily occurrence in Mzansi. Residents of Alexandra, east of Joburg, said enough is enough! More than 200 residents marched to Alexandra Police Station to get their message across. They told the SunTeam they felt the cops were not doing enough to protect women and children. They handed a memorandum over to the cops outside the station. Residents said domestic violence cases were not taken seriously. Mercy Nkonyane (33) said she was in an abusive relationship. Whenever she tried to open a case against her ex-boyfriend, she was allegedly told to fix things with him. “Cops told me to come back if he continued abusing me. Even when I went back a second and third time, nothing was done,” she said. Moses Shabalala (44) said he was tired of hearing about women being killed daily. He said if the police were really doing their job, men would be afraid to commit such crimes. Moses said the police shouldn’t interfere when residents took justice into their own hands. Andries Mokoena (29) said he had two daughters and he was too afraid to let them play on the street with other kids. “How do I explain to a seven-year-old and nine-year-old that they can’t play outside because they might be raped or killed?” A mum of four girls said she didn’t know how to protect her daughters. “We don’t have a man in the house. It’s just me and my four girls. I sleep in fear each and every day.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said cops were aware of the complaints from residents handed over through a memorandum and will respond to them on Sunday.
