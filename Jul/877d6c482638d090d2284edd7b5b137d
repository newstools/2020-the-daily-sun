Supporting is the one thing that we should all be doing and the coronavirus pandemic made us realise that we need to support local whether it's food, clothes or beverages. South Africa has amazing designers that are extremely talented and creative to a point that they are even recognised internationally and we need to support them more and put them more out there. Here are 10 designers that are turning heads: 1.
