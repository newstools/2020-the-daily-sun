BET’s new telenovela Isono has stopped production due to Covid-19. Production company Clive Morris Productions released a statement saying they were suspending shooting to keep their cast and crew safe. “Due to the increase and peak of Covid-19 in South Africa and Gauteng, a decision was made to temporarily postpone production to support the first priority, which is health and safety for the cast and crew and all involved in the Isono production,” read the statement. The company said they would continue to shoot once they felt they were ready. “Covid-19 has presented our industry with unprecedented challenges. We are monitoring the Covid-19 situation in South Africa and will make a decision to commence production when it’s best possible to resume.” Isono was set to debut on the small screen on Monday on BET Africa, but the date has been changed. The telenovela has a star-studded cast of actors such as Rami Chuene, Nthati Moshesh, Bohang Moeko, Anga Makubalo, Senzo Radebe and Didintle Khunou. “BET Africa are excited to launch the channel’s first scripted telenovela to the market. As viewers will soon discover, it will be worth the wait. “At this stage, we have not communicated the new premiere date and can assure viewers it is coming soon to screens,” read the statement from BET.
