FORMER International Boxing Organisation (IBO) bantamweight champion Mfusi Maxhayi is chasing a rematch with the Western Cape featherweight champion Abdul-Aziz Kunert, who defeated him in December. The seasoned campaigner was shocked by the novice with a stoppage inside two rounds, and wants to avenge that defeat. This was Maxhayi’s second knockout defeat in his 12-year boxing career. His first knockout loss was against Siyabonga Masiba on his debut in 2008. The 33-year-old fighter said he has taken the loss on the chin. “He really stunned me with that stoppage. He caught me with a good punch. I am not used on being knocked down, that’s why I couldn’t manage to comeback. I don’t think he can beat me in a rematch,” said Maxhayi. He was ranked third on the national rankings before the Kunert defeat and was close to a SA title shot. Meanwhile, the talented pugilist from Brooklyn in the Cape Flats said fighting Maxhayi does not make business sense. “My main focus now is the SA title. I have nothing against him but if he has a title or I have the SA title and he becomes a mandatory challenger, then we can meet, but other then that it is a big NO,” said Kunert.
