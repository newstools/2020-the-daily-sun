A 58-year-old mineworker from Impala Platinum mine has tested positive for Covid-19. He was tested last Thursday. The man also suffers from diabetes. He said he started having a chest pain, no appetite and difficulty breathing. He is among 600 workers in quarantine, while 584 are in isolation and seven in ICU. The patient spoke to Daily Sun during Premier Job Mokgoro’s visit to Covid-19 hotspots in Rustenburg. Cosatu in Rustenburg raised concerns about the lack of PPEs and safety of the mineworkers. Chairman Maleho Gaonakala said mines had become epicentres. “We are calling on the government, the health department and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy to make it a point that Covid-19 regulations are followed in mining companies,” he said. Mineral Council SA CEO Roger Baxter said collaborations with the government are key. “The testing system in mines is working because cases are being detected. There’s only five mine related deaths and 1 300 positive cases in the North West. This raises the point that mining is doing all the testing well,” he said. Nationally, Covid-19 mine deaths stand at 10, positive cases at 1524 and recoveries at 795. Premier Mokgoro said the visit provided the necessary input to fight the pandemic. He said a health forum and a Premier Executive Committee containing health and mine delegates will be formed to discuss issues relating to the two industry needs. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha noted with great concern that the growth of infections became noticeable when mines reopened. He said infections raised from 162 on 30 May to more than 4 000 on 30 June. Sambatha said the mineworkers returning to work should have been screened and tested back home before returning to work because many come from hotspot areas.
