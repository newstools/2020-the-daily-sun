THE family of ex-cop Sibusiso Dlamini (38) is reeling from shock after he was brutally gunned down in the early hours of Sunday morning. Sibusiso was shot dead inside his car while dropping off his friend at KwaMhlanga section B in Mpumalanga. His sister Dudu Mnguni (50) said her brother was shot in front of the gate of his friend’s house. The family didn’t know the motive behind the shooting and said her younger brother was a good man. She said he was friends with everyone. Sibusiso left the police force to become a businessman and was staying in Sheldon, near KwaMhlanga. His sister said he was on his way back from a party in Tweefontein. “I got a call on Sunday morning from one of his friend’s neighbours, telling me to rush to hospital as Sibusiso had been shot,” she said. “The neighbour told me she heard multiple gunshots. When she peeped through the window, she saw my brother’s car. “I had to quickly wake up and rush to hospital. I was hoping to find him alive, but unfortunately he was dead. “I saw his car parked at the hospital with both doors open. I went to his car and found his cellphone was still there on the seat, together with the keys. “In the hospital he was lying on the stretcher. I called his name, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t believe my eyes when the nurses showed me his bullet-riddled body. “Nobody saw the gunman and which direction he went in after shooting my brother.” Dudu said her brother’s friend managed to run to the house to alert his family. She said her brother’s car had eight bullet holes on the driver’s window. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops found 11 bullet cartridges on the scene. He said when cops arrived the victim had already been taken to hospital, where he was certified dead on arrival. “A case of murder has been opened and no arrests have been made yet. Investigations are continuing,” he said.
