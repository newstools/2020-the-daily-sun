Corruption is holding us back. It has been more than 26 years since Mzansi became a democratic country but in my opinion, we should be very far. Every department or ministry should be close to perfection. We should be competing with developed countries. READ: WIFE SHOT AT FUNERAL! Our health, education and social systems are all performing poorly because of corruption. Most of the time, if not all, when there is the awarding of tenders, there’s corruption involved. When those involved get caught, they always cry “apartheid”. I’m sick and tired of corruption. Look at the VBS case for example. Poor people were robbed of their hard-earned money and livelihoods. I don’t even want to go into so many tenders and the recent Covid-19 relief funds. Our government does not even give the problem the seriousness it deserves. They talk about it nonchalantly and no serious consequence ever follows. ALSO READ: SKEEM SAAM ACTOR BUST BY COPS! I was annoyed when the finance minister tweeted about corruption recently because that’s where it will end – just tweets, no action. The next thing they’ll blame apartheid. Until we take responsibility and take this matter seriously, nothing will ever change. The rich will get richer while the poor get poorer. We are still far from equality.
