The accused killer dad Irvin Mahlangu (27) was granted R5000
bail by the KwaMhlanga Magistrates Courts on Monday. Irvin is alleged to have killed his 3-month-old baby girl on
28 January by throttling and slitting her throat with a broken bottle allegedly
for muthi purposes. It is alleged that he also tried to kill the mother too Pearl
Mtsweni (22). The incident took place at his rented house at KwaMhlanga. The presiding magistrate told the court that a person is not
guilty until proven guilty. He said he knows that the case created a lot of
public and media interest but there were no public demonstrations. "The state has given its statement to oppose bail, but
it was not thought through while being prepared. There is no concrete evidence
from the state to deny the accused bail. The accused has proved beyond doubt
that he should be given bail. Nobody should be locked up without any valid
reason,” he said. Magistrate Andre du Pree said Mahlangu will appear again at
the Delmas High Court on 5 October 2020 for the start of his trial. The accused was told by the court that he is likely to face
a possible life sentence if found guilty by the high court. Mary Mtsweni the grandmother of the baby said she is not
happy that the accused has been given bail. "Now I am left with the burden of finding a place to
hide for my daughter. This man is going to kill her as he tried the day when he
killed her baby. The reasons given by the court are not good enough to give him
bail. He knows very well that my daughter is the only state witness and if he
can kill her there will be no case,” she said.  --
