SA Football Association CEO Tebogo Motlanthe will start the process of identifying a new technical director on Monday to replace Neil Tovey. But Motlanthe said Safa are in no rush to appoint a new technical director as international football is on pause. Appointing someone now will be waste of money for the association that has been cash-strapped for a while. Tovey, who captained Bafana Bafana and lifted the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996, saw his five-year term with Safa come to an end last month. “As the CEO, I’m working on that position to be filled,” said Motlanthe, who was recently appointed by the Safa the National Executive Committee in an acting capacity until December. “Once we are fine, we’ll make an announcement. Sadly we can’t rush now because we don’t have any activities internationally.” The technical director’s duties are, among others, to oversee all the coaching matters in the country, including training of coaches. He also overseas development structures in all nine regions and he also travels when any national team are playing in international competitions overseas. “If I appoint someone now, I’ll appoint that person and do what? To come and be in the office? It will not make sense,” added Motlanthe. “But it is a process and we have started it.” SunSport sources revealed that Tovey was keen to remain, but he couldn’t agree with Safa’s new financial package that was offered. A lack of financial support in the development structures was another issue that resulted in him moving on. But his departure was something Safa was willing to sacrifice. This was part of their cost cutting measures.
