THE murder case against six suspects accused of killing a 16-year-old teenager was delayed for hours yesterday until it was decided to continue without an interpretor. The six suspects, Mlungisi Thabethe (27), Andile Nhleko (27), Mncedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22), appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court in eThekwini to apply for bail. They are accused of kidnapping and murdering Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu. The beating was captured on video. Their lawyer, Chris Gounden, told the court there was no reason they should not be granted bail. “The state doesn’t show how the accused were linked to the charges,” he said. Gounden said the state claimed Thabethe was dangerous and if he was released on bail, his life would be in danger as Hambanathi residents were furious with him. “But in his application, accused one stated that if he is released, he would not go to Hambanathi,” he said. Gounden said there was no information about the date and time the video was taken. The state said the video showed Bobo being beaten. “None of my clients can be seen in that video,” he said. Gounden said the state also said Hambanathi residents had signed a petition opposing bail. “But the petition is just pages with signatures. It has addresses of people from Phoenix and New Town A. Those addresses are not from Hambanathi. In some of the pages, there are no addresses or surnames at all. Maybe those people don’t know what they were signing for. They could’ve been signing for the accused to be granted bail.” Magistrate Thiloshor Badal adjourned the matter until today.
