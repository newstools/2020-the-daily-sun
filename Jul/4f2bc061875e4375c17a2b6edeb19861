DESIGNER Ntando Ndlovu uses his clothing line to motivate the youth. The 21-year-old from Alberton, Ekurhuleni, creates short films about his brand LOVO Brand to inspire the youth. He told SunBuzz his story will help the youth improve their lives. “The reason I started LOVO was because I needed an escape. “I had substance addiction and thought I should start something to distract me. “So I registered this brand last year and officially started working this year. “I do short films that tell people about my story on YouTube. “The films serve as a way of showing the youth we can overcome anything. “Nothing can stop us from achieving our dreams.” Ntando said he loves fashion, and that’s why he started a clothing line. “I’ve always loved fashion. I always wanted to look great,” he said. “So when I started this line, I wanted it to be different and fashionable. I didn’t want it to be just normal, where I take a logo and paste it. “I started designing using Photoshop. After designing, I send the designs overseas to China to be manufactured there. “We sell on our online store. We design caps, T-shirts and elegant wear for women. The plan is to add men’s casual wear.” They recently worked with rapper Costa Titch, and they’re looking into working with even bigger celebs. “We want to go outside of South Africa and make our brand known. We obviously want to see it succeed here first, but the plan is to go abroad.”
