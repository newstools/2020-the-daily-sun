Don’t let your debt control you! Here are five ways you can
control your debt. 1.      
Save Save some money each month so you don’t have to use credit
for purchases such as clothes, furniture and appliances. You should also save
towards an emergency fund for unexpected events such as medical expenses. 2.      
Make sure you can afford debt - if you
need it Do a budget and work out how much you need to put towards
savings as well as monthly expenses such as food, housing and transport. Any
leftover money can be put towards debt repayments. 3.      
Don’t spend to your maximum credit limit The repayment on a maximum credit limit might not be
affordable. Remember, the number you worked out in point 2 is how much you can
afford to put towards debt repayments each month.  Nothing more! 4.      
Keep an eye on interest rates Always ask what the interest rate is, how it can change and
how it affects repayments. You need to have enough to pay your debts each
month, even when interest rates rise. 5.      
Make it hard to use credit Leave your store, credit and bank cards at home in a safe
place and take only the cash you need to spend at the shops or on an evening
out.
