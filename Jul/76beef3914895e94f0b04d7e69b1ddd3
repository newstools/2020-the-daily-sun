Government is more concerned about the sale of alcohol instead of putting a stop to violent behaviour, drunk driving and alcohol-related problems. But why the obsession with alcohol? Politicians are hiding their failures and blaming everything on alcohol. Covid-19 has exposed them. If we had proper public healthcare, we’d not have problems at hospitals. If we had a working police force, there’d be law and order. If we were not losing billions to government corruption, we’d not be in this situation. We have a big drug problem, but you don’t see the minister of police preaching about it. The crime rate is higher than in most countries, and Mzansi women and kids are abused every day. Government is quick to talk about alcohol, the only way it can be seen to be working. Politicians don’t care about us or the country. They get fat salaries, live behind high walls where their kids and families are safe, and they have medical aid. They don’t experience the poor service we receive at public hospitals. They never go to cop shops to deal with incompetent cops. There are those who support the ban on alcohol and cigarettes because of religious beliefs or hatred of the substances. But this is also about the livelihood of millions of our people whom government has driven into poverty. Wait until the same people are driven into doing crime. Maybe you’ll understand my point once that happens. This is everyone’s problem. The truth is that people are hungry, and people are losing jobs. What about our president and his cabinet. What have they lost? - Letter by ML Makadikwa, Botlokwa
