EARLIER this evening President Cyril Ramaphosa held a virtiual imbizo on the corona virus. He answered questions ranging from the reason for the lockdown, the banning of booze and skyfs and the issue of schools reopening . "It's almost as if the
whole country has become like a hotspot" at this point, reiterating that
the pandemic is dangerous and is claiming lives",he said. "We started off by doing the lockdown. We did ours quite
early, and... it exerted a lot of pressure on our people, but it was necessary,
because if we hadn't the spate of infections would have been a lot
higher." He says the lockdown allowed the government to prepare health
facilities to meet the increased number of patients. "Our health system
was challenged even before Covid-19, but we've increased the capacity of beds
and ICU units... we are improving as we are going on."   Addressing the alcohol issue, Ramaphosa says experts advised the government that hospital
beds were being used for trauma-related incidents that are
"alcohol-induced". The decision was therefore taken to suspend - not
ban - alcohol, he says.  On the reopening of schools, he says it is a matter of great debate and that the World
Health Organisation recommends schools should close if Covid-19 cases were
rising in a country. He says the matter is under discussion. A caller asks about

jobs," the President says. "We are committed to focussing our efforts
on an economic recovery.  A woman calls from an old age home, asking for
