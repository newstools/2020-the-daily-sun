THERE’S no dull moment with Mzansi’s funniest athlete Lebogang “Daywalker” Shange. The 29-year-old race walker, who represents the colours of Central Gauteng Athletics, is always cracking jokes even when things are not going well in his life. Athletes are going through tough times as they have not been afforded an opportunity to take part in track and field events this year. Athletics SA cancelled all athletics events for the year due to COVID-19. Race walking is not a popular event in Mzansi and athletes on the African continent are forced to go abroad to make good money. Before the virus, Shange would compete in China, Australia, Portugal and Mexico to make money. He has moved to Northwest University from the University of Pretoria since December 2019. To make matters worse, he missed out on the athletes’ relief fund. Athletes were paid R20 000 from the fund to help them to get by. “Race walking isn’t as popular in SA, the most amount that you get paid is R150 at local events,” Shange joked. “There’s no point crying about it. I can’t lock myself indoors and cry about it. I don’t have a sponsor and don’t get monthly income like other lucky runners, but I smile and laugh to avoid depression.” Shange, who finished fourth at the IAAF World Championships in the 20km race walk in 20017 in London, was supposed to have been part of the IAAF Championships in Spain on 18 June, but the event was called off. He would have received an appearance fee and good money for finishing in the top 10. “You have to clock 1 hour and 20 minutes to qualify for the Olympics. I was going to qualify for the 2021 Olympic Games in Japan.” Shange dropped out of Grade 11 and has no formal education as he relies on the sport to earn a living. His parents and sister passed away and he’s left with his brother. “I’m the last born in a family of three. I’ve been doing race walking since 2008. COVID-19 taught me to save money. I don’t have savings.”
