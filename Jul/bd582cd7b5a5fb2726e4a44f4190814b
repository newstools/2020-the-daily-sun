KING Goodwill Zwelithini has called on the Zulu nation to fight Covid-19, just as they did in the great battle of Sandlwana in 1879. The king addressed his people during his 72th birthday celebration at Linduzulu Royal Palace in Nongoma today. He said the only gift he wanted from them would be to ensure they fought Covid-19 by staying safe and following lockdown regulations. The king said like the battle of Sandlwana, the virus was the biggest challenge his nation ever faced. He said if they could show the same bravery when defeating a heavily armed British army in 1879, he had no doubt the virus would be overcome. He said people should stay where they were and stop moving, and those working in other provinces must stop visiting their homes as the virus was peaking. “My people, the war is not won by the strength of the army, but when soldiers follow instructions from commanders. “As the commander-in-chief of the Zulu nation, I call on all of you to fight Covid-19 by following lockdown guidelines. And stop loitering around because that fans the virus.” The king suggested government was wrong to ease lockdown regulations. He said with strict lockdown rules in March, the virus was contained but started spreading once rules were eased. He was concerned that KZN had overtaken the Western and Eastern Cape as the most affected. He called on government and unions to handle the issue of reopening schools with the care it deserved. He urged pupils to stop loitering during the suspension of classes and to help at home. The king, the second longest-serving monarch in the world after Queen Elizabeth, has called on his people to fight the virus after Zionist bishop Bheki Ngcobo questioned his silence on it.
