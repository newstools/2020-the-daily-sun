MORE than R1 billion has been reallocated to the taxi relief fund, including R25 million to buy PPE for the taxi industry. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, announcing his revised budget to the National Assembly, said due to the pandemic funds had been shifted from savings on goods and services to fund shortfalls in distressed entities and for the buying of PPE for the public transport industry. “The reprioritisation of conditional grants will see the public transport operations grant allocated R6,749 billion for the financial year, of which R337 million is earmarked for procurement of PPEs for public transport facilities and operations.” Mbalula said the R1,135 billion allocation towards the taxi relief support wasn’t compensation for loss of business, but a gesture on the part of government to help the industry and meet them halfway. He acknowledged that government and the taxi industry had not yet agreed on how the relief fund would be distributed. “We remain hopeful that our ongoing discussions will yield outcomes that are beneficial to the industry within the limited resources,” he said. Mbalula announced that the target for the scrapping of old taxis and the Shova Kalula Bicycle distribution programme had been downscaled. But revision of the current financial year would not have an effect on the department’s strategic plan. Mbalula said the five-year plan would be reviewed at the end of the year. On the revised budget, he said further revisions would be made by state-owned entities where most needed. The department was confident that transport entities would recover and help revive the economy. He said road accidents and deaths remained unacceptably high. Interventions must be based on all sectors working together.
