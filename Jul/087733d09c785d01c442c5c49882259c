I think that our government is letting us down. No one is and no one must be above the law. We were told to stay at home at the beginning of lockdown. Some companies were forced to close while taxis, which were operating under strict conditions, were allowed to continue operating. Our parents, some working at those companies, had to obey the law. Others made a living by selling booze in their pubs and taverns. They were also forced to shut down and had no income for two months. After government relaxed the rules on the booze ban, we were all excited because some of our parents could earn a living again. Then boom, the government banned booze again. How are these parents expected to support their families? It is unfair that the government did this without even forewarning people.
