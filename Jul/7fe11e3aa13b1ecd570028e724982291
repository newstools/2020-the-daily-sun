Mojapelo said investigations led the team to an area next to a local Crèche at Xipungu village in Letsitele, where the body was found in the bushes. Further investigations suggested that the child might have been raped before she was murdered. This will be determined by forensic investigations that are unfolding. The child, who was a Grade 1 learner at Totwana Primary School at Xipungu village, was reportedly left with a caregiver, who is also a family member on Monday when she suddenly went missing.
