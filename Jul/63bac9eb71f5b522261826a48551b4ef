  The bail application by the 41 suspects accused of
killing five people at the International Pentecost Holiness Church has been
postponed. Among them is a SAPS member, an SANDF member, and a
lawyer who was involved in the violent hostage drama that erupted at the
church. Magistrate Gavin Pillay spoke to the lawyers of the
accused through the fence explaining how the proceedings were going to unfold. It was agreed that the suspects will remain in
their cells while their bail is being deliberated. This is due to the court being closed for
decontamination after one of the employees tested positive for Covid-19. On the morning of the 11th of July, a Holy war
erupted at the IPHC "ISilo" in Zuurbekom, West of Johannesburg. Allegations state that there is a struggle of power
between three brothers as to who the rightful heir is. The suspects are charged with murder, attempted
murder and malicious damage to property and will have their next appearance on
Monday the 27th. Their bail application affidavits will be filed by
this afternoon.
