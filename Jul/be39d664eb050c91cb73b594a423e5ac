The Premier Soccer League (PSL) board of governors (BOG) held a virtual meeting on Tuesday to discuss among other things, the completion of the 2019/20 season. The PSL is determined to ensure the completion of the current season which has been on hold for over four months due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, they have run into some struggles with the South African Football Association (Safa) who insists the resumption of football in Mzansi cannot happen before the 1st of April. According to the association, match officials still need time to work on their fitness as they have not been in action for some time. “According to the Referees Sub-Committee of the the Technical  Committee, the first week of August is the appropriate date of the commencement of NSL matches,” read a statement from Safa. Meanwhile, the PSL has been ready and had earmarked the 18th of June for the resumption of matches. “The Board of Governors noted that the PSL had received permission from the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture on 23 June 2020 to resume the 2019/20 season,” read a statement form the PSL following their BOG meeting. “The PSL had complied with the requirements and ready to resume with the 2019/20 season on 18 July 2020, but unable to do so due to unavailability of match officials. “The Executive Committee has been mandated to re-engage stakeholders regarding the current status quo.”
