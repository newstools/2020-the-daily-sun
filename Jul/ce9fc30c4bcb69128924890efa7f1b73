STOKVEL has changed my life. If I didn’t join one, I’d still be living in a shack waiting for an RDP! These were the words of Lina Makola who has built a seven-roomed house with her stokvel money. The 43-year-old mum of three from section S of extension 11 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun her life changed in 2015 when she joined Gomola Social Club. Lina said she used to live in a shack but when she received R30 000 from her stokvel in 2018, she decided to build a house. Lina told the SunTeam the 30-member stokvel collected R3 000 each month. Last year, she received another R30 000 and her husband gave her R20 000 to put up the roof. Lina said next month, she planned to finish the house and she’d be moving into it in October. “This stokvel is a life-saver and I’ll continue being a member,” she said. Lina said at the end of the year, she wanted to start saving to buy a BMW 3 Series. She encouraged other people to join stokvels as they would ease the pressures of life. “At first, I didn’t want to join but now I am achieving my goals,” she said. Lina said she was also using the stokvel to pay for her daughter’s fees at Unisa. She said her house had three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a lounge, a kitchen and double garage. Her daughter Kgothatso (19) said the stokvel had changed everything for her family. She said she was in her first year studying criminal justice. “My mum is a hard worker. I am happy to see her always smiling,” she said.
