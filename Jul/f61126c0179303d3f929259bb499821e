Reggae singer P. Postman says he’ll be giving people a piece of his mind on his fourth album. The musician, whose real name is Percy Mukwevho, said this album will consist of conversations. Postman told SunBuzz: “This album will be a combination of things I want to talk about – things I feel people need to hear. “There’s a song that’s about how we need to build a better future for the next generation. “That song stands out the most for me because that message is important. “Some songs are blunt because I need the message to get across and I’m unapologetic about those songs. “I can’t say when I’ll be releasing it yet, but definitely this year.” Postman, the first- born son of reggae legend Dr Colbert Mukwevho, said his love for music definitely came from seeing his father perform. “I’d be lying if I said my dad wasn’t my biggest inspiration. He has a lot to do with me doing music. Postman will be releasing a single titled Ready  this Friday, 31 July. “Ready is a song I wrote after losing my mum. Most importantly, I’m releasing it for people who’re feeling the way I felt when I wrote that song.”
