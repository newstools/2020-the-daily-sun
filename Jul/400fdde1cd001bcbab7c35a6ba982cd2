There is something about the grapevine. Not the one that travels and is normally the bearer of bad or misinformed news. But, the grapevine that bears grapes for both percentage  and non percentage beverage drinkers. For those percentage drinkers, its perfectly served in either white or red and with a sweet or dry flavor for your taste-buds. This grapevine ages beautifully over time and its value increases as it gets younger. This beautiful paradox makes this drink a site to be hold, and every glass has a story to be told. One of which, is how this amazing drink drives the punani crazy. If drank in careful moderation of course, wine can be what the sex doctor ordered and here is why:  Studies show that red wine may be the only type of alcohol that can improve sex. Another study found that drinking a moderate amount of red wine actually increases blood flow to women's erogenous zones, and could increase lubrication. The study also found that women who drank red wine had a higher sex drive than those who drank another type of alcohol. I guess its too late to tell her to stop wining right? (you see what I did there)  A study also found that polyphenols, which are found in red wine, as wells as berries and chocolate, can decrease instances of erectile dysfunction by 14%. If that wasn't enough, researchers also pointed out that red wine contains histamines, which can increase your sex drive. So one glass can change an Eskom load-shedding situation into a lighthouse. Turning everything on.  You know the saying: "Too much of a good thing is not good". Well sadly that is true and despite all benefits that come with wine for the punani. We have to be aware that downing the entire bottle wont double the fun. Just a glass or two after a good meal, and thereafter desert can be served in the bedroom.
