pandemic hailing it as a wise move as the department had failed to keep
children safe at schools. The governing body in a statement issued shortly after
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the decision on Thursday night, said it has
been its believe that schools were not ready to open. “It's been our call as organization to the Minister of
Basic Education Mme Angie Motshega that all schools must closed and scraped
2020 academic year. “This is a decisive way in which the government can
intervene in this situation. This shows that the decision to reopen schools
before was not a good move by the Department of Basic Education,” it said. The body lamented the department for failing to meet
the norms it has set for itself in keeping learners safe in schools and could
therefore not be trusted with the safety of children in schools. Further, some schools were still having shortages of
water, personally protective equipments while some learners were still walking
more than 10 kilometers to schools. “We also call upon to the president of the country
Honourable Cyril Ramaphosa to form Special Investigating Unit to investigate
corruption on PPEs against some officials of government,” it said.
