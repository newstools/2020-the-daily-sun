MURDER accused Vusi Sehlabela will be kept in jail at Nelspruit Correctional Services after his case was moved to the Mpumalanga High Court. The 37-year-old from Marite Trust is accused of killing Patrick Mhlanga (41) during a road rage incident in Madras. The incident happened in April 2018 when Sehlabela was out on bail for the murder of his brother-in-law Daniel Mokoena (40), who was gunned down in full view of patrons at a Marite tavern in 2017. The accused appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court near Bushbuckridge earlier today, where he heard his case would be heard in the high court. In September, state witness Fridah Khuane (31) was killed after being shot eight times by unknown suspects who fled the scene at an Acornhoek tavern. Khuane was due to give evidence about the death of her husband Daniel, but the matter was moved from Mhala Regional Court to the Nelspruit Regional Court. State Prosecutor Rapelwana Sebotse told the court the suspectâ€™s matter was being moved to Mpumalanga High Court that will be sitting in Graskop in September, and Magistrate Robert Mokone postponed the case to the seventh of that month.
