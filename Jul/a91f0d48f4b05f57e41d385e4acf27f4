WHEN the salon owner welcomed a woman carrying a baby, little did she know she’d soon have trouble on her hands. The Xhosa-speaking woman waited for a while before putting the child on the sofa and saying she quickly needed to go to the shop. This happened two weeks ago, and the salon owner from Zimu extension in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, is still waiting for the mum to return. Sergeant Harry Manaka said: “It’s alleged the woman carrying the baby came into the salon and asked for her hair to be washed. “She immediately paid the owner of the salon, and while waiting her turn she asked if she could leave her baby on the sofa so she could quickly rush to a nearby shop. “The owner told her to hurry because she was almost finished with the other customer, but she never came back.” Manaka said the salon owner told police the mum was visiting the salon for the first time. He said the baby was being looked after by another customer who was at the salon when the incident happened. “The social development department has since been notified of the case and its progress,” he said. Manaka appealed to anyone who may have information about the woman to call the Springs child protection unit.
