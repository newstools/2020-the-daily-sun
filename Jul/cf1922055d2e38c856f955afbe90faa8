PRESIDENT  Cyril Ramaphosa has waved a white flag to taxi operators with his announcement this evening that taxis could now load at 100% capacity for short distance travel. “Taxis undertaking local trips will now be permitted to increase their capacity to 100%, while long distance taxis will not be allowed to exceed 70% occupancy, on condition that new risk  mitigation protocols related to masks, vehicle sanitising and open windows are followed,” he said. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula had been at loggerheads with the taxi industry which complained that it was bleeding money because of lockdown travel regulations and restrictions.    death rate of 1.5% was  among the lowest in the world as compared to a global average case death rate of 4.4%.“We owe the relatively low number of deaths in our country to the experience and dedication of our health professionals and the urgent measures we have taken to build the capacity of our health system which faced a number of its own inherent challenges before COVID 19.”He also blamed the spike of cases to reckless and careless behavior of people, saying even with concrete evidence, there were people who were not adhering to regulations and were not wearing masks in public or organising house parties.
