AN intimate memorial service was held for veteran actress Candy
Moloi earlier today at her home in Bryanston, north of Joburg. The 67-year-old actress who was one of the original cast members
of Muvhango,passed away on Tuesday after a long battle with  cancer. Friends, family and industry colleagues all paid tribute to a
woman who was described as an angel. Legendary singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka spoke about meeting
Candy in 1986 and how they both starred in the Xitsonga TV drama Giyani: Land
of Blood. “I wished she had been recognised more while she was still alive”,
added Yvonne. Metro FM DJ Wilson Nkosi was among the other entertainers
including castmates from Giyani and Muvhango. Candy was praised for always demanding excellence from
actors or radio personalities she worked with when it came to them speaking Tshivenda
and Xitsonga. Her doctor about how she had initially collapsed and suffered
a seizure before being diagnosed with a massive brain tumour. The operation was successful but after chemotherapy she
started becoming sick again. Lerato Zah,Candy’s actress daughter whom she was on Muvhango
with, broke down before speaking about her ‘queen.’ “My mom’s last three years have been difficult. She was very
ill, suffered from all sorts of cancer attacks. It was not just the brain
cancer but there was also one behind the eye.” “She had lymphomas in the stomach and chest. In the end I
believe she was tired of fighting.” Lerato, who recently beat Covid-19,said she only saw her mum
twice since the lockdown because of the restrictions in hospitals. She ended her emotional speech with, “mama ,I release you.” Mama Candy will be buried this coming Sunday in Limpopo.  Goodnight my Queen A post shared by  Lerato ‘Zah’ (@lerato_zah) on Jul 30, 2020 at 3:51am PDT
