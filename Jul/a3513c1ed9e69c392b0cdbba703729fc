Award-winning jazz musician Thandi Ntuli has shared the music she worked on in Switzerland. The singe was headlining the Jazzwetkstatt, a festival in Switzerland last year. She has now released the music here in Mzansi. The album titled Exiled (Live at Jazzwerkstatt) was released in March. Speaking about the album, Thandi said: "Exiled is my second album. So I took that album and rearranged it. So what happened was that I was called to headline the event and was told that I can choose my own musicians and make my own music. So I rearranged the songs on Exiled and performed them at Jazzwerkstatt last year."

I usually write for a six-piece band and this was a fourteen-piece band. So it was a great learning experience," said Thandi. She said she is working on new music.
