 A security officer in his 20s was injured on
Thursday morning in a cash-in-transit heist on Frikkie Meyer Road in
Vanderbijlpark. ER24’s Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived
on the scene to find the wrecked cash van in the middle of the road with debris
spread across the scene. “Paramedics assessed the four security
members on the scene and found that only one had sustained a gunshot wound to
his ankle. The other three men, fortunately, escaped injury,” Meiring said. The man was treated for his injury and
provided with pain-relief medication before he was transported to a nearby
hospital for further care.
