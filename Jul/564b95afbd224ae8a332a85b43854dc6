RELEGATION threatened Black Leopards star Lesedi Kapinga has extended his contract with Lidoda Duvha, but just for their remaining six Absa Premiership matches. Kapinga’s contract with Leopards expired at the end of June. But due to the coronavirus pandemic which forced the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to suspend all matches since mid-March, teams are allowed to extend a player’s contract until the end of this season, if both the player and club agree. Kapinga’s decision to help Leopards in their relegation battle will be a huge relief and boost to under pressure coach Alan Clark and the club’s fans. Leopards are currently bottom of the Absa Premiership with 20 points from six matches remaining. “I don’t want to talk much about Kapinga’s contract, but all I can confirm is that he will be with Leopards for the remaining six matches,” said Kapinga’s manager, Mushe Mudau. “Kapinga’s focus now is to play six games and to give his best to help Leopards move away from the danger zone and avoid relegation.” It is said that the 25-year-old midfielder will be joining defending Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns on a five-year contract, and he can’t wait to work with Downs coach Pitso Mosimane. But stressed Mudau: “I cannot talk about Sundowns or any other team for now. Our focus now is for Kapinga to stay focused at Leopards in their remaining six games as he still has a contract with them. We have to be professional and respect Leopards. If there is any news it will be announced when this season is over.” Kapinga has also been linked with a move to return to his former team Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) next season, as they will be playing in the top flight after their owner and businessman Masala Mulaudzi bought Bidvest Wits Premiership status.
