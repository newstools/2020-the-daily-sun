THE taking over of ambulance services from municipalities by the Gauteng government has brought nothing but chaos. The Ekurhuleni Municipality was the latest to have its ambulances taken on Wednesday. And Fanie Dladla (20) from Gugulethu/Everest squatter camp near Springs had to spend more than two hours lying on the side of the cold road, waiting for an ambulance. This after he was hit by a grey Mercedes-Benz on Grootvally Road near Payneville Primary School in Springs, on Wednesday. The SunTeam drove to a nearby fire station to try to get him help, but found ambulances waiting to be taken away by the provincial government. Frustrated paramedics told Daily Sun there was nothing they could do to help. The residents from Gugulethu/Everest felt that the provincial government was taking them for granted. “This was clearly a political decision taken without consulting us,” said Sidney Ndlovu (51). Another resident, Salphinah Mahlangu (39), said: “We fear this kind of incompetence will result in many people dying while waiting for ambulances.” The SunTeam also visited the Brakpan Fire Station and found 12 ambulances parked, with paramedics doing nothing. Ekurhuleni spokesman Zweli Dlamini said the municipality would no longer render ambulance services. This came into effect as of 1 July. Should residents need an ambulance, they can call 011 564 2211 or 011 564 2210.
