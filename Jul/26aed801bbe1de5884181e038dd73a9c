THE Department of Education employed young people for screening and cleaning in schools to assist in the fight against the spread of Covid-19. But workers who are employed in schools around Bojanala District, North West, are worried that the department will never pay them for their hard work. One of the screeners said they haven’t received their June salaries. “What is devastating is that the principals are not saying anything about this issue. We don’t know if we will get paid for July. We just go to work without knowing what will happen,” she said. “Our contracts stated that we will be paid R3 000 every month. If the department wanted volunteers, they should have stated that and they should not mislead unemployed people who are desperately seeking jobs. “We use transport fees to get to work and we have families to feed, we can’t work for free. Working during these times is risky. The fact that we have put our lives at risk for free is not right for us.” North West education spokesman Elias Malindi said the department has paid 146 screeners and others are going to get their salaries. “The salary delay was caused by the fact that some of the screeners didn’t have bank accounts when they were appointed, and others didn’t correctly fill in their appointment forms.”
