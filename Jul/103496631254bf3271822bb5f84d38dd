THE bail application of Angeline Seanego (22) has been postponed for the third time after she supplied the court with the wrong address. Seanego appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday facing murder charges. She was bust two weeks ago for allegedly killing her boyfriend Dennis Kyazze and hiding his naked body under the bed in their flat in the Tshwane CBD. The state prosecutor told the court that the address given to them was different once again. They said the address supplied by the grandmother in the statements was completely different. The magistrate adjourned the matter to 30 July, and said on that day they will hear the case with or without the correct address. The magistrate said the matter couldn’t be postponed again for the same reason. Yesterday, her legal representative asked the court to postpone the bail hearing until they could confirm her home address. According to police spokesman Kay Makhubele, a relative of the dead man went to his flat and found the girlfriend. “The body of the deceased was found under the bed with injuries on the upper body,” said Makhubele. He said she was arrested and charged after she couldn’t explain the strange circumstances.
