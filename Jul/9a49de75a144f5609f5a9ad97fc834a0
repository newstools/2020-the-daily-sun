Norma Gigaba, the wife of former minister Malusi Gigaba, has been arrested by the Brooklyn police in Tshwane this afternoon, according to sources. She has been charged with malicious damage to property, crimen injuria and assault. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hungwani Mulaudzi said the suspect will be appearing in court on Monday. "I cannot confirm who opened the case or the merit of the case but the suspect has been arrested and will appear in court on Monday," he said. The arrest comes after a video has been doing the rounds on social media of what is alleged to be the former minister's car. In the video a Mercedes-AMG G63 Wagon is seen being vandalised with a key and the word cheater written all over it. The Gigabas are not new to public drama. In 2017 a New York-based fashion stylist Buhle Mkhize released details of her affair with Malusi.
