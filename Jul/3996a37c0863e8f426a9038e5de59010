GLASGOW City have hailed their latest addition of Banyana Banyana captain Janine van Wyk, as one of the "biggest ever signings in Scottish women's football". The 33-year-old centre-back lead Banyana at their Fifa Women's World Cup Finals last year in France. She has also earned herself 170 caps for the Mzansi women's national team. The Janine Van Wyk (JVW) owner is expected to hit the ground running in scotland as the club coach has already starting to plan around her for their Champions League fixture next month. Head coach Scott Booth says van Wyk's "incredible experience" will be key for his side, who face Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals in San Sebastien on 21 August. Booth stated: "She has incredible experience and I feel this will be key for us this season. "Janine captained her nation at the 2019 World Cup and is their record cap holder. "I know that she will 100% lead by example and fit in to our already talented squad.” And City club manager Laura Montgomery added: "Her record is incredible on and off the pitch in what she has done for girls and women's sport in her own country as well as in her promotion of equality." "At Glasgow City, we are all about championing women and girls and Janine very much fits into that mould. "Her footballing CV is very impressive and we are delighted she has chosen to continue her journey with our club.”
