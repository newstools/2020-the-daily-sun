ONE of South Africa’s top sporting events – the Cape Town Sevens – will have a tense wait until the end of the month to find out if the tournament will go ahead in December, something that is increasingly looking unlikely. World Rugby will take a decision by the end of July on the tournament, which has been sold out annually within minutes and is a massive fan favourite to finish the rugby season. The complexities of logistics of moving 16 men’s and women’s teams across the globe for a rugby tournament will hit Sevens rugby especially hard, and it is likely the tournament will be shifted to another date if it is possible. SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux admitted this in a conference call with journalists on Tuesday. “You would have seen that some of the Sevens competitions are cancelled. We are still waiting on World Rugby on a decision on the Sevens series next year and how and when it will take place,” he said. “Given the current restrictions there might be a movement in dates, there might be cancellations or postponement. We await World Rugby’s decision on that and it will be informed by World Rugby, border restrictions and obviously the sponsor’s appetite to go with that. We are expecting a final decision on that by the end of the month.” The Olympics have already been postponed for a year and a qualifying tournament for the emerging nations was also cancelled due to Covid earlier this year. A cancellation of the Cape Town Sevens will hit the Blitzboks hard as much of their funding comes from profits made at the tournament. New Zealand were declared winners of this year’s HSBC World Series after four tournaments were cancelled, while the Blitzboks ended second. -SuperSport.com
