ANGRY Nongoma residents in northern KZN have blockaded the town main road demanding the arrest of the mayor's bodyguard. This is apparently after he knocked down two teenage girls dead with a mayor's car. The incident which left Olono Shezi (12) and Asanda Ngcobo (16) dead happened on Thursday ecvening. The teenage girls' uncle Mbuso Ngcobo (29) told Daily Sun that his nieces were sent to the shop to buy bread. He said the family were called by the neighbours to rush out after the girls were knocked down and found them lying on the road unconscious. He said they rushed them to the clinic but they were told they were already dead. He said the family is devastated but what made things worse was that the bodyguard wasn't arrested and residents have gone to the road to protest. "We are demanding the immediate arrest of the bodyguard. We know that if a driver has killed people he must be arrested and charged for culpable homicide but this one is above the law because he is a mayor's bodyguard," saidÂ  Ngcobo. One of the protesters who asked not to be named said they are demanding the arrest of the bodyguard. He said it's been long residents demanding speed humps on the road but they were being ignored. Municipal manager Mpumelelo Mnguni who said he was with the mayor at the victims family said it is not true that police did nothing. He said they took statements but didn't arrest the bodyguard because they will investigate first. He asked to be called later as they were still busy with the family. Cops provincial spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police don't arrest the driver for culpable homicide but open the case and wait for public prosecutor to make a decision.
