ALAN Clark says he was not forced to resign as Black Leopards coach. Clark said he left the relegation-haunted team who are sitting at the bottom of the Absa Premiership because he had an offer he could not refuse in Europe. He said the Venda-based club’s boss David Thidiela understood and accepted his resignation yesterday. “I was happy and I was looking forward to helping the team avoid relegation,” said Clark. “I got an opportunity which is a dream to me and I cannot let it pass. I sat down with chairman Thidiela and explained to him and he did not want to stand on my way. I want to learn in Europe. Maybe one day I will come back to Leopards.” But a source told SunSport that Leopards management did not trust the inexperienced Clark to save the team in their remaining six Premiership matches. “What is happening is that Leopards want someone with experience in this situation, and Alan Clark is still a young coach who is still learning,” said our source. “Leopards management felt it was better for Alan to resign so that they can get someone with experience in their remaining do-or-die six matches. Look, they (Leopards) have already lot some good players in Lesedi Kapinga and Joseph Mhlongo and now they need someone (coach) they can trust. “They let Kapinga go because they cannot trust him in this situation, as he had already signed a pre-contract with another team (Mamelodi Sundowns). Leopards want people they can trust.” Clark is the fifth coach to be in charge of Leopards this season. Leopards started the season with Lionel Soccoia, Morgan Shivambu, Luc Eymael, Cavin Johnson and then Clark took over in February. Leopards, who were promoted to the top flight two seasons ago, are bottom with 20 points.
