SUNWHEELS tested Mahindra’s new S11 Pick Up and fell in love with this 4x4. From the sides and rear, it looks like a humble bakkie, but that changes when you step in front and see its daring grille with a good-looking restyled head and fog lamps. Jump inside and suddenly you are in a whole new world, as the S11 has all the modern features you’re looking for. The spacious cabin boasts all essential comforts and techno advances, including four speakers, 7-inch touchscreen with GPS navigation, Bluetooth, USB and AUX support portals. But above all, the S11 excels in road performance. Feeling how comfortable it was over humps and potholes, I drove to rough roads in Westonaria, west of Joburg,where the S11 proved it’s one of the best in its segment. All hail to the 2,2 litre, four-cylinder Hawk turbo diesel engine, with six-speed auto transmission, delivering 103kW and 320Nm of torque. With easy acceleration, the S11 has 7,9-litres/100km fuel consumption, a job well done in these times where every cent matters. You’ll love its static-turn bending headlamps that automatically switch on around dark corners. Another techno advance is the Micro-hybrid that intelligently switches into standby mode.
