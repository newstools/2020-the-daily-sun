The two singers have taken charge of their future! Amber MusicQ, a female duo from Jozi, plan to take over the house industry. Their latest single with J Maloe, Take Control, is dominating the charts on Mzansi’s commercial radio stations. Group member Nqabakazi Ngema (33) from Soweto told Daily Sun the song was inspired by the recent rise of gender-based violence in the country. “Hopefully, we can inspire someone to take control of a bad situation and learn to see themselves as worthy of more,” she said. “The song is doing very well. People are loving and downloading it and we’re super-grateful to everyone who’s downloaded the song.” They specialise in soulful house, jazz and neo soul. Second member, Ntombi Tshabalala (28), said they started making music in 2012 at the Campus of Performing Arts in Midrand, Joburg. “We wrote our first song together, titled Lady, around the same week we met,” said Nqabakazi. “From then onwards we started experimenting in songwriting, which elevated our skills as a dynamic duo. “Songs are powerful as they can brighten one’s day, make you cry and get you to think. This was something we both wanted to do way before we met.” The two were inspired by singers Thandiswa Mazwai, Simphiwe Dana and Zonke Dikana. “Most of our songs talk about self-love, unity and our journey as Amber MusicQ,” said Ntombi. “We always hope our music will help people look within because we’re the help they’re waiting for.” The duo has also had some bumpy rides along the way, accompanied by career-defining moments. “We’ve had moments where we thought great things were about to happen and nothing happened. “At the same time we’ve had great opportunities, but weren’t ready for them. “We’re blessed to have access to people who have experience and artists who’re still on our level.” They said their dream collaborators would be Moon Rocket, Black Coffee and Black Motion.
