HE TAKES full responsibility, he doesn’t deny the accusations, and claims he’s sorry. Lithapo actor Mangaliso Ngema, who was accused of sexual harassment, shocked Mzansi yesterday when he apologised. “I’m not going to deny allegations levelled against my name,” he wrote on Facebook. “I’ll take full responsibility for the sexual harassment case. I apologise to Miss Lorraine Moropa and others for the abuse I directed towards them.” He apologised to his family, cast members, and Quizzical Pictures. “I take the fall I deserve.” Quizzical Pictures said they’ve resolved the issue on the set of Lithapo. “The actress is comfortable with the outcome.” Actress Lorraine claimed she was sexually harassed by a senior actor on the set of the series. Soon after, actress and radio personality, Altovise Lawrence claimed she was harassed by the same man, on the same set. Actresses such as Florence Masebe, Rami Chuene, Masasa Mbangeni, Nokuthula Mavuso, Thando Thabethe, Thembisa Mdoda, Bonnie Mbuli, Rosie Motene and even Dumisani Mbebe took part in conversations about the issue on social media. Housekeepers actress Thando said people should be taken seriously when they report these things. “I’m happy actors are supporting one another.” Isibaya star Mampho Brescia said she’s been on the same set for about seven years and has never had a bad experience. “I sympathise with actresses and women in general who’ve gone through this.” Actress Nokuthula Mavuso wrote on Twitter she worked with an actor who would lick his lips and make comments when nobody was watching, and nothing was done until she refused to work. Actress Thembisa Mdoda tweeted: “Perpetrators must not have room to breathe.” Actress Masasa Mbangeni tweeted: “I beg you all to please not let this die down.” Florence tweeted: “Any action Quizzical Pictures take now’s just a reaction to the noise.” She said they should have taken action when Lorraine first reported sexual harassment.
