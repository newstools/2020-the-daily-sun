BAFANA Bafana international Lars Veldwijk has made the switch to South Korean second-tier side Suwon FC, the club have confirmed. The striker leaves top K-League side Jeonbuk Motors after battling to win a starting place and the impending arrival of Brazilian forward Gustavo. Veldwijk moved to Asia from Dutch club Sparta Rotterdam in January and scored on debut, but that was his only goal in three starts and eight substitute appearances for Jeonbuk. "Professional football team Suwon FC recruited foreign striker Las Veldwijk of Jeonbuk Hyundai," a club statement read. Suwon currently top the second-tier and are gunning for promotion to the top-flight at the end of the season. It is yet another club for Veldwijk on what has been a journeyman career to date for the 28-year-old. The much-travelled forward has also played for FC Volendam, Dordrecht, Utrecht, Excelsior, PEC Zwolle and Groningen in the Netherlands, as well as Nottingham Forest (England), Kortrijk (Belgium) and Aalesund (Norway).
