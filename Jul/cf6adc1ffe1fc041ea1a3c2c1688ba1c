AFTER spending almost a decade writing and reciting poems, Mpume “Zulu Poet” Xulu (31) is spreading her wings. The poet from Nkandla, northern KZN, will release her debut Afro pop single, Sengihambile, at the end of the month. The song is dedicated to the journey of her life. She’ll call herself Mpume SA to build her music brand. She made a name for herself when she recited poems on Izwi Lomzansi FM in 2011. Mpume told SunBuzz: “I want to show Mzansi my singing talent. People think poets only write and recite poems. “Poets are also artists and can sing well, like I’m doing. I’ve recorded three Afro pop singles, all to be released this year.” She hopes to give her fans a different taste of music when she releases her debut album next year. She said: “At the moment I’m just testing the waters with my standard Afro pop singles. “I want to see their reaction. I hope my audience will give it as much of a warm welcome as they did my poems. “I’m working on my debut album, an Afro pop and poetry mix. “I want my fans to get a different taste of music. “I can sing and write and recite poems. “It will be easier for me to do both on my debut album.” Mpume, however, said her music branding will be different. Mpume said: “In poetry I specifically focus on challenges that affect Zulu people, especially in their love lives. “In music I represent all of Mzansi. That’s why I’m calling myself Mpume SA.”
