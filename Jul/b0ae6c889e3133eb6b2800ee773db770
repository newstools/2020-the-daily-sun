Chelsea's penultimate Premier League fixture against champions Liverpool on Wednesday night takes them further than any other since the restart and offers the Blues the chance to return to London with three pivotal points. Chelsea have won 18 of our past 44 matches against sides starting the day top of the Premier League table - more than any other side in the competition - and hunger for Champions League football will drive the Blues on as Liverpool prepare to receive silverware that has long eluded them. With a guard of honour before and an expensively choreographed Premier League trophy presentation in the Kop afterwards, Jurgen Klopp has admitted there are distractions for his team tonight. "It’s not the easiest game I ever prepared with the team, to be honest," he said, "because there are two things tomorrow night; usually I don’t have to think about something else." This visit notches up Chelsea's 89th appearance at Anfield in all competitions, matching nearby Goodison Park as the most visited away ground in the club’s history.The Blues must now set aside the 14th FA Cup final appearance secured on Sunday, and maintain a steely determination to leave Anfield with all three points for the first time since the title-winning 2014/15 season. Four of the six league and cup visits since that win have finished 1-1. Chelsea were ebullient in our most recent meeting at Stamford Bridge, a 2-0 FA Cup victory. - Article courtesy of Chelsea FC
