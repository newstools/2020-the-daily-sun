THE air was thick with grief when friends and family said goodbye to Tebogo Lephothe (27) and her son Ikageng (6) yesterday. Their funeral service was held at Tebogo’s home in Suurman in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. They were buried at Dilopye Cemetery. The two were burnt to death in their shack last Friday and Tebogo’s family believes her ex-boyfriend was responsible. According to the family, he’d been threatening to kill her since she broke up with him six months ago. Many mourners said they were angry about what happened and there was no way they would have stayed away from the funeral. Tebogo’s guardian Lesley Diane (50) said he wanted justice.  Her other guardian Angeline Lephothe said she was overwhelmed.  “I want my children back. It feels like I’m dreaming. This can’t be them. I can’t believe it. I want my kids back,” she said. Tebogo’s best friend, Tshegofatso Komane, said she blamed herself for not saving them. “I let them down and I regret not taking Ikageng when she asked me to take him. “There are many people who have died like this and justice was not served. This time something must be done,” she said. Other speakers said the mum and her son were very close to each other. “They were inseparable. Tebogo took her son everywhere she went and it’s sad their lives had to end at the same time,” said a speaker.
