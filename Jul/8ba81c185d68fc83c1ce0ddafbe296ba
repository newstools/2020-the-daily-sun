A PRINCIPAL survived a hail of bullets on his first attack. But yesterday when the very same principal was shot several times he didn't make it. The Sibonise Junior Primary School principal Moses Madonsela died when unknown suspects fired a hail of bullets towards him while he was driving at J section KwaMashu north of Durban. Madonsela was in his white bakkie with a care taker from his school when the shooting happened. A resident who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that she was washing her clothes when she suddenly heard the gun shots. She said she went outside then saw that the principal had been shot.  "Principal Madonsela was with a care taker when the shooting took place. The care taker sustained injuries and he was rushed to hospital," she said. Another resident said he heard that a white Toyota Etios was seen shooting at the principal's car and then escaped. "The etios over took the principal and then fired the shots before escaping," said the resident. Family members who were at the scene refused to comment about the matter. This was the second time that the principal was attacked. Daily Sun ran a story last year. He was driving a bakkie in Newlands East in May last year when he was driving his silver grey bakkie. Its alleged that on that incident he was driving along Barracuda Drive when a car allegedly over took his bakkie. Apparently the police found close to 26 bullets holes in the bakkie. Madonsela was then rushed to hospital with gun shot wounds. He was at ICU for a long time following that incident. KZN Department of Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi confirmed the matter. "I'm still gathering information on the matter," said Mahlambi. The scene is still active, police are on the scene.
