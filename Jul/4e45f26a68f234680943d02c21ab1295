HARDWORKING, selfless and short-tempered are some of the words used to describe Jabu Dladla (71). The Zamokuhle Funeral Services owner died on Thursday. His family told Daily Sun he had a heart attack on hearing about his cousin’s death. His son Mzwakhe said they rushed him to the nearest hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. “The family intended to break the sad news to him, but a call came and delivered the news.” Jabu had apparently been having heart problems for some time. “He wasn’t himself since the passing of his brother a few weeks ago,” said Mzwakhe. “He’s always been a hard worker, but he was always down of late and dragged his body when doing things he’d normally have done easily. “The second death was unbearable for his heart and he suffered a heart attack.” Jabu’s business, started more than 10 years ago, had several branches across the country. Mzwakhe said: “I doubt we’ll ever forget him. “He was a kind man who helped many people. “He taught us to work together and we intend to do exactly that.” Bonga Mthembu said Jabu was a friend and good mentor.
