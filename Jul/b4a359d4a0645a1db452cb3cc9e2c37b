RUBBISH collectors are at risk of being exposed to Covid-19. This is because they are always exposed to waste such as used surgical masks and gloves. To help minimise the risk of them getting infected, Fibre Circle distributed masks, hand washing units and soap to the waste collectors and some residents from Never Never, Daggafontein and Everest/Gugulethu squatter camps on Friday. Inside the pack was also a R200 food voucher, a blanket and a booklet to teach their children about the dangers of coronavirus. The handover was in partnership with Springs cops. Anele Sololo, general manager of Education and Awareness at Fibre Circle, said they chose these squatter camps because that’s where most of their recyclers were from. “We thank them for working with us to keep our country clean,” said Sololo. She said Fibre Circle has donated 1 500 packs. She said some residents were also given PPE. Sololo thanked the Springs Police Station for partnering with them. Resident Mary Ngobeni (48) said she was motivated by the gift. Morris Ranku (52) said the money he made from recycling helped to support his family and he was happy to receive PPE. “It’s important to teach residents about the dangers of the virus,” he said. Brigadier Thembeka Gwebushe said the project was a great success. She thanked the cops involved in the planning of the project.
