The presidency has thanked the youth of Mzansi for their suggestions on how to rebuild the economy following the covid-19 pandemic crisis. In a statement, the office of the presidency said they have received hundreds of submissions from across the country on how government can drive economic recovery after the coronavirus crisis. “Listening to the youth as we tackle the complex decisions that lie ahead is extremely important. As the leaders of the future, they will one day be the decision-makers who help to shape a better South Africa for all,” said the presidency. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa made a call to young people to rise to the challenge of leading the economy after the coronavirus. Suggestions received included supporting local and townships economies. The youth said the local economy will provide the much-needed jobs that will see an increase in taxes and drive down crime. They urged the government to invest directly in the youth of South Africa's townships and villages and not organisations that represent the youth. Other suggestions included manufacturing, green economy, digital technology, farming innovation as well as environmentalism. They told government to fund more researches in science and strictly hire fresh graduates to implement their ideas.Furthermore, to change the way business is currently done to avoid the continuation of destroying the planet, and incentivize innovation for a sustainable green economy
