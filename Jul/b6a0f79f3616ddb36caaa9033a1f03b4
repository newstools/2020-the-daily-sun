CHIPPA United have confirmed that Thabo Rakhale has left the club by mutual consent after his contract expired at the end of June. The 30-year-old joined the Chilli Boys from Orlando Pirates in January 2018 and has since established himself as an important first-team player. Rakhale netted five goals and provided 10 assists in his 68 appearances for Chippa across all competitions. "Thabo Rakhale's contract has expired. We can confirm the club and Thabo have amicably decided to part ways," read the statement the club shared via its social media platforms. "The club would like to thank Thabo 'Jomo' Rakhale for his service at the club for the past 3 years. He will surely be remembered. We wish him well in his future endeavours." It remains unclear where Rakhale will play next. He's been linked with a move to Kaizer Chiefs, but they are still battling against a transfer ban. Thabo Rakhale's contract has expired.
