MDUDUZI Ncube (31) has come a long way. The Afro soul singer and songwriter was born in Hammarsdale, west of Durban. “I come from a musical background and had no option except becoming a musician. “This is because, as a way of keeping us away from the streets, my parents would make us sing all day. “Somehow, the love of music grew until I decided one day I’d do music on a professional level.” But making his mark in the industry wasn’t easy for him. “As I tried to break through the industry, I realised there were many obstacles. I knew I had talent, but it wasn’t enough. As a result, I ended up in the streets of Durban,” he said. “I’d busk on the Durban beach front. Some would throw money on the ground as a way of appreciation. This encouraged me.” It was during those busking sessions that he met Brad Hunter, who became an integral part of his career. “Brad showed me the ins and outs of the music industry,” he said. “Eventually, I met DJ Tira and he took me under his wing. I recorded my first official song, Malokazi, featuring Berita. “This was soon followed by another single track, Falling.” The former Afrotainment artist has jumped ship and is signed under Inkabi Record Label. “On Friday I released my third single Isigingci, featuring Big Zulu. This is an Afro soul song about love. “Now that the song is out there, I’ve realised it actually talks to the person I love.” He said he composed the song, but Big Zulu added his own lyrics. “I wrote the song a few months back. I trust that people will enjoy it because it wasn’t rushed. “Instead, I took my time perfecting it. As a result, I wrote the song in pieces. I wanted to find the right tune and words. I then gave it to Big Zulu, who added his lyrics.” The song is already available on digital platforms.
