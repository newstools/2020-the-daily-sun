FORMER Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Brilliant Khuzwayo, is hoping to make a dramatic comeback after being told he would never kick a ball again in his life due to a severe ankle injury. Khuzwayo, who was forced to retire due to that injury when he was at Pirates last year at the age of 29, is working hard behind the scenes to revitalise his football career. However, his representatives from QT Sports have played down Khuzwayo’s comeback attempt. But SunSport sources have revealed Khuzwayo is keen to do whatever it takes to return to football. The player also told SunSport last year that he’ll try and see different people (specialists) in an attempt to get his damaged ankle repaired despite Pirates doctors saying he’ll never play again. “I’d rather not comment,” said QT Sports representative Basia Michaels. Khuzwayo said on his social media account that he has been hard at work with a specialist. At the same time, he has been flooded with heart warming messages of support from PSL footballers. “I know Brilliant is seeing a physician to reduce the scar tissue around his ankle just for basic day (to day) living,” Michaels said. “It is just for his health sake, that is what it is.” The Umlazi-born shot stopper was forced to retire when he suffered the injury during pre-season with Pirates in 2018. He moved to Pirates from Kaizer Chiefs following six years of playing second fiddle to Amakhosi’s number one Itumeleng Khune. At Pirates, Khuzwayo was looking to re-establish his career and also to challenge for a Bafana Bafana starting berth. It was a sad ending for Khuzwayo, who also played for Thanda Royal Zulu and AmaZulu.
