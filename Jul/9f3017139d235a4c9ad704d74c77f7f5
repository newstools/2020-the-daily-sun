STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker has given Iqraam Rayners the green light to join SuperSport United. The 24-year-old striker, who signed a pre-season contract with the Tshwane giants in January, was to have left Stellies after they concluded their Absa Premiership season. But the league is yet to be completed after it was halted in March due to COVID-19. The Western Cape-based outfit occupies 11th place on the log table with 27 points from 24 matches. The Premier Soccer League rookies still have six matches to play before completing their debut season in the top flight. But Barker said there was no need to stand in the player’s way from joining Matsatsantsa a Pitori. “The desire for the boy to join SuperSport was just too big. He really wants to go to Pretoria and join his new club and decided that he was going as he was looking forward to starting a new chapter with them. We give him our blessing to go although he was supposed to wait until we finish playing the remaining six games,” said Barker. The former University of Pretoria and AmaZulu coach also released experienced defender Morgan Gould from his one-year contract. Barker did not see the need to keep the former Jomo Cosmos and Bafana Bafana defender until the end of the season. “We have four other centre backs in our team and can cope in that department. When counting Gould we have five central defenders and I felt we have more than enough in one position,” explained Barker. At age 37, Gould has passed his prime, and Barker probably wants to work with younger players who still have longevity in the game. “We wish Gould well and we will see how the youngsters will handle themselves at the back,” said Barker.
