A WEEK ago, Amogelang Madeni (48) committed suicide by overdosing on his asthma medication. This was after his uncle, Tax Madeni (56) from Batho Mangaung, was buried after the struggling family battled to make ends meet. Tax’s wife, Nkagisang (53), had pleaded for help with Amogelang’s funeral and Daily Sun published the story headlined, “Family calls for help again”, on 24 July. Today, Amogelang will be laid to rest. Nkagisang said they were helped by the ward councillor to bury her nephew with dignity. She said: “After our story for help was published, we met the ward councillor and he managed to help us. It’s sad that I won’t be able to go to the graveyard to see him laid in peace because I am still wearing my husband’s mourning clothes. I’d like to thank Daily Sun and the ward councillor for the help, and ensuring that my nephew gets a decent burial.” Cousin Kea Madeni said Amogelang was visiting her in her dreams and asking to rest in peace. “I don’t have much to say but I ask you to rest in peace. You visit me in the dreams all the time and I understand your problems. I don’t have much to say but I now ask you to rest in peace,” said Kea. Pastor Vuyo Struurman said: “Amogelang is now resting on Abraham’s chest. I plead with you people to repent and seek God now. Let us run to the Lord because He will never forsake us. Rich people like to belittle poor people. But I can tell you now, we all know the time of our births, however, we don’t know our time of death.” Amogelang was laid to rest at South Park cemetery where the police was monitoring the number of people entering the graveyard.
