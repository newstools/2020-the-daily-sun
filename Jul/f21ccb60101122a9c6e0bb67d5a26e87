A truck destroyed a bridge. This is according to the Executive Mayor of Gauteng, Mzwandile Masina. This happened earlier today in Alberton on Vereeniging road. Some people on twitter are unhappy with this and stated that this is because the bridge is old and hasn't been maintained.  Masina clarified that the bridge did not collapse on it's own, it collapsed because of a truck. The truck caused the bridge to collapse. We are on side with the team of Engineers @Abramjee please report factually. The bridge did not collapsed on its own due to structural defects. pic.twitter.com/6cS1lVsL02  MEC for Gauteng public transport and roads infrastructure, Jacob Mamabolo said the Department is aware of the incident and the city of Ekurhuleni is currently working on it. "We urge road users to be cautious when approaching the road," said Mamabolo. Even after the Mayor explained how the bridge collapsed, people are still blaming it on poor lack of maintenance. Ntando Mabena said there is no way a truck could destroy a well built bridge. But the infrastructure build by the Apartheid government cannot sustain us forever, it needs rehabilitation so is schools, hospitals and clinics. STOP STEALING THE MONEY meant for these things comrade/s.  I never trusted this bridge, it always looked suspecious to me..Time for our engineers to earn their keep. Lesiba o nona hoa pele. Lindani Masuku said this bridge has always looked suspecious to him. "On that very same road, there's a bridge near Empilweni. Please have that fixed. That bridge has cracks. We can't be avoiding road accidents and have to look over our shoulders when passing under or over a bridge, it's scary," said Lindani.  Bridges r hit by trucks daily. When we design dem we take that into account especially in SA considering our driving. WHERE IS DE DAMN TRUCK. It hit a bridge n still managed 2 drive off? Ungazo dlala ngatshi wena we not is neeh.
