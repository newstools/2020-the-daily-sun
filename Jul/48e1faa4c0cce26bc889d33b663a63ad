TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have joined the long list of GladAfrica Championship teams that have reported Covid-19 cases. The Venda nased outfit on Thursday confirmed two positive cases of Covid-19 at the club, including one player and one member of the backroom staff. "After conducting Covid-19 tests on the management, technical team and the players, the results came back negative except for one player and a technical staff member who tested positive for Covid-19." "The two have been advised to isolate with immediate effect and also inform all those who had contact with them. The club would like to wish them a speedy recovery during this trying time," a club statement read. Some of GladAfrica sides that have confirmed Covid-19 cases in their squads includes log leaders Ajax Cape Town, second placed Swallows FC, TS Galaxy and University of Pretoria. TTM are currently in fourth spot in the First Division standings and they are still hopeful of securing a play-off spot which will give them another life line to fight for a place in the PSL for next season in a three team mini league. Tshakhuma are set to purchase Bidvest Wits and assume PSL status next season, with all that is left to do is for the deal to be rubber stamped by Wits. pic.twitter.com/tL82b3e49p
