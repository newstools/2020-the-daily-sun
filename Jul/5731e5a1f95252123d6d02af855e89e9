A MAN who was convicted of raping an 82-year-old gogo will remain in police custody until Monday for sentencing. Regiment Maluleke (29) from Agincourt outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, pleaded guilty to the rape charges in February. He was charged with rape after police investigations linked him to the incident through DNA testing. This after the gogo was raped by an unknown man at Newton Trust in January 2017. In the plea statement read by Maluleke’s lawyer, the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe heard that he found that the gogo’s door wasn’t properly closed. “I entered the house and she was alone at that time. We wrestled but I overpowered the gogo and raped her.  “I fled the scene, believing nobody will ever find me because I wasn’t seen by anyone except the gogo. I plead guilty to this crime. I regret my action and want to ask for forgiveness from the victim and the family,” the court heard. During his appearance yesterday, the court also heard that Maluleke’s lawyer wanted the presence of a social worker who compiled the victim’s impact report for cross-examination before sentencing. Magistrate Elmarie Theron postponed the case to Monday for sentencing.
