THE City of Cape Town destroyed and took away building material at a newly formed squatter camp called Covid-19 yesterday. Nomsa Ndamase (34) told Daily Sun lockdown has made things difficult for them and that’s why they decided to build their own homes. “Piece jobs have dried up and we don’t have money to pay for rent anymore. That’s why we are occupying any open space available,” said Nomsa. “There was no need for them to take our material away. Destroying our shacks was enough,” she said. Another resident said if the city thought destroying their shacks would stop them from occupying any available land, then they were mistaken. “Some of us borrowed the money to buy the material and we now have to pay for material we don’t have anymore. We will never get that material,” said the resident. Nobathembu Mzila (40) said the city should’ve let them stay there until lockdown was over.  “They acted too fast because some were just building their shacks while others had already started staying in their shacks,” she said. She said some people were chased out by their landlords. “We can’t blame them because they didn’t get anything from the government ever since lockdown. We can’t expect to stay in their houses for free. They also have bills to pay,” said Nobathembu. The city’s MMC for human settlements Malusi Booi said the city monitors attempts to invade land and illegally occupy projects and acts where it can. “It uses aerial imagery, among others, to track attempts to occupy land and it uses photographs and videos to document operations,” said Booi. He said they made decisions on operations in collaboration with several stakeholders including cops and the relevant law enforcement operations. “It follows the rule of law and as in the rest of the country, it attempts to thwart land invasion as it becomes flood, fire, health and safety risks for the occupiers and the broader communities,” he sai.
