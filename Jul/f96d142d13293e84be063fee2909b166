A MPUMALANGA control prosecutor stationed at Standerton District Court, who is accused of corruption and defeating the ends of justice, was remanded in police custody until Tuesday for formal bail hearing. The 35-years-old was arrested by Mpumalanga police on Tuesday during an intelligence sting operation. This was after he accepted R5 000 bribery from the suspects in exchange of their cases to either be withdrawn or struck of the court roll, especially drug cases. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said bail of the suspect was opposed because of the seriousness of the offence. “The matter against him has been postponed to next week Tuesday (4 August) for formal bail application and to procure a magistrate from another court,” she said. The acting director of public prosecutions in Mpumalanga, Advocate Matric Luphondo, said he is concerned and views this in a very serious light. “It is disappointing that one of our own, who is supposed to be at the forefront of fighting against corruption being arrested, a major scourge in our area for the NPA, finds himself facing allegations as a perpetrator,” said Luphondo. “We will do everything legally possible to protect the image of the NPA and its core value of independence, professionalism, accountability and credibility while internal disciplinary proceedings against the suspect is underway.”
