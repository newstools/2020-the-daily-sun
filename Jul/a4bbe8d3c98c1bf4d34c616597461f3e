CHIPPA United will release defender Diamond Thopola and midfielder Meshack Maphangule at the end of PSL season. They will follow winger Thabo Rakhale and defender Tebogo Makobela who were also shown the door as their contracts were not renewed. The duo joined Chilli Boys in July last year on loan from Soweto giants Orlando Pirates having failed to get regular game time under coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic. Assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena, who was Sredojevic’s assistant, followed the pair to Port Elizabeth. But it was evident they will exit the club as he didn’t utilise their service during the only Absa Premiership match he was in charge of against Bidvest Wits (0-0) before the season was stopped due to coronavirus. Thopola only played three matches for the team this season, while Maphangule enjoyed more game time having started in 19 league matches prior to Mokwena’s arrival. Chippa COO Lukhanyo Mzizi said: “The two players will be with the club until the end of season. Whether we will replace them or not that decision will be made at the end of season,” said Mzizi. The good news for Chilli Boys fans is that management have decided to keep defender Tercious Malepe. He joined United for his second spell in August last year on a one-season loan deal from Pirates. He has been a regular in the team since he never missed a single match. “Tercious will remain with the team as he is part of our plans,” explained Mzizi. He also revealed that Mbuyiselo Sambu will be in charge of the team’s remaining six league matches as Mokwena’s loan contract was not renewed when it expired on Tuesday. Sambu has been in charge of the Chilli Boys’ MultiChoice Diski Challenge side having replaced Daine Klate. “Sambu was given the coaching role on a caretaker basis until the end of the season,” said Mzizi.
