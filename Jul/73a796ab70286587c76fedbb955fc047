SINGER Kelly Khumalo will soon be appearing on TV screens. The controversial celebrity will be starring in her reality show called Life With Kelly Khumalo on Showmax from 6 August. Speaking about how the series came about, Kelly told Daily Sun: “Legend Manqele approached me because he was interested in knowing me more and was passionate about my brand. I took my time to think about it as reality shows have to be real. “I had to be in a space where I was ready to tell my truth. That’s why I had to think about it. I agreed once I was ready.” Kelly said viewers should not expect her to talk about things they wanted to know. ALSO READ:CORONA VIDEO MAKES K.O SICK TO THE STOMACH! “This is about me. I won’t be saying anything about what they want to know. People will see my mum and kids, Christian and Thingo. My friends Brenda Mntambo, Wanda Baloyi and Thami Dish, and pretty much everyone who surrounds me will be featured.” Legend has previously produced Kwa Mamkhize, Being Bonang and Somizi & Mohale: The Union. He said: “Kelly is one of our most talented musicians but the stories I kept hearing about her didn’t add up to me. “My first approach was to do a music video for Kelly and work on rebranding her. But when I sat down with her, I realised she’s a microcosm of the black single mum in this country. “I decided I wanted to use the power of reality TV to tell her story as authentically as possible. Viewers can expect a different side of this seemingly one-sided story about Kelly.”
