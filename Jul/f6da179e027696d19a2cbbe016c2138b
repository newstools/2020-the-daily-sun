Mzansi, brace yourselves for YFM’s new host, Petula El-Kindiy. Petula, who’s from Botswana, started hosting her first show yesterday, taking over the 3am to 6am morning show. And on Saturday she’ll debut on her second show, The Morning Essentials, from 6am to 10am. An excited Petula told SunBuzz this was a dream come true. “This is unimaginable, especially because I’m not even from South Africa. “YFM is a dream for every broadcaster and I got a chance to be part of the station. “I’m excited. I’ve been doing radio for 11 years, when I was still a teenager, and now I’m here. “It’s finally happening. I’m with a big station.” Petula said she came to Mzansi to study. “Before coming to SA, I was at Yarona FM and Gabs FM back at home. “I then got a scholarship to study at Rhodes University. “I studied media management and graduated in 2018. “While studying I was with Bay FM. That’s when I decided I wanted to get more experience. “So I sent my tape to YFM last year. They called me and offered me a job. “I moved to Joburg, which was a huge decision, and started training from last year. “This year I finally got the great news that I’d be hosting these two shows.” Petula runs a project where she reads bedtime stories to children. “I decided to read stories for children and post them on SoundCloud for free. “This is just something I felt like doing since lockdown started. However, I’d like to make something big out of this. “I’ve been speaking to publishers to help me create more bedtime stories in African languages.”
