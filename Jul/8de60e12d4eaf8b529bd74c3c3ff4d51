Photographer and Model Thickleeyonce was robbed yesterday in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Thickleeyonce, whose real name is Lesego Legobane, took to twitter to share the traumatic event. I got robbed yesterday by a group of guys in a car posing as an Uber in Braam. They accessed my banking app and stole a lot of money from me and took my personal belongings including my phone and sped off. I am so upset and traumatized. Luckily I’m not physically hurt. ????  These fuckheads used their own personal accounts to transfer money (I’m crossing fingers the bank and SAPS will help find these guys). Anyway they have full access to my phone, if anyone uses my WhatsApp to ask for money please don’t send it. It’s not me.  I couldn’t access iCloud cos I didn’t have a security code, it was sent to to my phone number which they took. I’m still at the iStore trying to get my phone blocked. I am so defeated yho.  Thickleeyonce added that she did not get physically hurt. I’m just so happy they didn’t physically hurt me. I didn’t even bother fighting or arguing with them, ugh. ??
