I’m one of millions of South Africans who’re excited about a possible Covid-19 vaccine. News that our own scientists are busy working on a vaccine got me excited. Some of our medical scientists and biotechnologists can match up to the best in the world. While work is still in progress for the vaccine, the nation should respect the advice, rules, regulations and laws of this country as formulated by government. Always wear your mask, sanitise your hands regularly and, most importantly, keep a social distance. This will definitely help flatten the curve and spare lives. The coronavirus is infectious and has no respect for someone who doesn’t respect it. ) Letter by Mack Ratladi
