Anti-apartheid stalwart Andrew Mlangeni will be laid to rest on Wednesday morning. Speaking outside his home in Dube, Soweto, ANC-treasurer-General Paul Mashatile pledged that as the leaders of the ANC they will never disown Mlangeni's legacy. The funeral service of the last remaining Rivonia trialist will be held at the University of Johannesburg's Soweto Campus. Former President Thabo Mbeki is expected to speak on behalf of all previous presidents. Mlangeni died at the age of 95 last week following an abdominal complaint. He was admitted to One Military Hospital in Tshwane.  On Tuesday Mlangeni's body arrived at his home where it was viewed by his family followed by a prayer service. Mlangeni has been described as an icon, a great leader and a selfless servant who leaves behind a greater legacy.
