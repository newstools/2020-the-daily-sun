HIGHLANDS Park have given another one of their veterans, defender Bevan Fransman a short term contract. Recently the club handed short term deals to three other veterans, Musa Nyatama, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Greg Etafia.Fransman (36) whose original contract expired last month, has signed a short term extension until the current suspended Absa Premiership season is completed. The Cape Town-born defender joined the club at the beginning of last season from Maritzburg United. “Yes, we have extended the contract of Bevan by handing him a short term deal like we did with the other guys recently,” said Highlands co-director Brad Kaftel. Kaftel is one of many PSL stakeholders who said they exercised their option with Fransman and the other three “golden oldies” in the hope that the Premiership will eventually resume and be concluded at the end of August. Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic where leagues worldwide were suspended, players whose contracts ended at the end of June were allowed to sign an extension until the end of the season. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza updated the public on Monday about the league’s stand-off with the controlling body, the SA Football Association, saying they have done everything required and are waiting for Safa to endorse the resumption. Safa holds the key for the league to restart. Safa are in charge of referees and our informants have disclosed that Safa are not willing to come to the party to send referees into the bio bubble – a bio-safely controlled environment, which was identified as Gauteng, as per recommendations of the NSL Covid-19 Health and Safety Directives protocols. “I’m hoping that football resumes so that we can be able to complete our season and then we’ll decide what to do at the end of the season with other players’ contracts that were renewed,” added Kaftel.
