TAXI violence in Marabastad, Tshwane left two taxi drivers fatally wounded, while another two were hospitalised yesterday. Apparently, the four taxi drivers were sitting in a minibus taxi when unknown gunmen shot at their taxi multiple times. Captain Mavela Masondo said the shooting left two drivers dead at the scene and the other two critically wounded. “The motive cannot be confirmed at this stage. Two cases of murder and two of attempted murder were opened for investigation,” he said. Santaco spokesman in Tshwane McDonald Makata condemned violence among taxi drivers. He said although they weren’t sure what led to the killings, they believed this could be due to the ongoing taxi violence on the route between Pretoria and Joburg. “We don’t promote any violence among our taxis,” he said. Makata said the shooting has robbed families of their breadwinners. Masondo said cops have launched a manhunt for the suspects. He appealed to anyone who might have information to help in their investigation to contact their nearest cop shop or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
