UNIVERSITY of Johannesburg and Banyana Banyana striker Amanda Mthandi has become the latest player to move overseas after signing for Spanish side CD Badajoz on Monday. The 24-year-old has signed a contract for one season, with an option to add another, and has been rewarded for a promising showing at last year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. It was there that she was spotted by Badajoz when Banyana played their opening game against Spain. “CD Badajoz has reached an agreement with South African international Amanda Mthandi for next season. The player signs for a campaign with an option for a second one,” the club announced on their website. “Mthandi leaves her country for the first time, although she already knows our football because she faced the national team [of Spain] in the last World Cup. The announcement comes hot on the heels of Nothando Vilakazi’s switch to Spanish side EDF Logroño, and Jermaine Seoposenwe’s move to Sporting Braga in Portugal, which have all come in the last week. This is will be Mthandi’s first professional contract. She becomes the fourth Banyana player to play in Spain – after Ode Fulutudilu (now in Finland), Seoposenwe (moved to Portugal) and Vilakazi, who signed for Logrono last week.
