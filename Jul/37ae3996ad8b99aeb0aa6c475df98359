A TRUCK driver was bust for transporting booze in the Eastern Cape. The 40-year-old was arrested in a joint operation between police and traffic officers in Kinkelbos today for transporting more than R60 000 worth of booze. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “It is alleged that police in Kinkelbos and the traffic officers were at the Kinkelbos traffic weighbridge just outside Port Elizabeth when they stopped a truck and a silver VW Caravelle. “On searching both vehicles, more than 5 000 litres of alcohol packed in cases (12 x 1-litre bottles) was found. The truck driver admitted ownership of the alcohol and was arrested and charged under the regulations of the Disaster Management Act, for the illegal transporting of liquor during the prohibition period. “The estimated value of the alcohol is R62 550. The suspect is expected to appear in the Alexandria Magistrates Court tomorrow,” said Beetge. Nelson Mandela Bay district commissioner Major-General Thembisile Patekile said: “Our community as well as businesses must respect and adhere to the limitations and prohibitions as set out in the Disaster Management Act. The police will continue to enforce the law and arrest those who blatantly disregard the law.”
