TV and Radio personality Somizi Mhlongo is expected to appear again in the Randburg Magistrate Court today. Somizi will be appearing for the case relating to the "bad joke" that Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula had shared government classified information with him. Mbalula came under fire for sharing government secrets about the easing of the lockdown with Somizi which he vehemently denied. He subsequently opened a case against his buddy Somizi, who was arrested a few days later after he handed himself to the police at the Sandton police station. Somizi was released on R1 500 bail.
