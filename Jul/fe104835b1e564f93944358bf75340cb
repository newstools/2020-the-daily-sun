People are slowly losing their sense of ubuntu on social media. All they ever do is post offensive or insulting videos. I have to caution that posting insulting, vilifying and character-assassinating messages on social media will put them in trouble one day. If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. You’re responsible for what you publish on social media. It takes one unintentionally offensive post to spark an outrage. This can lead to major defamation or invasion of privacy, and even legal action against you. There’s nothing to gain from these offensive and insulting videos. People have time to waste, at a time when we’re dealing with the dangerous coronavirus. How will watching these kinds of videos cheer us up in this trying time? When you post bad content on social media channels, you run the risk of overshadowing all the hard work you’ve put into building your presence and establishing connection with your online audience. We must be responsible on social media and come up with constructive ideas.
