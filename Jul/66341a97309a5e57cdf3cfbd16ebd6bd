ANELE Ngcongca has committed his future with Mamelodi Sundowns ending Belgian side Roeselare’s hopes of utilising his services next season. Roeselare, who campaigns in the Belgium second division on Monday confirmed on their website that they have snatched the versatile defender on a two-year contract with an option to renew for another season. However, Ngcongca’s agent Mike Makaab denied that his client will be returning to Belgium for his second spell having spent eight seasons with Racing Genk where he played 279 matches from 2007 until 2015. Explained Makaab: “Anele has signed with Sundowns.” However, the former Orlando Pirates mentor could not reveal the duration of the 32-year-old player’s contract as the club is expected to release a statement on their media platform. Ngcongca, who joined Downs in January 2017 from Genk is currently in camp in Rustenburg as the Tshwane giants prepare for the resumption of PSL season that was halted in March due to coronavirus pandemic. But Ngcongca is still in the casualty room as he is nursing a hamstring strain.
