CASTING agency owner Lucky Temo says losing a job was a blessing in disguise. Lucky, a former paramedic from Benoni in Ekurhuleni, owns Temo Casting Agency. He’d always wanted to be in entertainment! “When I lost my job I was distressed. I’m a family man,” he said. “I had no plan for a job. A few months later, when I started the casting agency, I realised I was meant to be here. “I had studied to be a medic because my parents wouldn’t let me study anything media related.” Lucky has been casting for some of Mzansi’s biggest productions: The Queen, Rhythm City and Losing Lerato, to name a few. He said: “This journey has been amazing. I’ve supplied actors, drones and cars for productions I never thought I’d work with. “I’m grateful to these big productions for giving me an opportunity to prosper. “I’d been supplying extras for Rhythm City before lockdown, but we had to stop. “Hopefully, we’ll continue after everything goes back to normal.” Lucky plans to expand. He said: “I work from home, but I’m looking for an office. We’re going big. “I’m looking forward to working with big productions such as The Bomb Shelter film company and to keep working well with the Fergusons.”
