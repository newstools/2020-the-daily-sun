NBA star Russell Wilson has again left women feeling envious of his wife, Ciara, over whom he gushed. Wilson has been consistent in showing her how much she means to him. Taking to his Twitter account, he wrote a moving message to her, which reads:"You Radiate. Even in the midst of the darkest days of COVID & the world... You Shine. God’s Light glistens off of you. Although this pregnancy experience has had so many restrictions b/c of the world, it has been one of the greatest blessings loving & living life with you." You Radiate.
