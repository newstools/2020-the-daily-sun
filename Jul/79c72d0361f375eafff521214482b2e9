PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will tonite address the nation on the developments on the fight against coronavirus. The Presidency in a statement could not divulge which issues he will be touching on in his address but, he might announce the decision on the closing of schools which Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has referred to Cabinet. Motshekga in meetings with unions told them the decision to close schools rested with Cabinet. “The President’s address follows several meetings of the Cabinet and the National Coronavirus Command Council,” The Presidency said in a statement, adding the address will be broadcast live at 8 PM on television and radio stations. Ramaphosa’s address follows confusing messages from the government's twitter about the sale of alcohol and cigarettes remaining banned until end of lockdown. At first the government said the ban would remain but later backtracked, saying the message was incorrect and issued in error. However, it later emerged that the message was in the government sheet, sparking outrage from industry players.
