SOME
of Grade 6 pupils from Prenora Preparatory School in Seshego Zone 4 outside
Polokwane in Limpopo were excited to return to school. The
pupils were screened and sanitized before entering the schoolyard. A
Grade 6 pupil said she is glad to be back at school and hopes that they will
recover the time lost and complete the academic year without further disruption
of schools. "We
will adhere to the regulations, but most importantly is for us to continue with
our studies because it had been impossible to learn through the programs that
are run on radio," She said. A
parent Francina Lebogo (51) said that she is satisfied with the safety measures
the school exercises when receiving more learners today. "We
are praying that no one gets infected so that the schooling program doesn't get
interrupted. I spoke to my son that he must keep a safe distance when heâ€™s with
his friends at school and hope that he will adhere to other rules from the
school," she said.
