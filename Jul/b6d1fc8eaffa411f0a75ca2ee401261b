Police Minister Bheki Cele expressed concern at cases of sexual offenses reported to have taken place at educational institutions around the country. He said educational institutions are becoming "hotbeds for sexual violence". Nearly 400 cases of rape were reported at either schools, universities, colleges or day care facilities, Cele said. Cele was delivering annual crime statistics in Tshwane on Friday. He said the crime statistics for 2019/2020 reflects the slowing down of the increase in violent crimes. However, rape cases show an increase of 1.7%. Murder cases recorded indicate a difference of 303 compared to 2017/18 where the difference was 1320 and 2018/19 where it recorded a difference of 686. Furthermore, cash-in-transit heists recorded a decrease of 10,4% and bank robberies declined by 100,0%. Burglary at residential premises has also declined by 6.7% and robbery at residential properties has also recorded a decrease of 5.8%. Following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, Cele revealed that 113 police officers have died after contracting the virus, 12138 have tested positive to the virus with 254 hospitalised and 4904 recoveries. "This invisible enemy is brutal and it is attacking everyone," said Cele. He said: "We would like pay our respect and salute the role of our departed members in the fight against crime." Cele said going forward the crime statistics will be released quarterly, to ensure timeous intervention measures aimed at crime reduction. He said: "While businesses, schools, places of worship and many other public spaces were forced to close or scale down operations due to COVID-19, the same cannot be said for criminal syndicates, rapists, drug cartels, gangsters, hijackers, murderers and burglars. Hence, the South African Police Service, throughout the pandemic and beyond continues to endeavour to safeguard the country as per our constitutional mandate," he added.
