Manyisa recalled the fond memories he made at Sundowns, in a post made on Twitter. On his Twitter account Manyisa said: "My time with the Masandawana family has come to an end. 3 years filled with amazing memories, 2 league titles, a Telkom Knockout Cup and most importantly I got to make friends that will be forever. "Thank you to the chairman Dr Motsepe, Coach Pitso and all the support staff for believing in me and giving me an opportunity of a lifetime. "To all the supporters thank you for taking me in as your own and for all the love. "Lastly, thank you to my teammates and brothers. I will miss you guys. For one last time Ka Bo Yellow."
