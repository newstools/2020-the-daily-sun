PITSO Mosimane has tied Sibusiso “Vila” Vilakazi at Mamelodi Sundowns for a further four years until 2024, as previously reported by SunSport. SunSport understands that Vilakazi has agreed to stay on at Chloorkop this week, joining a host of other top stars who have renewed contracts with Sundowns for over four years. Thapelo Morena and Gaston Sirino had their contracts extended until June 2025, and it came as no surprise that Mosimane opted to keep Vilakazi too. Vilakazi has been one of the most consistent players for Mosimane and the Kagiso-born coach, who just celebrated his 56th birthday this week, is repaying the 30-year-old from Soweto with a four year gift, with an option to renew. Vilakazi featured in 32 matches overall for the Brazilians this season, which must have played a major role in convincing Mosimane to keep the Bafana Bafana hitman at Chloorkop until 2024. He currently played 18 matches in the Premiership, seven in Caf Champions League, MTN8 (3), Telkom Knockout (2) and a further two in the Nedbank Cup while scoring 10 goals in the process – a record that many could only wish. “He is a good player and the club cannot afford to lose such a talent,” said our mole. “Look, Pitso did not hesitate in offering Vila a new contract and Sundowns have a long season ahead of them, as they need to leapfrog Kaizer Chiefs at the top of the PSL table, and win the Nedbank Cup. And he needs players such as Vila motivated.” Vilakazi has made a huge improvement compared to the previous season where he was not a regular, scoring three goals in all competitions. Sundowns will open the season with a blockbuster against Orlando Pirates at Dobsonville Stadium on 11 August at 6pm.
