PUPILS in the North West said they would rather choose life over education. On Monday, Barolong High School pupils in Mogogoe Village stopped motorists and demanded they supported them. They want government to shut down schools, saying many teachers and pupils have tested positive for Covid-19 since schools reopened. “My life is important. If I lose it I will be a ghost but I will never be a normal human again. But if I fail, I will repeat and life will go on,” said a pupil. Traffic was halted and police had to be called to disperse a group of pupils who were holding placards and singing. Some said they were not given enough masks and had to look for clothes to cover themselves. Pupils said they lived in fear of contracting the virus every day. They said social distancing will never happen at schools. “Kids will always be kids. We talk, we laugh, we hug, and we have been doing that since we returned to school. Education is important to us, but we value our lives too,” said another pupil. Another pupil said it was difficult to concentrate in the classroom because it’s a problem every time a pupil or a teacher coughs. “Last week we walked out of a classroom because there was a teacher who kept on coughing. We could not ignore that. It was scary and sitting there pretending it was not happening was going to be impossible,” she said. A parent said she supported the pupils. “They will miss one year but if they die, we will lose them forever. I won’t be able to forgive myself if my child dies because he contracted the virus from the school,” she said. Provincial education spokesman Elias Malindi said they were aware pupils were disrupting traffic. “Pupils have the choice of coming to school or they can stay at home,” he said. Malindi said the department called the police to calm the situation.
