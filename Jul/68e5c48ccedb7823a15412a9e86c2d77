Cornrows is that hairstyle you always fall back on, no matter how many times you've changed your hair. As salons have opened under the lockdown level three, it means we can now take off those head scarves and get our hair done. But that also comes with the responsibility to make sure it stays intact a little longer, as you want to reduce you salon runs as much as possible. Here are five tips to help you to keep your cornrows flawless. 1. Ask your hairstylist not to tie your hair too tight -  This can help avoid scalp irritation, and a rash, which may lead to excessive scratching and hair loss, especially on the hairline where the hair is fragile and breaks easily. 2. Treat hair before braiding - Get your hair treated so that by the time you plait your hair, your scalp is in good condition. 3. Wear a satin cap when going to bed - Satin caps offer protection against split ends,  dryness and keep your hair hydrated. 4. Moisturise your hair - Moisturising does the same for your hair as food does for the body. Keeping your hair moisturised will make it stronger, with less breakage and thinning. 5. Wash your cornrows - The build-up of sweat and products used can be damaging to your hair, so it’s important to wash your braids once every two weeks.
