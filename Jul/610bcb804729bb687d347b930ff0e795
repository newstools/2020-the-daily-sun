FIREFIGHTERS have come through for their late colleague! On 19 December, Daily Sun ran a story about a mysterious fire that destroyed Sylvia Nkabinde’s home in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. The 36-year-old lost everything in the fire. Her late husband, Samuel Sambo, used to be a firefighter at Joburg’s Emergency Management Services.  A group of firefighters called Brotherhood Club have come together to help rebuild the house of their colleague, who died in 2005. EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told the People’s Paper the group was founded on 20 June. “All of us, when we joined the service, thought we’d found employment,” he said. “Little did we know we were joining a global family of public servants who’re often not celebrated. Not even death will break the brotherhood bond.” Mulaudzi said Samuel’s family had been homeless for six months. “In June, while we were experiencing the cold front in Gauteng, firefighters remembered the family of one of their own was homeless,” he said.  He said over R50 000 had already been raised to help rebuild the house. Family spokesman Steven Nkabinde told Daily Sun they were happy about the kind gesture shown to them. “We’re very grateful they came to assist one of their own.”
