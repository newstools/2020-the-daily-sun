MANCHESTER United star Paul Pogba has revealed that he is “really, really happy” to be back playing football. The Frenchman has been a key player for United since the return of football as he looks to help the Red Devils finish in the top-four. Pogba's 2019/20 campaign has been largely affected by injuries but he has been in fine form since his return. “Just being back training, touching the ball and doing what I love is amazing; I missed it so much,” he told his club's website. “You realise when you’re out for a long time how much you really enjoy playing football and how much you love it. So obviously I’m really, really happy and so blessed to be back and be fully fit now, and I’m enjoying being back with the team “I feel great, I feel much, much better now. I’ve been training well and they [the club] have been looking after me very well. I’ve been doing some extra work and treatment on my ankle and the rest of my body. And my team-mates as well, they’ve helped me to come back and feel confident. It’s like I never left, the guys still trust in me and always believe in me and that’s helped me a lot as well.“You can tell that the team is improving a lot,” he continued. “We play more as a team than we did before, we enjoy it even more, we defend together, we attack together, and this team is stronger as well. The players who are on the bench or who don’t play every time, when they come on they help the team so the mentality is good and is right. All this together has put us where we are today.”
