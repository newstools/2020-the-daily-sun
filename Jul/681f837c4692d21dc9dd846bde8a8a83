THE Tshwane University of Technology SRC took to the streets yesterday demanding that classes start again. Singing struggle songs outside the university gates, they accused management of being arrogant towards student leaders regarding the phased return communicated by Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande, and the newly-proposed plan for teaching and learning. SRC secretary Tshiamo Tlharipe said Nzimande visited the university and assured everyone it was ready to reopen. “We’re shocked at the sudden change. It means the university management and the minister deceived students and the public.” PEOPLE WANT THEIR RDPs Tlharipe said their primary duty was to ensure everyone had access to quality education. The SRC urged third year, B-tech and postgraduate students to return to their residences this week. Tlharipe called for the suspension of e-learning as it didn’t benefit the majority of students. TUT spokeswoman, Willa De Ruyter, said no memorandum from students leaders was received. “We don’t want a situation where we open then close again due to the spread of infection. We’ve conducted a survey of students who have difficulty studying online and we’re printing study materials for them.”
