Gospel singer, Sbu Noah, saw himself having to defend himself again after being accused of being Zodwa Wabantu's bae. The Ewe Getsemane singer was said to be Zodwa's bae after Zodwa posted a picture of herself and a man whose face wasn't visible last week. People on social media saw a resemblance between the man in the picture and Sbu Noah. Sbu took to Instagram to say that is not him. Over the weekend, a news site wrote an article saying Zodwa announced Sbu as her boyfriend and again, Sbu defended himself. Also read: O JEWA KENG HELPS DURING LOCKDOWN Kodwa ngshilo ngathi akmina ??
