THERE is opposition to the Premier Soccer League restarting the Absa Premiership on Saturday! Clubs claim they have not had enough time to train and prepare properly for the restart of the season that was suspended in March due to the coronavirus outbreak. AmaZulu general manager Lunga Sokhela said it was too early to restart as they had to deal with strict NSL Covid-19 Health and Safety directives, and then begin staggered training sessions as the club was only given a green light to train in groups last week. He added he understands the PSL is under immense pressure to meet Fifa’s guidelines of completing all league programmes before the end of next month. “It’s a very short space of time, we all agree that two weeks to train is not ideal to do everything,” said Sokhela. “But it is not anybody’s fault. The campaign was brought to a halt because of Covid-19 and we have to deliver what we promised to our sponsors.” When the league was suspended in March, AmaZulu were in relegation trouble lying second from bottom on 23 points from 24 games – three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards. But the PSL might have jumped the gun by announcing the proposed restart of the 2019-20 season on Saturday. This has not only met with opposition by clubs, but also the SA Football Association.
