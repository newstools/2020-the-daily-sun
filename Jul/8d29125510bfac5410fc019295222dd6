  The Minister of International and Cooperation Dr. Naledi Pandor
says she has learnt with shock the news of the passing away of South Africa's
Ambassador to Denmark Zindzi Mandela. The daughter of struggle icons, Nelson Mandela and Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela, various news outlets this morning have reported her
passing. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa was quoted in one of the online
publications confirming her death. However, Pandor's office said she is still gathering information
around her death. "The Department is still busy gathering information regarding
her passing and will be able to put out a detailed statement at a later stage. "On behalf of the Department and herself, Minister Pandor
expresses deep condolences to the Mandela family, friends and colleagues,"
her office said in a statement. Pandor said Zindzi will not only be remembered as a daughter of
our struggle heroes,  Tata  Nelson, and Mama Winnie Mandela but as a
struggle heroine in her own right. She served South Africa well. "May her soul rest in peace."
