BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic midfielder Given Mashikinya says mental strength will be key in their bid to win the Nedbank Cup. Celtic face Baroka FC in the semi-final of Ke Yona Cup when the season resumes after being halted by coronavirus in March. Siwelele beat GladAfrica Championship side TS Sporting 3-2 on penalties in the last eight after the teams were tied 1-1 at full-time. The 29-year-old player, who recovered from Covid-19, is confident that their new coach John Maduka has what it takes to guide them to the final where they could meet the winner between Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns. Maduka was promoted from the assistant role after the sudden departure of Lehlohonolo Seema, who joined Chippa United. Said Mashikinya: “We want to win the cup for our supporters. The last time we won a trophy was when we lifted the Telkom Knockout in 2011. “We want to give them something to cheer about during this difficult season. “There is no team that will be ready to compete physically due to the long break. Fitness will be a challenge, even training has been different since we haven’t done preparations we used to before the lockdown. But we need to be mentally strong to be successful.” To achieve their target, Mashikinya insist that youngsters also need to come to the party. “Our success lies in our hands. We also need to push the young ones to show how important we are about winning the cup.” Mashikinya said Maduka and his new assistant Abram “Wire” Nteo won’t make changes to the side that occupied ninth spot on the Absa Premiership table with 28 points under Seema, when the season was stopped with 23 matches played. Nteo was also promoted after being in charge of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge side. “Every coach has his own philosophy, but I doubt he will make changes at this time of season. We have a new coach, but only the title (of Maduka) changed. He gave us a schedule the day coach Seema left and we are using it until today,” Mashikinya added.
