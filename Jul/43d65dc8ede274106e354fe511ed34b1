MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is hoping the Brazilians Yellow colours will not be heavy on their promising new signing Lesedi Kapinga. The player who was released by Black leopards on Tuesday, despite their relegation woes signed a five-year deal with Sundowns which will be effective from next season. “Lesedi is our player‚ we have signed him on a free transfer and he is a good prospect‚” Mosimane said. "He likes to play one-on-one‚ he likes to take defenders on‚ he is quick and we see him as a Keletso Makgalwa. We see a few characteristics of Gaston Sirino and Themba Zwane in him, and he has speed. "I wish him all the best and hope that he makes it because the yellow jersey can be heavy at times and it looks like a waste‚ but that’s football. “He is young‚ he is a very good football player and you can see that we are trying to get as many young players as possible. "If you look at our signings so far‚ besides George Maluleka‚ we are having younger players who are coming to strengthen our team as back up for the older guys.” Mosimane says that Kapinga’s quality on the ball will see him fit easily into Sundowns' style of play. “He fits the profile with his style of play‚ he is a type of player who likes to play combination football. "We have also checked his social life and even there he ticks the right boxes because he is a very smart boy.” Kapinga who joined leopards from Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at the beginning of the season featured in 27 matches in all competitions for Lidoda Duvha and scored six goals.
