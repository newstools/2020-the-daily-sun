Fezeka Shandu, the writer of the two-minute film, said on Tuesday it was announced that it had been nominated for two awards at the Ladima International Film Festival. “They were looking for top ten films and I submitted my film. From a very young age, I’ve been writing films and short dramas but this nomination has made me realise that I can reach greater heights in the film industry,” she said “Unfortunately, the girl’s uncles forge ahead with lobola negotiations. They cannot be bothered by lockdown regulations. In their minds, once the process starts, it cannot be postponed or interrupted as they must uphold their tradition,” explained Fezeka.

The girl’s family lives in KZN and the guy’s family lives in Lesotho and this means the guy’s uncles cannot travel to KZN. This leaves them with one option, doing everything online. This also means the lobola money must be deposited into the girl’s account. This is because none of her uncles have a bank account,” she said “At the same time, it forces our African traditions to conform with technology. It also opens our eyes to the new possibilities,” she said.
