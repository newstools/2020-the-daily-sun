Minister Bheki Cele  is still on a
mission to fight the illegal sale of skyfs. Speaking during a parliamentary
question and answer session earlier today,Cele said those convicted of buying
and selling skyfs would receive criminal records. TimesLive reports that MPs asked Cele
whether it was fair for people to receive a criminal record for buying a
cigarette. He said the courts have “confirmed
that you cannot buy a cigarette; it is illegal”.  “It is not just the regulations, not
just the minister of co-operative governance & traditional affairs, or
minister of police, it’s a full bench of a senior court in the Republic of SA.
So, if people [buy or sell cigarettes], that is to commit a crime, so there
must be a criminal record. You did it knowing full well that you are not
supposed to,” said Cele. The minister said, however, that
discussions with the department of justice were ongoing, reports BusinessLIVE. “It is on that score that the
department of justice has come to the police to discuss how we look at those
[minor infringements], but there are some who have been found working with
organised cartels, transporting cigarettes ... those will have to stay with
their criminal records, but on petty [offences], the minister of justice is
looking at that,” said Cele.  Cele has come under fire during the
lockdown as some believe he has priorotised policing booze and skyfs instead of
more serious matters such as gender based violence. He also was criticised for cops
confiscating booze from motorists  at
roadblocks during level 3. The sale of booze has been reopened since
June 1 and Cele has been clear about his wishes for booze to be banned again
arguing that crime has spiked since the reopening of its sales.
