Elandsfontein residents are at it again, this time they're
demanding to the occupation of private land. They told Daily Sun that they've been waiting for houses for
the longest of time and they deserve to live on that land. Community leader, Tshepo Ngobeni told Daily that they've
been living in that land for three months and now they refused to be removed. He said there's nothing else they can do because they've
been waiting for houses for 15 years but there's no progress. "We're 26 years into democracy but we still can't have
the land that was stolen from our forefathers, this is unacceptable," said
Tshepo. Resident, Lethu Masoka said they're tired of waiting for the
government to do something because it's failing them. "We're willing to even build proper houses and make
them our homes. We want to live a comfortable life like other people," he
said. "We're willing to fight this till the end. This place
being empty also caused an increase in criminal activities. We had to occupy
it," he added. They're not protesting for the first time. On the 26th of
June, Daily Sun reported on them protesting against being removed and they're
willing to fight till the end. Midvaal Mayor, Bongani Baloyi said this land is owned by
someone and therefore they must be removed.
