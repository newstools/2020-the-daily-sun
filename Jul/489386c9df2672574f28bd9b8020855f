THOSE who think Black Leopards will be relegated will eat humble pie at the end of the season. This is the promise made by Lidoda Duvha captain Thabo “Festival” Matlaba ahead of their remaining six Absa Premiership matches. The Venda-based side are currently bottom on the log with 20 points. But the likes of AmaZulu, Polokwane City and Baroka are also in the relegation mix. Those three teams are all only three points above Leopards. The former Orlando Pirates star has vowed that Leopards will be still in the top flight next season. “It’s important for our fans not to get worried because we are working hard and doing everything in our power to ensure we get fit and ready to play the remaining games,” he said.. “I can promise our fans on behalf of the team that we are going to survive and we will stay in the PSL next season. We know that some people think we will get relegated and that is not going to happen. “We are aware that we are facing tough matches and some teams are fighting relegation, some for the top eight, some to win the league. But we will do all we can to move from the position we are in and finish in a respectable position.” The 32-year-old has also promised that their fans will see a totally different team compared to the one that has been struggling before the league was suspended in March. “We have been chatting with each other as a team about the position we are in,” explained the Tembisa-born star. “The mood is amazing and the boys are working hard at training. This is our job and we want to secure it (PSL status).” Matlaba joined Leopards this season and has been impressive as he won the heart of fans. His form has been so good that Bafana Bafana coach Ntseki Molefi recalled him to the national team before the league was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
