FORMER Uzalo actor Khaya Dladla is the latest survivor of Covid-19. Khaya, who played GC on Uzalo, said he went through self-isolation for 14 days. And he feels 100% well. He took to Instagram where he said he wished people would understand the power of mind. He also said that 14 days of isolation had been a journey of self-introspection and new habits. "This journey has been an emotional and very psychological battle. The day people understand the power of mind, the better. As soon as your mind tells your lungs you can't breath, you won't breath. As soon as your mind tells your body you are dying, you will die. Take care of yourself and speak life to yourself every day," he said. Dladla is one of Gagasi FM DJs. The commercial radio station based in Durban, shut its doors last month when it announced that one of its DJs tested positive for coronavirus.
