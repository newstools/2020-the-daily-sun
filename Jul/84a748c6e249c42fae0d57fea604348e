 A woman has been arrested for setting her ex-boyfriend’s Jeep on fire. The woman can be seen in a video that has gone viral on social media, wearing grey pants and a black sweater pouring what might be petrol into the Jeep’s back seat from a red container. But she quickly learned that what she was doing was wrong, as she lit the petrol in the car it exploded on her face. After she was raged away by the blast, she can be seen crawling away. It is not clear when the incident took place, but it appears to have been captured in the United States.  Cell phone video captures the moment a woman lights her boyfriend’s Jeep on fire.
