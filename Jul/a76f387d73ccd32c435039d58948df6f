COPS are investigating a case of child neglect after a baby was dumped at Thulamahashe Taxi Rank two months ago. Mpumalaga police said an unknown woman arrived at the rank in Bushbuckridge and asked a street vendor to look after her daughter while she went to buy nappies at a shopping complex, but she never returned. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the woman who agreed to watch the baby got worried when it became dark and the mum had not returned. “She then alerted the police and social workers, who opened a case of child neglect and went looking for the mother. “We appeal to members of the public who might have information about the whereabouts of the mother or her family to contact Mhala police on 079 396 4587, or investigating officer Sergeant Isabel Sibuyi on 081 894 9411,” he said. The 52-year-old was kidnapped earlier this year and his vehicle was found burnt in the bush at Mashonamini Trust near Mkhuhlu, Bushbuckridge. Hlathi said the victim’s car was set alight, with him inside. The man managed to break the window and crawled out, but later died of his wounds. He said a murder case was opened for investigation and requested anyone with information to come forward. “Anyone who might have information about this matter can contact Detective Constable Sibusiso Sibuyi on 082 065 16590, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” said Hlathi.
