As part of the COVID-19 relief strategy, temporary housing
structures will be given to the less fortunate. Speaking to Daily Sun MMC for Housing Mlungisi Mabaso
explained that they have identified congested areas that make it difficult for
people to practice social distancing. He said among those identified, were Alex and Lufhereng. "We will be moving 1600 people from Alex bringing them
to Marlboro. We are aware that this is a drop in an ocean, but we really have
to start somewhere," he said. He added that there's already a huge backlog in housing so
that's why they are trying to come up with solutions to help people in the
meantime. Joburg executive Mayor Geoff Makhubo commended the MMC for
his dedication towards changing people's lives. "He called me twice this week to remind me to honour
his invitation in launching this project. 1600 is a small number compared to
the people who will be left behind," said Makhubo. He said the project has to be completed in the next three
months and the relocations start on the fourth month. "This pandemic is a serious one and we have to try by
all means to not only focus on the problem but come up with solutions that will
restore dignity to our people," he said.
