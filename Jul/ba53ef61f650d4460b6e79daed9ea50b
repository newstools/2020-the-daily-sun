MALUSI Shezi, also known as Smallz, got his big break in 2008 with his hit song Money Maker, followed by Money Spender. The kwaito singer from KwaMashu, north of Durban, will release a new single, More Money, More Problems, at the end of the month. The big question is: will history repeat itself? Smallz, who’s been quiet since 2011, is adamant that his new single, like Money Maker, will be huge. “Unlike my previous songs with dominating drums, this one has more piano and less drums. “It’s still Durban kwaito with house influences. “I will release a 10-track album by the end of August that will feature both of Sho Madjozi’s dancers, Bin and Linda. Smallz said he likes singing about money as it makes things happen. He said: “If you have money you get anything you want. “Even ugly men stand a good chance of attracting a beautiful woman.” He runs a clothing line under his own music label, Money Spender Entertainment. “We sell sweaters, tracksuits, T-shirts and Covid-19 masks,” said Smallz. He started his career as Mshoza’s dancer on the song, Hlabalingene.
