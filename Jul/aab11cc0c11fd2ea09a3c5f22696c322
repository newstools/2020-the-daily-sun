Former Baroka FC coach Wedson Nyirenda has returned to football with a short-term contract to lead Lusaka Dynamos in the remaining months of the 2019-20 Zambia Super League season. Nyirenda, who led Baroka to the 2018 Telkom Knockout trophy, has been clubless since leaving Limpopo in December, and has signed a deal with an option for next season. He replaces Ian Bakala at Dynamos, who moves back to the assistant coach role, and has a little under three weeks to work with his players before the club is back in action. Although the Super League resumes this weekend, the first matches are catch-up games, so Dynamos are not back on the pitch until an 2 August, meeting with champions Zesco United. They are currently in sixth position, six points behind leaders Forest Rangers with 10 games to play, meaning they remain very much in the championship hunt. They are seeking their first league title, with their previous best finish being fifth in 2017. Nyirenda decided to call it quits at Baroka with the club just a point above the relegation zone. The former Zambia international, who played in South Africa at Kaizer Chiefs, joined the Limpopo club ahead of the 2018/19 season and had instant success, leading them to the Telkom Knockout trophy with a surprise victory over Orlando Pirates in the final. But he found the going tough in the league and after narrowly avoiding relegation last season, became embroiled in another battle at the bottom in this campaign. His 51 games in charge yielded 12 wins, 18 draws and 21 defeats in all competitions.
