The singer, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, said the show was scheduled to start in November and the registration process was currently open. “People are busy with registration. The project was supposed to have begun already, but because of the pandemic it was pushed to November with the hope that things will be better then,” she said. “I thank God this isn’t only limited to South Africans. I believe Africans have what it takes to compete on the global stage.” The show’s executive producer, Anthony Nyazi, said one of the reasons he chose Zahara was that she’s talented and has a special skill. “I’m a musician myself and have been in the industry for 20 years,” he said. “I hosted Zahara many years ago in Uganda, where I’m from. “That’s when I saw she’s immensely talented and skilled. “I chose her because for this kind of show, you need to have touched Africans.”
