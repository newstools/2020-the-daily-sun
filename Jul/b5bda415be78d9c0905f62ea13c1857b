It was an exciting weekend for The Queen's actor Sthembiso "SK" Khoza who allegedly attended a sex party. The talented actor who plays Shaka on the Mzansi Magic telenovela recently appeared in viral videos, where he was in a company of naked girls. In one of the videos, the actor can be seen dancing and having a great time with two half naked girls. While in the other video he can be seen being touched by one of the girls, whilst he is trying to get the TV to work. It didn't take long for the video to make it to Twitter top trends and his fans expressed their disappointment in his behavior and concerned whether this won't put him in the bad books of the Ferguson's. Daily Sun tried to get SK to comment to no avail. This is a developing story. Inappropriate video images of myself were leaked online and I would like to profusely apologize to my family, friends, employers and fans for embarrassing them and myself. I have put @Shona_Ferguson ( FergusonFilms ), my family, and @Mzansimagic in a position I totally regret. My actions were unacceptable, I beg for forgiveness. I take full responsibility, especially at a time we are faced with a serious pandemic. I should have made better decisions. I need to do better. To everyone I have disappointed and hurt, I am truly sorry ????
