The trial case against controversial leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary is set to begin on Monday at the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane. Bushiri has called for calm from his followers and asked that they pray for him and his wife as they are about to start with their trial. The couple was arrested last year February and are facing charges of fraud, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act for offences they allegedly committed from 2015. They are currently out on a R100 000 bail each. From their first court appearance at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Tshwane they have been embraced by thousands of their supporters. In fear of that happening again the ECG church has called for their supporters and church members to adhere the Lockdown regulations. In a statement by ECG, Bushiriâ€™s spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said in the wake of COVID-19, the church wishes to advise all those who will be standing with their leaders on Monday to observe and adhere to set health regulations of their respective countries. He added: "Further, the church would also like to extend its deepest appreciation to those that have been sending messages of solidarity though the hash tag #IstandWithMajor1."
