KWAITO and TV star Zola7 is collecting donations to assist drumboy Siphosethu Manyisa, but his family says they do not know anything about it. Last month, he asked people on Facebook to donate a second-hand drum kit for the boy. He wrote: “There’s a boy who plays drums and uses old buckets as his drum kit. I saw his photo on Facebook and as South Africans, we cannot allow this. WATCH: TRUCK DRIVING TOKOLOSHE! “Therefore, we are on a mission to buy him pre-owned or new drums. My team is already contributing. I am going to put out a number where you can make your contributions.” He later posted that the lowest price for a second-hand drum kit was R2 500 and asked for donations. He later wrote: “With all the pledges received for our young drummer, we have managed to raise funds for a second-hand drum kit. Now we are gunning for a brand new one.” Daily Sun learned its alleged that Zola7, whose real name is Bonginkosi Dlamini, was supposed to hand over the drum kit early last month, but it never happened. But Ronald Makoua from Visionaries of Purpose has donated an electronic drum kit to the boy. “I came across Siphosethu’s video on Facebook in May and decided to donate the drums to him,” he said. Sbusiso Manyisa, the boy’s father, said they were grateful to Ronald for the drums. He, however, claimed he was never contacted by Zola7. His manager Sandile Nkomo said although Zola7 asked for money for the boy, he had not received any donations. “Zola7 has contacted the boy’s father. Perhaps he wasn’t aware that he was talking to Zola7,” said Sandile.
