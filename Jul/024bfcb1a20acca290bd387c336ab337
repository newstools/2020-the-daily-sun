REIGNING International Boxing Federation flyweight champion Moruti “Baby Face” Mthalane has expressed his deep disappointment at Fight Club SA after they failed to keep their promise to him. Mthalane, who worked at the Fight Club SA as fitness instructor in their Honeydew branch, accused his former employer of short-timing him and not paying what was due to him. Other sponsors have paid the boxing sensation. The hard-hitting pugilist has labelled Fight Club SA as a joke because they failed to honour their agreement. Mthalane, one of Mzansi’s most decorated fighters, alleged that Fight Club SA promised him money in exchange for TV exposure when he defended his IBF crown against Japanese Akira Yeagashi in Japan in December. “Our agreement was I would advertise their brand live on TV during my fight and they will pay me after the fight. It’s been seven months now they have not lived up to their promise. Since the beginning of the year they kept on feeding me empty promises,. Untill today, I haven’t been paid,” said Mthalane. This has led to the two-time IBF world champion quitting his job. Mthalane, who hails from KwaZulu-Natal, said he has given up on getting the money. “They can keep the money,” he said. “I won’t ask for it anymore. I was not aware that I was dealing with the wrong people. I’m deeply disappointed with their act and I don’t take them seriously, they are a joke. I resigned last week.” Attempts to get a comment from Fight Club SA was unsuccessful as they have been closed due to the lockdown. “Kindly note our head office and support staff will only be available after lockdown. Please check back then! Our clients portals, contact forms and live chats will be available once we return,” is a message posted on their official website. The 38-year-old veteran fighter is the only local boxer holding a credible belt. Mthalane gave Muhammad Wassem his first defeat to reclaim the IBF title crown. He went on to defend the title on three occasions.
