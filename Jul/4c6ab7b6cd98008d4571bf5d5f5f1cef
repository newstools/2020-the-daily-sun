DJ TRUMPET has accused Winnie and Rethabile Khumalo of stealing his song. He said Isivunguvungu was produced by him and sung by Rethabile, but later he saw a new version produced by Prince Kaybee. “I started working with Winnie and Rethabile in August,” said the DJ, whose real name is Ayabonga Sheyi. “Myself and Rethabile had Ixilongo and Isivunguvungu. “The agreement was Ixilongo would be Rethabile’s and Isivunguvungu mine. “I was shocked to see them giving the song to Prince Kaybee. “I’d sent Winnie a message on Facebook asking to work with her. She heard my work and asked me to move into her house in Soweto. “After a few weeks there were already problems. Rethabile bullied me and Winnie made sexual remarks. I left a few months later.” The DJ said his life wasn’t working out and Winnie was making it worse. “She said I won’t make it because her ancestors are angry at me. I’m back in the Eastern Cape. They’re kicking me while I’m down.” Winnie said: “When we went our separate ways we took the song, put in different vocals, and released it. I didn’t fight or complain. He messed up this opportunity. “Everything is his fault. At my label Winnkay’s, a producer comes with their beat and we come up with vocals. “He left and we took our vocals and worked with Prince Kaybee’s beat. “I welcomed him, but he didn’t respect me. He’d wake up at 4pm and go behind my back and work with my associates. I didn’t make sexual remarks.” Rethabile said: “We used a bigger DJ on a song we worked on together, that’s all. He was wrong at the end of the day.” Prince Kaybee distanced himself from the matter on Twitter and apologised to Trumpet: “It’s not my story. Winnie has all the info.”
