The Educators' Union of South Africa (EUSA) has threatened to shut down schools "by force" to protect pupils and teachers from contracting the Covid-19 virus. The union, which has 27 000 members, claimed that Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga was putting lives at risk. Teachers' unions have been calling for her to close schools to curb the spread of the virus and come up with alternative models of teaching.   "The minister has concluded the consultation process... she is now processing a comprehensive report of this process through [the] structure of government, eventually with the NCCC [National Coronavirus Command Council] and Cabinet."   "A dead teacher cannot teach and a dead learner cannot learn." Mhlanga said the union should desist immediately.Â   "We want to call on all those who are using illegal means to disrupting schools, including those who are appropriating themselves the authority of closing schools, which they don't have in law, to stop this immediately," he said.
