SHE is one of 16 staff members from Themba Hospital who tested positive for Covid-19. Thulisiwe Mazibuko said the virus has separated her from her family. The 28-year-old mum of two from KaBokweni in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she hadn’t shown any symptoms of the virus when she tested positive, but she expected anything as a front line worker. “I had to get tested after a colleague tested positive. Our family doctor suggested everyone tests for the virus and my husband and son (2) tested negative. “But my three-year-old son tested positive and the doctor suggested we isolate ourselves somewhere else,” she said. Thulisiwe said she and her eldest son now live with her mother, who also tested positive, while her other son stayed with his father. “I’m emotionally affected because I have a very strong bond with my kids and my partner. “But we can’t be together and I miss them a lot. What hurts me the most is that my first born doesn’t understand the whole situation. “He wants to be with his brother and father,” she said. Thulisiwe said being with her mother gave her comfort. “I get all the support from her and we are on this recovery journey together,” said Thulisiwe. She said as the country couldn’t go back to level 5, people should take themselves back. “People still have gatherings. They’re ignorant and don’t take this virus seriously. They’re putting themselves at high risk of getting infected and aren’t even following the precautionary measures.”
