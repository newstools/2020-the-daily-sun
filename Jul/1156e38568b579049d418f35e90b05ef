THE lockdown has taken poking away from single people across the country and threatened many relationships. Daily Sun recently spoke to students about how lockdown was affecting them. They said the thing they missed most was poking. Zinhle Zwane said things were not going well in her relationship. She said she used to have sex with her boyfriend every day when they were living in a residence but since lockdown started, he was distant. “Our relationship has taken a knock and I miss our poking. I was always glowing and happy, but now I’m grumpy,” she said. Lydia Mokwena said she had not seen her boyfriend since lockdown started. She said they had phone sex, but it wasn’t the same and data sometimes ran out at inconvenient moments. “It hurts so badly, but I guess there’s nothing I can do but starve,” she said. Gift Humu said his right hand was working overtime and his relationship was on the rocks, as he was not good with phone sex. “We live in different provinces and things have been hard for us,” he said. Sydney Maluleke said he thought of violating the regulations to go see his girlfriend, but he didn’t want to put her at risk. “I’ll keep abstaining until we are able to be together,” he said. The SunTeam also spoke to older readers. Reatlegile Mathibedi said she had not poked since lockdown started because her boyfriend refused to break the rules. “I was sad, but I’m getting used to it. I recently bought a dildo, so I’ll have to see how that goes,” she said. Moses Maphanga said his girlfriend has been begging him to break the rules, but he took his health seriously. Sinikeziwe Maseko said she moved in with her boyfriend a month ago and they had been poking every day. She said she had never been happier.
