FORMER Freshlyground lead vocalist Zolani Mahola has penned a song as part of the Because We Are Campaign, which she said was to encourage Mzansi to talk about the learnings from the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed many of lives. Speaking to Sunday Sun, she said she hoped the pandemic hasn’t stopped our ability to dream of the world we want to live in. “Thirty of South Africa’s best musicians came together in this song to say we stand by this country and this song is how we play our part in creating our future reality,” she said. The idea behind the song and campaign was founded by Aron Halevi of CreativitWillSAveLIves, a creative entrepreneur, who is also the founder of the band Freshlyground. Said Zolani: “We worked on the song for four months and wanted to release it around the time of Nelson Mandela Day, so it becomes a celebratory song rather than a sombre song.” She said after successfully forging a singing career with Freshlyground, she wanted to give it a go as a solo artist this year, which is why she announced that she would venture into a solo career at the beginning of the year, but the coronavirus dampened her plans. “The pandemic has really questioned my role in society as an artist. “It made me question what the meaning of success is and I have come to realise that the status I’ve built over the past 20 years has given me a platform,” the 38-year-old explained. “I never left the music industry. I was waiting for the right time to venture into my own solo career.” The song is available on all digital stores.
