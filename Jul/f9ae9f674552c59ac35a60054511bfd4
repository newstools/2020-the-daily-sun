Rivaldo Coetzee believes he could have a future in a central midfield role after being converted to that position at Mamelodi Sundowns prior to the lockdown. The 23-year-old has won all of his 24 Bafana Bafana caps at centre-back, but has been shifted to the midfield by Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane, and is enjoying his new role. “Yes, I would say that the position grew on me and training in that position every day before the lockdown has helped me to adapt to it,” Coetzee told his club’s website. “I actually enjoy playing midfield, I hope I can continue there and maybe have a future in that position. “It was a bit tricky in the beginning, I wasn’t used to people pressing me from behind. I was used to seeing everything on the pitch and that made it easier for me to attack space. “But in midfield you have to think quicker and always scan so you know what’s happening around you, and know what to do with the ball before you even receive it.” Coetzee says he has looked at the game of a number of top stars and learned from how they tackle the position. “There are a few players that I like in that position, especially from teams that play the same football we do at Mamelodi Sundowns, which is to dominate and play to always have the ball. Rodri and Ilkay Gundogan at Manchester City are just two examples.”
