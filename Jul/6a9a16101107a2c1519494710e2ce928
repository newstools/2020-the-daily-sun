We are now part of the tele-generation. A generation that cannot live without a telephone, and has since moved away from sending telegrams. We view the world from drones instead of telescopes because our lives have become interesting like television. We telecommunicate with everything but always struggle when it comes to telepathy. So what is telepathy and why do we struggle with this telecommunication? By definition, telepathy often occurs between close people who share bonds like lovers and soul mates, or even friends and family at times. Such communication can also commonly happen between twins especially if they are very close, but even close siblings can be mutually telepathic as can parents or children. In romantic relationships, we often associate telepathy with soulmates as this is a very deep connection that can be traced spiritually, emotionally and in verbal or non-verbal communication. So how can you tell you are in a telepathic relationship? Experts give us their insights: According to experts, telepathy in a relationship is something that is slowly fizzling out. With the world moving at a frantic pace, couples barely find time for one another. Couples struggle to connect with one another, and thus we don't ever find ourselves soulmates. Telepathy is a beautiful skill that couples odd adopt in order to keep their relationship fun and romantic.
