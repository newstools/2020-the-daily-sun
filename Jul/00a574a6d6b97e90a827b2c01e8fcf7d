PASTOR Linda Maponyane of the Jubilee Global Ministries in Randburg, north of Jozi, is sharing the pain with women. She gives an example of the distressed Saria in Genesis 16-5. Said Maponyane: “Recently, prophetess Bongiwe Zulu spoke about self-inflicted pain that’s similar to Saria’s situation. “Take a look at a woman in your church that hides her pain in a beautiful smile. “We’ve hidden this pain behind our cars, careers, weaves, make-up and beautiful outfit.” Maponyane said we come to the church hurt and leave hurt because we’re still stuck in the scene of the offence and perpetrator. Said the woman of God: “Even if an announcement of our answer is at our doorstep, we laugh it off because we don’t believe because the pain can make you deaf and blind to the truth. “That’s why many miss the healing in the presence of the pool of Bethesda being stirred up.” She further said pain can make you comfortable for many years. “Many of you reading this message are wearing masks and layers of past pains. “Some of the adults are still stuck in pain that happened to them when they were still little girls,” she said. “It’s like your husband is still married to the heartbroken 12-year-old baby girl who was raped long time ago. “Everything your mamazala says is misrepresented because you hear her through the ears of a 12-year-old girl that is still hurting.” Maponyane prayed for healing and deliverance to those who can’t let go of the old pain.
