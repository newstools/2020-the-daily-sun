THE PSL is hard at work scheduling new fixtures, including dates and venues as they prepare for the resumption of the games. The new fixtures to conclude the Nedbank Cup, Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship will be released either tomorrow or on Friday. Gauteng was chosen as the biologically safe environment for the remainder of all matches. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza confirmed on Monday that the 2019-20 programmes, suspended since mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will resume on 8 August, starting with the Nedbank Cup semi-finals. The Premiership matches will resume on 11 August and the GladAfrica Championship a few days later. SunSport has been informed that the fixtures for both competitions will continue according to the original fixtures list that was released before the season got underway, but the difference this time will be the venues. On top of this, clubs in Gauteng will continue to use their own training facilities and teams who are from outside the province will choose allocated venues for training. “All the teams from Gauteng will be allowed to use their regular training pitches. In the past we thought everybody must train on neutral venues,” said an insider. “But due to logistical requirements, we thought let’s allow the Gauteng teams to carry on training at their regular training venues and allow the incoming teams to choose venues they’ll like to use.” When it comes to match day venues, things will differ. The insider revealed that the PSL will do the draw. It means teams in Gauteng such as Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United and Swallows FC – whose home venues are FNB Stadium, Loftus, Lucas Moripe and Dobsonville respectively, may be classified as away teams based in the draw. “The PSL will do a draw for match day venues. It may happen that Gauteng teams, despite their home venues being in the province, may end up being an away team based on the draw,” added the mole.
