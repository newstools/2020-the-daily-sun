  AS THE
CORONAVIRUS gains momentum in Limpopo, 40 soldiers from Cape Town deployed to
Lephalale over two weeks ago have tested positive for COVID-19. The group
of troops were placed under a 14-day quarantine period at their home unit in
Cape Town before being transported to Lephalale to safeguard the border gate
between South Africa and Zimbabwe. The South
African National Defense Force spokesperson Jaco Theunissen said the soldiers
are exposed to the scourge of COVID-19, more than ordinary citizen like all
other frontline workers. Theunissen
told Daily Sun that: "The soldiers arrived in Lephalale on 13 June 2020
and were immediately placed under the 14-day quarantine period at the South
African Military Health Services Training Centre there, as per the stipulated
health protocols." "After
some soldiers were screened it became clear that a number of them needed to be
tested and that's when it was established that certain soldiers tested positive
for COVID-19," He said. He added
that the soldiers who tested positive were isolated in a facility inside the
base that has been specifically established and prepared for quarantine
purpose.
