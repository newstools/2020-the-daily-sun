HUNDREDS of parents are against the reopening of schools. The parents said they don’t want to lose their children to Covid-19. And parents at a number of schools in Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni closed the gates, saying no kids would report to class. They said either their children learned online or stayed at home. “School kids, especially those in primary schools, don’t know social distancing,” said parent Nonkululeko Jwaga (40). The protests have been happening since last week, with parents removing grade 7 pupils from schools. “We fear for our children as numbers are rising here,” said Nonkululeko. “School security isn’t enough to enforce social distancing among pupils.” But some parents said they wanted their kids in school. “Those parents who don’t want their kids in school mustn’t violate the rights of those who want their children to go to school,” said parent, Thuli Senene. Meanwhile, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said she understood parents were anxious about their kids. She said parents were not forced to take their children back to school.
