A BITTER war of words has erupted between radio presenters Tshatha Ngobe and Ngizwe Mchunu. Ngizwe, fired by Ukhozi FM in 2018, said Tshatha knows nothing about maskandi. Ngizwe works for the station at the moment. The beef comes after actor and poet Kwazi Nsele wrote a poem praising Tshatha for his role in developing maskandi. Ngizwe apparently replied,  threatening the poet and demanding that he changes the poem to accommodate his perceived heroism. Tshatha and Ngizwe used to be friends and presented popular maskandi show, Sigiya Ngengoma. But the frienship turned sour and they started having fights, which led to suspensions and them being separated. Ngizwe was furious that Tshatha had been mentioned in the poem and not him. He said: “Kwazi can’t talk about maskandi history and mention Bhodloza Nzimande, the first maskandi DJ, and leave me out. He was supposed to mention me. “I’m better than Tshatha in more ways than one when it comes to maskandi, and I’m not scared of him. “I want him to admit he’s terrified of me and tell the nation the truth. Even if we were to ask people to vote, I’d beat him hands down.” Tshatha told the SunTeam he didn’t know why Ngizwe hated him. “The nation must know what type of person he is. He hates me and I don’t know what I did wrong to him. “Why threaten a young boy for praising my good work?” Kwazi said he won’t rework the poem. “I don’t know why he’s attacking me. He’s no longer with Ukhozi FM. I won’t apologise. I did nothing wrong,” he said.
