This after City Power technicians visited the area due to outstanding problems in outages.According to City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena their team were held hostage by the community of 6th Avenue Joe Nhlanhla. He said this will lead to more delays in restoring power to Vasco da Gama which affected almost half of Alexandra from 1st to 20th Avenue between Vasco and Richard Baloyi.  "Its not clear why the team was held hostage but its believed the frustration of not having power for the past five days. Part of the community of 6th Avenue are also angry because they haven't had electricity for almost two weeks since their mini substation blew up and burnt," said Mangena. He said JMPD officers were called to release the team held hostage and no one was injured. Mangena said City Power is currently engaging both the affected communities. " In the meantime we have withdrawn our teams out of Alexandra until their safety can be guaranteed. Councillors and Regional Director were notified," he added.  He said the service providerÂ  is concerned about the behavior of holding their technicians hostage as it leads to delays in attending to repair and prolongs restoration times. " We appeal for customers to calm down and bear with us as our resources are a bit overstretched due to the amount of outages we have to deal with during winter period. We are hoping to restore the comminuty fed from Vasco da Gama soon," said Mangena.
