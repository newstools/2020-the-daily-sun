Are you the type that always isn't around in the relationship? Always vanishes into thin air? Are you always absent in the relationship attendance register? If you've answered yes to all of the above, then you are suffering from what is called ghosting. Ghosting by definition is the practice of ending a relationship by suddenly (and without explanation) withdrawing from all communication. The ghost ignores your attempts to contact them it's as if you'd never had any contact at all. This phenomenon is by no means limited to long-term romantic relationships. Informal dating relationships, friendships, even work relationships may end with a form of ghosting. According to PSYCOM, "Ghosting hurts, it’s a cruel rejection. It is particularly painful because you are left with no rationale, no guidelines for how to proceed, and often a heap of emotions to sort through on your own. If you suffer from any abandonment or self-esteem issues, being ghosted may bring them to the forefront."In this age of ever-advancing technology, your ghoster is likely to appear on your various forms of social media and, if that’s the case, this person who is now physically gone from your life, is still quite visible. How do you move on? Unfortunately, there’s no magic bullet or proven advice to quickly guide you into recovery from a ghosted heart, but there is common sense." So the next time you're put on voicemail in your relationships, be aware that like Casper you have been ghosted.
