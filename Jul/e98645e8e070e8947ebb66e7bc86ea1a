The South African Football Association (SAFA) president Danny Jordaan has revealed that former statesman Nelson 'Madiba' Mandela will always be remembered as Mandela Day approaches. Mandela Day, a yearly occurrence on the birthday of the former South African president, happens on the 18 July. In 2010 the United Nations declared the first Mandela Day on 18 July 2010 - a few days after the very first African FIFA World Cup tournament ended. Each year South Africans, along with many nations worldwide, dedicate 67 minutes (67 â€“ the amount of years fought by Madiba for social justice) to "bring together people around the world to fight poverty and promote peace, reconciliation and cultural diversity," read a statement, just over a decade ago. Jordaan says that he along with the association will continue to remind people across the globe how Mandela brought people together through sport. "SAFA will forever remember Tata Nelson Mandela's contribution to our acceptance to the international football family and hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010," said Jordaan. "We will continue to remember his contribution and how he used sport to unite people. He was inspirational to our senior national team where the Madiba Magic inspired the team to greater heights. "Those of us who walked and worked with Madiba will always remember this loyal servant of the nation. He was a South African, continental and global giant."
