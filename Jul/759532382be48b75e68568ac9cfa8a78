COMMUNITY radio presenter Oddity hopes to work for a commercial radio station. The Mkhondo FM presenter, whose real name is Bheki Mtshali, would like to join Gagasi FM or Metro FM. Oddity, who’s from Mkhondo in Mpumalanga, has many ideas he’d like to share on a bigger stage. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “My show at Mkhondo FM has a lot of great content that deserves a bigger platform. “I also have many mind-blowing ideas that would be great for a commercial station. “I’m working towards moving to a bigger station and have bigger audiences to share my work with.” He hopes that happens soon. Oddity hosts The Rap Up Hip Hop Show, which airs every Friday from 9pm to midnight. “I joined Mkhondo FM in 2015. I was in Durban when I heard there was a new radio station back home. I sent my demo and I was hired. “I’ve been doing the hip hop show since then. The show is a lively one. He said: “We do album reviews and play classics. We also have a segment called ‘Today in hip hop history’, where we share a fun fact about its history. “Most importantly, we bring in up-and-coming artists for interviews and play their music. “I’m a musician, too, and I understand the struggles musicians face, so I invite them to my show.” Oddity is working on an EP that will be released next month. “My debut EP, The Unknown Conscience, was released in 2016, and I’m working on my second EP, Soulid,” said Oddity.
