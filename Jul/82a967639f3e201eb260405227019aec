The dining meal has changed. If you like me are used to sneak out twice or thrice a month for that infamous junk food meal, you can be forgiven. I know healthy food is the way to go, but starch and veggies can taste redundant after a couple days being on the menu. You need what they call in gym terms your "cheat moments" where here and there you have a bit of grease and spices on your menu. Sounds pretty fair, right? But, this mouth-watering analogy has become the order of the menu when it comes to relationships. Stable relationships, much like stable food, have proven to be boring and redundant lately, especially during this lockdown. More and more relationships have succumbed to this lockdown, and the reason could be the lack of diversity in the stable food. According to a research that was done in America, 16% of couples had less sexual activities during this lockdown. Many of them attributed boredom and lack of excitement in the bedrooms. So, with the stable food slowly being struck off the menu the question is, has the side dish now become part of the menu? According to Cyber Affairs data, 20%-40% of married couples have been caught cheating online during lockdown. Tinder has also seen a sharp increase in its dating platform and this points to one thing: That cheating meal has now become part of the main course. So the next time your partner wants to change the menu in your relationship, take note of his/her order. Should you not accommodate their requests, they will start eating out and if recent relationship stats are anything to go buy, you will find out that there is a new dish being served right under your nose.
