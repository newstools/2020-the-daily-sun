WHEN Joseph Phiri left his house, he said he was going to visit his friend. But that was the last time the 31-year-old was seen by his family. He never returned to his home in Chesterville, Durban, since leaving on 3 May. His brother Phackani Phiri (35) told Daily Sun that on the day he left and didn’t come back home, they thought he’d return the next morning. “But he didn’t. I then became worried. I called him on his cellphone but it was off. I went to look for him at his friend’s house, but he told me he left his house very early and said he was going back home,” he said. Phackani said he was so confused as this was the first time his brother left home and didn’t return. “Even his girlfriend doesn’t know where he is. The last time she spoke to him over the phone was on the day he left. We then went to report him missing at the police station. We began searching for him everywhere, but nobody knows where he is,” he said. He said he has been to three different hospitals, but there was no sign of him. “I’m really worried about my brother. It’s been months now and we can’t find him. I’m hoping to find him, even if it means finding him dead. I don’t know whether he is still alive or dead,” he said. He said Joseph worked as a gardener at a house in Westville. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that Pinetown cops were appealing to residents for assistance in finding Joseph. Gwala said he was last seen by his friend after visiting him in Cowies Hill. “He was last seen wearing a navy T-shirt, blue jeans and white takkies. Anyone with information regarding his whereabouts can contact the investigating officer, Detective Constable Wiseman Nyawose, on 074 261 5500 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Gwala
