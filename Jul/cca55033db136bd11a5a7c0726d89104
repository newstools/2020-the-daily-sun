A
stepfather who was convicted for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter has been
sentenced to life imprisonment. Disable
Gilbert Malatjie (31) from Acornhoek pleaded not guilty when he appeared before
magistrate Elmarie Theron at Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe near
Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Wednesday. The court
heard that Gilbert was dating the mother of the victim and she was already
pregnant when he raped the stepdaughter while the other 4-year-old sibling was
forced to watch the incident at their house in Acornhoek. The
incident happened in 2018 after the mother went to work at the nearby school in
the village and when she returned from work, she was told by the 4-year-old
daughter that their father had raped the elder sister. After
hearing the cruel ordeal, the mother didn’t have the intention to report the
matter to the police but the sister in law reported it, and both the father and
mother were arrested. He told the
court during the trial that he didn’t rape the stepdaughter and that she was
injured by an iron bar on her private parts. “My sister
in law was too jealous of me and she influenced the victim to lie that I raped
her after their mother went to work," Malatjie told the court. But his
testimony was rejected and he was found guilty when his trial hearing was held
this year. Magistrate
Elmarie Theron sentenced him to life imprisonment where he was also declared
unfit to possess a firearm.
