  THE HAWKS have arrested two suspects in
Rustenburg for corruption. One of the suspects allegedly approached the
cops involving diesel theft worth R480 000 where two suspects were arrested on
10 July 2020 at an underground pipeline site while extracting diesel and
pumping it into a fuel tanker. According to police spokesperson Captain
Tlangelani Rikhotso, the suspect allegedly claimed to be the legal
representative of the accused and offered the investigator R30 000 to release
both suspects on bail and further release the fuel tanker that was seized at
the crime scene. Rikhotso said an undercover operation was set
up and the suspect arrived with his partner to make a down payment of R5000. Both suspects were immediately arrested and
are expected to make their first appearance before the Rustenburg Magistrate's
Court on Thursday.
