KING of Limpopo gqom Thabang Moseamedi is fighting the coronavirus. Thabang, who’s better known as Mr On Point, said he was about to release his EP when he tested positive. “At the end of last month, I found out about my status. I went for a check up because a colleague I work closely with had tested positive. He was already feeling sick and presenting all the symptoms. I then took him to the hospital and the results confirmed he was positive,” he said. “On the following day, I went for a check up and was found to be positive as well.” Mr On point said at the time he was working on his EP, E Tikatareni.

The EP will have 10 songs and seven have already been completed. “My plan was to release it by the end of last month but now I will have to wait until the end of next month.
