Free State Department of Police, Roads, and Transportâ€™s
chief director, Mangaliso Xaba has recovered from Covid-19. Xaba made a video and posted it on his Facebook account
on Thursday and he thanked all the people that supported him while he was
hospitalized. In the video Xaba says: "Mangaliso Xaba is now
sitting here at his place right away from hospital and he has survived. He is healed
and now taking care of himself. Let me thank all my congregation, my families,
my sons and a daughter, all the relatives, thank you for being there for me.
What is important though is that Corona virus is there, for now. It wants the
lungs and nothing else. Especially when you have any diseases prior to it, if
you have chronic diseases, you are unlikely to survive. But I have survived
with diabetic and cholesterol. Thank you to all of you my colleagues at work,
the taxi and bus industry and everyone else." He said he thanked for all the prayers that has also
helped him. "Above all, your prayers to our heavenly Father
Jehova have actually assisted. I am now back home and sitting here and going to
make sure that I'm taking care of myself," said Xaba. Free State health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said by
Thursday, the province has seen 6 561 confirmed cases, 592 new cases, 45 deaths
and 1 033 recoveries.
