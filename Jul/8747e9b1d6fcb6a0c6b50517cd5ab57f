FORMER Uthongathi coach Johhny Ferreira is itching to get back into action after signing a contract with new GladAfrica Championship side. This season Ferreira played a major role in transforming Uthangathi into a team to beat in the league as they are currently title contenders. However, in December, after losing his second match of the season he was suspended and in March he was fired by the club. He has now joined new kids on the block Sekhukhune FC which is currently knowns as Tsakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the First Division. Ferreira“Yes, I can confirm I have joined Sekhukhune FC from next season,” Ferreira said. The mentor did not reveal the length of his contract with the club. He will work alongside Alex Bapela who will be his assistant. Ferreira added: “Right now we are waiting for Premier Soccer League to finish the current season we will then start our preparations for nest campaigns. “I have been coaching in the First Divison for a long time. I promised the chairman (Simon Malatjie) that I will deliver. "I am looking forward to walking the walk.” Tshakhuma sold their GladAfrica franchise in June and the club will be renamed to Sekhuhune FC from next season. With their remaining games in the GladAfrica, Tshakhuma will be hoping to secure a promotional play-off spot which will see them getting another opportunity to battle for a spot in the Absa Premiership for next season. They are fourth in the GladAfrica table with 38 points, 10 behind Ajax Cape Town who are sitting comfortably at the top of the table.
