POPULAR Uyajola 9/9 presenter Jub Jub was going about his usual business of confronting cheaters. But this week turned out to be business unusual, as Jub Jub came face-to-face with taxi drivers who sent him packing. In a video that has been doing the rounds on social media, taximen ordered the host to leave them alone when he went to confront a cheating taximan while on duty. The video shows a group of them shouting and calling for him to leave. It shows the presenter and musician, whose real name is Molemo Maarohanye, narrowly escaping what seems to be a beating at a taxi rank near Ellis Park Stadium, in Joburg. It also shows him and his camera crew getting into the minibus frequently seen on the show that exposes cheating partners on the channel Moja Love. “Jub Jub uzofa, hamba!” screams are heard. The men on the video are also heard screaming, “wenzani erank?” Speaking through his channel, Moja Love, Jub Jub said he went to the rank when his informers told him the cheating couple were together where the man works as a taxi driver at the rank. He said the taximen said their gripe was that he arrived unannounced. “They wanted me to make an appointment with the queue marshal first but I told them I couldn’t because it defeats the purpose of catching cheaters on the spot and would have blown the cover,” he said. Jub Jub said he was happy he did his work and achieved the purpose. Without going into details of the show, which he said people will enjoy the confrontation, he said the wife of the taxi driver started to be suspicious when she discovered a positive pregnancy test at their home. “Uyajola 9/9 still holds Mzansi’s record of over 2,7 million viewers on the show that happened in Qwa Qwa recently. He said the episode where he was confronted by the taximen will air tonight. WATCH VIDEO BELOW: WATCH: ABO MAGEZA CHASE JUB JUB!https://t.co/SO1YLo3RSg pic.twitter.com/LzLQSKNdKp
