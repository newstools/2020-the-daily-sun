The South African Football Association (SAFA) has joined millions of South Africans and football fans across the continent in mourning the untimely passing away of Orlando Pirates supporter, Mandla ‘MGIJIMI’ Sindane. Mgijimi as Sindane was famously known in football circles, died in his sleep on Tuesday in his hometown of Emalahleni in Mpumalanga. He had been struggling to breathe. Loved by football fans across the country and the continent, Mgijimi’s ghost-resembling figure had become a regular feature wherever his team Orlando Pirates played. “Football has lost a colourful and ardent supporter of the game," said SAFA President, Dr Danny Jordaan. "He hardly missed any of the Pirates games and his flamboyant character put him among Mzansi’s prominent football fans. “Him, Mama Joy Chauke, Saddam Maake, Dejan Miladinovic, Botha Msila, Robert ‘Mzekezeke’ Nkosi and Masilo Machaka have been the face of South African football fans adored around the globe. We are really saddened by Mgijimi’s untimely departure. May his soul rest in peace."Mgijimi’s unique gear and vibrant energy made him an added attraction at soccer matches and with football resuming in early August, his omnipresence figure will be sadly missed. - Safa
