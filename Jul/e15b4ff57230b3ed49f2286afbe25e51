  The EFF
Commander-in-Chief and President Julius Malema is expected to visit Mlangeni's
family on Monday. The Economic
Freedom Party said Malema will visit the Mlangeni's family to offer his
condolences on the passing of anti-apartheid stalwart Andrew Mlangeni. Mlangeni
died on Wednesday at the Military One hospital in Tshwane. He died at
the age of 95, following abdominal related complications. Due to
covid-19 regulations, a series of virtual memorial services were held since
Friday, organised by the ANC together with Mlangeni's family. These included
reflections on the life and times of Mlangeni, who was the last remaining
Rivonia trialist. Mlangeni
has been described as an icon, a giant, and a selfless servant.
