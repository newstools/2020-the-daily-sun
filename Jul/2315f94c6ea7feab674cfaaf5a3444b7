Manchester City have become the dominant force in English football over the past decade but are still waiting for the final piece in the Abu Dhabi project jigsaw - the Champions League title. Backed by Sheikh Mansour's immense wealth, inspired by Pep Guardiola's managerial genius and boasting a cast of superstars, the club have greedily scooped up 11 major trophies in nine years. Yet the prize that has eluded them is the Champions League, which the owners crave above all else. Monday's ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), lifting a two-season UEFA ban from European competition, will give Guardiola's men a huge lift for this season and next as they chase elusive European glory. They can now prepare for the second leg of their last-16 tie at home against Real Madrid, leading 2-1, safe in the knowledge that they will be back at Europe's top table next season. City's great fear was if CAS upheld UEFA's ban, imposed in February, players would look to elsewhere and Guardiola himself could even lose interest. Now they can not only retain their best players, but look to recruit more talent in a bid to take back the Premier League title from Liverpool. "From a footballing perspective, it is good to know that Pep Guardiola may now extend his contract as City manager beyond next season, continuing to raise coaching standards in this country," said the Times. "It is a joy to know that Kevin De Bruyne, the finest midfield player in the world on present form, may stay on, enchanting audiences with his extraordinary passing style." City have already lifted the League Cup this season and are well-placed in the FA Cup. But they know that to be considered a member of the established European elite, they must win the Champions League.
