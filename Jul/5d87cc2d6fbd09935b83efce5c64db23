By KGALALELO TLHOAELE A WOMAN was bust on Saturday for breaking lockdown regulations after appearing in a video of a funeral allegedly in Soshanguve, Tshwane. In the video, she’s seen among mourners who seem to be over the regulated limit of 50 people. “Guys, we just buried our father, brother and our boss. You wouldn’t suffer while he was around, but God made His will. The police must wait because we had to bury him,” says the woman. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said: “Other video clips relating to the same funeral are circulating on social media, and these also confirm the number of mourners was more than 50 people. The woman has been charged with contravention of lockdown regulations, and was released on a warning to appear in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court on 3 September. “Cops have also charged a family member in their capacity as organiser of the same funeral, for failing to ensure adherence to rules.” That person was released and will appear in court next month. Cops warned people to not break attendance regulations at funerals. Acting commissioner, Major-General Johan Ndlovu, said regulations were there to protect lives.
