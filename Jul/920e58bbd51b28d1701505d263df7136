ANC KZN spokesman Ricardo Mthembu has died of Covid-19. Mthembu, who was also a member of the provincial legislature, succumbed to the disease in the early hours of Wednesday morning after spending two weeks in KwaDukuza private hospital's intensive care unit. His death was confirmed to Daily Sun by family member Zandile Manzi today. Manzi, who answered Mthembu's wife's phone Zodwa Mthembu, said the wife was still in shock. She said Mthembu had coronavirus symptoms and was rushed to hospital where it was discovered he had been infected by the virus. Mthembu, who is from Gledow outside KwaDukuza, was KwaDukuza municipality mayor until last year when he was elected as MPL to the legislature. ANC in province and legislature speaker's office said they are preparing statements about Mthembu.  Meanwhile deputy ANC provincial chairman Mike Mabuyakhulu was said to be in the ICU battling coronavirus. He was said to have rushed to hospital last night after he collapsed. Daily Sun was reliably informed that he was in a very critical condition. No official confirmation either from the ANC or family yet. The People's Paper is also aware that another ANC member of the legislature has tested positive for Covid-19. The member, which is known to Daily Sun, is said to be in quarantine.
