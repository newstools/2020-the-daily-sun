FIFA confirmed on Wednesday that the 2022 World Cup schedule will kick-off at the iconic Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar on 21 November 2022. The final is scheduled for 18 December 2022 at the Lusail Stadium in front of an 80 000 crowd.  The Al Bayt Stadium, a 60 000-capacity arena that takes its name and shape from the traditional tents used by nomadic peoples in the Gulf region, will be the stage for hosts Qatar to kick off the tournament at 1pm (local time). The local kick-off times for group matches have been set for 1pm, 4pm, 7pm and 10pm, with the simultaneous kick-offs for the last round of group games and knockout-stage timings being 6pm and 10pm. Khalifa International Stadium will be the setting for the play-off for third place on 17 December.  The iconic image of Fifa World Cup champions France lifting the trophy at Luzhniki Stadium is still fresh in the memory of every football fan. Exactly two years after that historic occasion on 15 July 2018, the unveiling of the match schedule for the next edition invites the football world to dream of a new beginning – one that, now, has a precise time and place to start. With the aim of providing all teams with optimal rest between their matches, the group stage will last 12 days and, with four matches per day, it promises a full and exciting schedule for fans. The tournament’s compact nature – with no air travel needed to move between the venues – will allow organisers, for the first time, to optimise specific match demands for the benefit and comfort of fans, teams and media.  This will be achieved through the assignment of the group fixtures for each match day to a stadium and kick-off time only after the final draw, currently planned for after the March 2022 international match calendar qualifying window. Once the pairings are known, the possibility will be discussed of providing a more beneficial kick-off time for audiences at home, or indeed for fans in Qatar with regards to the stadium allocation. ? 23 #WorldCup winners in 10 seconds ??????
