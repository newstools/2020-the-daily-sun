FORMER police minister Nkosinathi Nhleko has denied allegations that he told General Berning Ntlemeza that Hawks head Major-General Anwa Dramat would be suspended. Nhleko yesterday told the Zondo Commission sharing that information with another employee would amount to procedural unfairness. “I absolutely had no reason to speak to one employee about the fate of another employee,” he said. Last year, Ipid investigator Innocent Khuba told the commission that on 6 December 2014, Ntlemeza told him to watch the news as there would be a hit on Dramat. “I just wonder as to why would I do that. I supervised Dramat directly,” said Nhleko. He said he might not remember the sequence of events, but he was supposed to inform ex-national police commissioner Riah Phiyega and former president Jacob Zuma. “It wouldn’t be fair to a president to hear from the media about either a contemplation letter being dispatched to high level police or the eventual suspension. It becomes important to brief the head of state that this is what I’ve established. This is what the law says and, therefore, this is what I’m required to do,” said Nhleko. Dramat was given a suspension notice on 9 December and was eventually suspended on 23 December. His suspension was based on an Ipid report that said he was involved in the illegal rendition of five Zimbabweans in 2010. Nhleko said the first report drafted on 22 January 2014 recommended criminal charges against Dramat, Major-General Shadrack Sibiya and others. But the second report of 18 March cleared them. The former minister told the hearing he decided to bring in lawyers to investigate the alterations. “You need more details than what’s written on the report. “That’s where the question of the investigation comes in,” said Nhleko.
