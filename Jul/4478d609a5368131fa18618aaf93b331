GOGO’s mean son made her sleep in the kitchen. But residents took gogo Mapeu Motimele back to the room. But her son allegedly removed all the beds and the gogo now sleeps on the cold floor. Dinah Motimele (58) said her 90-year-old mum slept on a mattress and complained of body aches. Jobless Dinah, who sleeps on the floor in another room, wished she had money for a bed. “It pains me that my mum raised us under difficult circumstances after dad died.” Gogo sometimes felt suicidal. “My own son has taken over my property as if it’s his,” she said. She said her son Alfonso built four backyard rooms behind her four-roomed house in Mashemong, Tembisa. “He’s renting two out and one was taken by his son and the other is his store room. “I don’t get a cent, but the rooms are built on my property. He even has the title deed to the house.” Gogo feared her son might sell her house. Alfonso said he removed the beds as they were his. “I’ve placed them in one of the rooms I built,” he said. He admitted he had the title deed and collected rent money after building back rooms. Neighbour Sello Potsane said: “We condemn such acts and are not going to sit back and watch.” Tahir Sema of the Gauteng human settlements department said the house didn’t fall under their jurisdiction. He advised gogo to report to the police that her title deed had been stolen. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha of Tembisa cop shop referred the matter to the municipality. The municipality’s Themba Gadebe said the matter was being investigated.
