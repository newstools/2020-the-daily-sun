VETERAN Polokwane City captain Jabulani Maluleke will know on Wednesday whether the Limpopo based side will renew his contract or not. The 38-year-old’s contract with Rise and Shine expired on Tuesday following a successful seven-year spell that saw him play 54 matches scoring eight goals since he joined the club in 2014 from SuperSport United. This was after he impressed club owner Johnny Mogaladi while on loan where he made ten appearances before he was offered a permanent deal. Maluleke has been a pillar of strength for the Limpopo based outfit this season in their battle to survive relegation. He started in 20 matches and was only substituted twice before the PSL season was halted in March due to coronavirus pandemic. Polokwane are third bottom on the Absa Premiership table, tied with neighbors Baroka FC and AmaZulu on 23 points with six games still to play. They are three points ahead of bottom club and fellow Limpopo rivals Black Leopards. Maluleke, who still gives youngsters a tough time whenever he is on the pitch said: “I will meet management later today to discuss about my future with the club.” Meanwhile, highly rated goalkeeper George Chigova together with left-back Simphiwe Hlongwane were also expected to discuss their future with Mogaladi on Wednesday as their contract have also lapsed. Chigova joined Rise and Shine in 2015 and made 93 appearances to date, while Hlongwane has missed only the last four league matches as he has been ever present in the starting line-up this season.
