ENOS Letsoalo said he was dismissed from work after reporting a white manager for using the k-word.  The 39-year-old from Segopye village in Ga-Mamabolo outside Polokwane, Limpopo, said he was a health and safety officer for Coreslab. He said he went to a section of the company on 9 June to hand over a Covid-19 safety notice to the manager as the section did not comply with instructions. READ: WHY DO MEN USE IMBIZA FOR THE 4-5? Enos said the section manager refused to sign it. “He said he did comply. He became aggressive and became racist. He called me the k-word.” Enos said he reported the matter to director Jaco de Bruin who apologised, but no further action was taken.  “We went to a hearing and my right to bring a representative or a witness was denied. I asked them to bring CCTV footage as proof this took place. That was dismissed.

I was dismissed on 15 July because according to them, I had lied. I was dismissed for voicing my concerns.” De Bruin said Enos wasn’t telling the truth. “Enos accused another manager of using the k-word. Polygraphy tests were done and the manager was not found guilty during a hearing. I then charged Enos for falsely accusing someone of racism. He was found guilty at a hearing. He was dismissed fairly and legally,” said De Bruin.
