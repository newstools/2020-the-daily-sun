  A
gogo (67) and her two grandchildren were found brutally murdered in a house at
Maokeng village. Police
spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the neighbours allegedly became
worried when they realised there was no movement in the house since the morning
and calls that were made, were also not answered. They
then went to investigate and thatâ€™s when the gruesome discovery was made. Mojapelo
said the police were called and on arrival at the scene, the three bodies were
found lying in a pool of blood with gaping wounds. The mother of the two children aged 29, who is
also the daughter of the 67-year-old gogo, was allegedly not in the house during
this brutal attack. Police
investigations revealed that the attacker might have committed these horrendous
deeds during the night of Monday or in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The
motive for the killings is not known at this stage and police investigations
are continuing. Mojapelo
said cops have opened three counts of murder cases and anyone with information
that can lead to the arrest of the killer is requested to contact Detective
Warrant Officer Albert Manaka on 082 414 6634 or Crime Stop number 0860010111.
