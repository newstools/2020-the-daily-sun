THE clock is ticking. Can you hear that sound, Mr Lehlohonolo Seema? That is the countdown on how long you will last as Chippa United coach. The tick-tocking sound might be a new experience to you. But it has sounded the death knell for many before you. What exactly makes you think you can survive the storm that has so easily sunk your predecessors? It boggles the mind. Did Chippa Mpengesi recite the sweet nothings he whispered in the ears of Rhulani Mokwena, Clinton Larsen or Eric Tinkler, to name a few? “My new chairman is a beautiful soul” ... I hear you say. But aren’t those the exact words Tinkler uttered over a year ago? Wasn’t Norman Mapeza identified as the right man for the job in the long-term? Yes, it’s not for me to dictate your future moves. And of course, job security may have influenced your decision to leave the financially unstable Bloemfontein Celtic. The financial constraints, exacerbated by the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on football, have left you disillusioned. But given Mpengesi’s tendency to fire coaches without provocation, many won’t be surprised to see you in the wilderness soon. You have shown potential with your commendable work at Celtic. But you leave Bloemfontein with your apprenticeship incomplete. Joining the Chilli Boys represents a major step in your relatively young coaching career and the acclaim you’ve received for keeping Celtic off dreaded relegation zone, which would seem a reasonable mandate, is worth noting. Your ambition, if not bravery, is also quite admirable. We can only hope you’ve gone through the Ts and Cs of that three-year deal with a fine-tooth comb. They say a good coach is defined by what he achieves. Good luck, coach. You are certainly going to need it. Tick-tock, tick-tock... The silence around plans to finish off the season is deafening.
