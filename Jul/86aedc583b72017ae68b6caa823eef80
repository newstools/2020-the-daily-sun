Rapper Megan Thee Stallion says she was not arrested. According to media reports, Megan and fellow rapper, Tory Lanez were arrested on Sunday, following a fight they were involved in. The reports further said Megan was bleeding from a cut when they were arrested. Megan has corrected that information. She took to Instagram to explain what had happened. "The narrative that is being reported about Sunday's morning events are inaccurate and I'd like to set the record straight. On Sunday morning, I suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me," she said. She also explained that the police didn't arrest her, but they took her to the hospital. "I was never arrested, the police officers drove me to hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the bullets," she continued. The Savage rapper said she is grateful to be alive.
