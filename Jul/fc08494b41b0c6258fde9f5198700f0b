THE hosts of this year’s Samas have been announced. Actress Dineo Moeketsi-Langa and comedian Donovan Goliath will be presenting the first virtual ceremony of the music awards. Speaking to Daily Sun, Donovan said: “When I got the call that I would be hosting the awards, I thought it was a prank because given the times we are in, this is the last thing you’d expect to happen. “Hosting the Samas was one of my dreams. “It only sunk in when I got the email with Dineo tagged in it and the director chatting to us.” It will be Donovan’s first time hosting the awards. “There have been such great hosts before, but this one is different to all of them as it’s virtual. So I can’t compare myself to any of the other hosts. “I am definitely nervous and for a lot of comedians, that is what fuels the fire, to be anxious before you go on stage. “I am excited because I have a great co-host and I am keen to see what we come up with.” Donovan said people could expect a jam-packed award ceremony. “This year, the creators of the show have got a lot more creative with how they are going to present categories and with us being in the studio presenting the show.” The comedian said he was happy with the safety measures put in place. “Safety and social distancing is the number one priority and it was one of the first questions I asked when we were briefed,” he said. Donovan said he expected more events would be virtual.
