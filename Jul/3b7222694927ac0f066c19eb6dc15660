BELGIUM second division side KSV Roeselare have secured the services of Mamelodi Sundowns defender Anele Ngcongca on a two-year contract with an option to renew for another season. The club announced on their website that the 32-year-old versatile player will add stability in the team having gained valuable experience while playing for another Belgian outfit Racing Genk between 2007 and 2015. He played over 279 matches during his eight seasons with Genk where he won the league title and Belgian Cup twice. Read the statement: “ Today Calvin Anele Ngcongca (South African, 21.10.1987) signed a two-season contract plus option on an additional campaign at Schiervelde. The defender, who can handle several positions, comes from Mamelodi Sundowns FC, with which he was active last season in, among other things, the quarterfinals of the CAF Champions League. In the 2015/2016 season, Anele was loaned for a year to the French ES Troyes AS, before returning to his home country. In the four seasons with the Sundowns, he played 97 games and became South African champion twice, winning the cup and the CAF Super Cup. Now Anele is returning to Belgium, with his experience he hopes to be able to contribute to the 'KSV Roeselare 2.0' project. We warmly welcome Anele and wish him the best of luck at Schiervelde.”
