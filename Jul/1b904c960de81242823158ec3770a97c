LOVE expert Venesia Makofane has launched her second book titled The Essence of a Healthy Relationship online. She said Covid-19 delayed the launch of her book but it also gave her enough time to start on her third book, The Disorders of Intimacy. She said she is planning to launch her third book in January next year. The 31-year-old from Dennilton in Limpopo, who is now based in Kempton Park, said she was inspired by the success of her first book, The Reflections of a Lasting Love, that she launched in February in 2017. She said to date it has sold about 10 000 copies, and it continues to sell. “Love ideas just come pouring in my mind and I have to let them out through writing. I’ve since been dubbed the love expert. I’m very optimistic that this book will do much better than the first one. As a motivational speaker and a love expert, I aim to equip people to not only count anniversaries in their relationships, but to also check if they are happy and their love is healthy,” she said. “As a country we are experiencing gender-based violence where women are dying at the hands of the people who claim to love them. “My books are there to help teach people how to love one another. I already have hard copies of the second book, and they can be found in bookstore shelves. “On online stores they can be accessed at Amazon and Smashwords,” she said. Venesia told Daily Sun that we cannot be a generation of toxic relationships. She said her main aim is to become a qualified life coach and to counsel couples. She said apart from writing about love, she also sings about it. “I’ve just finished my second single titled True Love under my company Veekmak Media Production and Entertainment. I’m yet to release it. The single is a follow-up on my first that I released in 2017, titled Ungowami. “I’m a firm believer that loving too much doesn’t mean you love well. I don’t only want people to build long lasting love, but I also want them to build healthy relationships,” she said.
