FADED kwaito star Msawawa says he’s found God and his life has changed for the better. Msawawa, whose real name is Siboniso Dlamini, has decided to switch to gospel after being born again. The musician from Clermont in Durban told Daily Sun: “I used to sing kwaito when I was still young and naive. Fame overpowered me and I became reckless. “Being famous didn’t work for me. It made me big-headed. There was a time when I was famous yet broke. “I tried everything to remain relevant, but it didn’t work and my fame faded.” Msawawa said when he accepted he was no longer famous, he sat down and surrendered himself to God. “I decided to go to church and became a born-again Christian. I recently released a gospel song titled Thandaza,” he said. Mswawa said the song was available on all digital music platforms. He urges people to pray when they needed answers. “I pray that God humbles me all the time. When I am big again, I don’t want to look down on people,” he said.
