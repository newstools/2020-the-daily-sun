The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa on
Monday topped the 200 000-case mark - double the number of cases reported just
14 days ago on 22 June. This means that 100 000 coronavirus cases were recorded in 14 days across the
country, compared to the 110 days it took since the first confirmed case on 5
March to reach the first 100 000 cases. This surge in cases can be
attributed to a significant spike in the number of cases being found in
Gauteng, the most densely populated province in the country. On 22 June, the Western Cape accounted for a little more than half of the 100
000 cases reported nationally, with 52 544 cases. But it took the Western Cape 18
days to double from 25 000 cases to 50 000. In contrast, Gauteng doubled from
26 000 cases on 24 June to more than 50 000 cases in just 10 days. Mapping confirmed cases by day of
each province's respective local epidemic provides clarity on how fast Gauteng
has caught up to the Western Cape. As of Monday, Gauteng had reported 66 891 confirmed cases,
quickly catching up to the Western Cape which has 70 938 cases. On 13 June, 99 days after the
first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Gauteng, the province had less than 10 000
confirmed cases, and had, on average, reported 88 new cases a day. Between 14 June and 6 July, that average skyrocketed to 2 300
cases a day, with the province recording more than 50 000 cases in 23 days. This exponential spike in cases
is clearly visible when the daily increase in cases is set out on a seven-day
average basis, such as in this graph. For the week leading up to 6 July, Gauteng and the Eastern Cape
reported a daily increase in cases far exceeding that of the Western Cape. But when plotted on graphs using
the same axis values, the gravity of the Gauteng surge compared with the
Western Cape is clear.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/Investigations/infographics-sa-breaches-200-000-coronavirus-cases-with-half-of-those-coming-in-just-14-days-20200707
