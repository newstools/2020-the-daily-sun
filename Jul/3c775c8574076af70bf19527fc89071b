PERCY Tau has confirmed his departure from Belgium giants Clubbe Brugge. But the look of things, it seems his next destination has been secured. But whether he returns to England at his club Brighton Hove and Albion or is going to be loaned elsewhere remains to be seen. Tau was loaned to Brugge, the same club owned by Brighton boss Tony Bloom, in this marred season in the effort to help him secure the work permit to the UK.The 26-year-old helped the club secure the league title, featuring in 30 games across all competitions, scoring 12 goals in the process. In those games, he featured in five of six Uefa Champions League where in the group stages they were paired against some of the top European clubs such as Real Madrid, PSG and Turkish side Galatasaray. They finished third in the group, which saw the club enter the Europa League. However, they were thrashed by Manchester United 6-1 on the aggregate score in the last 32. It was the second loan stint in Belgium for the Bafana star after spending 2018-19 at Royal Union Saint-Gilloise following his signing from Mamelodi Sundowns for R50 million in 2018. However, after Tau confirmed his departure, his former assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena hinted that Tau’s next move is already been lined up. Tau Tweeted: "I’d like to take this moment to say, thank you to the players, technical team, entire staff and supporters for a successful loan spell. @ClubBrugge I thank you." And you’re off to.... Mxm let me allow you to tell them. ???? https://t.co/QKIXPwrLoU
