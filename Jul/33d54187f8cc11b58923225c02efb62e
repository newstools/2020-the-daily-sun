  THE ANC in the Eastern Cape has fired Raymond Mhlaba
Municipality chief whip for insulting residents. Lindelwa Penisi, who is also a Ward 20 councillor, was
caught on camera on Sunday insulting desperate residents at Magaleni Village in
Fort Beaufort after she was confronted about water challenges. She was removed as council chief whip on Monday pending
disciplinary action against her. DA Constituency Leader, Nomzamo Zibonda, said: “This video
once again shows that the ANC and its cadre deployees do not care about the
people they are meant to serve. “No public representative should ever conduct themselves in
such a disgraceful manner. Our communities are in dire need of water, they do
not need to be chastised and sworn at.” Zibonda said the municipality has been experiencing water
shortages for a few years, with allegations that community members have been
made to buy water. “Now more than ever, the need for water has been placed in
the spotlight due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which requires the constant washing
of hands and maintaining high hygienic standards,” said Zibonda. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi confirmed that
Penisi was removed from her position. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this un-ANC behaviour
and will never be tolerated. Disciplinary processes will be instituted against
councillor Penisi. “Such abhorrent behaviour makes a complete mockery of the
office she holds and is contemptuous to the people of Raymond Mhlaba
Municipality and the constituency she represents. We will at all times defend
our people’s hard-won democracy and protect it against those who are working
relentlessly to undermine it,” said Ngcukayitobi.
