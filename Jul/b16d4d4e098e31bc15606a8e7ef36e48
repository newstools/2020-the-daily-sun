BABERWA FC boss Joe Seanego has been offered a chance of a life time to become chairman of Belgian second division side KSV Roeselare. It will be the first in the history of South African football that an overseas club recruits a chairman instead of players as per norm – should he signs the five-year deal. Accepting the lucrative deal will also pave the way for four Baberwa players to realise their dream of starting a career abroad. Roeselare recently made headlines in Mzansi’s media having announced the signing of veteran Mamelodi Sundowns defender Anele Ngcongca on a two-year contract. Seanego will travel to Belgium on 2 August to have a look at Roselare’s facilities and also meet other board members. Explained Seanego: “Roeselare have been following Baberwa for quiet some time, and they like what I am doing. They invited me to be in Belgium for a week and if I am happy with the conditions then I will sign. They also sent me a letter to apply for Visa.” However, Seanego revealed that his businesses are the only stumbling block that could stand on his way to expand his knowledge abroad. He sees the move as a wagon that could help his ABC Motsepe League side that campaign in the Gauteng stream to get more exposure internationally. Baberwa had occupied third spot with six points behind leaders Pretoria Callies on 44 points from 22 matches when the season was halted in March due to the virus. Added Seanego: “Even though I haven’t achieved anything with Baberwa, success doesn’t only come through trophies. They liked the way I have given my team exposure and it shows there is something positive about the job that I am doing. They also promised to take care of my team to ensure we achieve our goal of competing in the PSL one day.” Even though the coronavirus pandemic has affected a lot of businesses and delayed other league’s abroad to restart, Seanego says he will take all safety measures prior to his departure.
