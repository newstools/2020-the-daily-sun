WHILE many soapie productions have been affected by the coronavirus, Generations: The Legacy remains the only soapie that has not been severely affected. But it’s back to business at the set of Muvhango after 10 people tested positive for Covid-19, and production was shut for two weeks. In a statement, the SABC confirmed that production resumed yesterday. “A couple of departments will be affected in light of the unforeseen developments. We have mapped out measures to mitigate the negative impact on the production,” read part it. According to the statement, two freelancers will be brought in to fill in two key positions. “Completing season 21 on schedule remains our top priority,” the statement continued. Meanwhile, insiders said some people on Generations were not comfortable with Muvhango resuming production. “They share the same floor as well as an entrance, so some people are concerned about their safely,” said a source. Another source said the concerns stemmed from the fact that actors and crews from both productions interacted with each other a lot including having lunch together most of the time. But Generations publicity manager Nandipha Pantsi said the set was disinfected. “We only had one case of infection, but the person works upstairs and not with the cast. There’s no need to worry because the set has been cleaned,” she said.
