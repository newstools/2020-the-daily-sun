GIFT Radebe has never been lucky with the ladies. So he decided to take matters into his own hands by consulting with a sangoma. “I used to buy magoshas, but it got tiring because I’d sometimes consider asking the magosha to come home with me. I was a joke,” he said. The 38-year-old from Chiawelo, Soweto, said the sangoma charged him R2 500 and promised he’ll attract women from all walks of life. So happy was Gift to hear this, he paid an extra R300. He told Daily Sun he was given muthi to burn in his bedroom and to bath with, as well as imbiza for when he gets his woman. “I did exactly as I was told. I finished everything in two weeks and went to the sangoma for more. He laughed at me and told me it’s a once-off procedure,” said Gift. He started asking ladies out and they were easy to get, but it was not the ones he really wanted. “These women were old, but it didn’t matter because I wanted to weigh my options. But not even one of them was younger than 50.” The women he really wanted still despised him. “These are people’s wives and they will never settle down with me. “I almost died after being klapped by one of their husbands. I’m now convinced God wants me to die alone,” he said. His friend James Mantsena (40) said he warned him about this, but he didn’t listen. “We have been dealing with husbands who’ve threatened his life because of this. We really need help for him,” said James. Daily Sun spoke to Mahlalentabeni Zungu, the sangoma Gift consulted. He said there was nothing he could do for him. “I told him he has options to choose from, but he started with older women. “That’s not my problem. I hope he gets help,” said Mahlalentabeni.
