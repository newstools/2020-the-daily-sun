CONTROVERSIAL Bishop Bheki Ngcobo has challenged Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, to quarantine the province, questioning his silence while the coronavirus was eating away at his people. Ngcobo told Daily Sun today he woke up to a prophecy that he must tell the king to speak to the Zulu nation. The bishop, known for speaking his mind, said the king’s voice was the only one missing among KZN people. He said his prophecy to challenge the king came at a time when the province was recording daily Covid-19 cases at an alarming rate. He said Zulus were conservative people who’d do anything announced by their king, and the king must use that to his advantage and save his people from the virus. Ngcobo understood he couldn’t dictate to the king, but he proposed that Goodwill announce that people in urban areas remained where they were and rural people stopped going to towns, except for important trips or for work. “We have a unique king in this country who doesn’t only command respect among Zulus but leads other tribes. “I call on His Majesty to speak to fellow Zulus like President Cyril Ramaphosa did to South Africans. “The king can play an important role in stopping the coronavirus spread in the province.” The king’s spokesman, Prince Thulani Zulu, said Ngcobo would make a good prophet because what he prophesised was exactly what the king was planning to do when he addresses the nation at his birthday celebration on Monday. He agreed with Ngcobo that, with the fourth industrial revolution, there was no reason for working men in urban areas to go home every month, since they could easily use digital ways to send money.
