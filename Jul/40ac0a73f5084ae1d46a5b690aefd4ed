When it comes to lipstick most people are very fussy, especially when coming to trying new products. When it comes to lipsticks I too used to be very picky but I have since then found gems since I decided to give different brands a try. I recently tried the Every Shade Lipstick and I am wowed. Their first range of lipsticks was introduced this year with four shades that took the spotlight. The shades are Nude lip, Purple lip, Pink lip, and Rooi Lip. The beauty of these colours is that they match all skin tones and fit different looks. What really stood out for me was the soft matte texture that has rich moisture that keeps the lips from getting dry because I don't really like that about matte lipsticks.  Every Shade is a 100% black woman owned beauty brand and was created for women of all skin types, shapes, ethnicities, personalities, races, creeds, shapes, and cultures. Their branding is one things that really attracted me to try out the product right away after getting it because of the elegant and slick packaging which speaks volumes about the care put into the product. The brand also has a waterproof foundation and will be bringing eyeshadows which come in a palette of various shades from earth browns to bright summer tones and dark evening glows. All this will be launched in September 2020 alongside their adaptable face powder. Twitter & Instagram: @Everyshade_ZA Facebook: EveryshadeZA
