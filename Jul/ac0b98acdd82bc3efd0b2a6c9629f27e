 THE outlawing of female genital mutilation has been hailed as a groundbreaking achievement. The country has one of the highest rates of the practice, also known as female circumcision, in the world. About 88% of women and girls from 15 to 49 years have undergone some form of female genital mutilation, according to the most recent government data. The United Nations Population Fund said the criminalisation by the country was a historic victory for public health, human rights and gender equality. “Banning female genital mutilation is a landmark achievement for Sudan,” Massimo Diana, the fund’s representative in Sudan, said. She said the organisation must work with communities to ensure that practice followed government policy. Osman Abufatima, secretary-general of the National Council for Child Welfare, welcomed the ban. “It’s a historical and outstanding day,” Abufatima said. About 200 million girls and women across the world have undergone some form of female genital mutilation. It’s the practice of partially or totally removing the external female genitalia, or causing injury to female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Critics argue that girls subjected to it are denied their right to health and human rights. Immediate risks include hemorrhage, shock and infections. – CAJ NEWS
