THE coronavirus may have stopped this year’s Trek4Mandela climbers from going to Mount Kilimanjaro, but it didn’t stop them from giving to those in need. The Imbumba Foundation and partner Dot­Africa gave food parcels to 140 tourism workers on Saturday. They then went on a 16km hike around the Cradle of Humankind, west of Joburg. The tourism industry has been hardest hit by the lockdown, and most workers haven’t earned an income since March. Richard Mabaso of Imbumba said: “We came to make a small contribution to support 140 staff members working in the tourism industry around the Cradle of Humankind.” Mabaso said they launched a campaign to support young girls’ menstrual health. “Whenever we climb Mount Kilimanjaro, it’s mainly to collect funds to buy sanitary pads,” he said. “Today we’re renewing our commitment to reach a further 67 000 girls in the next six months.” Mabaso said they had selected under-resourced schools to support matrics with applications for university and NSFAS bursaries. “Last year, we helped 500 pupils go to varsity after matric. This year we want to assist 27 000 pupils.” DotAfrica’s Lucky Masilela said the event was one of many milestones. “This was one of those moments where we needed to step up and do something.”
