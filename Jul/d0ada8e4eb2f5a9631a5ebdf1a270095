"First training with the team was fantastic, a warm welcome, the coaches welcome me very well," Mokwena said. "The session was very well organised. The players gave me the normal less amount of respect that they gave me before I left" "It felt normal in a sense that these were family members that were only distance for each other temporarily. I have come back to a very familiar environment with a lot of familiar faces." The former Pirates and Chippa United coach said he could not resist the opportunity of re-joining Sundowns when it came when his contract was not renewed by the Chilli Boys.
