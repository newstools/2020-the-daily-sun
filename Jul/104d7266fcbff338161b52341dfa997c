If it’s true that there are people behaving recklessly during this difficult time of Covid-19, they must face the full might of the law. Law enforcement must ensure that they nip this criminal act in the bud by swiftly arresting the perpetrators. That will send a clear message to others that such behaviour deserves punishment. It’s alleged that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 are roaming the streets, while others are drinking booze in the taverns. It may be that the offenders are not aware that their actions are equal to committing culpable homicide, and that they can be arrested for such behaviour. So they must stop this madness! We condemn the practice of moral degeneration and encourage people to behave well. We should be a nation that is caring and adheres to moral principles. We should support the rules and not want to inflict harm on our fellow citizens. It’s all in our hands. - Letter by Mamatonyane Maila Tshwane
