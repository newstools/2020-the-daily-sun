Dear MizzB I AM a 25-year-old guy and have a very close friend. Lately, I’ve developed weird thoughts about him and it’s getting worse. I find myself fantasising about him sexually. I am wondering if this is normal and if I should tell him. I have never felt this way about any guy before. Dear Brother Feelings can be very confusing and tend to complicate things. Be realistic and consider how well you know him before you decide if you’ll tell him or not. Remember that not everyone is welcoming and understanding about different sexualities. Some people become very angry and cut you off completely, while others accept you. It is encouraged to always speak your mind or express your feelings. But in some cases, it is best to just keep quiet and walk away. Good luck!
