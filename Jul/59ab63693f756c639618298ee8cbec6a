HE smoked zol for many years, and it almost collapsed
his lungs. Khaile Parkies stopped smoking in November and now
does positive work for his community. The 36-year-old from Temba in Hammanskraal, north of
Tshwane, said he and his three friends started delivering medicine to the
elderly and people living with disabilities in April. He works with Thabo Langa (35), Itumeleng Aphane (30)
and Dipuo Skosana (26). “This is a good initiative to help the elderly and
those who’re living with disabilities as they struggle to do it themselves,” he
said. Khaile said they help five people. “We formed an organisation called Yenzokuhle Social
Assistance for the Elderly and Disabled in April. “We’ll continue to help the elderly and people living
with disabilities even after Covid-19.” They also helped people queue for check-ups at Temba
Clinic. “We’re doing it for free and out of love,” he said. Gogo Lettie Matlatse (73) said the initiative helped
her a lot. She never had to worry about fetching medicine from
the clinic. “We’re proud of them because they’re also taking us to
the clinic for free,” she said.
