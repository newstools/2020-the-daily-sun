IT'S all systems go for PSL referees to take to the field and officiate. That is what Safa is saying after referees underwent the compulsory Covid-19 tests in Joburg on Friday. The referees assembled in camp on Thursday as they gear up for the resumption of the PSL season, which has been delayed due to the spread of the coronavirus in the world. And the federation governing football in the country has indicated that they are prepared to allow the PSL to resume on 1 August, kicking aside the PSL's suggested 18 July date. But the National Soccer League (NSL) extra-Ordinary BoG meeting, which was to give answers to the whole confusion, was postponed to Monday, 27 July, throwing all plans to the water. The postponement is due to the untimely death of chairman Irvin Khoza's wife on Thursday morning. Now it remains a mystery whether the Premiership will resume on 1 August as it was initially suggested. And teams are currently in camp training as they wait for word from the PSL on when they should report to the bio-bubble camp in Gauteng. PSL referees underwent physical and psychometric tests on Thursday and were also screened for Covid, and they seem to be ready to officiate on 1 August.
