KAIZER Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama remains optimistic that he will be able to continue where he left off when the Absa Premiership resumes. PSL teams returned to training this week ahead of a proposed restart of league action. New training protocols have been put in place to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.Before the lockdown, Manyama was on blistering form carrying his side as they are sitting at the top of the table four points ahead of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns. “I don’t think I’ve lost the spark. I just need a few runs and touches on the ball to warm up and should be ready to compete.” Manyama told the club website. Chiefs returned to training on Monday after over 100 days without action due to coronavirus which saw all sporting activities being suspended in March. “Football is in my blood,” Manyama said after completing his training session with the team. He added: “It is refreshing to see my teammates albeit still maintaining a safe distancing. The body feels okay so far because we kept working hard under lockdown, there is no problem on that one. “Training on the pitch will tell as we go along. The set-up is new to us, but we have to get used to it” “It felt good to run through a few exercises. I look forward to more of these sessions. The touches are still good though. You saw me hitting the net a couple of times, right?” He concluded:“We just need to stay safe and follow the protocols. Everyone needs to stay safe so that when things get back, we are ready to do things together.”
