THERE is no doubt in Lungi Ngidi’s mind that he fully deserves his major accolades. The Proteas fast bowler edged Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma to the T20 and ODI Cricket of the Year awards at the recent ceremony. It hasn’t been easy picking many positives from the year in which the national cricket team plunged into new depths, following a series of poor results. But amid the rubble some positives emerged, with the individual brilliance of Ngidi, De Kock and Bavuma among a few. “The award came as a bit of a surprise,” said Ngidi. “I’d seen guys like Quiny and Temba perform very well with the bat. I knew it was a well contested category. But when I sat and thought about my performances, it started to sink in that maybe I did deserve it. “There a few performances I put in that I was very proud of, bowling in certain positions we probably weren’t expected to win a game from there.” Ngidi has taken 53 wickets to date in ODIs, but it is the famous nine he took against Australia in March which remains the highlight. He has seen little cricket action since then, owing to the national lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has managed to go out to the nets, being part of the 45-man national squad which began training last week under eased lockdown regulations. However, it hasn’t been all fun. “It is a bit of a mess to be honest at the moment, ” Ngidi said with a chuckle. “It is a bit difficult and different. We basically have to book sessions now. We will be done and then another group comes in. As the bowlers, we each have our own net, our own balls. There’s no touching and hardly any communication as well. Before we go to the gym, we need to let them know as they have to sanitise the area. It’s a whole process before you can actually bowl a cricket ball.”
