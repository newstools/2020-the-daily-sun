Cybersex, erotic tech and virtual intimacy are on the rise during the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic has affected a lot of people's intimate relationships because of social distancing and lockdown, and many have resorted to being sexual through technology. Isolation has also hit some relationships hard as we have seen the reports on the rise of divorces. People across the world have found creative ways to connect sexually and intimately online. A recent online survey found that a majority of participants in a sample of 1 559 adults reported a decline in the quality of their sex lives (43.5 percent) during the Covid-19 pandemic, while only a minority reported improvements (13.6 percent) and (20.3 percent) added at least one new activity to their sex life, such as a new sexual position, incorporating pornography or engaging in cybersex. Sex tech is a billion-dollar industry that builds a wide range of products for interactive, immersive and connected erotic experiences. Sex tech includes virtual, augmented and mixed reality, “teledildonics,” dating applications and platforms, online erotic games and artificial erotic agents (or erobots) such as sex robots, virtual partners or erotic chatbots. Virtual sex is a safer way to fulfill our sexual and emotional needs in times of lockdown.
