The only meaningful legacy in defining Mandela Day celebrations is when big corporates have an intake of young people offering six months’ training. This empowers them! We need to stop cleaning up schools or painting old-age homes. This should no longer be tolerated – it makes no material difference. We no longer want to be treated like charity cases. We want to be skilled, empowered and able to look for work or start up enterprises. Mandela celebrations should be developmental and not treat the poor as charity. We want to see banking institutions making available funds for youth who want to start businesses. Our hope for Mandela Month is to be included in the economy. We’re no longer looking for hand-outs, but employment and empowerment. It’s either that or nothing. Madiba would have expected more than just groceries and paint. Ntlhaveni block D
