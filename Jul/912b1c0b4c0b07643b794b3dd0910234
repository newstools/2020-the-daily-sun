 A
POLICE highway patrol task team’s operation has yielded positive results. This
after 246 boxes of various assortments of liquor, illicit cigarettes and a car
were confiscated in and around the Polokwane CBD and along the N1 north in
Limpopo following a tip-off from residents. Seven
suspects aged between 24 and 45 were arrested for possession of illicit
cigarettes and contravention of the Disaster Management Act and Immigration
Act. Limpopo
police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they received information about
someone selling illicit cigarettes in the Polokwane CBD. “On
arrival, a 45-year-old man was found in possession of nine cartons of illicit
cigarettes. He was arrested for selling and having illicit cigarettes,
contravention of the Disaster Management Act and Immigration Act as he failed
to produce relevant documents to be in the country,” he said. Ngoepe
told Daily Sun the six other suspects were arrested along the N1 when a Toyota
Corolla with six occupants was pulled off the road and searched. “A
load of liquor and illicit cigarettes were discovered, and the suspects were
immediately arrested for possession of illicit cigarettes, contravention of the
Disaster Management Act and Immigration Act as they also failed to produce the
relevant documents to be in Mzansi. “During
these operations 246 boxes of various assortments of liquor, illicit cigarettes
and one Toyota Corolla were confiscated,” said Ngoepe. The
suspects will appear before the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon. Provincial
Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba applauded the team for
their continuous efforts to fight crimes across the province.
