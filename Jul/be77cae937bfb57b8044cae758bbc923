AFTER Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng made his comment regarding his love for Israel, concerns were raised by the rulling party African National Congress (ANC).  The Justice commented that he was under an obligation as a Christian to love Israel and to pray for peace. The concerns raised by government was that Chief Justice Mogoeng is not in the position to comment in the manner that he did about Israel. But some of the Christians across the country fully support Chief Justice Mogoeng and they have publicly revealved that they are 100% behind him. They said that they dont see anything wrong what he did. Today the Christians enganged in a virtual protest organised by the South African Friends of  Israel where they stated clearly that they are behind Justice Mogoeng as he too is a South African citizen who has a right to say what he feels. The virtual protest on Zoom had a panel of Christians who shared their views about this matter. Pastor Barry Isaacs officially opened the virtual protest and then he introduced the speakers. The Congress of the people (Cope) Papi Kganare was the first speaker. Papi said Mogoeng has a right to freedom of expression. "He had a right to express his view. He shouldn't be forced to withdraw his view. Its wrong for anyone to intimidate him," he said. Another speaker was Prince Zwelakhe Mthethwa. Mthethwa said that he also supports Justice Mogoeng in expressing his belief. Appostle Mary Stephens said:"Our constitution allows all South Africans a freedom of religion so does Justice Mogeong, he also has a right to show his religion." She said Christians religion is based on Israel. Chris Eden said Justice Mogoeng is a beakon of hope for South Africans. "But the government want to bully and silent him," she said. However, due to technical difficulties other speakers such as Phakama Shembe couldn't get through to speak and the virtual ended.
