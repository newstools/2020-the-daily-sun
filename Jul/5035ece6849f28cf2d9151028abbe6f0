DJ SBU is lending a helping hand to small businesses. The media personality and businessman partnered with 3Sixty Global Solutions Group CEO, Khandani Msibi, to give 20 black-owned businesses R20 000 each. Together they started the 3Sixty Business Saver Competition. Sbu told Daily Sun he put Msibi on the spot and asked him to help a few businesses that have been hit hard by Covid-19. “Mr Msibi was on my podcast, The Hustlers Corner. His business was small when he started and he is now a business mogul. So I challenged him to help one or two businesses. By the end of the show, he had pledged R400 000 to help 20 businesses,” said Sbu. He said they chose black-owned businesses as they were hit the hardest. Msibi said: “It’s a difficult time and I understand that. This is why I thought I should bring excitement and hope to people. My company is also affected, but not as much as small companies.” To enter the competition, the business owner must send a one- to two-minute video on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. In the video, they should introduce their business, explain how they were affected by Covid-19 and how the R20 000 would save it. The terms and conditions are that the business must be running for a minimum of six months, be black-owned and the person must follow 3Sixty Life and The Hustlers Corneron all social media platforms. They should also subscribe to The Hustlers Corner on YouTube and use #3Sixtylife #DJSBU #CovidBizSaver on the post. Winners will be announced every Saturday for the next 10 weeks.
