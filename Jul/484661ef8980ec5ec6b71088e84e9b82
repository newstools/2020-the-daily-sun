  Today was supposed to be the third appearance of
premeditated murderer Muzikayise Malephane. In a turn of events, the Roodepoort Magistrate Court had to
be shut down due to confirmed cases of COVID-19. The 31-year-old is facing a charge of premeditated murder
following the brutal death of an 8 months pregnant Tshegofatso Pule (28). Pule was last seen leaving her Meadowlands home in Soweto to
visit her boyfriend in Florida on June 4. Her body, with a stab wound to the chest, was found the
following day hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort. Her death sparked a national outcry after the continuous
killings of women and children. During his first appearance, the accused said he would be
ignoring his bail application and asked for legal aid. In his second appearance last week Melaphane was accused of
deliberately delaying the court process when he suddenly requested for private
representation after saying he couldn't afford it.
