Struggling to make payments each month?
You can apply for debt counselling! Your debt repayments will be more
affordable, and you will be able to pay your monthly living expenses. How it works 1.       You
meet with a debt counsellor who draws up a payment plan. 2.       The
plan allocates money to paying off your debt and meeting your daily living
expenses. 3.       A small
fee may be charged for the first meeting. 4.       Once
approved, you enter debt counselling, also known as debt review, and pay a set
amount each month to your debt counsellor. 5.       Debt
counsellors take a small portion for fees and pay the rest to your creditors. 6.       It can
take a few years to clear your debt. 7.       Your
creditors cannot demand payment from you when you are in debt review. Important to know Contact the National Credit Regulator to: Tel: 0860 627 627 Website: www.ncr.org.za
