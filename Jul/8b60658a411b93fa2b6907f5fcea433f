For a wound to heal, it’s necessary to dig deep into its core and draw the pus out. By attacking the source and not symptoms, you get rid of the problem. With gender-based violence rampant in communities, we’ve made little or no stride in fighting this pandemic as we continue to preach to the converted. With men on board as part of the solution, we can do more through men influencing each other to effectively fight this problem. It’s heartening that the men at a squatter camp in Makause in Germiston have established a group to stop violence in the community. They walk the streets, giving a much-needed service of intervening in cases where women and kids need help against abusers. Instead of watching women suffer the men, led by Simphiwe Zwane, intervene. They don’t look away when hearing screams. Domestic abuse isn’t a family problem. It affects communities and the rest of Mzansi. – Editor
