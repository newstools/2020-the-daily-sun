BOOTYLICIOUS actress and media personality Phindile Gwala showed that she is more than just a pretty face when she visited her former high school in an effort to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The 32-year-old, who shot to prominence through her role as Nonny on the popular SABC2 soapie Muvhango, got Princes Langaza Secondary in a frenzy when she donated protective material this past week. “With the situation and the economy looking dire with each passing day, it’s important to me that I’m of service to my community, especially during this pandemic,” Phindile said. She said among the material donated included sanitisers, masks and gloves, coupled with a message of safety and awareness. “It felt great to be at my old school. It brought back all my childhood memories. I wish I could do more but the current situation is disabling. “I want to thank the principal, Mr Mahaye, for granting me the opportunity to give back to my school, which also happens to be one of the best in the area.” She said this initiative struck a cord as she remembered the good old days, and seeing familiar faces. “We’re in this together. We really do need each other and together we’ll get through this.” Phindile promised to continue visiting other schools in the area to offer help and much-needed resources.
