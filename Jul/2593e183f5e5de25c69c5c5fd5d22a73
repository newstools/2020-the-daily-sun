IT’S alleged a fire that burnt down 79 shacks on Saturday was caused by a man cooking pap in the morning for his lunch box. Angry residents of Plastic View, Tshwane, were so furious they wanted to beat him for leaving his paraffin stove unattended, but he managed to flee. The man’s cousin MacDonald Kiyana (43) told Daily Sun he had not seen him since the fire. “We understand the anger of residents because they lost their homes and valuables,” he said.

He said he lost his asylum papers and his wife’s Zimbabwean passport was burnt. He said he bought the car for R25 000 in Joburg and had not insured it. The father of four said: “We don’t have clothes, blankets or food and it’s winter.” His wife Conny Mashaba (34) said life would never be the same again. The affected residents asked for any help, saying most residents were not working. ALSO READ: WIFE SHOT AT FUNERAL!
