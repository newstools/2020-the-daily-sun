A LIMPOPO highway police patrol VW GTI crashed into a car dealership last night in Polokwane, following a car chase. One person was killed and the three cops who were traveling in the GTI are now in Hospital fighting for their live. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they have launched a manhunt for an unknown motorist driving a red Renault sedan, who allegedly caused collisions between three vehicles when he was being chased down by the Highway Patrol Unit at around 8.30pm. He said: "The collision claimed the life of one motorist who smashed into a police vehicle, apparently trying to avoid the collision. The police vehicle in turn smashed into a stationary vehicle on display," Mojapelo said. He has pleaded with anyone with information about the said vehicle to contact the investigating officer, Warrant Officer Philipus Wolhuter at 082 775 4012 or the nearest police station.
