But this time I was booked all over KZN and had to make sure I was safe. “This came at a price, but I’m not complaining because it comes with the job.” She also had to cancel an outfit. “I had already paid R15 000 for my outfit and was about to pay the remaining R8 000. “But it’s not a train smash. I’m not going to ask for a refund from Ngcebo. Instead I’m going to put the money as deposit for next year’s race.” She’d prepared two outfits.
