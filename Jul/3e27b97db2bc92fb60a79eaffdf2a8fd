COPS are serious about fighting illegal mining. And they’re continuing to seize the equipment used by zama zamas. On Wednesday, cops confiscated several phendukas and stands, generators, as well as other equipment used by illegal miners. The raid was conducted by Springs police, the defence force and Ekurhuleni Metro police. Police said illegal mining operations would continue until they stopped it. They warned zama zamas to respect the law. The first raid was conducted in Struisbult and the second one in Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni. Residents of Everest squatter camp said they were happy cops’ efforts were bearing fruit. “We used to duck bullets here when these zama zamas fought over gold dust,” said a resident. Said another resident:’ “We can see the illegal miners are slowly becoming discouraged as the cops are not giving them a break.” Last year, national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole announced that a new unit aimed at fighting illegal mining would be formed.
