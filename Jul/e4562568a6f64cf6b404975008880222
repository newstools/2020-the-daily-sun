We all know that Somizi loves the finer things and he sure can afford them. Yesterday the cook and choreographer took to Instagram to tell his fans that he got his fist ever botox. A doctor can be seen injecting a small needle resembling a botox syringe into Somizi's eyebrows. "It's been long overdue... and if u know me u know my struggles with my skin... and I must say I see a huge improvement... thanks to @drkanaris I even did my first botox ever... loved it... so don't be shy to hit her up for anything skin related," Somizi cited on his caption.
