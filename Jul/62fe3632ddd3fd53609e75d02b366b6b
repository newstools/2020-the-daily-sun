WHILE tough engagements between the Basic Education Department and teachersâ€™ unions over the closure of schools until the off-peak of Coronavirus are underway. Parents are pleased with the decision by the Limpopo Education Department to halt the return of Grade 10 and Grade 3 pupils to schools. The Department made a u-turn on Sunday evening on the return of more pupils to classes Monday, as it was previously announced in the amended directions published in the Government Gazette by Minister Angie Motshekga. Martha Kutumela (35) from Ga-Ramphele village outside Polokwane in Limpopo said she really accepts the decision to reverse the decision because the more pupils getting back to school will have an impact and overwhelm safety systems at the school. "The infection rate is really high now in our province and teachers including learners are testing positive for this invisible disease. So, having more learners there it's a risk. Most schools don't have enough classrooms for pupils to exercise physical distancing during lessons." She said. Another parent Lucia Kubjana (49) added that they have been helping their children to study since Lockdown was implemented in March through the education TV and radio channels. "We have teachers from our local schools who always assist them through WhatsApp whenever there are difficulties and hope that in the end we will make it and our children also pass to the next grades," She told Daily Sun. Tidimalo Chuene the spokeswoman for Limpopo Education Department says after careful consideration of all key variables in phasing back more learners, they decided to suspend the return of these two grades and further directives on this decision will be communicated in due course. "This decision does not affect arrangements that are already in place for learners who benefit from the National School Nutrition Programme. All eligible learners will continue to access their meals at school," Chuene added.
