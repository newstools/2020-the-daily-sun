RUBBISH collection in Umlazi, south of Durban, could be disrupted again after workers threatened to go on strike. Workers said the eThekwini Municipality told them to get tested for Covid-19 yesterday after some of their colleagues were found to be positive. Speaking to Daily Sun earliertoday, angry workers said they’d down tools if the municipality didn’t come and test them for free. “We’re the lowest paid workers in the municipality, so where do they think we’ll find money to pay for corona tests. It’s the middle of the month, so we don’t have money,” said one worker. She said she’d gone to one testing laboratory and was told to pay R1 000, which she couldn’t afford. The had been panic among staff on whether they should continue working and get infected or go on strike. The municipality’s infrastructure head councillor, Thanduxolo Sabelo, said it was standard procedure for workers to pay for their own tests. Samwu provincial secretary Nokubonga Dinga said the union wasn’t aware the municipalities no longer paid for tests. She said workers couldn’t afford it. If workers do go on strike, it will be for the second time within a month. They returned to work just three weeks ago after downing tools, demanding that 75 of them be permanently employed. They returned to work after they were told their contract would be extended for three more months. They were also promised they’d be prioritised for full-time employment when posts became available.
