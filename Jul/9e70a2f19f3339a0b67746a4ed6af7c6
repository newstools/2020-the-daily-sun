Makamu is happy to be alive and thanks God for his recovery. Last week
Daily Sun reported on Israel Makamu testing positive for covid-19. He told
Daily Sun that he had severe symptoms and at some point, he had to be rushed to
the hospital. He again
urged people to stay safe and educate themselves about this virus. "It's
not a joke and you shouldn't wait till you have it to start being concerned
about it. It's a deadly disease and can take your life in a blink of an
eye," said Makamu. Bishop also
told Daily Sun that he never thought he'd catch this virus. "I
always thought it wonâ€™t happen to me. I never had my mask because I thought it
caused heat on my face but now, I wear a double shield and mask. I'm not taking
any chances," he said. "Ignorant
people like me must be careful. Take it from me, I know," he added. Makamu gave
thanks to everyone who's given him support during this hard time.
