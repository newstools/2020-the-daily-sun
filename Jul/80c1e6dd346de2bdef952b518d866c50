The missing police officer, Constable Mildred Silowe was
found alive but drugged and robbed. The 26-year-old was reported as missing by her sister, at
the Bushbuckridge Cop Shop on Sunday. Constable Silowe from Boiketlo Village, Casteel, had left
home on Sunday afternoon to travel back to work in Lydenburg using public
transport. Upon arriving at Bushbuckridge Shopping Complex where she was to
catch a second taxi to Lydenburg, she was offered a lift by an unknown man and
immediately informed her sister. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said moments
later, her sister called to check up on her several times but failed to reach
her. "She also called Constable Silowe's roommate who confirmed
that she had not arrived. The sister then grew worried after failed attempts to
trace her and reported the matter to the police who immediately launched a
search," said Hlathi. Hlathi said Silowe was found around Calcutta area on
Monday evening next to a set of robots. "She told police that she recalls being covered with
a cloth on her face by one of the men in the car that had offered her a lift
back to Lydenburg, where she became unconscious thereafter. She also relayed
that she later regained consciousness only to find she had been ditched in the
bushes with her hands and feet tight with ropes and had been robbed of all her
belongings. She then managed to roll to a road nearby where she was spotted by
a passing ambulance," he said. "The police were summoned immediately and the victim
was then taken to hospital for medical treatment and has since been
discharged." Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma
expressed relief that Constable Silowe has been found alive and has ordered an
investigation into this matter. Anyone with information that may assist the police with
their investigation is requested to contact Detective Warrant Officer Nicol
Setwane at 0729068621.
