WE hope SunReaders have been enjoying walking with Stoan Seate as he reaches out to Mzansi on behalf of SunPower. We started the Sun’Ceda journey just before lockdown began and have seen how the pandemic affects lives.

This is a story many in SunLand will relate to as many families find themselves struggling when it comes to income.
