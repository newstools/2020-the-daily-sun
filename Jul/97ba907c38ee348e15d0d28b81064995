NELSON Mandela Bay acting mayor believes the city should return to strict lockdown measures to control rising infection rates during winter. Thsonono Buyeye’s concerns comes as the number of Covid-19 infections in the city climbed significantly in recent days. Nelson Mandela Bay has recorded 7 514 positive cases as at 29 June. Buyeye said: “It’s alarming that infections in Motherwell had now surpassed the 1 000 mark, recording a total of 1 061. Other hot spots include Uitenhage, which recorded 564 cases, KwaNobuhle with 580 and KwaZakhele with 551. The increasing numbers won’t change. There is nothing more we can request from the residents that we have not requested already. That’s why we are of the view that in the metro, a lockdown would assist us in controlling the virus.” He said hospitals were not coping, police stations and clinics often close because of infections and beds are running out in health facilities. Covid-19 disaster management forum chairman Shane Brown said: “While the city had measures in place to assist the hospitals, there was a fear of hospital beds running out. You can’t stop the spread of the virus if people are moving around. People are moving around and socialising without wearing masks, which is the most critical protective gear to fight the virus,” he said. “We really fear a situation where we run out of beds to help patients and run out of transport to get them to the facilities. While some people have their own transport, the majority does not have and they can’t use public transport as they are positive cases.”
