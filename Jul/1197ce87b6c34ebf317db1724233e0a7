Ellen Mashatile, the wife of African National Congress treasurer-general Paul Mashatile, has died. A double tragedy for the ANC general who buried his mother, Nomvula Mashatile (82) a week ago. In a statement released on Sunday, the ANC said Manzi Mashatile passed away after a long illness. “The organisation is found wanting of appropriate words to express its words of comfort. “We call on the public to give the family privacy during these difficult times. As expected, all measures necessary in compliance with COVID-19 regulations will be observed,” ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said.

Meanwhile, the Congress of the People (COPE) has expressed its condolences to the Mashatile family. “Whilst death does not discriminate, but every time it affects those close to us, we are never ready for it. “That’s why we say to Cde Paul Mashatile, be strong. We know your pain and we know that this pain is permanent and never pass. We wish you strength and fortitude to go through this,” COPE General Secretary Papi Kganare said in a statement.
