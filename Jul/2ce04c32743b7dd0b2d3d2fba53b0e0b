Former Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane has open up about the financial struggles footballers face after retiring. Speaking of his own financial experiences despite still playing at the age of 38, Yeye, as he is fondly known, says he regrets not saving during the early stages of his career. "Even though I had some responsibilities in my family and didn't earn a lot when I first started, I wish that I had saved and put some money aside because 10 years later, having that money would have made a difference today," said Letsholonyane, who was speaking alongside former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Simba Marumo at the Nedbank Football and Finance Summit.Letsholonyane, who is the co-founder of the Soweto based club ShaYe Lounge, admits that running a business hasn't been easy and even more so now during the coronavirus pandemic. "One of the reasons why we wanted to venture into business was to break the chain of footballers struggling post their playing days," said the Highlands Park star."It has been a challenge because we may be big names in the football world, but we are still new to the world of business."It's a completely different industry and we are still learning and growing, especially now with the pandemic. I believe that it’s part of life, our aim is to become better businessmen and role models."Meanwhile, Marumo says that footballers have continued the trend of struggling financially after hanging up their boots. He then further advises young players to start saving as early as possible in their careers."Footballers from the 60s, 70s and 80s have repeated the same financial mistakes over the years,” he said."That is why I decided to write a book which speaks to not only making money but managing and keeping it."I realised quickly from a young age that football is a short career, you can only play for five to 10 years or 15 if you are lucky."Marumo added: "Football stops when your life actually begins where you have a wife, kids and other responsibilities."So, one of the things I did to maintain my life after football was to buy land and build a property that generates money monthly. I would like to say to players, start now and buy assets because football money does not last."
