She is still recurring in and out of the story," she said. Sumaya also told Sowetan that Skeem Saam's shooting schedule is hectic and they do not want to wear her out. “She is at a very sensitive age so she needs as much rest, care and comfort as possible. The decision was made before lockdown, so I can't really say that Covid-19 is the sole reason,” she said.
