Our bodies communicate with us in mysterious ways and can help us see that we have underlying health issues through signs. Your lips can also reveal underlying health issues from liver disease to herpes and this is according to experts. Wellness expert Hari Simran says the colour, shape and texture of your lips can reveal signs of health issues that you might be ignoring or might not know that it is there. Simran said the upper lip represents the heart, lungs, liver, stomach and the thyroid while the lower lip can reflect issues in the intestines. Here are the eight lip symptoms Hari says you should be on the lookout for: 1. Wrinkles on the upper lip - Physical and mental tension can cause wrinkles, as can smoking. 2. Chapped and dry lips - Lips can become dry and chapped when you don’t have enough water in the body. 3. Bumps - Cold sores or blisters can sometimes appear in the winter months and usually heal on their own or with over the counter creams but they can also be a result of herpes. 4. Cracks on the edges -  If you drool in your sleep or wear a retainer then bacteria can accumulate around your mouth and cause infection. 5. Discolouration - If your lips have changed colour then you may have severe liver issues. Blue lips can indicate a lack of oxygen to the body and similar discolouration can be seen in fingers and toes. If your lips have gone a shade lighter and look pale then you might have anaemia, vitamin deficiencies or low blood sugar.
