PRASA yesterday introduced limited passenger rail services after train operations stopped in March. Spokesman Makhosini Mgitywa said: “As Prasa, we’ll strictly adhere to Covid-19 hygiene protocols, which include social distancing on platforms and on trains. “Wearing of face masks covering the mouth and nose will be strictly enforced.” He said the rail agency would slowly introduce a limited service nationally. Mgitywa said the morning peak service between Pienaarspoort and Pretoria Station will be between 5am and 9am, and the afternoon peak service between 3pm and 7pm. TWEET LANDS MODEL IN JAIL! The same times will apply in the Western Cape between Cape Town and Retreat Station. According to Mgitywa, the Eastern Cape will operate the East London and Port Elizabeth lines. Morning peak times will be between 5am and 8am, and afternoon peak times between 3.30pm and 6.40pm. “We encourage commuters to arrive at their stations earlier than usual to accommodate time for screening and hand sanitisation on the premises,” said Mgitywa. “No informal traders will be allowed to operate outside the station gate, inside the station, on the platforms and on trains.”  Mgitywa said there’d be no eating or drinking allowed at the stations or trains. “Commuters exhibiting symptoms associated with Covid-19 won’t be allowed inside stations and will be provided with a holding facility where health authorities will attend to them,” he said. He urged commuters not to travel if they weren’t feeling well and to seek medical advice. Prasa would deep-clean all operational trains and high-volume areas at the stations on a continuous basis. Mgitywa encouraged commuters to observe social distancing markings on trains, next to the ticket office and on platforms.
