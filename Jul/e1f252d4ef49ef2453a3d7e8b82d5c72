I’VE been a loyal reader of Sunday Sun since it was launched. My Sundays have never been complete without my favourite tabloid. The news of Sunday Sun closing shop at the end of July were disturbing when I first heard them. But I understand why the tough call was made. Now, I look back at my relationship with this Sunday tabloid, and it’s full of good stories. The newspaper may close down due to financial headship, but its legacy will live forever. I must say, I became a man of integrity because of the good advice I grew up reading in Sunday Sun. It really shaped the kind of husband and father I became. Even at my workplace and in public meetings, I’m able to raise burning issues and debate them with ease, thanks to my years of reading your tabloid. I’m so grateful that Sunday Sun gave its readers a platform to express their views through letters. Not only did I enjoy reading other readers’ letters, I also enjoyed being a regular feature on the letters’ page. I want to thank everyone who contributed to making Sunday Sun the big brand it’s become. To my fellow readers, I say all is not lost. Let’s keep reading Daily Sun. As for Sunday Sun, thank you for having been a positive friend in my life. Don’t go for good. Come back whenever possible.
