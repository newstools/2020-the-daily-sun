Songbird Shashl has released a new single, Heart to Heart. This is an upward path for the talented singer, whose real name is Ashleigh Moyo. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “Heart to Heart came about after watching a short Nigerian film about a married man who’s dating a younger girl. “The song warns young girls that when the two of you break up, the man has a family he’ll go to and you’ll be lonely.” The Zimbabwean-born singer said her music is usually inspired by her life. “The music I make is mostly inspired by real life situations I’ve either been in or seen first-hand.” “Musically, I don’t really look up to anyone because I try to be as authentic as I can. This is because when I sing I tell my own story and no other artist can tell it the way I can.” Since breaking into the music scene, Shashl said, things hadn’t been easy. “It hasn’t been an easy journey at all, especially in the beginning,” she said. “By the time I’d release a song everyone would already be on a new vibe. “But apart from that, it was generally just horrible being a female artist. Most people in the industry are men. “But I’m also thankful that I overcame everything and learnt how to carry and address myself in certain situations.” Shashl told SunBuzz the coronavirus has slowed down things for her. “I’m working on an album, but due to the pandemic a lot slowed down,” she said. Heart to Heart is available on all digital platforms.
