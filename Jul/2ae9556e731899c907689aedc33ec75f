Comedian and talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi are allegedly headed for a divorce. According to Micky, a source said Portia who stars in Scandal (The Fixer) filed for the divorce. She also stands to get some of Ellen's wealth. “Ellen’s estimated to be worth $500 million, and since they’ve been married for more than ten years in California and to my knowledge don’t have a prenup, Portia will be entitled to be a bigger piece of the pie than if they had split a few years ago. It could be one way for Portia to get even with Ellen for putting her through hell for so long,” the source said.
