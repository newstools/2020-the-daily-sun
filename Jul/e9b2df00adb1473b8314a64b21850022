Award-winning actress Jo-Anne Reyneke has joined Generations: The Legacy. The talented actress will be playing the smart, charming and ambitious Refilwe Zungu, who is the stepdaughter of Walter Nkaba, played by Nimrod Nkosi. Her biological father, Daniel Zungu, was a struggle stalwart who died 10 years ago, leaving her a fortune and over the years, Nkaba has unashamedly used her for his own political agendas. Refilwe is comfortable around alpha males â€“ she grew up around them. So when Nkaba introduces her to one of his powerful associates, she knows exactly how to hold her own, leaving him weak at the knees. Jo-Anne is set to make her debut in August.
