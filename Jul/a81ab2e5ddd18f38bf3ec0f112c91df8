BIDVEST Wits will not be playing like a team that is on the brink of being defunct when the currently suspended Absa Premiership eventually resumes next month. This is according to head coach Gavin Hunt’s assistant, Paul Johnstone, who insists the Clever Boys still have a lot to play for this season. The Milpark-based side will cease to exist at the end of the season after the club’s top flight status was sold to the owners of GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. Speaking on his club’s website, Johnstone said he expects Wits’ final nine matches of the season will be very emotional for everyone involved, especially the players. However, he has promised that the effort will be there for everyone to see as the PSL’s oldest club looks to wrap up their final campaign on a high. “From a playing style, nothing is going to change. We are who we are and Gavin Hunt is who he is,” said Johnstone. “There will be a lot of emotion out there that is for sure. I think there will be a lot of emotion from our guys, just given the fact of what everyone has heard about and what is potentially happening to the club. “It is crazy to think of, but all I can say is that there will be a hell of a lot of emotion out there and I hope the emotion is used in the best possible manner.” Wits are also still in the Nedbank Cup and will face Mamelodi Sundowns in the semi-final of the lucrative cup competition. Johnstone said the Students are doing their best to ensure that they are in top shape when the season resumes and have been building up their fitness since their return to training. “It is very tough to get the guys fully prepared, yes they have been doing their own bits of training at home but under restricted circumstances,” added Johnstone. “It is one thing training on your own, but a complete other ball game when playing against another team. Step by step, one day at a time and all we can do is see where we are at come that first day of competition.”
