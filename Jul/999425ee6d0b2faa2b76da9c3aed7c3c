FOLLOWING the Caf executive meeting last week which established the Women’s Caf Champions League in 2021, SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan has called on Fifa to also implement a Fifa Club World Cup for women. Caf said the Women’s Champions League’s format and dates will be communicated in due course. The format is likely to be similar to the men’s Caf Champions League which is made up of league winners and runners up of 55 member associations in Africa. Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies, who won this year’s inaugural Sasol National League, are set to represent Mzansi. This Champions League decision came after a major disappointment for women’s football in Africa. The flagship Africa Cup of Nations (AWCON) scheduled for this year was cancelled due to the fact that no host could be found. Jordaan, who is a Caf vice-president, applauded the Women’s Champions League as a great initiative and said Fifa should not waste time to create Fifa Club Women’s World Cup. “My own view is that we must not take the approach of gradualism that in five years, we will have this. The world will leave us behind,” said Jordaan in a Zoom meeting organised by Maximal Training Coaches. “I think it was a very progressive decision to start the women’s Champions League and now we just need to put the details and make sure there’s a compliance and the best teams on the continent get the broadcasts so that we can see the quality of women’s club football on the continent. “The next step of course is a Club World Cup for women. And Fifa must not wait for too long to have a Club World Cup for women.” The Fifa Club World Cup tournament for men is an annual Fifa event. It involves seven teams from the AFC Champions League (Asia), Caf Champions League (Africa), Concacaf Champions League (North America), Copa Libertadores (South America), OFC Champions League (Oceania) and Uefa Champions League (Europe), along with the host nation’s champions.
