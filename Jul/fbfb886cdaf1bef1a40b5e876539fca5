The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg
has sentenced a man from Ivory Park to two life sentences for double rapes and
additional 10 years for two counts of kidnappings. The Ivory Park spokesman, Captain Bernard
Matimulane told Daily Sun that the 32 year old Cliff Tshepo Mathabathe was
arrested in January 2019 in connection with a rape case which took place in
Ivory Park’s Extension Three. "During further investigations, it was
established through DNA that Mathabathe was responsible for another rape
incident which he committed in Tembisa as far back as 2011," said
Matimulane. He said during his his trial, Cliff applied
for bail which was denied owing to the fact that he was a danger to the
community and that one of his victims would have seen him, thus traumatising
her in the process. The Acting Station Commander of the Ivory Park
SAPS, Colonel Baba Mpotoane, has welcomed this sentence. “Mathabathe has shown that he was not about to
stop his evil and wayward ways, and the only avenue to stop him was this
lengthy jail sentence,” said Mpotoane. He also congratulated the
investigating officer, Detective Constable Edmond Lebopo, whose meticulous
attention to detail put Cliff behind bars.
