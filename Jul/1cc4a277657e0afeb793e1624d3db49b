THE 2019-20 Absa Premiership will resume on the weekend of 8 August and end in the first weekend of September, according to PSL chairman Irvin Khoza. The much delayed season will start with the Nedbank Cup semi-finals on the Saturday, 8 August before Premiership games at venues to be revealed by the league later on. The league has been at loggerheads with Safa over the resumption of football after it was halted by Covid-19 in March. It will require clubs 42 days to complete the season, which will end with Nedbank Cup in the second week of September.  Safa has made things easy for the PSL by making referees available, and all seems to be well and clubs ready to kick the ball again. PSL and GladAfrica Championship clubs are expected in the bio-bubble in Gauteng on 7 August before matches resume the following day. Addressing a press briefing on Monday afternoon, Khoza said clubs unanimously agreed to resume the season, and sponsors have been made aware of the decision. Nedbank Cup semifinalists - Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits, Bloemfontein Celtic and Baroka FC - will be the first to go into the bio-bubble on 7 August.  “It is all systems go for the 8th of August. Nedbank Cup semifinals teams will be the first in the bubble. All the other teams will be required to be in the bubble by 11 August,” said Khoza. “We have squeezed the fixtures as best as we can to make we mitigate against any pressing issues which might come up.“Khoza, however, emphasised the importance of compliance, which will be key to the whole exercise. “If you don’t comply before going into the bubble, you are out,” he said. “You must be tested 48-hours before you go into the bubble. Clubs will be allowed a maximum of 50 members, taking into account the possibility of infections.“ There will be be fixtures almost everyday, including the GladAfrica Championship.”Plans for the new season will also come under discussions soon.
