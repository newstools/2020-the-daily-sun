AFTER several
delays in the bail application hearing of the six suspects linked in the
kidnapping and alleged murder of the Hambanathi teen they will appear at the
Verulam Magistrate Court today. On Friday
they were brought to court and the matter was postponed to today, due to the
senior prosecutor Kirsen Shah not being available in court. These
suspects allegedly kidnapped and assaulted Bobo to death after they accused him
of stealing 27 cases of alcohol from Magagula tavern in Hambanathi. A video of
Bobo seen badly assaulted which circulated on social media touched a lot of
people across the country. Bobo went
missing on 28 April. His family was informed that Bobo was being beaten at the
Magagula tavern. When they went to look for him, they were told by the suspects
that he had escaped. Bobo's
family then went to report to the Tongaat police and when they didn't get help,
they then contacted the provincial detectives who then after took over the
matter. As the
matter was taken by the provincial detectives the six suspects were arrested on
7 May and charged with kidnapping. The
following day human remains were found in a dam. A
postmortem test had to be done to determine that those human remains found were
of Bobo. But as the
family was still waiting for postmortem results, angry Hambanathi residents who
were convinced that the human remains are that of Bobo, gathered and burnt down
the Magagula tavern where Bobo was beaten in. A senior
cop from Tongaat police station was accused of being involved in the killing of
Bobo. After a few
days that senior cop shot himself to death with a service gun in the police
van. This cop
was accused of helping the suspects get rid of Bobo's lifeless body. On 25 May
Bobo's family received the results that the human remains that were found at
the dam were of Bobo. A murder
charge was then added onto the kidnapping charge.
