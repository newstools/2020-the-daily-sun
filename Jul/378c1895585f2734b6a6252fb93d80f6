SOME traditional practitioners and faith healers believe the killing of women and children is making the ancestors angry. Greater Tshwane Traditional Faith Healers district general secretary Mkhulu Kenneth Jeta (47) saidthe murders were disturbing. “Gender-based violence in South Africa disturbs and hurts us when we connect with our ancestors,” said Mkhulu. “This can be solved if government can give us time and space to consult with our ancestors.” “Our ancestors are angry with the evil spirits in the country and causing this hardship and pain.” Mkhulu told Daily Sun the ancestors needed to be respected. He said evil spirits wanted to torment innocent people. If the violence didn’t stop, things would be bad in the future. “As traditional practitioners, we need to sit down with our communities and perform rituals,” he said. Mkhulu said no one wanted to see the anger of the ancestors. He appealed to people not to confuse traditional healers with those practising witchcraft. He warned that people should be careful of izangoma who practise evil deeds. “We’re asking for unity between traditional healers, faith-based organisations and the community to solve the problem,” he said. Mkhulu, an archbishop at the St Moses Spiritual Church of God, said he wasn’t at peace because of the violence. He said the law needed to take its course. Sangoma Happiness Majola (54) agreed with him. “We hope there can be a solution to the gender-based violence in the country, as many lives are being lost right now,” she said.
