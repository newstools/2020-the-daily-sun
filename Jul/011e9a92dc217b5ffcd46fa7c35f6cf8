THE South African Football Players Union Association (SAFPU) are concerned about the safety of players amid the return of football in Mzansi. Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa has already given the green light for training to resume for contact and non-contact sports, and the Premier Soccer League are expected to announce when teams will return to training as they are hoping to complete the 2019-20 Absa Premiership. The PSL season was suspended in mid-March due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Some PSL clubs have started testing players for Covid-19 and their have been 10 confirmed cases. SAFPU vice president Tebogo Monyai has outlined the safety measures that would have to be followed for them to play matches. Monyai says the cases that have been confirmed so far have raised concerns for professional players. “Our members (players) are not saying they don’t want to play, they are concerned about their safety,” Monyai told SunSport. On Tuesday night, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize also announced 6 945 new infections were picked up over the past 24-hour cycle, pushing the cumulative number of cases over the 150, 000 mark. With that, the pandemic is expected to reach its peak in the country. “Overseas it’s summer, Covid-19 is dropping. This side it’s winter, the pandemic is picking up. ” Monyai stated. He added: “On behalf of the players we raised this to the league and to South African Football Association(Safa). Football can only restart when it’s safe to do so. “We asked them to show us a plan that will put our members in a safety mode to return to the field. “Every player needs to be tested before the league start which is exactly what the league approved. It has happened in other clubs. And a couple of players tested positive in clubs like TS Galaxy, University of Pretoria, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.”
