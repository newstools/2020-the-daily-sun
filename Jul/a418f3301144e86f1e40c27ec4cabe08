Dear MizzB I live with my mum and stepfather. Since lockdown started, my stepdad has been touching my bum and making sexual comments. I don’t like this but I don’t know how to tell him to stop. Please help! Dear Sister Parents are supposed to be protectors to their kids and not be the ones causing them pain. Your stepdad has no right to touch your body without your permission and as an adult, he knows that very well. Please talk to your mum or an adult you trust so that they can speak to your stepdad and instruct him to stop what he is doing. That is plain abuse and it needs to stop. Reach out to organisations dealing with abuse, such as child line or social workers. Keep safe, my dear sister. Lifeline Contact Number: 0861322 322
