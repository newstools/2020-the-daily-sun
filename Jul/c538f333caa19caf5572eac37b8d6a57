BLACK Leopards No 1 goalkeeper Jonas Mendes is a worried man! The Guinea-Bissau international is concerned about his fitness as he has not seen action since the beginning of this year because of a serious injury he sustained and the lockdown. And when the 30-year-old recovered from injury, the Absa Premiership was halted due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Now the league is set to restart soon as all PSL team are back at training. But Mendes is worried if he will be ready to help Leopards move away from the bottom of the log and avoid relegation as he is one of the key players coach Allan Clark needs most. “I don’t know if I will be ready, but I am working with a physio,” said Mendes. “I am not training with the rest of the team. I am working on my fitness. “When I recovered (from injury) in March there was the lockdown, and now it means I have not played football for six months.” But if Mendes does not get his fitness back in time, Clark might rely on Mendes’ deputy King Ndlovu, who has also recovered from injury. Leopards’ defence has been a worry for Clark as they made many mistakes that has cost his team many games before the league was suspended due to Covid-19 in March. Mendes who joined the Venda-based side this year said he is happy the league will restart soon as he has been bored while working alone at home without seeing his teammates. Leopards are currently propping up the table with 20 points with six games left. The Venda-based club are in a relegation dogfight with the likes of AmaZulu, Polokwane City and Baroka, who are all sitting on 23 points plus Chippa United who have 26 points.
