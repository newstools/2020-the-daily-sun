THE curfew is back! And this means only essential workers will be allowed in the streets between 9pm and 4am. On Sunday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa said many social ills linked to excessive alcohol consumption took place at night, which has resulted in the return of a curfew. The law states: “Every person is confined to his or her place of residence from 9pm until 4am daily, except where a person has been granted a permit to perform a service permitted under alert level 3 or is attending to a security or medical emergency.” ZINDZI MANDELA HAD THE CORONA VIRUS! But magoshas in Bloemfontein, Free State, said they made money between 9pm and 2am and the curfew would make it harder for them to put food on the table. They said they regarded themselves as essential workers as punani was in high demand during the cold weather. The SunTeam spotted two magoshas just after 9pm. The women said they were prepared to play cat and mouse with the cops. A 28-year-old magosha, who identified herself as Shanine, said: “I arrived in town at 8pm and I’ve had four clients already. DOES YOUR PUNANI AGE AS YOU GET OLDER? “Tonight is very cold and men want punani. Cops are patrolling looking for people they can arrest for being in the streets. “We know they patrol in marked police cars and we can easily spot them from a distance and hide.” Another magosha (33) said they thought many magoshas would be at home in fear of the law. “But they will starve because this curfew won’t put food on the table.”
