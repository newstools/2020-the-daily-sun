HARARE, ZIMBABWETHE authorities have charged a cop for allegedly demanding the resignation of President Emmerson Mnangagwa via a message sent to a WhatsApp group. Milton Murairwa (31) is the latest individual to be hauled before courts for charges bordering on “undermining authority of or insulting the president”. He’s appearing in the Harare Magistrates Court under the Criminal Law Act after he allegedly posted the message on a WhatsApp group for cops stationed at Mbare police camp in the capital city. Fellow cops arrested him. Prosecutors allege Murairwa publicly and unlawfully intended to engender feelings of hostility to 46 members of the Mbare WhatsApp group against Mnangagwa by posting such a message on a social media platform. Magistrate Denis Mangosi released the police officer on bail. Murairwa’s arrest follows that of Shungudzemoyo Kache, another police officer, last month. Mnangagwa and his government are under immense pressure from the public and civil servants to revive the economy. – CAJ NEWS
