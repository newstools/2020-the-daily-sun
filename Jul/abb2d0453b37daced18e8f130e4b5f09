SuperSport United have confirmed the departure of striker Thabo Mnyamane, who left at the expiry of his contract on June 30. The 27-year-old has spent the last four seasons at the club, but seen his first team appearances dwindle in recent campaigns. He was signed from University of Pretoria ahead of the 2016/17 season, and scored 13 goals in 70 domestic appearances for the side. “Thabo is a true professional and I really enjoyed working with him,” SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo said in a statement. “He’s a very humble, respectful and a talented player, it was very unfortunate that injuries hampered his progress at the club. “We will always cherish the moments and success we have shared together and commend him for the contribution he has done for the club on and off the field.” Mnyamane helped SuperSport to the Nedbank Cup title in 2017, as well as two MTN8 triumphs in 2017 and 2019. He is free to join another club, but can only be registered for the start of the 2020/21 season.
