CAPE Umoya United have the money to enter the bio bubble in Gauteng despite being one of the clubs in the GladAfrica Championship that implemented a salary cut of their players. Roger de Sa, who is part of the club management having taken a back seat from coaching in 2018, is ready to do whatever it takes to see the season restart next month. He and his partners bought the club when it was known as Platinum Stars and relocated it to the coast. He said the club got financial support from the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) to mitigate the cost of the bubble. De Sa was relieved to see sanity prevail, when Safa confirmed the PSL can restart in the first week of next month, saying it was the best news for the country and football right now. “I’m a footballer, I want to play. I think most people who are involved in football for the right reason want the games to be played,” said De Sa. “This is not a social event or fitness exercise, we are a professional industry that supports many lives. The players are training and everybody is making their own sacrifices because they want to play. I think 90% of the country wants to see football back. Everyone wants to earn a living.” The decision on whether the PSL will restart or cancel the season will be made in a Board of Governors (BoG) meeting today. “The league gives us the grants. They are the ones that gives us the sponsorship, so we have to do what we have to do,” added De Sa. De Sa, who in his coaching career won the Nedbank Cup in 2010 with Bidvest Wits and the MTN8 in 2015 with Ajax Cape Town, said they were forced to implement the salary cuts because the club was going to collapse. “All that money from the UIF has been received, everything is above board and everything has gone well,” he said. At the time the league was suspended in March, the Maahier Davids coached side were lying 11th on the table on 28 points from 23 games.
