HE CAN’T use his left hand as it is crippled. And his nightmare started after he received a strange call in 2014. Alfred Sibiya (44) from Sizanani in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the stranger who called him spoke in Zulu. “The man asked for my name and surname. After I told him, I collapsed. “I would not have answered the phone if I had known that I’d end up crippled,” he said. Alfred said his left hand didn’t work when he woke up. “People still don’t understand how my arm became crippled. It’s pure witchcraft,” he said. Alfred, who is originally from Nkomazi in Mpumalanga, consulted a sangoma who told him a woman wanted him dead. He said he didn’t hold any grudges and wanted the woman tormenting him to stop.  Alfred said his family survived on their three children’s grants. His wife, Grace Lamula (32), said it was painful to see her husband in such a state.  “My husband used to work hard and provide for us. He now struggles to use his hand. I’d be happy if he could get help,” she said. Sangoma Majoko Hlongwane said someone wanted Alfred to suffer. “This comes from a woman who wants to destroy him. He should consult a powerful sangoma who would heal him and remove the bad spell.”
