RELEGATION threatened Baroka coach Dylan Kerr admitted that four of his players have tested positive for Covid-19. But Kerr told SunSport that he cannot reveal their names. Bakgaga returned to training last Wednesday with the former Black Leopards coach hoping to have all his players back ahead of the restart of the Absa Premiership. “All is good at training despite the sad news that four of my players tested positive and are not with us,” said Kerr. “Our hearts and prayers are with them to recover fast and join us. “During this time and the position we are in you need all your players in the team. “So this is a sort of setback for us. The boys have been working on their own for almost three months, so their fitness is not up to the standard we want.” Added the coach: “We are left with a few games and four players who tested positive will join us later. They will have to work harder to gain the same fitness level with those who are training now.” Baroka are currently in 13th position on the Premiership log with 23 points from six games remaining to end the 2019-20 season, which has been put on hold since mid-March due to the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. However, the Limpopo-based side have the same number of points with AmaZulu and Polokwane City, but Bakgaga have a better goal difference. They are only three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards, and Kerr will need all his best players available to fight relegation. Kerr’s lads are also in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals and will play against Bloemfontein Celtic.
