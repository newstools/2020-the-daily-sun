 DESPITE not being in action for almost five months, most of the Absa Premiership clubs remain optimistic that they will reinstate the form they were in before the league was suspended. The 32 Premier Soccer League teams will return to action on August 8 for the first time since March after the National Soccer League (NSL) Board of Governors (BoG) unanimously agreed to play the campaigns to their conclusion on Monday. Maritzburg United goalkeeper Richard Ofori says there is still plenty of motivation within the side to finish the season on a high. The Team of Choice has had a stellar campaign under coach Eric Tinkler as they currently occupy the fifth spot on the table with 39 points from 24 league matches. “Of course, we can finish the season strong because we are highly motivated after our great start to the season," Ofori told the club website. "We have worked very hard since the start so we shall finish strong. "I feel great that the league has resumed because we missed the action and it also gives the teams a chance to fight for their destiny, like getting promoted from the lower leagues, qualifying for MTN8 and winning the league. “The team is very strong and solid because we have been training individually during the lockdown but we need to start smart because of match fitness and hopefully finish the season in a good position. The Team of Choice will resume the campaign with a tricky encounter against Black Leopards who will be fighting for survival at the FNB Stadium, the home venue for Lidoda Duvha in the Gauteng bio-bubble. Maritzburg will play their three remaining home games at the Lucas Moripe Stadium, against Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits. Dates and times of all the remaining PSL matches are yet to be confirmed. This season Ofori has kept 10 clean sheets and his side have been finding the back of the net with the likes of Tebogo Tlolane, Thabiso Kutumela and Daylon Claasen leading their attack.
