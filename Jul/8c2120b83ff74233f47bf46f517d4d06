THE tourism industry has been hit hard by lockdown and guides say their families are starving. Appealing to government to open their industry, they’ve been picketing on the busy R71 in Hoedspruit, Limpopo, since last Friday. Guide Percy Mabelane said the situation was dire as the R30 million relief fund has been exhausted and they were going hungry. He said they’ve been sitting at home since the end of March. “It’s very hard for us and we wish government could consider opening the industry for us.” He said it was sad that breadwinners were turned into beggars. Percy said government opened places such as Kruger National Park, but that did not help as tourists were not visiting the park. “Locals are not supporting us. We were able to put bread on the table because of tourists,” he said. Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said the tourism industry has registered more than R54 billion losses since the start of lockdown. In May, she announced R30 million has been set aside as a relief fund for registered tour guides and those who were not employed by any company, those who owned their companies, as well as independent contractors. She also announced that some parts of the tourism were opened. But hopeless tour guides are at their wits end as Kubayi-Ngubane announced last month that international tourism would only resume next year.
