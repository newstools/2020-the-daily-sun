IT’S been almost three years since she lost her two children. And it’s still difficult for Veronica Johnson to overcome the tragedy. The 39-year-old from Eersterust in Tshwane lost her kids after a car hit their shack while they were sleeping. Her children, aged a day old and one year six months, succumbed to their injuries in hospital. “The death of my little children changed my life as I’m still suffering,” she said. Veronica told Daily Sun Gauteng Premier David Makhura promised to build her a house when he visited the area in March last year. “He even told me that ANC leaders must help me with food parcels until I found myself accommodation. I’ve never received anything from the ANC. “I’m still stuck and living with the empty promises,” she said. She said no one from the ANC has visited her to check whether she was doing well. “I will not vote ANC because they left me waiting and stranded. “I need the house Makhura promised,” she said. “The ANC should know I’m still waiting for my food parcels.” Veronica said she was being helped by residents. ANC chairman in Eersterust, Clayton Lorie, said Makhura promised to build a house for Veronica. “No house was built because of corrupt elements within the party.”
