UKHOZI FM is honouring its legendary presenter, Winnie “Umafungwase” Mahlangu, by searching for a new female presenter. The station has asked presenters to send demos of not more than three minutes and stand the chance of being the next Mahlangu. Ukhozi has been celebrating its 60th birthday since last month. Mahlangu was the first black woman to be a DJ on Radio Bantu in the dark days of discrimination against women and black people in the 1960s. Radio Zulu later changed its name to Ukhozi FM and has an estimated seven million listeners. Mahlangu’s late colleague, King Edward “KE” Masinga, named her the umafungwase (female first-born), as she was the only woman on radio. She was an Ukhozi FM presenter for 30 years, empowering rural and urban women. Acting station manager Sbongi Ngcobo told Daily Sun women marched for their freedom and Mahlangu fought for women’s rights behind the microphone. “To honour her, we’re looking for a female presenter to be the next Winnie Mahlangu. “She must be a good presenter and represent women with all her talents.” Mahlangu was born in Witbank, Mpumalanga, in 1934 and worked at a primary school in Wattville, Benoni, after getting a teacher’s diploma. When the SABC regionalised the ethnic radio stations, she was transferred to Durban to help start Radio Zulu. She was honoured with the Order of Ikhamanga in silver by former president Jacob Zuma in 2015. Those who want to enter must email demos to winnie@ukhozifm.co.za, and the deadline is at midnight on Wednesday.
