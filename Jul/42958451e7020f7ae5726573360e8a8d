IT is now or never for Philani Zulu at Kaizer Chiefs. Amakhosi recently extended the contract of the versatile former Maritzburg United player’s left-back and winger for another year after his original deal expired last month. The 27-year-old, who can play at left-back or on the wing, managed to get his contract renewed despite seeing little action this season. He has only played three matches in all competitions for the Absa Premiership leaders. His last appearance was when he came off the bench against Stellebosch FC in November. The player’s agent, Saheed Adebayo, said Zulu is loved at Naturena and they see a future with him. “He (Zulu) said he’ll work hard to repay the club’s faith shown to him,” said Adebayo, who previously brought Italian coach Giovani Solinas to mentor Chiefs with little success. Since Zulu arrived at Chiefs in the 2017-18 campaign from the Team of Choice, game time has been at a premium. When Chiefs signed him, they were looking for the long term successor for veteran defender Tsepo Masilela after the former Bafana Bafana left-back was released in 2018. However, Zulu has not managed to assume that role. Chiefs went to their development structures and unearthed Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya and before this season started, they signed Yagan Sasman from Ajax Cape Town. These two youngsters are ahead of Zulu in the pecking order, leaving Zulu sitting in the stands or on the bench. Adebayo said that Zulu’s progress at Chiefs has been hampered by injuries. “This (contract renewal) is good for him because he didn’t play too much last and this season,” said Adebayo. “I know him as a hard working boy and that’s why Chiefs considered and renewed his contract. “I feel there’ll be more improvement than in the past seasons.”
