SOUTH African youngster Sphephelo "Yaya" Sithole made his professional debut for Portuguese top-flight side Belenenses on Wednesday night. Sithola was introduced in the second half of the game when his side played to a 1-1 draw against Sporting Braga. The 21-year-old graduate of the KwaZulu-Natal Academy is highly-rated at his club and sure to get more opportunities next season having starred as a powerful central midfielder for the Under-23 team this campaign. Sithole moved to Portugal in mid-2017, first playing for the juniors of Sporting Lisbon.He then joined to Vitoria Setubal before a switch to Belenenses, who already had compatriot Thibang Phete on their books. Phete signed a two-year contract in January when he moved from Famalicao, and has become an instant regular at Belenenses. Yaya Debuuuuuuuts!!
