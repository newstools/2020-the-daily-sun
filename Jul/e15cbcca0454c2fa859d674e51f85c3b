LEHLOHONOLO Majoro is back at training with AmaZulu FC. Majoro resumed training with the club on Tuesday as they are preparing to complete the 2019-20 Absa Premiership campaign which was halted by the Covid-19 pandemic in March. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker was suspended together with the likes of Michael Morton, Nhlanhla Vilakazi, Thembela Sikhakhane and Jabulani Ncobeni early this year due to disciplinary issues. The duo of Sikhakhane and Ncobeni were called back and returned to train with the team just before the campaign was suspended. Morton and Vilakazi have since parted ways, they are no longer with the club. AmaZulu team manager Qedi Dlamini confirmed that Majoro is back and still part of the team and has a future with the club. Dlamini said: "The team started training on Tuesday and everyone was present. Majoro is our player he is training with the team and still contracted to the club. Dlamini also said the club is yet to decide the future of suspended head coach Jozef Vukusic. Vukusic was placed on 'special leave' with immediate effect, in March after being in-charge of 18 matches. "The management is still looking at that, we will announce once we have concluded. Ayanda Dlamini and Moneeb Josephs will continue to be in-charge of the team until the end of the season.
