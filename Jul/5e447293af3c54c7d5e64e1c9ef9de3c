A Thai man was arrested after dozens of complaints from neighbours whose shoes had gone missing. Theerapat Klaiya has a fetish for flip-flops and was found with 126 pairs that he had stolen from locals in Nonthaburi, central Thailand, police said.  The 24-year-old man was discovered using footage from CCTV set up outside his latest alleged victim’s home. When the man's house was searched, they found a collection of shoes that he claimed he had been collecting for more than two years. He allegedly told officers that after several hours of wearing the flip-flops, he cuddled and kissed them, stripping off and rubbing them on his body, before "having sex with them".
