THIS weekâ€™s been an emotional roller coaster. The entertainment industry has lost two prolific members, whose contribution will never be forgotten. Also, my heart goes out to the man who was dragged out of his shack naked by fools who also call themselves law enforcement officers. Afterall, once a straatmate, always a straatmate. Girl, what do you do with your Isibaya salary if you want the guy to buy you airtime and petrol? Black tax is a thing.
