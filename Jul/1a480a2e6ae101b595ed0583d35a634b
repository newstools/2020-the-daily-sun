THEY will not move unless they are given houses. These are the words of residents from Nana’s Farm near Avalon Cemetery, Soweto. This after they were asked to move from the area to make way for a housing development. Speaking to Daily Sun,the eldest community member madala Eliot Mkhondeleli (101) said he’d been living on the farm for 29 years. “I worked on this farm while the owner was still alive. Before he died, he told us we could live here and we never moved. This is the only home I know and have. I just wish they develop this place without chasing us away,” he said. Eliot said at one point they agreed to move and went to live in a nearby squatter camp. “They moved us to a place knowing the Metro cops will chase us out. I had to hide in a sewer when they started shooting rubber bullets at us, telling us we shouldn’t be there. “We decided to move back to the farm.” The madala’s wife, Grace Chauke (88), said: “We’re too old to be going back and forth. Why can’t they build their houses and allocate us.” But Joburg Housing MMC Mlungisi Mabaso said: “I know nothing about this and suspect that somebody is using the Joburg Social Housing Company to manipulate these innocent people. It’s a lie and whoever is trying to move them is in the wrong because lockdown rules don’t allow any evictions.”
