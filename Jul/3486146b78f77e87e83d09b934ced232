BARELY four months into the tobacco sales ban, one might imagine smokers may have run out of cigarettes. But this isn’t the case! They’re still puffing away and the fong kong skyf market continues to boom, selling illicit cigarettes at higher and higher prices – in some cases as high as R300 per packet of 20! And even cigarettes that are supposed to be only sold in Zambia are now available on kasi streets. These cigarettes travel over 1 600km and are apparently smuggled into the country despite Mzansi’s strict border controls. Smokers in Tembisa in Ekurhuleni and Soweto told Daily Sun they’d resorted to buying horrible cheapie skyfs.

Now we’re more at risk than ever before because of fake brands.” A 41-year-old gwayi lover said: “I spend more money on cigarettes than ever before. “I sometimes buy cigarettes at R150 a pack. This is money that’s meant to feed my kids.” Trade and industry’s Sidwell Medupe said illegal cigarettes sellers must be reported to cops. Tax Justice SA’s Yusuf Abramjee said the situation was tragic. “Criminal gangs are producing billions of cigarettes and flooding the country with them,” he said. “Smaller operators make a lot of money by buying them in neighbouring countries and smuggling them across the border.” At the time of going to print, cops hadn’t responded on what measures they’d taken to curb this crime. Home Affairs’ Thabo Mokgola said his department regulated entry and exit of people across borders.
