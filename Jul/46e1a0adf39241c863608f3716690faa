 GRADE R pupils were full of joy when they got back to school in
Mangaung primary school in Batho. The school said they will take half of the pupils and those who
attended on Monday will not go to school again on Tuesday. The one group will be at school on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays
and the following week they will be at school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. With pupils happy to be at schools for the first time since
national lockdown at the end of March, the parents were accompanying them. They were in queues to be screened for Covid19 and all went well. A grade R pupil Montshiwa Radebe (5) from Batho said she knew the
importance of social distancing. "I will make sure that my classmates maintain social
distancing and that they don't exchange their masks. If they do, they will
catch Corona," she said. Parent Dieketseng Ratsili said her five-year-old daughter Karabo
could not wait to be at school. "She is in grade R and has been looking forward to this day.
She has been writing a lot while at home and I hope that the teacher will not
find it difficult to catch up with all the kids. I am glad that she is back at
school," said Dieketseng. Teacher Vuyokazi Nduna said they were ready to accept the pupils. She told happy parents: "The pupils who are at school today
will not be here tomorrow, but they will come on Wednesday and Friday again.
Next week they will come to school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the week after
that they attend again like their first week. That's how we will rotate
them."
