M usical Duo KhanyiLuu and Mavee The Vocalist are planning to change the music game. The talented musicians, whose real names are Karabo Malebye (32) and Kanyane Madigwe (34), have a new song on the way. Ke Go Ratile will drop on 15 August and will be available on all digital platforms. Speaking to SunBuzz, Mavee said: “Ke Go Ratile is a love song that has a touch of amapiano. “The song came about when we were in studio with a producer listening to a beat. “Then Khanyi started singing Ke Go Ratile, which was fun. And we decided to go with that. “The song tells a story of two people who’re in love, and advises men on how to take care of the women in their lives.” The two said they were bringing a new sound. “The music we make is inspired by Mafikizolo and Bongo Maffin, but we don’t want to sound like them, so we decided to bring our own touch,” Mavee said. “We do Afro house because we like to represent where we come. “But this time round we’ve added a touch of amapiano to bring something new to the game.” KhanyiLuu said working with Mavee was an absolute pleasure. “He’s a great partner and we make great music together,” she said. The Tshwane-born duo is also working on an album. “It’s going to sound amazing,” said Mavee.
