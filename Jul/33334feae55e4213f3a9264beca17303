Mamelodi Sundowns striker Gaston Sirino has spoken of his “special journey” at the club as he readies for a return to action when the Premier Soccer League resumes. The Uruguayan will be suspended for the first two matches the Brazilians play on their return, but will not have to wait long to feature with games set to come thick and fast to the end of the season. Sirino has scored 13 goals in 33 matches in all competitions this season, while his creativity has also been a huge boost for the Tshwane side as they chase league and Nedbank Cup honours, having already collected the Telkom Knockout earlier this campaign. Sirino scored five goals in helping the side to that trophy and wants to continue to have the same influence in the closing weeks of the campaign. “It’s been a special journey winning two Absa Premiership titles and a Telkom Knockout trophy,” he told his club’s website. “The truth is I’ve grown a lot in my time with the club. I’ve learnt a lot with the team, like the position I’m currently playing in is where I’m most comfortable and feel the most confident in. “My goals with the club have stayed the same since I’ve joined – to play at my best each week, help the team where I can, score goals, win trophies and keep growing as a player.” Sundowns are anxiously waiting for the date that the season will restart, which is set to be decided on Tuesday at a meeting of the PSL’s executive committee. They trail leaders Kaizer Chiefs by four points in the league, but have a game in hand, while they are also in the Nedbank Cup semifinals, where they tackle BidVest Wits.
