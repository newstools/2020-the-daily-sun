MPUMALANGA police are looking for missing mum, Bonang Mathebula. The 20-year-old disappeared from her home in Garelane outside Dwarsloop, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, last Monday, leaving her three-month-old twins and a 20-month-old baby. Bonang’s mother Thembi s(53) was at work when she received a call from her 70-year-old mum, saying her daughter had vanished. “We tried calling her, but her phone rang unanswered. When we tried phoning her again the following day, her phone went straight to voicemail,” she said. “We tried searching for her at our relatives and friends’ places, but the search was fruitless.” Mpumalanga spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police were looking for Bonang, who’s reportedly missing. Hlathi said anyone with information on her whereabouts can call Bushbuckridge police detective, Warrant Officer Nichol Setwane on 072 9068 621.
