BOOZE has once again been banned as part of lockdown rules and cops are entrusted to bust those found in possession of it. But a shocking video has emerged on social media of a cop having a drink with a motorist. The motorist had been pulled over by the cop and he asked the officer if he could sanitise him with the booze he was drinking. However, instead of arresting the man for contravening lockdown regulations and for drinking and driving, the cop, who was in full uniform, gladly took a gulp of what looks like a gin. The officer can be seen happily downing the gin, while making small talk with the driver. Talking in Xhosa, the driver asked the cop who he was travelling with and the officer replied he was with his wife from Ekoloni, Eastern Cape. The video surfaced a week after President Cyril Ramaphosa banned alcohol again. People can only consume booze in their homes, while the transportation and sale of alcohol is also banned. Police Minister Bheki Cele also announced there’d be random stop and searches by the cops. Colonel Sibongile Soci said the member in the video has been identified, and an investigation in terms of their disciplinary regulations was being investigated. “The video came to our attention last week Thursday and forms part of our investigation. Eastern Cape police management are aware of this video and they are viewing this matter seriously,” Soci told Daily Sun.
