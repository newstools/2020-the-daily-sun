HIGHLANDS Park have exercised their options to keep Musa Nyatama, Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane and Greg Etafia at the club until the end of the current suspended Absa Premiership season with short-term deals. The club will sit down and discuss new terms for next season with Letsholonyane and Nyatama at the end of this suspended campaign which the PSL hopes will be concluded at the end of August. The PSL season was halted in mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Fifa sent out a guideline advising clubs that players whose contracts were due to expire at the end of June could be signed on a short-term deals until the end of the season. However, both the players and the club have to agree to the limited deal. Nyatama (32) joined the Tembisa-based outfit in January following his departure from Orlando Pirates. Letsholonyane who recently turned 38, joined the club later in the season after he was released by SuperSport United at the end of the last campaign. “We have extended the contracts of Yeye and Musa Nyatama until the end of August,” confirmed Highlands co-director Brad Kaftel. “And during that time we’ll negotiate with them and see where that takes us.” Former Nigeria international goalkeeper Greg Etafia joined the club during the off-season, initially as a coach of Highlands’ junior side. However, Highlands had a mini goalkeeping crisis when both Tapuwa Kapini and Thela Ngobeni picked up bad injuries. Ngobeni, who was signed from Mamelodi Sundowns during the off-season, will be out until September, according to the club. Highlands were then left with two ‘keepers – Marlon Heugh and Kyle Peters – which forced the club to register Etafia with the PSL as cover. However, the club last month confirmed Peters’ departure after his contract expired. “As far as Greg Etafia is concerned, he’ll continue to be a junior coach and also a fourth goalkeeper. So nothing has changed in that regard,” revealed Kaftel.
