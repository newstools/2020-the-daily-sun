WESTERN Cape promoter Savva Savvas has made a passionate plea to the government to allow boxing to resume. Savvas wants Mzansi to follow in the footsteps of the United States, England and Mexico, where there are a number of mega fights scheduled in the coming months for the first time since the outbreak of coronavirus. But South African fighters are not even allowed to train under government’s lockdown Level 3 restrictions. Savvas’ April tournament was among the events which were cancelled due to Covid-19. The promoter said he is willing to stage a tournament under strict Covid-19 restriction measures. “I’m ready to stage (a tournament) but Boxing South Africa (BSA) says absolutely NO. I think going forward we should be allowed stage professional events,” said Savvas. “The government is keeping quiet and we take our lead from BSA. I don’t really think they know what damage has been caused to the athletes. Rugby is a contact sport, yet they are allowed to train. “I think Boxing SA CEO Tsholofelo Lejaka is pushing hard and wants to see the sport revived but government has pushed it to the side.” The Cape Town businessman added the lockdown had hit the boxers hard as they depend solely on fights for survival. “Boxers need to earn a living as most of them don’t have a day job and in this climate they will not get one,” said Savvas. “The gyms are monitored and if coaches do there jobs properly, check sparring partners and keep a good hygienic standard, I do not see why the boys should not compete.” He added gyms must be monitored and sparring partners tested. “Tests will be done prior to fights as that is a world wide practice now,” he said.
