THE 18-year-old pupil allegedly went to the principal’s office, hoping to hear some good news, but instead she was raped! “The principal undressed me and took off my shorts and my panties,” said the grade 12 pupil. “Then he raped me!” The sad pupil from a Joburg school said she was raped on 8 July. She said the principal called her to the office and locked the door and undressed her, then raped her once, while using a condom. “He said I should tell my friends I was in the bathroom as I had some stomach problems.” She said it looked like he planned the incident. “He acted as if I wasn’t the first one. It shows he abuses other pupils who just keep quiet. I want justice for what happened. I want this principal arrested.” She said she has been taking medication, and has received counselling after the incident. The pupil said even though she was trying to be strong, the incident was having a bad effect on her school performance. “My family and friends are supporting me, but I’m struggling to focus. The school is carrying on as if nothing has happened.” She said she last saw the principal after he raped her and heard rumours that he was at another branch of the school in Midrand. The pupil said she hasn’t had any help from the police or education department. Captain Mavela Masondo said: “A case of rape has been opened. No arrests have been made yet, and investigation is continuing.” Department of Education spokesman Steve Mabona referred inquiries back to the school. An official at the school, who refused to be named, said the case was under investigation.
