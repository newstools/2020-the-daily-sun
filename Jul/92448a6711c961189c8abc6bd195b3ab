SANTI CAZORLA was given hero's farewell by Villarreal as his team-mates threw him in up air following his last ever game for the club. The LaLiga giants confirmed the Arsenal legend, 35, would be leaving the club at the end of this season. And after starring in a 4-0 final-day win over Eibar, Cazorla was given a fitting goodbye by his first - and potentially last - club. Cazorla notched an assist in the win to bring down the curtain on his spectacular season for Villarreal. He was subbed off in the 82nd minute against Eibar to a standing ovation from the few personnel in the stadium. After the game, he was given a guard of honour by BOTH teams - and thrown in the air by his Villarreal pals. Having once been told he may never walk again due to a series of horrific Achilles injuries, Cazorla has proven everyone wrong with an outstanding 2019-20 season. The playmaking star has been involved in 24 goals in 2019-20 alone, having returned to his boyhood club from Arsenal in 2018 - scoring 15 and laying on nine assists. His hot form even saw him earn a Spain recall. But over the weekend, Villarreal confirmed Cazorla would be leaving the club after 328 games. Cazorla's future plans are not yet known, but he has been linked with a coaching role at Arsenal. And the Gunners paid tribute to Cazorla on Twitter after Villarreal's crushing win. They tweeted: "Congratulations on an amazing finish to your Villarreal fairytale, Santi. "We wish you all the best, @19SCazorla." - THE SUN
