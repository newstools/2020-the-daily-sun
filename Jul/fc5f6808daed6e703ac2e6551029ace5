FAMOUS advocate Barry Roux is representing 23 of the 41 accused of stirring violence at the International Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zuurbekom, west of Joburg. Roux claimed his clients were innocent, saying the five men who were killed were in the same faction as the accused. In an affidavit read by Roux, accused number 20, a cop stationed at Protea Glen in Soweto, claimed he accompanied his lawyer friend to the church. “I was arrested with two of my friends. There are no previous convictions and pending cases against me. My wallet and SAPS appointment card were seized. “My licensed firearm was also taken from me after I was forced to the ground and searched,” he said. The accused claimed the state had a weak case against him. “I was only there to accompany my friend. I didn’t know there will be a shooting. I’m not linked to the crime through my finger prints, DNA and gunfire residue and I offered to surrender my passport to the investigating officer,” he said. Accused number 22, the director of Black Water, claimed he was called to the church by his employees. “I only went to the church because my employees were stationed there. “They called to tell me they were being bullied by the police. “When I got there, I tried to explain we were hired by the church and we collect money from their surrounding branches,” he said. Roux said his client was forced to lie on the ground with his employees and they were searched for firearms. “I called a lawyer, who is also a member of the church, to mediate, but he was also arrested when he got to the scene,” he said. Magistrate Gavin Pillay adjourned the case to today due to the water shortage in the area. So far, Pillay has heard 22 bail applications of the 41 accused.
