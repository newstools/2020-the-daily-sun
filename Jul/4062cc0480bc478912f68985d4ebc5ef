The ANC has dismissed claims that its national chairperson
and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has died of Covid-19. Mantashe was hospitalised on Monday after testing positive
for the virus last week. "This is heartless, inhumane, untrue and
insensitive," said the ANC's national spokesperson Pule Mabe on Thursday. Mabe said "malicious" rumours about Mantashe
having died from the pandemic were doing the rounds on social media networks. "To pronounce a person dead while they are still alive
is not only insensitive and evil, it also goes against the spirit of
ubuntu," said Mabe. He also said the ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte
had spoken to Mantashe, who said he was recovering well. On Wednesday a tweet from Mantashe dismissed claims that he
was undergoing treatment at a private facility. Mantashe is one of several ministers who contracted Covid-19
in recent days, with Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi currently in hospital and
Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula having recently recovered from the
virus. Gauteng Premier David Makhura and his Western Cape
counterpart Alan Winde also contracted the virus, while North West Premier Job
Mokgoro is all clear and has returned home after seeking treatment at a
healthcare facility in Gauteng. SOURCE: NEWS24
