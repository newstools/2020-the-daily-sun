CAF president Ahmad Ahmad has refused to be drawn on the resumption plan for domestic leagues on the continent, amid the Covid-19 crisis. Ahmad has acknowledged that Fifa has been dealing with its member associations on when domestic issues, as leagues look at ways to conclude seasons. Ghana announced the cancellation of their domestic league on Tuesday, the campaign having been suspended since mid March. And they were not the first ones to take the drastic decision, as seen with Botswana among a few. The PSL are faced with a similar challenge, although there hasn’t been indication from executives the Absa Premiership want to annul the season. There is, however, a concerted effort to complete the season with no fewer than eight fixtures left. Testing are being conducted as clubs seek compliance with the safety regulations, which have been put in place as teams prepare to return to training. Ahmad has emphasised the need to follow the comprehensive plan, put together by the Caf medical committee and a ream of experts, on the restart of football activities. “Federations and leagues have many contracts signed (sponsors). But they have the guidelines to follow on the resumption of football activities,” said Ahmad via Zoom intreview. Ahmad, who chaired a Caf online executive committee meeting this week, admitted the financial implications will be severe for continent’s football governing body as a result of postponement of the Africa Cup of Nations finals and the rescheduling of other events. Caf have already allocated an addition R300 million as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Each member association will be entitled to R5,5 million. The efforts will come handy for members such as Safa, who have been battling to keep the wolves from the door. And the situation is likely to get worse with no international matches scheduled.
