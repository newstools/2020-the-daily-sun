 FEAR creeps
in as several shops at Vaal Mall get hit by the coronavirus. This comes
after Dis-chem, ABSA, Woolworths, and the Centre Management Office registered
several positive cases. The mall,
in the Vaal, south of Joburg has shoppers worried that they may get infected by
the Coronavirus. Speaking to
Daily Sun, a shopper at the Mall Dikeledi Mopeli (28) said she fears for her
life and those who work at the mall. "It’s
not safe anymore coming to the mall. We continue to come here because we got
essential needs, otherwise, we wouldn't be setting foot in the mall," she
said. In a
statement, Vaal Mall confirmed having cases at some of its stores. "We
are aware of the messages circulating on social media with regards to alleged
positive COVID-19 cases at Fruitti Nutti, our car guards, and cleaning staff.
This is incorrect and untrue," read the statement. "We
can, however, confirm that positive cases were reported at Dis-chem, ABSA,
Woolworths, and the Centre Management Office. All these stores were closed
temporarily to allow for professional decontamination companies to sanitise and
deep clean the premises. ABSA and Dis-chem have re-opened for trade already and
the Centre Management Offices and Woolworths re-opened today on
Wednesday," continued the statement. The mall
said all its stores, as well as the Management, is taking the necessary
precautions to safeguard staff and customers in line with the regulatory
requirements, and all sanitation measures continue. "We
assure you that the health and safety of our shoppers, staff, and tenants
remains of utmost importance to us. Vaal Mall
has sanitation stations available throughout the Mall which we encourage all
shoppers to make use of. We have a strict “No Mask, No Entry” policy, and we
encourage our shoppers to adhere to social distancing guidelines as well as
sanitise and wash their hands frequently," read the statement.
