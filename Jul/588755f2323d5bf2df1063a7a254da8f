FOUR eThekwini metro cops have been arrested for
stealing skyf. The officers who are based in Verulam north of Durban
were arrested this morning. The four allegedly went to a cigarette dealer shop and
accused him of selling skyf during the lockdown which has been banned by
government. The owner denied selling and told them he locked his
cigarettes in cupboard after president Ramaphosa announced the ban. The members demanded for him to open the cupboard and
took all the cigarettes. The owner reported the matter in the police. Cops provincial spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said
the officers aged between 30 and 42 were arrested for corruption. He said their arrest follows an investigation by the
Provincial Anti-Corruption Unit into a corruption and theft case reported on 10
June 2020. He said the four suspects received intelligence about
a shop owner suspected to be selling cigarettes at La Mercy in Tongaat. "The men demanded the cupboard keys before they
removed cigarettes and an undisclosed amount of cash. The suspects later
released the complainant who reported the matter to the police. They did not
hand in the cigarettes and cash at any police station," said Naicker. He said all four suspects are due to appear at Verulam
Magistrates Court soon. In another case investigated by the Provincial
Anti-Corruption Unit, Naicker said Sergeant Lazarus Narainsamy (39) stationed
at Tongaat SAPS appeared in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday for
extortion. He is accused of extorting money from a suspect who
was arrested for assault and crimen injuria during March 2020. The court released him on bail of R1000 and the case
was postponed to 23 September.
