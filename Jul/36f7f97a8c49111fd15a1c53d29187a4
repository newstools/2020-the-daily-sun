AUDIT firm PricewaterhouseCoopers failed to inform the public that they found non-compliance at SAA. Yesterday, auditor Pule Mothibe told the Zondo Commission it was an omission that they didn’t mention irregular expenditures in their audit opinion. It was put to Mothibe that the failure to inform shareholders about wrongdoings was dereliction of duty on his part. “I will not go as far as to say it’s a dereliction of duty because we’re reporting steps that we were able to carry out,” said Mothibe. “We do concede that the last step should’ve been carried out. “That is, identifying the matter in the audit opinion.” PwC and audit firm Nkonki jointly audited SAA from 2012 to 2016 and the state-owned enterprise received clean audits in those five years. However, when the auditor-general of South Africa took over in the 2016/2017 financial year, SAA disclosed R125 million in irregular expenditure. Mothibe said their work was hindered as they couldn’t find some tender files. He admitted that though there were controls in place, they didn’t identify deviations that took place when tenders were given. “Our view was that there was no material non-compliance,” said Mothibe. Evidence leader Kate Hoffmeyer told him the report was misleading if it didn’t give the full picture of the state of affairs at SAA. Mothibe said: “We did identify deviations and notified management. “We do accept that we should have done that (elevated). “We should have elevated some of those items of non-compliance in the audit report.” The commission also heard that former chairwoman of the SAA audit and risk committee, Yakhe Kwinana, sat in the committee that appointed PwC despite her company being in a joint venture with PwC. Mothibe said there was no act that forced Kwinana to declare her interests, but it would have been best practice if she did. He said they took comfort in the knowledge that the appointment of auditors was not done by one person, but by a committee.
