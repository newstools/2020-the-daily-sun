FORMER South Africa captain Bongani Khumalo has been handed a one-year extension of his contract at SuperSport United. The 33-year-old will now spend a third successive season at SuperSport United with his latest deal to run out at the end of June 2021. The new contract also has a one year extension option, which could keep him at the club until mid-2022, when he will be 35-years-old. SuperSport is where Khumalo began his top flight career, winning three successive league titles, after which he went to Tottenham Hotspur in England. He has also played at Reading, Doncaster Rovers and Colchester United in the English league and PAOK Salonika in Greece. When he came back to South Africa in 2015, Khumalo rejoined SuperSport but then followed his old coach Gavin Hunt to Bidvest Wits. Khumalo has previously said his ambition is to win a fourth league crown with SuperSport next season. -SUPERSPORT.COM
