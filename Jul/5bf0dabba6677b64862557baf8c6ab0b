Young beauties who aspire to become Miss Kwaggafontein have been urged to start registering now in order to participate in the contest next year. Organiser Elvis Mashego (29) said even though they won’t have a contest this year, young girls should enter now as a workshop will be held to brief them on how to win. Elvis, from Kwaggafontein B section in Mpumalanga, said they’re looking for girls between the ages of 16 and 24, who have no children. “Due to Covid-19, we’re not going to have the Miss Kwaggafontein Beauty Contest this year,” said Elvis. “The only thing we aim to do is to have a workshop that will enlighten the girls on how to win. “In previous years, the girls used to join without any knowledge, so we’re going to tell them about the dress code and how to handle themselves during the contest. “The girls will be taught how to handle themselves if they win. They must know where the pageant is going. “They must be able to know how to raise funds and develop other young girls. They’ll also get to know about duties of the title holder in the community.” He said the reigning queen will conduct the workshop and give tips. “We’re looking to have between 15 and 20 girls in the finals. Judges will be workshopped about the contest.” Elvis said the workshop will be held at his home at Kwagga ‘B’ stand no 324 on 10 October. He said girls who won’t attend the workshop won’t be allowed to enter.
