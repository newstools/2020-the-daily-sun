GUNSHOTS were heard coming from a room in the middle of the night. In the morning, the bodies of the two lovers were found lying in a pool of blood. Sicelo Mzukwini (27) and his girlfriend Noxolo Makhanya (26) from the Ezigeni area in Umbumbulu, south of Durban, sustained multiple gunshot wounds. It’s still not clear who killed the couple and the motive is unknown. Both their families are still puzzled. Sicelo’s cousin Sazi Mkhize (27) told Daily Sun the family is still shattered about the deaths. “So far we really don’t understand why they were killed. Sicelo was unemployed but he wasn’t involved in any crime. Noxolo has been with Sicelo for about two years. So she used to visit him very often and she ended up being killed while visiting him,” he said. He said they are leaving everything to the police. Noxolo’s father, Wilfren Makhanya, said he doesn’t want to talk about the incident as he has no clue why his daughter was killed. “I don’t know anything at this moment. We are still going to find out about this incident from cops,” he said. He said the entire family is in disbelief. They can’t believe that Noxolo is gone for good. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a murder case is being investigated by Umbumbulu cops. Gwala said it is alleged that at 5am this morning, at Ezigeni area in Umbumbulu, the bodies of a 27-year-old man and a 26-year-old girlfriend were found inside the house with multiple gunshot wounds. “The gunshots emanating from the house were heard last night by family members and when they checked in the morning, their bodies were discovered,” said Gwala. She said the suspects and the motive is yet to be established as the investigation unfolds.
