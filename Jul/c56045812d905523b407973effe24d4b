LADYSMITH Black Mambazo is tired of not being able to perform for their fans due to Covid-19. Now the Grammy Award-winning scathamiya group has come up with a plan to entertain national and global fans. They will stage a concert called One Night in July with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which will be live streamed. The group will perform live at the Durban Playhouse on Friday, and fans can watch the performance live on the streaming service WatchaTV. The group’s manager, Xolani Majozi, told Daily Sun fans would have to register to watch the show. “This will be the biggest live-streamed concert for Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s global and local audience. “Fans will be motivated by Mambazo’s songs during these tough times. They can use this opportunity to relieve stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said. Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been performing for international audiences, but their three-month US tour was cancelled because of the pandemic. The concert will start at 6.30pm, and online bookings and registration is R100 via the Ladysmith Black Mambazo link.
