ALLEGED kidnappers are behind bars. They were busted during a pre-dawn intelligence-driven raid this morning. The national SAPS spokesman, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said members of various units of the SAPS and Hawks moved swiftly on an alleged kidnapping syndicate at a house in Kliprivier. Naidoo told Daily Sun that the SAPS Intelligence team was following leads on the kidnapping of an Indian National who was kidnapped earlier this month. "This led the integrated multi-disciplinary team to the Klipriveir house where five men, two of which are of foreign nationality, were arrested," said Naidoo. He further stated that three of these men are likely to be charged with kidnapping while the other two, possibly for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.  "Foreign military uniform, several firearms including rifles and pistols were recovered, some of which were buried in the garden on the same property," he said. "The owner of the house is currently on the run and the kidnapped victim has not yet been found," he added. Naidoo said police are investigating the possibility that this group may also be linked to Melville drive-by shooting on New Yearâ€™s Day this year. "We're encouraging anyone who has any more information on this matter to contact the SAPS on our Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. Information may also be communicated via the MySAPSApp," said Naidoo.
