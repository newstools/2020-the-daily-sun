AFTER more than 115 years without a king, the Mthatha High Court finally reinstated the AmaMpondomise kingship. On Tuesday, Judge Mbuyiselo Jolwana confirmed His Majesty Luzuko Matiwane as heir to the AmaMpondomise  throne. This after a court battle between the Dosini and Phahlo royal families, who claimed to be the right houses to lead the AmaMpondomise nation. The high court dismissed the Dosini house’s appeal with cost and ruled in favour of the Phahlo royal family. Yesterday (Wednesday), the Phahlo royal family called a media briefing, where they announced they wanted to bring back all the assets which were lost during the apartheid regime, including land. Phahlo royal family secretary, Zwelethu Tyali, said their main objective was to restore the identity of AmaMpondomise and reunite all clans and houses including the Dosini house. “The king will have a meeting with all AmaMpondomise traditional leaders to discuss a way forward. “We wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office and Premier Oscar Mabuyane immediately after the high court judgement,” said Tyali. He said they would soon announce the date for Matiwane’s coronation. The AmaMpondomise kingship was withdrawn in 1904 after the brutal killing of Magistrate Helmilton Hope in the 1880 revolt. On 24 July, Ramaphosa signed a government gazette recognising AmaMpondomise as a fully fledged kingship. In December 2016, former president Jacob Zuma and Tolo Commission said AmaMpondomise had no kingship, but in May 2019, Mthatha High Court’s Judge Richard Brooks ordered that the kingship should be reinstated. Dosini house were unavailable for comment.
