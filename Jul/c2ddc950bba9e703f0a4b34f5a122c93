A warrant of arrest has been issued for Somizi Mhlongo after
he failed to appear at the Randburg Magistrate Court where he was due to appear
today. Somizi was supposed to appear for the contravention of the
disaster management act case, which was postponed, again. The socialite will stand in front of the Randburg Magistrate
again on July 23. The matter was postponed for the director of public
prosecution's decision. Somizi's lawyer has made representations. Somizi found himself on the wrong side of the law after he
told his radio co-host about the governmentâ€™s plans to ease the lockdown. Somizi who was released on R1 500 bail, was captured on an
Instagram live telling Dineo Rakana how Minister Fikile Mbalula told him about
the extension of the lockdown, which had not been announced officially by the
head of state. After getting public backlash, Somizi claimed that he
actually didn't know anything about the lockdown extension and that he was
merely making a joke. However, his joke also put Mbalula under the spotlight as he
was perceived as someone who shares government information with his buddies. Mbalula denied and distanced himself from Somizi's
utterances and opened a case against his close friend.
