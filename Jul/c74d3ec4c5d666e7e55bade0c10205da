THE Springboks could be set to a return to action in November. This is after the World Rugby Council approved a temporary 2020 calendar, following the suspension as a result of Covid-19 outbreak. The temporary window will accommodate tournaments such as a Rugby Championship as well as the release of international players. The Championship, which involves South Africa, New Zealand, Australian and Argentina, will take place over a reduced six-week period between November and December and will take place in New Zealand. But special measures will need to be put in place to deal with the lockdown regulations as outlined by various governments. According to World Rugby, the current regulation 9 windows will return to normal after the conclusion of the temporary calendar. The Boks, who haven't been in action since they lifted the Webb Ellis trophy in Japan last year, are the reigning Rugby Championship champions. In a statement, World Rugby explained that the decision was taken after extensive and productive dialogue between the sport's major stakeholders, balancing the interests of the international game, the professional club game as well as the player welfare. "Throughout this process, all parties have sought to deliver the best possible outcome to support the interests of international and club rugby and the players," said World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont. "Agreement and approval of this schedule is exciting for players and fans and an important step in supporting our unions in mitigating financial impact and optimising the sport's return from the pandemic in an equitable way."
