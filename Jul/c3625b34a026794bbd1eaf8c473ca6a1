As we move closer to 2021 confronted by the Covid-19 pandemic, may we remember Chris Hani. He once said: “What I fear is that the liberators emerge as elitists who drive around in Mercedes-Benz and use the resources of this country to live in palaces and to gather riches.” That’s where we are today as a country. May we remember and vow to never surrender to political manipulation. Political manipulation is a type of influence that aims to change the behaviour or perception of others through indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another’s expense, such methods could be considered exploitative and devious. It’s time we take back our communities and our pride. We can rebuild our political pride and trust. As a community and as a nation, we need to distance ourselves from elitists and leave no room for populists in our society. The past events in Phiritona were very much thought-provoking. The community were faced with fear of the dreaded Covid-19 pandemic and attacks from a lunatic who broke into houses as he wished. It was concerning to note the blindness and deafness of people elected to lead the community. None of them spoke to the community to calm their fears. The people of Mshaya took to the streets and demanded justice. It’s their constitutional right to do so amid the risk of contracting the virus and unwarranted criminal records. It was heartbreaking to see. We don’t have leaders and we don’t have councillors who care for the people. We have elitists whom Hani warned us about. We must vote them out of power in the next election.
