THEIR transformer exploded two months ago. And the residents of Bekkersdal, west of Joburg, tried to get Eskom to fix it but with no luck. On Monday, they went with Councillor Dumile Sithole to Eskom offices in Westonaria to try and get the officials to solve their problem. But the officials refused to address them. The residents then burnt tyres in front of the offices’ gate and blocked workers from leaving the premises. The protesters said they felt they were being taken for granted by the power utility. “We can’t go on like this. We’ve been patient with Eskom and I think it’s time we showed them we mean business,” said one of the protesters. Community leader Tshepo Seikaneng said they were paying for services, but getting nothing in return. “We’re experiencing one of the coldest winter seasons this year and it’s hell without electricity.” Councillor Sithole said he had been trying to speak to Eskom to sort out the problem, hence he accompanied the residents to the regional offices. Victor Ramagaga, regional Eskom spokesman, said they would send a team to investigate. The police had to keep an eye so that the residents didn’t burn down the Eskom building in Lebanon, Westonaria. Warrant Officer Peter Masooa said the police would continue monitoring the situation.
