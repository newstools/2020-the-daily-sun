FORMER eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede wants her case to be struck off the roll. Gumede and her 20 co-accused, among them former city manager Sipho Nzuza, former housing head Mondli Mthembu and former deputy head of solid waste Robert Abbu, appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court yesterday. They faced fraud and money laundering charges relating to a R389 million tender. Gumede’s lawyers, Jay Naidoo and Bulelani Mazomba, wanted to file for a permanent stay of prosecution because the court had failed to tell their clients details of the charges. Naidoo and Mazomba represent Abbu and Mthembu as well. Prosecutor Ashika Lakan said the state was ready to hand over court papers but was being delayed by Covid-19 regulations. Banks were unable to provide some statements. Magistrate Dawn Sumaroo gave the state six weeks to sort out its problems and postponed the case to 10 September. Gumede’s lawyers wouldn’t accept another delay and filed for the case to be struck off the roll. Speaking outside court, Gumede said it was clear the state had no case against her. She said she was being undermined as she was a woman.
