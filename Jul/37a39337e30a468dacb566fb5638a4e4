WOMEN have shared their stories with Daily Sun to encourage others to leave abusive relationships. On Monday, the women from Rosettenville, Joburg, marched on the streets to call on Mzansi people to fight the abuse of women and children. Thembsile Dladla (33) said: “This should be the time for Mzansi to walk the talk so we can put an end to all these cruel killings and rapes.” She told Daily Sun she was in a three-year relationship with a man who would beat her and then buy her flowers and chocolates to apologise. She said at first she wanted to help him heal from his problems, instead of leaving him. “But when I suggested therapy, he got more angry, saying I treated him like he was crazy. I ended up leaving the relationship.” Matshidiso Malego (31) said a recent StatsSA study found one in five women with partners had experienced physical violence. “Even so, gender-based violence remains largely hidden. There aren’t public discussions about it.” Matshidiso said she was in an abusive relationship for four years and recently left it. “I was one of those people who hid this from everyone, including my friends and family.” Miranda Mthembu (32) said she used to be with a man who beat her and then went to sleep outside. She said he sometimes threatened her friends when he couldn’t get hold of her. “We dated for an entire year, but I had to break it off when he started threatening my friends and family,” she said. Nomthandazo Sikela (37) said she used to lie when her friends asked about her bruises and made excuses when her partner shouted at her in front of them. “But I broke up with him when he started using objects to beat me.” Mercy Mokoena (26) said she left her boyfriend after he slapped her in front of her friends. “What I know is that if you let a man beat you once, he’ll continue,” she said. Takudzwa Nigel (29) said ending the violence was everyone’s responsibility. Njabulo Thwala (29) said: “We now live in a society where women don’t feel safe.”
