A GIANT python roaming the bush and killing people’s chickens at Mavilijane Village outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga was rescued this morning. Resident Solomon Mabuza (34) said they started to notice something last month after chickens went missing, without them knowing who caught them, He said they were glad to know the giant python eating their chickens was found. “Our chickens will be safe for now and we will keep on watching if others don’t come to our yard,” he said. Fire and Rescue worker Cockroach Mdluli told Daily Sun in February they rescued another snake in the vicinity and that this six metre-long python was reportedly spotted by villagers last month but when they tried to kill it, it disappeared into the bush. “Residents informed us where they saw it and we searched it and it was found trapped by big rocks with injuries. Because I love to save snakes, I tried to save it from death. It took us an hour because he was fighting us due to pain but we managed to rescue it. “This type of snake will be seen only if it’s hunting food, targeting chickens and rats and it can kill even a person when it’s hungry, so we want to urge residents if they see this type of snake, they shouldn’t try to kill it themselves but contact us so we can catch it and those who collect firewood in the bush should look out for the snake.” “The python has since been taken to Kruger National Park where it will continues its life away from people. If residents see snakes at home, they can contact our fire and rescue chief in Bushbuckridge on 060 506 4020 or 079 887 9814 so we can remove it before it harms them.”
