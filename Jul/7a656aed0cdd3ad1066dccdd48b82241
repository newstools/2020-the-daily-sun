The residents said if the speeding didn’t stop, they’d soon install cameras on Maliehe Street in Diepkloof, Soweto, to watch over their neighbourhood.  “We don’t want to depend on the municipality. We want to do things ourselves,” said resident and project coordinator, Tiisetso Nthau. “The money we contributed was used to buy cement, lintels and sand. The lintels were pinned inside the hump to support it.” But motorists were not impressed. “Why should we be punished for the sins of others? Not everyone speeds. We’re not against them putting up the humps, but eight is too many,” said an angry motorist. Another unhappy motorist said: “Eight humps on one short street is going to damage our cars. “We’re getting punished for others’ mistakes and this is not fair.”  However, the residents were unfazed. “Speedsters took advantage and drove at high speed, endangering our lives and that of our children,” said one resident.

Joburg Roads Agency spokeswoman, Zoleka Jika, said residents aren’t allowed to construct humps as not all residential roads warrant speed humps. “It all comes down to driver behaviour. Drivers must drive at the permitted speed in residential areas, which is 60km.”
