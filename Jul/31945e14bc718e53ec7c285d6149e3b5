POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said Amahle Quku would still be alive if it wasn’t for alcohol. Amahle (17) was raped and murdered in Brown’s Farm, Cape Town, last month. Cele blamed alcohol as a major cause of many social ills. AMAHLE LAID TO REST!  He said when alcohol was banned during level 4 and 5 of lockdown, there were no major issues of gender-based violence and violence in general, but these spiked as soon as the ban was lifted. “With the young 17-year-old, that’s alcohol,” said Cele. “She was taken from a party, murdered and thrown in the street naked. “I believe that young kid would still be alive if there was no alcohol, no party.” He ended up sounding like a “broken record” when he made calls against alcohol, but he was glad the Department of Health was raising the matter. “I’m glad people from the health fraternity are raising it sharply to say health facilities are saturated since alcohol came back,” he said. Cele said he was also concerned about the increase in Covid-19 cases.
