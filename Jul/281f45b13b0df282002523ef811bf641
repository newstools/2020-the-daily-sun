ZODWA
is spending time in the arms of a new man, but this time it isn’t about love –
it’s about sex. “I don’t want to show off with
this one. He’s my undercover lover. I want to keep this one private,” dancer
and entertainer Zodwa Wabantu told Daily
Sun. “I haven’t decided if he’s the
one or not. We’re just having sex.” She said she didn’t want to put
herself under pressure. “If I say I’m in love when I’m
not, and worse still if we break up, people start saying I’m loose and I can’t
keep a relationship. “We’re just having fun, going out
on dates and getting to know each other.” “Sex with my new guy is amazing!
I enjoy it each time he touches me.” They met in the CBD in Durban. “After my breakup, I started
going out and mingling. “I’d stop and greet people and
have a chat. “Then one day I met him and he
got my attention.” Zodwa said there’s nothing wrong
with casual sex. “People have been doing it since
forever. Stop being ashamed of what we like.” She’s having the time of her life
but not off the market. “I don’t know where this is going
with this man, so I’m still looking. “Those who’re interested can DM
me on Instagram or email me, and we’ll see where that takes us. “I can’t always be in love. This
year I don’t want a relationship. “I just want to mingle, have fun,
and have sex with whoever I connect with.” She’s not looking for a Ben 10. “I’m looking for a real man. He
must be handsome and wealthy.”
