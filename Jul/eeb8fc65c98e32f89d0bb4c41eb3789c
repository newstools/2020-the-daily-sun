PEOPLE around him see his potential and push him to keep going! The 26-year-old accounting Tshwane University of Technology student is making extra cash with art. Kagiso Mabusela spends his leisure time painting and drawing. He paints anything he sees, from portraits to landscapes, using pens and oils. Kagiso told Daily Sun he pours his heart out while drawing. “I express my feelings and expose social ills with my drawings, and some of my artwork speaks about inner feelings,” he said. Most of his artwork portrays well-known people. “The quest for more orders inspires me to do more and improve my art until I reach the hyper-realistic standard of painting a proper picture that will look better than a photo,” he said. “The reality is that creating this kind of artwork has allowed me to develop an understanding of the physical and spontaneous changes that take place in every object and our lives.” He started drawing when he was younger and received praise from peers and teachers. His business didn’t do well during lockdown. “I’m home and far from most art shops,” he said. “Since art shops in my hometown lack materials, I bought them in Tshwane. “I get lots of orders daily, which makes me want do more, but I can’t take some due to less material.”
