FORMER Orlando Pirates winger Tlou “Sox” Segolela believes the club have laid a strong foundation and they stand a chance of matching their remarkable double treble between 2010 and 2012. Segolela was part of the Pirates team that made history when they became the first club in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) era to achieve that feat. The speedy winger said he sees the potential of the team reaching that level again, however, they need to make at least three signings that he believes are the missing pieces of the puzzle. The Buccaneers have only won the 2014 Nedbank Cup since that double-treble-winning era. It has been almost six seasons without clinching any title despite being among teams that have the strongest squads in the PSL. “As you see, Pirates now have a nice foundation,” said Segolela. “I can say the team needs to sign a centre back, goalkeeper and in the middle, they need that one hard player who will do the dirty job for them and release the attacking players to score goals.” This season Bucs have changed coaches three times – Milutin Sredojevic, Rhulani Mokwena – and Josef Zinnbauer currently in charge. Segolela believes they are heading in the right direction now. He said: “Players are starting to believe in the coach’s philosophy, style of play. Usually, those things take long but they have to get it right.” In recent seasons, the Buccaneers have been busy in the transfer market in reinforcing the team with some quality players from different clubs in the PSL and outside the borders of Mzansi. Segolela’s wish could be granted as reports suggest that the club is targeting Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo to strengthen their defence. Among other players that are believed to be on Pirates radar are striker Deon Hotto, Maritzburg United goalkeeper Richard Ofori and defenders Rushine de Reuck and Siyanda Xulu, who recently parted ways with the Team of Choice.
