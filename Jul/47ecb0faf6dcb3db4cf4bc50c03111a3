FIVE
men accused of the death of an ANC man’s death were granted bail today. Given
Ngomane (31), Boet Boet Lekhuleni (35), Deon Lekhuleni (27), Sikhumbuzo
Lekhuleni (33) and Nhlanhla Mabuza  were released
on R1000 bail.  They
were arrested two weeks ago following Prince Manzini’s alleged assault and
murder.  THE
KaBokweni Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga heard that it was arranged for the
five men charged with Manzini’s  assault
and murder  to disrupt an ANC Branch
General Meeting. This
was revealed by investigating officer Captain Simon Mlotshwa while he was
opposing bail against the accused. The
45-year-old was one of at least more than 200 people who attended a meeting to
elect candidates for the 13th Mpumalanga ANC Regional and Provincial General
Conference. Mlotshwa
said three of the accused were taxi drivers, one was a merchandise, while the
other one was a carpenter. He
said they were linked to the incident by eyewitnesses. He
told the court it emerged that the accused were not ANC members and are not
known to the organisation. He
said on the day of the incident, two factions within the party, namely Focus
and Ngci, had misunderstandings over the agenda of the day. He
said senior ANC members came up with a different agenda and a dispute started
when the deceased questioned it. “The
accused assaulted the deceased and other members who belong to the Focus group.
Chairs and other objects were used. “The
group was not part of the meeting, it was arranged that they disrupt the
meeting,” he said. Mlotshwa
said it was not in the best interest of the law to release the suspects as they
were familiar with the eyewitnesses and lived in the same area. He
said there is a likelihood they would interfere with the witnesses. When
handing down his judgement, Magistrate Musa Mabunda said the state had no
difficulties arresting the accused. The
case was postponed to 29 September for further investigations.
