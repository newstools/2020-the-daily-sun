IT’S the new normal... These are the words of Pitso Mosimane as he adapts to unorthodox training methods under the coronavirus-enforced national lockdown.  The Mamelodi Sundowns coach has met up with his players for the first time in over 100 days at Royal Marang Hotel in Rustenburg. Under different circumstances, Mosimane would be taking his team for a pre-season camp at his favourite Rustenburg spot during this time of the year. But this time around the team has assembled for camp to prepare for the completion of Premiership campaign, which had been suspended since mid March due to be Covid-19 outbreak.  ”It hasn't been easy. It's our new life,” said Mosimane, who has also welcomed assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena back to the team. The defending league champions trail current log leader Kaizer Chiefs by four points, on 44, with nine games remaining.They also have the Nedbank Cup semifinal date with Bidvest Wits.  The sports ministry has given teams the green light to resume training, but it is unclear when will the games begin. The idea is to have all professional teams a biologically safe environment where they can play the remaining matches under strict health measures.
