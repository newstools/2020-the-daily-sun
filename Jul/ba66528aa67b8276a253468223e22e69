IT’S a mansion in the midst of mikhukhu! That’s what residents think of Michael Mokoena’s double-storey house on a mountain in Matlejoane in Atteridgeville, Tshwane. The 35-year-old said it took him four months to build the six-roomed shack and garage. Michael – a builder, welder, painter and plumber – built everything himself . He said he felt comfortable on the top floor of his mansion and had a beautiful view of Atteridgeville. “I’m thankful that my dream of living in a mansion has come true while I’m still young and energetic,” he said. “I’ve invested a lot in my house. Now I have a peaceful night’s sleep.” Michael said his only concern is that there’s no electricity in the area. He uses a generator to power his tools. The house has three bedrooms, a bathroom, spare room, kitchen and a garage for two cars. There’s also a pool. “People call my house Nkandla of the kasi and that makes me happy,” he said. “People appreciate what I’ve done. I’ve named my house Michie’s Cafe.” Michael, who lives with three family members, said he’s available to build double-storey shacks for people who’re interested. “My family can’t stop praising my shack,” he said. Michael said people often stop along the road to look at his unique house. His brother-in-law, Thapelo Seloane (31), said he’s enjoyed every single moment of the two years he’s lived in the house. “There’s a fresh breeze when you’re in this house,” he said.
