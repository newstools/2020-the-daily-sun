Security guards and petrol attendants who were on duty had to run for their lives after a group of unknown gunmen bombed two ATMs and a cash safe at a Sasol filling station. This happened at Mkhuhlu Plaza near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Saturday. One of the shocked guards told Daily Sun they  saw a group of men running around the shopping centre’s yard holding rifles. They later heard a loud bang and saw the suspects running towards the ATMs while others were standing at the gate entrance. “We had to run for cover. We hid at the taxi rank where vendors put their stock and when we went tp investigate, we found that two money machines were damaged and the thugs were gone,” he said. A 35-year-old petrol attendant said they saw armed men coming towards them and they ran for their lives, but they were ordered to sleep on the ground. “They held our colleagues inside the shop at gun point and in a short space of time, we heard a bang and minutes later we found that the thugs were gone, and the cash safe was bombed. We’re glad that they didn’t kill us, but we were all shocked after the incident as this is terrifying,” he said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that police are investigating cases of robbery after two ATMs and a garage safe were bombed at Mkhuhlu on Saturday. “A manhunt has been launched for the suspects and we appeal to anyone with information that can help the police in arresting the suspects to contact Lieutenant-Colonel Duduzile Shabangu on 082 469 2560 or the SAPS CrimeStop number on 08600 10111,” said Hlathi.
