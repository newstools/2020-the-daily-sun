SOUTH African-born actor Atandwa Kani says he was recently racially profiled. Atandwa, known as the Prince of Theatre, is living in the US and has opened up about racism there. He recently shared an Instagram video captioned “In the Divided States of White America”. He speaks about a recent incident where he felt he was being racially profiled by a white couple in New York. He says he stepped out of his apartment on Friday and a white couple slowly approaching him walked to the other side of the road when they saw him.

I’m walking out of my apartment and I see these two white people, this couple, and they are walking towards me and they decide to walk across the street,” he writes. Atandwa, who played the younger King T’Chaka in Black Panther, says he thought it might be because of the coronavirus at first, but he was wearing a mask. “I asked another black person who was watching if he saw that and he responded and said yes. “He asked me what I’m going to do about it. “The only thing I could say to him was: ‘Is this is what it has come to?’” Shortly after sharing the video, people commented and comforted him. A user wrote: “You’re a prince! Don’t let people like that get under your skin. They don’t deserve to walk in the same streets as you.” Another user asked him to be cautious: “Take caution and be wide eyed everywhere you go or even walk.”
