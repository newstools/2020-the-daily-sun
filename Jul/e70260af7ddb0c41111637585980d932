AMAZULU’S preparations ahead of the resumption of PSL season in August have been dealt a major blow. Sunsport has reliably learnt that Usuthu stopped training last week after one of their key players allegedly tested positive for coronavirus. This is a huge setback for the KwaZulu Natal side in their bid to survive the relegation axe hovering above their heads. AmaZulu are second bottom on the Absa Premiership table tied with Polokwane City and Baroka FC on 23 points with six games still to play. They are three points ahead of bottom club Black Leopards. Said the Source: “The team stopped training after one player tested positive for Covid-19. They did another test again last Friday and are waiting for the results.” Usuthu are anxiously waiting for the results hoping they will be negative so that interim coach Ayanda Dlamini and his assistant Moeneeb Josephs can continue with preparations before travelling to a bio safe controlled environment in Joburg where they will play their remaining matches. Dlamini is in charge while coach Jozef Vukusic awaits his fate after being placed on "special leave" in March due to reasons management refused to divulge to the public Added the Source: “The results normally take two days to be sent to the clubs and already it’s Tuesday they haven’t received them, this is frustrating for the team.”
