There’s no doubt the train is the cheapest mode of transportation. Yet with railway lines in a shocking state, most train commuters are being deprived of it. It’s been reported that Prasa has lost millions of rands as a result of vandalism. To make matters worse, taxi fares around the country have shot up a result of the coronavirus. This puts a huge strain on the daily budgets of commuters, most of whom live below the breadline and can’t afford taxi fare, anyway. Blame it on insensitive thugs who destroy our safe, affordable mode of transport. Mind you, cables were being stolen and trains vandalised long before lockdown: steel seats, doors and windows – to be reused in shacks or sold at scrapyards – were ripped off and stolen! Prasa is also to blame for this mess. It bungled a high-level security contract, leading to its assets not being watched over properly. Therefore, security should be Prasa’s main priority if it is to sustain this valuable mode of transportation. ) Letter by Solam Yves Ludidi, from Ennerdale
