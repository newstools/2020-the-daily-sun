President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation as COVID-19 infections are on the rise in Mzansi. In his address on Sunday night, Ramaphosa said that the sale, dispensing and distribution is suspended with immediate effect. The president also said there will be a curfew from tomorrow, between 9pm and 4am, unless one has a valid reason to be on the road between those times. Ramaphosa has most probably broken many hearts across Mzansi by announcing that the sale of booze has been suspended immediately as part of the fight against the corona virus. During his heavily worded speech which he sounded as an unhappy dad addressing his unruly kids, the president said it would be at a great economic cost if Mzansi were to go back to level 4 or 5. But he said the sale of booze was necessary to alleviate pressure on hospital capacity. "To conserve hospital capacity, the sale and distribution of alcohol is suspended with immediate effect",he said. Booze sales were reopened on June 1 when the country entered level 3. But by the first day the rate of car accidents and trauma cases had gone up and more concerning was the number of gender based violence cases by the end of June. Police Minister Bheki Cele and Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane had called for booze ban last month. Mzansi currently has 276 242 active corona cases andÂ  4079 deaths at day 108 of its national lockdown.
