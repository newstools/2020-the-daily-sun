A FAMILY is worried new houses are being built on top of their loved ones’ graves. They claimed some houses were already built on top of the graves at Garona Estate in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. Lizzy Sithole (58) from Kanana in Hammanskraal said she was home in April when she saw houses being built on the farm where she and her family lived. She said there were more than 20 graves in the area. “This is bad. These people must stop building where our loves ones’ graves are. This is our parents’ land,” she said.  Lizzy appealed to those building houses in the area not to disturb the dead. “We want government to intervene because this is unacceptable,” she said. The mum of five said people were hijacking land that belonged to their parents. Her uncle Thomas Nembudzani (49) said it was disheartening and very disturbing that some people didn’t care about the dead. “I’m angry because we were not consulted when the project to build houses in the area started.  “We don’t even know who is developing property on our graves. “We need answers as to why the houses are being built on top of our relatives’ graves,” he said. The family said the people who are disrespecting their relatives’ graves will never have peace. Sinky Sebopa, a communication officer in the office of the KwaKekana Royal Administration in Hammanskraal, said: “We will look into the matter and meet the concerned residents next Monday.”
