THE music industry was shocked when word broke yesterday that businessman and PR guru Pheko Kgengoe had died. Friends and colleagues of Pheko (35), the owner of 4TheLove, said he still had a lot to offer. The Soweto-born businessman, who often visited the Daily Sun offices to drop off new albums, started his career in 2011 as a publicist for Universal Music. He was known in the music industry for always having a big smile and giving warm hugs. He later joined Sony Music SA as a publicist before following his dreams and opening his own company. That was where he made a name for himself running a label, sampling music for artists and hosting events. He worked with award-winning stars including Kwesta, AKA, Makwa, Samthing Soweto and Terrence McKay. Pheko touched the souls of many in the industry and helped kick-start the careers of musicians. He was known as a family man who was dedicated to his wife, son and mother.
