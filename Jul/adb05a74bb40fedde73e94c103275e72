MONTHS after it brought sport to a halt globally, the Covid-19 crisis has left Zimbabwe’s national rugby coaches jobless. Not even the bailout from World Rugby last week could save their jobs. The Zimbabwe Rugby Union (ZRU) confirmed it had terminated the contracts of the coaches at various national team levels. The union said it had not generated enough income to pay the technical staff, amid the lack of international competitions during the coronavirus curse. The decision affects the developmental side, known as the Goshawks, as well as the Sevens side, the Cheetahs. Officials from the national union said new applications will be invited once the situation around coronavirus stabilised, likely next year. Only coach Brendan Dawson and his technical team that leads the Sables, Zimbabwe’s senior side, remain employed. Their contracts expire in 2023. ZRU president Aaron Jani said that the union was prioritising on rebuilding for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Zimbabwe seniors and Sevens sides were due to take part in various tournaments this year, including the SuperSport Challenge in neighbouring South Africa. This, and the Victoria and Gold Cups are major sources of income for the ZRU. World Rugby last week paid R96 000 to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19, paid through Rugby Africa. ZRU confirmed receiving the Food and Medical Relief Fund. “This assistance is intended to aid our rugby community with basic food hampers and medical assistance such as the supply of personal protective equipment to help in the fight against Covid-19,” the ZRU said in a statement. A committee has been established to ensure equitable distribution of the food hampers and PPEs to the players. – CAJ News
