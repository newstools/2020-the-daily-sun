Charlie Hlalele remains hopeful of playing for AmaZulu this season when the Premier Soccer League restarts. The 25-year-old winger, signed from Tornado FC in 2018, suffered an Achilles tendon injury that has kept him sidelined for the entire campaign. He has used the time off from football, as a result of the coronavirus, to work his way back to full fitness, and is eager to pull on the Usuthu jersey as soon as possible. Speaking to the club's official website, Hlalele said: "I sustained an injury two weeks prior to the start of the season and it took me quite a long-long time to recover. "It was a painful process, but I had to take it one day at a time. I had to do my rehab, my strength, and always tried to stay positive and disciplined." He added: "Everyone knows, to be on the side lines for so many months is not easy. "It's just that I need to work on my full fitness. If I am lucky enough, I can win my spot in the team, the squad or even in the starting line up in one of the remaining matches." AmaZulu have six matches to save their PSL status, having entered the enforced break in 15th place on the league standings. -TeamTalk Media
