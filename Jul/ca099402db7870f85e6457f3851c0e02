A mysterious fire ate away their shacks as they watched
helplessly. The incident took place in Alexander yesterday afternoon.  Speaking to Daily Sun Jonas Tshabalala (63) who lost
everything in the blaze said he was watching when the fire started but didn't
think it would cause this much damage.  "As you can see this is a double story building with
shacks on top. The fire started in one of the rooms on the second floor. My
neighbor told me we should move out things but I took her lightly," said
Jonas.  He added that in a very short space of time the fire had
spread and was uncontrollable because it was windy. “I don't understand how the firefighters work but it doesn't
make sense to me. This is the third incident since I came here over 20years
ago, and no point where the firefighters able to stop the fire before excessive
damage," he said.  Nomasonto Mbatha (32) who carried her 10 month old baby on
her back said the only thing she has is the clothes she's wearing. “I don't even know where I'll start getting clothes for my
child. I'm unemployed and homeless now. We can't blame anyone for the fire
because we all understand our living conditions. I pray good Samaritans will
come and help us," said Nomasonto.  She explained that the building is falling apart and no
longer a safe place for people to live in. “It’s been falling bits and pieces and we're trying to
collect what's left of it.  MMC of housing Mlungisi Mabaso and Joburg executive Mayor
Geoff Makhubo will be visiting the area to see how they can help.
