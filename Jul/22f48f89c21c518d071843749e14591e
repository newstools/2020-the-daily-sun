PASTOR Thomas Mamburu has appealed to people to invest in a good life, as this will enable them to forgo current pleasures for later rewards. Preaching at the Christ Family Centre in Madombidzha outside Makhado, Limpopo, Mamburu said life doesn’t have guarantees. Said the pastor: “Today, you’re happy, tomorrow in pain. And if we pay attention, there’re people who were once wealthy but things changed for them. “They became reluctant as life was so smooth. This is a wake-up call.” Mamburu read from the book of Ecc 9-10, that says whatever your hand found to do, do it with all your might. For there’s no work, nor plan, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave where you’re going. “God gave all of us time and purpose, it’s up to us how we use it.” He also gave an example of Christ who had a friend, Lazarus, from Bethany in John 11:1-9. “This man and his family used to welcome Jesus to their house. Jesus used their home as His refreshing and resting place. They didn’t know they were investing. “At a later stage, Lazarus got sick and the message was sent to Jesus. Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick, died and was buried. The Lord was touched about his death and remembered how Lazarus was committed to His ministry, hospitality and sacrifices he made.” Mamburu also spoke about the story of Dorcas, who died and all the widows stood beside her. “Dorcas invested in a good life by loving God and helping other people. Her death moved many people and God brought her back to life,” Mamburu said. “The question is, if you happen to be in trouble, how many people can defend you like the Lord did to Dorcas? “People may forget you and call you different names, but God doesn’t forget the labour of love you give to others.”
