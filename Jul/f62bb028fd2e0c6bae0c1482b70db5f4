Mother of two Tracy Kiss believes that a shot of 4-5 juices have the power to boost the immune system. The 32-year-old woman says the sperm donations from her boyfriend have kept her disease free for the past three years. Tracy says she takes three shots a week and prefers it because it is chemical free unlike pharmaceutical medicine. "I found a free and vegan-friendly alternative method to boost the body’s immune system. You don’t always know what is in pharmaceutical medicine – it is much better for the body to drink something that doesn’t contain chemicals. "It isn’t much different to a mother breastfeeding her newborn to give them the nutrients they need. It isn’t for everyone but it is packed full of vitamins and I haven’t had a cold or flu ever since drinking it in 2017 – I also put it on my face to clear up my skin," she told Metro.Tracy continued: "It is best to consume semen as close to production as possible to get the most nutrients and benefits."Tracy believes semen will help her fight off the coronavirus as she leads an active, healthy lifestyle and her supplement has helped her remain healthy.
