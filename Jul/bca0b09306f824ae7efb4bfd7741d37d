BLACK Leopards coach Alan Clark has dumped Black Leopards when they needed him the most. Just a week before the PSL resumes on 8 August, Clark has dropped a bombshell and quit the Venda-based side. According Clark, he will be going overseas to pursue other career opportunities in Europe. "It's nothing like I fought with the Leopards management, but just a career path that I wanted to take. All is good with me and the chairman (David Thidiela)," Clark said while confirming Leopards management have accepted his resignation letter. SunSport has in March reported that Clark was on his way out after Leopards apparently approachedÂ  Dan Malesela with the hope of luring him to Thohoyandou, but they could not agree on monetary deals. Leopards are at a compromised position on the PSL log table where they need consistency to avoid relegation. Club insiders say Clark has been hyped up last week while conducting training and they left shocked that he has resigned. Clark, who took over from Cavin Johnson, has been crying over the shortage of youngsters at Leopards, and was also compromised when it comes to fielding Under-23 players.
