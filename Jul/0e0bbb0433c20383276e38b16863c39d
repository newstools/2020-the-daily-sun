BANYANA Banyana striker Jermaine Seoposenwe has signed for Portuguese outfit Sporting Braga. The Banyana star's moves comes just days after she confirmed her departure from Spanish side Real Betis. She penned a two-year deal with Braga. Her time in Spain was relatively short-lived after league action was cut short by the Coronavirus. She made just three appearances before her six month contract came to an end. Speaking to the club's website about the move, Seoposenwe said:"I definitely hope to start well, be in touch with the team and fight for all the trophies. "That is the focus, working hard to achieve these goals. Liga BPI is a championship with players with a lot of skill and technique. "I am excited to be on the pitch and start training and playing with my teammates." Seoposenwe joins her Banyana teammate Thembi Kgatlana in Portugal, who plays for Benfica. Happy to announce that I have joined @SCBragaOficial . Looking forward to this new journey and a chance to make a positive impact. Want to thank everyone that played a role in making this happen! Here’s to a LONG and prosperous time in BRAGA...Time to get to work????????????? pic.twitter.com/kc2wDvHLzR
