 PEOPLE claim to have tokoloshes for various reasons. One such person, a truck driver, alleges he has a tokoloshe that drives his truck for him. A video of the driving tokoloshe recently surfaced on social media. In the video, the truck is in motion but the driver’s seat is empty. A man in the passenger seat can be heard saying: “Kuyayikhahlela okuwumfana. Ngilele nje kuyang’buka kufake ne-mask. “Ngiyabonga, madoda. Yeyi! Kodwa akulula ukuyithola. Kufuneka uqine ephaketheni (the tokoloshe is a good driver. I’m sleeping while the tokoloshe in a mask keeps looking at me. Thank you, but it’s not easy to get one. You must have deep pockets). A long-distance truck driver who used to deliver furniture told Daily Sun: “I had to drive the truck of a colleague, who was off-duty, from Joburg to Kroonstaad. “I was driving with two assistants and sleepy. I guess we ended up dosing off.” He claims he woke up at the delivery address and didn’t know which routes he took as he was fast asleep. “When I asked the guys how we got here, they said they fell asleep before me and assumed I was the one driving. “When I told my other colleagues about this, they said I wasn’t the first person to experience that and nobody wanted anything to do with that truck” Sangomas said this practice has been going on for years and was a simple reminder they shouldn’t be taken for granted. Gobela Mtimande Ngwenya saidthe practice was associated with ukuthwala. “This is what a lot of long-distance truck drivers do. They want to do a lot of trips and need help from ‘abafana’. “I don’t support this practice. It ends up causing unnecessary accidents. Once the tokoloshe gets angry with its master, a war erupts on the road.” Makhosi Maliyavuza said: “Government and some citizens take sangomas for granted. “They know what we can do and continue to test us. One day something big is going to happen.”
