YOUR fingernails can give you a signal when something in your body isn't right. People say your nails are a reflection of your health and health professionals have confirmed it. If your fingernails or toenails look different than normal, try to find help. According to WEBMD, here is what your nails say about your health: Dark Lines Beneath the Nail - Dark lines beneath the nail should be investigated as soon as possible. They are sometimes caused by melanoma, which is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Gnawed Nails - Biting your nails may be nothing more than an old habit, but in some cases it's a sign of constant anxiety that could benefit from treatment. Nail biting or picking has also been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. If you can't stop, it's worth discussing with your doctor. Pale Nails - Extremely pale nails can sometimes be a sign of serious illness including anaemia, congestive heart failure, liver disease or even malnutrition. White Nails - If the nails are mostly white, with darker rims, this can indicate liver problems, such as hepatitis. Fingers that look jaundiced may be another sign of liver trouble. Yellow Nails - One of the most common causes of yellow nails is a fungal infection. As the infection worsens, the nail bed may pull back, and nails may thicken and crumble. In rare cases, yellow nails can indicate a more serious condition such as severe thyroid disease, lung disease, diabetes or the skin disease psoriasis. Bluish Nails - Nails with a bluish tint can mean the body isn't getting enough oxygen. This could indicate a lung problem, such as emphysema. Some heart problems can be associated with bluish nails. Cracked or Split Nails - Dry, brittle nails that often crack or split have been linked to thyroid disease. Cracking or splitting combined with a yellowish hue is likely due to a fungal infection.
