According to the mum, when she was bathing her daughter the girl told her it hurt. She tried to check what was wrong, but her child started crying. “I asked her what had happened, and she continued to cry,” she said. “The next morning I asked her again, but she didn’t want to speak.” She took her to her gogo’s place, and when she fetched her later she noticed her trousers were dirty and worn wrong. She asked what had happened, but the child cried. “My mum and I checked her and realisedshe’d been raped,” she said. “We took her to the clinic, which confirmed she’d been penetrated – and not just once.” The woman said her daughter told them who raped her. One suspect is the uncle and the other a spaza shop owner. They reported the matter to the police and the suspects were bust but released the following day.
