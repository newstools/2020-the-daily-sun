AMARHARHABE Prince Jonguxolo Sandile will take his place as king following the death of his mum, Queen Noloyiso Sandile. The queen, widow of late King Maxhobha Sandile, died of coronavirus-related causes last Wednesday and was buried at Mngqesha Great Place in King William’s Town, Eastern Cape, yesterday. The queen, sister to King Goodwill Zwelithini, became regent after the death of her husband in 2011. Her son was too young to become king at the time. Royal spokesman Prince Sigcawu said as Jonguxolo was now 28, there was no reason to have an acting king. Sigcawu said papers would be submitted to Premier Oscar Mabuyane, who’d forward them to President Cyril Ramaphosa for the prince to be endorsed as king. In a tribute to his mum, Jonguxolo remembered her as strict but caring. “You were a good mother who taught us not to walk around with a royal attitude,” he said. “God has given us our time with you. Go well, Ndabezitha! Mageba!” Minerals and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, who delivered a virtual eulogy on behalf of the president, said the queen had clearly understood her duty to her family and people when she took over.
