Protests are not calls to reject the ANC! These are the words shared in a letter wrote by anti-apartheid stalwart Andrew Mlangeni which was read during his official virtual memorial service which is currently underway. Reading the letter, the ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule said: “Our people do not follow the ANC blindly as they do to religion. Our people support the ANC because of its track record of over 100 years of selfless struggle. “The protests that some of us find so uncomfortable should tell you that these protests are demands for attraction not calls to reject the ANC government,” Magashule read. Magashule described Mlangeni as a selfless servant and an outstanding volunteer of the struggle. Magashule said: “An iconic father of our nation. “He has lived so well with so much dedication, provided us with a real life example of how it should be done. He was a backroom boy and he was proud of it. Long live the spirit of Mlangeni long live,” added Magashule. Mlangeni who is the last Rivonia trialist died early this week at the Military One hospital in Tshwane following abdominal related complications. A series of virtual memorial services have been held since Friday in celebration of his life. On Sunday, the Director of the memorial was the Minister of Human Settlements, Water and sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu who described Mlangeni’s death as a greatest loss to the nation. The leader of the ANC Women’s League Bathabile Dlamini said Mlangeni was very welcoming and treated everyone like a comrade. She said: “He was very outspoken and never waited for anyone to speak for him.“He will never make you an enemy, he will talk to you nicely and treat you like a comrade. He never undermined people and he had utmost respect for everyone. He worked very hard up until his last days. “We plead to the coming generation, the generation after Mlangeni to lead us to a better future,” added Dlamini.
