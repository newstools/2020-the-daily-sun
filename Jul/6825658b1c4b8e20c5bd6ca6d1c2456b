 Thokoza residents are going to be in the dark
again after a transformer was burnt. The Ekurhuleni spokesman, Themba Gadebe told
Daily Sun that the fire had also affected the adjacent transformer and all
cable work inside the substation. Gadebe said repairs are underway but these
might take some time. "If all goes well, it will take three
weeks. All cables inside and feeding to the substation must be replaced,"
he said. "The fire also damaged all 33kV control
room switchgear panels which are used for protection. The estimated lead time
for replacement is three months," he added. Gadebe also told Daily Sun that the City of
Ekurhuleni is working on finding a temporary solution to supply a portion of
affected customers, even on a load reduction rotational schedule, in the next
three weeks.  Residents are unhappy and said they always
have electricity problems every month. "It has become a norm and some of us
have resorted to buying seshebo every day because buying a lot of it and
putting it in the fridge is useless, it'll rot," said Maxaba Suzanne said
on Facebook. Busiswa Mrasi said substations are always on
fire and they never know the real reason. "There're always repairs underway. It's
tiring, we don't need these temporary solutions, we need something that'll keep
the electricity on for the entire winter," said Busiswa.
