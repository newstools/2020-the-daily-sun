 SUZAN Kutumela was crushed when her six-week-old baby was stolen on Tuesday. The 19-year-old from Oukasie in Brits, North West, told cops she was with a friend in the Brits CBD when they met a woman called Kedibone at the post office. She went to the taxi rank with Kedibone, who also had a baby on her back. Police spokes- woman Maria Nkabinde said the two went to buy food at Shoprite Centre. “Suzan left her baby with the suspect. When she returned the suspect was nowhere to be found.” Suzan asked if people had seen the suspect, but with no success. She pleaded with them to come forward if they had information about baby Ofentse’s whereabouts. The suspect was wearing a brown jacket while a baby was tied around her back with a pink towel. Anyone with information should call Detective Sergeant Jonas Mogotlane on 060 970 9200 or 08600 10111.
