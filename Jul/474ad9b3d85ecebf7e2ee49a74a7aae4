South Korean epidemiologists have found that you are more likely to catch the coronavirus at home than from strangers. A study published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on July 16 looked in detail at 5 706 "index patients" who had tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 59 000 people who came into contact with them Reuters reported.

The findings showed just two out of 100 infected people had caught the virus from non-household contacts, while one in 10 had contracted the disease from their own families. The results showed that just two out of 100 infected people had caught the virus from non-household contacts, while one in 10 had contracted the disease from their own family household. “This is probably because these age groups are more likely to be in close contact with family members as the group is in more need of protection or support,” Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and one of the authors of the study, told a briefing.

Children could be less likely to transmit the virus, but our data is not enough to confirm this hypothesis,” said Choe.
