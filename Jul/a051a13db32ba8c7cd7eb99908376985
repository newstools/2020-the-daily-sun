DJ Chynaman is spreading his wings. Born Siyabonga Gumede from Sundumbili in northern KZN, the DJ landed himself a role in Mzansi's most-watched telenovela Uzalo. He plays the role of a rich man, who spends money on girls to entertain him. Chynaman said that he was excited to appear on Uzalo where he expressed his acting skills. "Having appeared on Uzalo proves that an artist should be able to multitask. An artist shouldn't be known for only one artwork. I am humble and grateful," said Chynaman.

But he never looked back since he had travelled to different countries such as Zimbabwe, USA (New York), Swaziland and others. He said he hopes that acting on Uzalo is the beginning of great things. "I believe that my talent will be highly recognised and I will see myself on big sccreens in future. What excites me the most is that Uzalo is the biggest production which is watched by millions of viewers," said Chynaman. He first appeared early in July when he offered Zekhethelo (played by Nyalleng Thibedi) a place to sleep over in exchange for entertainment.
