Gender-Based Violence remains a recurring scourge in Mzansi. As a result, the United Democratic Movement (UDM) has called
for the government to have a referendum on the death penalty. The party’s General Secretary, Bongani Msomi said there have
been calls from various sectors from of the society for the death penalty to be
reintroduced. “Especially in terms of gender-based violence (GBV),
femicide, as well as child abuse and murder, the United Democratic Movement
reiterates its longstanding call that the government must allow for the voice
of the people to be heard,” Msomi said in a statement. ALSO READ: KILLER DAD BACK IN COURT! Msomi said the existing punishments for the perpetrators are
not able to deal with the scourge. “Protection orders have become mere pieces of paper and ink
and the perpetrators do not take them seriously, and the police fail to enforce
them. “The UDM calls upon the government of the day to take GBV
seriously and to stop paying lip service as it makes no difference to the lives
of those who live with daily abuse,” he added. Msomi said governmental leaders cannot take decisions alone
while excluding the people who forced to deal with devastating situations.
