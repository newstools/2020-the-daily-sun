THERE is a bitter war over the late Sipho Mahole’s body. The family said his ex-girlfriend didn’t even tell them Sipho (40) had died. “We asked ourselves how she could keep such a secret,” said his mum, Zodwa Mathibela (59). “To us she was not a wife because Sipho paid R6 000 for lobola and still had to pay R30 000 when they separated five years ago. “She has no right to bury my son because, in customary law, she’s not the wife.” Sipho’s brother, Bonginkosi, (38) said Motlapule Makhetha (29) and Sipho separated five years ago, but he supported his five-year-old son. “My brother had a new girlfriend,” he said. Motlapule came looking for Sipho on 15 June, but he wasn’t home. “We were surprised to see her after five years. I contacted my brother to say Motlapule and his child were waiting for him. He came and drove them to the Vaal. That was the last time we heard from him.” They got worried when he didn’t return home. His phone was off. “Mum asked that we look for him. We were denied entry to Motlapule’s home. “We had to ask cops to escort us. We were denied a chance to see Sipho and were told she wasn’t there.” They opened a missing persons case. Last Thursday they received a call from Sipho’s colleague passing his condolences after his ex allegedly went to his work to tell them Sipho was dead. She was there to claim his money. “All she wants is his body so she can claim his money. She came with her undertaker to remove the body. “We got a court order to stop her. We’re not happy with the cause of death. The pathologist said it was corona yet he wasn’t wearing a mask when he showed us the body.” Motlapule asked to be called later, but her phone went to voicemail. The next day someone claiming to be her spokesman called to say she could release Sipho’s body, but not his car or ID.
