AS  Gauteng is set
to  become Mzansi’s corona
epicentre,officials are getting ready for the worst case scenarios and readying
more 1 million graves. Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku spoke to media at a
site in Tshwane where an excavator was digging graves at the site with a capacity
of about 36 000 graves. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika,Masuku said it was an uncomfortable
topic as heath practitioners but they had to face reality. Yesterday’s numbers showed that Gauteng had more than 71 000
active cases and 478 deaths, nearing the Western Cape’s 72 156 cases. Masuku said the province was preparing over 1,5 million graves.  #Covid_19SA Gauteng Government is preparing for the worst.

Municipalities have for the past two months have been checking for available
land as the  numbers have been
increasing.” He added that it had become necessary for the preparations
before burials. “The statistics have indicated that there is a 15%-30%
increase in deaths from last year ... we also have other causes of death but we
are seeing the pressure in the system generally”,he told TimesLive.  City of Tshwane COO James Murphy  told TimesLive that the site was being
prepared in case there was a need for mass burials.  “In total we have more than 200,000 spaces, including normal
burial spaces, but our major concern is to prepare for mass burial.
Fortunately, as the MEC indicated, the numbers in Tshwane are still very low.
We are going to get to a time where we will not be able to do single burials,
we are going to have to do mass burials and that would have to be directed by
government itself,” he said.
