THE PSL has extended their deadline to complete the 2019-20 Absa Premiership and the Nedbank Cup to 31 August. Initially, it was planned that the season will be concluded at the end of July as per Fifa recommendations. The league’s Board of Governors, which comprise 32 PSL and GladAfrica Championship club chairmen, held a virtual meeting yesterday where there was no clarity on a number of issues. SunSport understands that there was a big debate on clubs having to foot their medical bills, as well as travel and accommodation when the season resumes, at a date yet to be confirmed. It is understood that the league is in no financial position to pay for clubs’ medicals and accommodation. All the 32 clubs will be in one province where they will play in two venues to complete the stalled season in a safe environment, hopefully free of coronavirus. With regards to training, the PSL’s immediate formalities are for each club to provide Michael Murphy, League’s Covid-19 Compliance Officer, with a copy of their operational plan and Compliance Officer. The clubs can immediately return to full training if they obliged. “The league has six weeks to conclude this season’s programme,” our mole said. “I refuse to accept that the league does not have money, but be as it may, clubs are going to suffer more financially when they have to pay for their medical bills and hotels. “A club could be forced to spend about R2 500 for one player’s medicals. And worse is that clubs are further expected to do other medical check ups, not only Covid-19 tests. “Clubs are not even sure whether they will receive their July monthly grants or not – after Absa did not renew their league sponsorship. “Surely clubs that are not financially stable will collapse with all these costs associated with completing the season risk free. It could easily cost each club over R1 million to finish the season.”
