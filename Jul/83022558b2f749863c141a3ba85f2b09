Covid-19 is killing people every day – people we know or live with. To make matters worse, there’s a serious problem of non-compliance by organisations, including government departments, to regulations. Some big companies apparently hide Covid-19 cases from their employees. And they fail to decontaminate and sanitise the workplace, thereby risking workers’ lives. Last week, a woman called me seeking advice about her employer’s failure to comply. The poor woman has comorbidities and claimed she declared that to her employer. Comorbidity means more than one disease or condition is present in a person at the same time. But she’s being forced to work, regardless of her condition. A day or so ago, another woman called regarding the same problem. She told me employees who had tested positive were forced to continue working. They were sent home after threatening to go on strike. The two women have reported the matter to the departments of health and labour, but received no help. If companies continue conducting themselves in this fashion, people are going to die like flies. I’d like to urge Daily Sun to investigate such cases and expose them.
