Chicken Licken has one of the undeniably creative adverts in the game and they always hit home. Chicken Licken premiered their advert on various social media platforms titled: "It takes a #SoulfulNation to make it through these tough times. That’s why for our new ad, we are honouring the ordinary people who have kept us entertained and our spirits up during #LockdownSA." The ad features local social media comedian Tyson Ngubeni, who speaks in a foreign accent. "South Africa. A nation that's always been known to overcome adversity. But what exactly makes them such a soulful people?" asks Tyson in the opening scene. WATCH AD BELOW: It takes a #SoulfulNation to make it through these tough times.
