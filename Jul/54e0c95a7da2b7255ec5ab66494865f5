TWO Mozambican men who are accused of being in possession of rhino horns and shark fins will remain in jail until their case is finalised in the Middleburg Regional Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Father Alberto Nharreluga (47) and his son Alberto Nharreluga (Jnr) (27) were bust in April last year after being found in possession of two rhino horns and shark fins. Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said the rhino horns and shark fins were found by members of Mpumalanga police flying squad on the N4 next to Belfast. She said they were found hidden inside the suspects’ vehicle while the two were travelling from Mozambique to Gauteng. “During the arrest, the suspects tried to entice the police with a kickback, but failed. “Then the serious corruption investigation members were alerted and they processed the crime scene and charged the suspects with possession of endangered species, and an additional corruption charge,” said Sekgotodi. “Since their arrests, the Nharrelugas attempted to apply for bail several time but their effort was unsuccessful and investigation has been completed. Their trial on both alleged crimes, possession of endangered species and corruption, will start on 28 October this year in the Middelburg Regional Court while they are remanded in custody.”
