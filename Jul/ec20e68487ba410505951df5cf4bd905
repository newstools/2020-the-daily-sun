SOUTH African 400m hurdler Wenda Nel has recovered from Covid-19. According Team SA, the 32-year-old, on Monday laced up her running shoes and tested herself against the stopwatch for the first time in a period of four months without running. "My heart rate is still a bit high," Nel as she was quoted on the TeamSA official website. "Not super high but higher than it used to be. I think the best would be if I take things slightly easy for a week or so to enable to give my 'lungs' time to wake up. "I was lucky in that I did not experience any of the severe Covid-19 symptoms. I only had a continuous headache. "Still, I cannot ignore the fact that I did test positive and that the virus was in my system." The Tuks Athlete who has been a force in South African athletics since 2009Â admitted that at times during the national lockdown, there were times when she was slightly frustrated. She said: "In the past, it was easy to say we grateful for this or that. It is, however, only when something really gets stopped or taken away that you realise what it meant to you. "I have now more appreciation for everything that goes with being an athlete. I can honestly say I am more motivated than before. Nel won her first senior national title in 2010, and since went on to win another seven national titles in the 400m-hurdles. Some of her career highlights were setting a personal best time of 54.37s in 2015 Beijing Olympics, finishing fifth the same year at the world championships and winning a bronze medal during the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.
