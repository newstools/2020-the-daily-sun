WHEN
stalwart Andrew Mlangeni left his home for the hospital, he had a feeling that
he might not return. This was
according to Andrew and June Mlangeni Foundation chair Hlengiwe Mkhize who
briefed the media briefing on the funeral details of the late struggle icon. "When
Ntate went to the hospital, he made a comment at the door expressing doubt on
whether he will come back to the house," she said. Mkhize said
the funeral will take place on Wednesday at the University of Joburg Soweto
campus. Yesterday,
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Mlangeni will get a category one state
funeral. "The
family is grateful that the president saw it fitting to give him that respect.
We think this will go a long way even for the community of Dube. "Ntate
Mlangeni's may have been old, but no one is ever ready for this tragic
loss." Mkhize said
as the family and foundation they are not gonna be able to give much
information, as the procedure will be taken over by the state. She said
the procedures would be shared by the presidential team at the right time. ANC's
Nomvula Mokonyane also visited the house earlier today. She said:
"We've met the family; our engagements are continuing to work on the
programme that will work until we lay him to rest. She added:
"As we have done with other bereavements during the lockdown, we will be
encouraging our members to respect the regulations and conform with the rules,
so we don't put pressure on the family." Later today
there is a memorial service that will be led by former President Jacob Zuma and
the African National Congress. There will
be an official memorial service, organised by the ANC on Sunday.
