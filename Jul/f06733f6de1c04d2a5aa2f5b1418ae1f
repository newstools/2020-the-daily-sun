A KZN MEC and a mayor have been linked to an abortion scandal involving a young woman. Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka and Newcastle Mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba have been dragged into the bitter fight between ANC provincial legislature member, Jomo Sibiya, and a 23-year-old woman over a child. During an ANC briefing in Durban yesterday, provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli announced a task team would be established to investigate allegations Sibiya tried to force her to abort their child. Ntuli announced the team, led by former premier Willies Mchunu, would summon Hlomuka and Mahlaba to answer questions about their alleged involvement in the matter. “The team has been given until 24 August to submit the report to the provincial working committee,” said Ntuli. According to the woman’s family, she met Sibiya in Joburg last January at the party’s annual birthday celebrations. The woman, bust for practising as a doctor with a fake qualification, gave birth in April while in custody. She appeared in the Inkandla Magistrates Court on Monday and the case was postponed to 29 September. Cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the suspect was facing fraud charges. But Sibiya couldn’t comment as the matter was under investigation. Hlomuka’s spokesman, Senzo Mzila, said he wasn’t aware of the allegations. The mayor’s spokesman, Mlungisi Khumalo, said he’d subject himself to an ANC investigation. Mahlaba won’t say anything about the allegations as the person implicating him was anonymous in a letter the ANC was said to have received.
