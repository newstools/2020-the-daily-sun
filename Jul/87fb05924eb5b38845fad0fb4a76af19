IT’S not every day that one sees drivers smiling at a traffic cop. But Mokgele Motlohi is adored by motorists because he makes sure their cars aren’t damaged by bad roads. The Thaba Nchu traffic cop fixes potholes! Taximan Thapelo Seoje (34) said: “This is one cop I won’t mind getting a traffic fine from. “He’s doing more than what his job requires. I’ve never seen a traffic cop who works with garden tools while in uniform. “He hates potholes and soil that gets stuck on the roadside after the rain. He always makes sure roads are safe to travel on.” A private driver, Lerato Mosiako (29) from Morolong section, said: “I used to panic when I saw a traffic cop, but I love this man for doing more than what’s required of him. “He’s very friendly and professional. I’ve seen him filling up potholes in town with sand. “He pushes a wheelbarrow filled with sand and works like a construction worker.  A colleague, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “He’s the most passionate worker. He always says potholes damage cars and cause many accidents. “He’s been doing this for a long time and management knows about him, but he’s not getting any awards.” Motlohi told Daily Sun: “I started fixing roads in 2016. I joined the force in 2010 during the Soccer World Cup. “In 2018 I was attacked by three people who broke my neck, but that didn’t discourage me.  “I was helped by hawkers and taximen, and the culprits were arrested. “It feels good to know that we work together as a team. Motorists understand when I give them traffic fines or instruct them. “I remove the soil next to the roads and fix the potholes. This protects people’s cars.”
