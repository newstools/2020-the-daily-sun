SHE has been struggling to find a man for six years and struggling in other parts of her life. So she visited her grandfathers’ graves in Atteridgeville Cemetery, Tshwane, on Sunday to talk to them about her bad luck. Lehlohonolo Mamabolo said visiting the graves was her only hope. “I can’t live like this anymore. I have consulted sangomas and prophets, but nothing is working as they all tell me to look for my father and follow our roots,” she said. The 35-year-old from Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, said she was looking for a good and mature man. “I don’t know why men do not look at me as I’m a beautiful woman.” Lehlohonolo runs a mobile beauty spa in Joburg. She said people have promised her contracts only to change their minds without saying a word. “This hurts as I am missing out on opportunities because of the bad luck that is following me. My father, who I never met physically, came to me in spirit on Saturday. He appeared to me as a white dove while I was talking on the phone,” she said. Lehlohonolo’s aunt Gladys Khoza, who is also a spiritual healer, said they took Lehlohonolo to the cemetery to connect with her ancestors for the first time in 35 years. She said she believed her life will be better after consulting and uniting with the ancestors. “We’re happy. This is a family reunion and it means a lot to us. Good things will now follow her,” she said. Sangoma Kholeka Dlamini said it was important for Lehlohonolo to connect with her ancestors. “It’s important to visit graves. “People who have died still hear us and will respond,” she said.
