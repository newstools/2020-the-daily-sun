WORKERS accused of stealing meat at a petrol station were apparently frisked and stripped by the manager and his assistant. “The whole shift was called into the locker room and the manager broke the locks of the lockers and instructed everyone to undress,” said a woman who works at the petrol station in Phalaborwa, Limpopo. He was accusing them of stealing meat used to make takeaways. Male and female alike were allegedly pushed around and shoved into a locker room! “The male manager and female supervisor body-searched us, and the man groped our private parts,” said a female worker. “He boasted that there was nothing we could do because he’s well-connected at the local labour department offices. “We have nowhere to go. We don’t want to lose our jobs, but we’re tired of this.” The petrol station owner told Daily Sun the manager broke the lockers to fumigate for Covid-19. But he later said: “I think there was a misunderstanding. I have instructed the manager to apologise.” When contacted, the manager claimed to be somebody else yet his name and number appear on the petrol station’s list of contacts. The staff member said the manager boasted he had connections and opening a police case would be fruitless. “We’re often called words like monkeys and k*****s,” said the woman. “He says he’s well connected. We don’t know who to trust.” The workers said yesterday they’d open a case even though they feared victimisation. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that an inquiry was opened at Phalaborwa Police Station. Ngoepe said cops took statements from the workers and would open a case after viewing video footage.
