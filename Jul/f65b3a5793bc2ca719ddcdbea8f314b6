A family is devastated after sand collapsed on their their kids and killed them. The two boys were assisting a man who was digging sand for
building from a hole. The young boys Njabulo Mthethwa (9) and his friend Zipho
Mthethwa (12), were busy digging when suddenly the sand of the hole they were
digging from collapsed onto them on Thursday. The boys from Lindelani in KwaDukuza north of KZN
tragically died on the scene. IPSS Medical Rescues search and rescue paramedicsâ€™
spokesman Paul Herbst said it is believed that the children were helping a man
dig for building sand. He said apparently the man left with a load of sand and
when he returned, he noticed that the hole had collapsed. "The man started to dig and came across a body and
contacted authorities. On arrival of IPSS paramedics found that both boys, aged
12 and 9, showed no sign of life, and were declared dead on scene," he
said. Njabulo's uncle Sakhile Mthemthwa (29) said the man was
hired by their neighbour to fetch the sand and the boys went with him. "It's sad but we still want him to come back and
explain to us why he left the children alone. He shouldn't have left them
because this wouldn't have happened," he said. He said the families are both devastated following this
tragic incident. "I don't want to talk about this tragic incident
because it has caused a lot of pain for us," he said. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the
matter. Mbele said two boys were helping a man to dig for
building sand when the wall of the hole they were digging in collapsed on them. "An inquest docket was opened at KwaDukuza police
station for investigation," said Mbele.
