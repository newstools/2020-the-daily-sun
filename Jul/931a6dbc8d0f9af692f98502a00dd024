RAFAEL Mabunda is not at peace after his son was killed. All he wants is justice. The 55-year-old from Meadowlands, Soweto, said his son Nhlamulo (19) was robbed of his iPhone in July. Rafael was at a funeral in Alexandra when he heard Nhlamulo had been rushed to hospital. “I was called by my crying daughter. She wasn’t sure if he was dead,” he said. He identified his son’s body when he reached the hospital. He said a friend of Nhlamulo’s had told him Nhlamulo was called by someone to meet him at a park. Said Rafael: “He said the person never showed up. “He told us as they were leaving, they were approached by seven men who demanded they hand over their cellphones. “He claimed he gave them his, but Nhlamulo refused and was stabbed in the neck.” Three men who saw the incident had told Rafael his son was attacked by two men. “I’m questioning a lot of things. My heart won’t be alright until I find out what happened,” he said. Sergeant Octavia Thebe said a murder case was opened, but no arrests had been made yet.
