ABOUT 2,5 million pupils returned to school yesterday after sitting at home for over three months. Grades R, 6 and 11 pupils joined grade 7 and matrics, who returned last month. It was alleged seven teachers tested positive for Covid-19. Parent Sipho Nkabinde said he would not be sending his child to Lingithjudu High School near Bronkhorstspruit. Teachers, whoâ€™re shortstaffed, were worried about ensuring pupils followed regulations. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said 10 000 teachers out of 400 000 who applied had been given permission to work from home. A grade 6 pupil told the SunTeam she hoped to recover the lost time without more disruption. Parent Nokulunga Mkhaliphi was happy the department decided not to open for grade R. At Mzuvele High School in KwaMashu, north of Durban, everything was in order when grade 11 pupils returned. The SunTeam visited the school and found a screening desk and social distancing marks on the floor. The school experienced several break-ins during lockdown, and two offices containing books were burnt.At Nqabakazulu High School, there was chaos last week but everything was calm when grade 11s returned yesterday.
