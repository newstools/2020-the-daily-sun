He said: “I’ve not buried a member of my church due to corona.  “We need to partner and pray together against the virus. We can’t let it kill us.” Mboro said some pastors had left the ministry, which needed cars to come to church, visit the sick, and attend burials. “We have pastors who quit. They can’t pay their bonds and cars,” he said. He decided to hold a drive-in service to reach out to people. “The nation is depressed. More and more people are losing their jobs,” he said. “Those who used to resort to alcohol and cigarettes are struggling because of the ban.  “That’s where we as men of God come in: giving people hope and uplifting spirits through prayer and providing solutions. “We can’t just fold our arms while people are dying.” He believed prayer could defeat the virus. “But we shouldn’t disregard safety precautions,” he said.

I feel better and stronger, but I’m still under quarantine,” she said.
