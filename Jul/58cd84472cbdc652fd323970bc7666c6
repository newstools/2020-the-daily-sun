SHE was known as a Miss Bachelorette SA Finalist 2020. But people in her kasi are now calling her Miss Covid-19 after Mpho Nyangintsimbi tested positive. Sadly, her father, mum and brother (16) also tested positive for the virus. The 29-year-old from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said what made matters worse was that they lived with her daughter (10) and brother (11), who’d tested negative. “It was really hard because I couldn’t hold my baby and we couldn’t sit together. We needed to ensure we kept our distance and each room has a hand sanitiser.” “We started practising social distancing. Luckily, everyone has their own room, so no one shares a bed. We don’t even sit in the living room together,” she said. Mpho told Daily Sun while some people have been supportive, others were being spiteful and have turned her family into a joke. She said she heard a WhatsApp group was created to solely gossip about her. “I’d expect this kind of behaviour from kids who don’t know much about the virus. But it is sad coming from old people. It’s like we brought the virus to Hammanskraal.” Mpho said it all started when her mum tested positive for Covid-19. She’s now recovering in hospital. She said her mum had the symptoms, but they all thought it was flu. “We took her to the doctor and they gave her flu medication. “But things became worse. She started showing severe symptoms and we rushed her to the hospital, where it was confirmed she had contracted Covid-19,” said Mpho. She started showing symptoms a few days later and got tested. “The results came back positive. My dad and my brother also had symptoms and got tested,” she said. Her dad Bongani (51) said he never thought he’d get the virus. “People need to start taking this seriously. they need to educate themselves about this virus.” Yesterday was the family’s last day of self-isolation.
