The 39-year-old from Weilers Farm, near Orange Farm, was blamed for the death of two dogs which were hit by a speeding car outside his boss’ house in Walkerville, south of Joburg, last week. Thulani, a security guard, was on night shift when the dogs died. 24K FINE FOR CALLING BUSINESSMAN A "QWAQWA K***R!" He told Daily Sun: “The wife quickly dashed out, leaving the gate open. She’s done this several times before. “I heard the sound of a speeding car and a loud bang after she left. The car hit two dogs.” Thulani said he alerted the wife when she got back. “She cried hysterically when she saw the dogs in the street,” he said. “She went to get her husband at a neighbour’s house, where he was attending a party. “He pointed a gun at me, swore at me and called me a bastard and the K-word.” Thulani said he opened a case against his boss, but he was asked to drop the charges on condition that he’d keep his job. He said he did what he was asked as jobs are hard to find. But he was told to “f**k off” when he went back to work. The charges have been reinstated. Captain Mavela Masondo said investigations continued.
