THE family of the late Tshegofatso Pule expressed frustration at yet another postponement of the court case. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Tshegofatso’s uncle Tumisang Katake said he was disappointed. “We were only informed today that the magistrate is on leave. This is all emotionally draining,” he said. Tumisang said the Roodepoort Magistrates Court was closed last week due to Covid-19 decontamination. “We’re now told the case will proceed on the 23rd,” he said.  EFF deputy secretary-general Poppy Mailola said: “They’re already showing signs of failure with this case. If no one cares to inform the family, clearly it isn’t a priority.” The EFF would continue supporting the family.  The suspect, Muzikayise Malephane (31), faces a charge of murder following Tshegofatso’s brutal murder. Tshegofatso (28) was eight months pregnant at the time of her death. She was last seen on 4 June leaving her home in Meadowlands, Soweto, to visit her lover in Florida. Her body was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort.
