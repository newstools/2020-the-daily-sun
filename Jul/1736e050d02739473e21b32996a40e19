CIVIL organisations Equal Education and Section 27 say Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and her MECs are playing games with the court, parents and pupils. That is what was heard in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane yesterday. The organisations brought an urgent case to the court to get assurance that meals were being provided at schools to nine million pupils benefiting from the school nutrition programme. They accused Motshekga and education MECs of refusing to provide food to pupils. Equal Education’s general secretary, Noncedo Madubedube, said the department failed to provide meals to all pupils, not only to those back at schools. The organisation’s legal representative Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi told the court the pupils’ one guaranteed meal was taken away overnight. Advocate Marius Oosthuizen, representing the national and provincial education departments, said the accusations were unfounded. “The idea that the minister doesn’t care about the hungry children is absolutely untrue,” he said. Oosthuizen told the court the department was working on a plan to ensure pupils received meals. Judge Sulet Potterill concluded the hearing and promised to make a judgment as soon as possible.
