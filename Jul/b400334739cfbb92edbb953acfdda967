A FAMILY has been living in fear since a relative accused of killing and mutilating two brothers was released from police custody. The bodies of Kadimo and Buti Mokopanele were apparently found in different toilets in Zeerust, North West, with their private parts, eyes and tongues missing. After the incident in Khunotswana Village, a relative of the victims and his friend were accused of the murders. James Tshubi, the uncle of the brothers, said since the suspect’s release, no one in the family was able to sleep. “We don’t feel safe. We stay at our house during the day and at night, we go sleep over at the houses of friends or relatives,” he told Daily Sun. James said he wished the police had informed them when the suspect was released so they could take steps to protect themselves. “After the incident, I took him to the police myself. “That’s why I thought it would have been better if they informed me of his release,” he said. A resident said it was believed they were sent by a tavern owner who was told by a sangoma to get body parts. James said the family was still waiting for a forensic report to confirm whether the body parts were missing. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed the case was provisionally withdrawn, pending an analysis report from the forensic laboratory.
