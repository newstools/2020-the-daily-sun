SUPERSPORT United CEO Stan Matthews says the club is not in a hurry to sign New Zealand striker Jeremy Brockie. The Christchurch-born forward is hoping to re-join Matsatsantsa a Pitori after a dismal spell at crosstown rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. The 32-year-old was loaned out to Maritzburg United by Sundowns and he also struggled in KwaZulu-Natal and desperately wants to go back home to Matsatsantsa a Pitori. Matthews said the club is not in a position to commit to Brockie right now, but the three-time league champions have extended their loan agreement of three players. Kamohelo Mahlatsi and Athenkosi Dlala are at University of Pretoria, while Kagiso Malinga is on loan to Swallows FC in the GladAfrica Championships. “We decided to extend the players’ stay at the two clubs until the end of the season. As for Brockie, we are not in a position commit to him or any other player at this stage. We will re-assess our position towards the middle of August when the season has been concluded,” said Matthews. The no-nonsense Matthews said Brockie must not rush them to take him back and that he must wait just like any other player that wants to be a part of their team for next season. Matthews said that the coach Kaitano Tembo will also sign his new deal at the end of the season and that they are hopeful that he will help the club to end the campaign in the top four. “Tembo’s contract is ready for him to sign and he will do that after we have played our remaining six matches,” explains Matthews. The Tshwane giants are third on the log table with 40 points from 24 matches. Matthews said the players are excited and looking forward to resume training. “The players are happy and can’t wait to restart training. They just want to play football again and we share in their excitement. The club will adhere to the league’s rules and regulations and as soon as we are given the green light to start training, we are ready,” said Matthews.
