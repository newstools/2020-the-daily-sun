SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has praised his players’ discipline and mental strength in the four months they spent away from each other during lockdown. Tembo is pleased that his players did not go easy on themselves during the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, keeping their fitness levels as high as possible. This has made the Zimbabwean-born mentor’s job much easier in the past few days as his charges returned to training. Speaking to his club’s official website, Tembo said the first week of their return to training has gone much smoother than he had anticipated, owing much to the shape in which his players returned. “The mood is very good and that made it easier for us to get back to work with everyone in the right frame of mind with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm. It was emotional seeing the guys for the first time after four months,” said Tembo. “You could see the smiles and the excitement on the guys’ faces. The boys had training programmes during isolation and I’m very proud of them for being professional in terms of following their routine. “The focal point of our first week was the fitness condition of our players, which meant we had to go through a battery of tests and then continue building their fitness levels gradually.” SuperSport are one of many PSL teams that released a few players at the end of last month following the expiry of their contacts. Players like Thabo Mnyamane, Thabo Qalinge, Thakazani Mbanjwa and Thato Lesoma were not retained, while captain Dean Furman returned to England. “We would like to thank them for their contribution to the success of the club and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavours,” added Tembo. SuperSport currently sit third on the PSL log behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns, with just six matches left. They are six points behind Chiefs, who have eight fixtures to play.
