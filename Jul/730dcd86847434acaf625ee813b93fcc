KAIZER Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro says they are working hard to ensure they are in "the right mindset for the restart of the league." Amakhosi have returned to training ahead of a proposed a August restart to the 2019/20 Premiership season. While the 31-year-old defender admits it has been hard to adjust to the new training methods, Castro knows safety is key to completing the currently suspended season.Speaking to the club's official website, the player said: "It's good to be in our happy place again, because the pitch is our home. "The first week was a bit hard for us, also, because we couldn't train in groups. We needed to keep distance from one another."Now, however, we are training together and that feels much better. We are training hard to become fit, regain our on-the-ball confidence, and to get into the right mindset for the restart of the league.‚ÄùChiefs are currently top of the league standings, with Mamelodi Sundowns hot on their heels, just four points adrift and having played a game more.
