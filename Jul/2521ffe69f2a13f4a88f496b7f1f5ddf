"Time doesn't wait. Indecision will let opportunities slip by. Pick a path and walk confidently with your heart behind every step." From one of the greatest authors and artists, Doe Zantamata beautifully articulates the essence of time, that time will not wait and that one can miss out on opportunities of life. This is a recent stand many women have decided to take in order to get things done. Women have taken matters into their own hands, and like Boys to Men they're down on bended knee. Yes, tradition and norms have dictated that men should be on the hunt and the women should wait on the other side of the receiving end. The man should be the one asking a woman for their hand in marriage, but how things have quickly changed. We admittedly have only seen this trend of women proposing to their men during a leap year. The rarity of this date was the only time women were allowed to ask men out and even propose to them. However today, things have completely changed and lines of normality have been blurred. So why is this? According to professional matchmaker Michelle Frank, he says the trend is all about gender equality. “If a woman wants something she goes after it in the workplace,” she says. “She wants to live her life with a man, why wouldn’t she choose to go after that and propose?” Furthermore, a 2018 report from Pinterest found the number of people searching for “women proposing to men ideas” skyrocketed 336% from the year before. Simply put, women are slowly realising that if you snooze or lose, and that success only comes before work in the dictionary. So if you delay on putting a ring on it, be warned. She might just beat you to it.
