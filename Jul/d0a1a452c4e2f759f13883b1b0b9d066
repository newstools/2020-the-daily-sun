  A
mother of two kids was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment or pay R8000 fine by
the Mhala Magistrates Court on Thursday after she falsely accused her lover of
raping her. The
court heard Prayer Gumede (27) denying ever raping her and that his lover made
a confession to the police that she had lied. Her
conviction came as a result of sterling work done by investigators Detectives
Sergeant Tintswalo Chauke and Constable Tinyiko Chauke, both from the family
and children protection and domestic violence unit. She
pleaded guilty to the charges of perjury before Magistrate Tanya Du Preez. The
court heard the accused opened a case against her lover on 8 February that he
raped her after he forced her to sleep with him. "Please
forgive me for having misled this court and the police. My lover didn't rape
me. I was jealous as he was cheating on me. And I was afraid I might lose him.
So, please, don't send me to jail my two kids will suffer," she pleaded. Public
Prosecutor Kedibone Bareng said: "Accused pressed fake charges of rape to
this innocent victim. She wasted state resources that should have been diverted
to other cases." Magistrate
Du Preez said the court has found the accused guilty of perjury and sentenced
her to 12 months imprisonment or an R8 000 fine.
