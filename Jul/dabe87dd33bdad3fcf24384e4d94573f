That's loneliness on its own. Where you will watch friends calling each other and then having plans right in front of you and you will be skipped," he explained. He said he often ran to the hotel instead of taking the Proteas bus. "I found a way that became one of the best weapons of my life. I'd go to the bus driver early morning to give him my bag and say to him 'I'll meet you at the ground'. I would run to the cricket ground."
