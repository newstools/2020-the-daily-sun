A Khayelitsha mother is struggling to bury her son who was shocked by electricity in March. For the past four months, the mother has been trying to bury his son Mzukiseni Gogodla (31) without success since she doesn’t have the money. Annie Mandida (53) said she is now struggling to sleep because she always dreams about her son. “In my dreams, he asks me why I have abandoned him, why I am not giving him a decent burial. It has been stressing me for a long time and I really need help so that I give him a decent burial,” she said. Mzukisi’s body is a mortuary since April and the family needs R13500. Mzukisi’s sister Zanele Mandida said they have become a laughingstock to the whole community because his brother is not buried. “When someone dies, people would say you have to bury the deceased and not to be like Mzukisi’s family who keeps corps forever without burying them. “If a person dies people would say it is obvious that the deceased person will be buried before Mzukisi,” she said. Democratic Alliance’s PR councillor in the area Thulani Dasa told Daily Sun that he heard of the issue and he is trying to find people who can help. “I have knocked at the doors around, but I haven’t got anything, I hope the family will get help soon,” he said. Community leader Margaret Sigonyelo said: “As a community leader, I heard about this problem so I spoke to councillor Dasa and other leaders around the community so that we see how we can help the family. It’s difficult for this family and we call anyone who can help them to do so,” she said.
