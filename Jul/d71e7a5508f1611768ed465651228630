VICTOR Ramambila wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Today, Victor is the proud owner of Ramazwi Security Services and Training Agency that has 70 employees in Gauteng, Limpopo and KZN. Victor said he has trained more than 6 000 law enforcement personnel and public administrators since starting in 2006. Said Victor: “I chose training to develop skills in the security sector. The training agency is accredited by DHET, SAAETA, LGSETA, ETDPSETA, PSETA, UMALUSI and other registered institutions.” But Victor’s beginnings were humble. He grew up as a herd boy at Tshiozwi Village in the Sinthumule area near Makhado, Limpopo. The 52-year-old was raised by his unemployed mum, Masakona Ramambila, who augmented her income by ploughing for subsistence. This go-getter said he used to go to school bare feet. After matric, Victor wanted to be a lawyer, but his poor mum couldn’t afford varsity fees, so he went to Gauteng to look for work. “I lived in Mamelodi hostel with a stranger until I got my first job as a security officer after I saw an ad in a newspaper that Coin Security was looking for security officers,” Victor recalled. According to Victor, he was fired from his job for forming labour union. “I was a social activist, who fought for employees’ rights. “I demanded salary increases for all,” Victor, who later became a private investigator, explained. While working at Extensive Vision as a private investigator, Victor studied risk management and ended up as a shareholder in the same company. “I became one of the directors who led teams of investigators from Gauteng, Limpopo and North West,” he said. Victor was also fired from this job as he opened his own private investigating firm, Solvic. Today, Victor is proud of some of his graduates, who work as prison warders at Kutama-Sinthumule prison.
