So, you have settled into your relationship with your partner. The honeymoon phase has fizzled out, and your relationship has hit the love running. You have settled into each other's personalities, and have slowly realised that it is time to introduce your partner to your world. Now before you even consider taking him/her to meet your parents, you have already slowly began to introduce him/her to other aspects of your life. Let's take the church aspect of your life as an example. If God is the Genesis of your life, then the next revelation would be to introduce him to your core. Now admittedly, some people are fully dedicated to the work of God. The time spent at church can therefore raise a few eyebrows if an explanation is not given. Numerous assumptions will be made which can lead to the relationship's demise. So now we have to introduce our partner to our church. Psychologists warn that religion and cultural matters are sensitive issues when it comes to relationships. If not addressed adequately, these can cause serious conflict within the relationship. So experts advice that when introducing your partner to your religious or spiritual life, a phased approach is required. Various church dominions have their own way of doing things, and some can make someone feel uncomfortable. So it is important that you don't overwhelm your partner, but slowly introduce them to your church lifestyle. So, once you have agreed to introduce him/her to your church life this should not send the wrong signal, but should allow him/her to learn about you. They say a couple that prays together, stays together. Can I get an amen to that!
