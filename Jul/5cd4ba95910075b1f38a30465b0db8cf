A PRIVATE contractor confirmed he did maintenance work at Nomvula Mokonyane’s house under instructions from ex-Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi. Yesterday electrician Charl le Roux told the Zondo Commission that between 2014 and 2015, he fixed outside lights, a water pump and backup power system at the house in Krugersdorp, west of Joburg, of the former environmental affairs minister. He said one day he noticed an expensive car parked in the garage. “I looked and I saw it was an Aston Martin,” said Le Roux. He said he went back to do some other work around 2017 or 2018. He said for all the work, invoices were sent to Bosasa and no address mentioned. Le Roux claimed he never dealt with invoicing and receiving money as he was sub-contracted. He said the main contractor was San Electrical, owned by Renier van Biljon, who was married to his cousin and gave him jobs. Evidence leader Viwe Notshe, SC, told the commission investigators and lawyers visited Mokonyane’s house on Sunday to see the features Le Roux said were there. Notshe said the features were noted down. He said Mokonyane’s lawyers were present during the inspection and they co-operated with the commission. Agrizzi gave evidence last year claiming that Mokonyane was given R50 000 monthly payments, booze and groceries by Bosasa. He said Bosasa installed CCTV cameras, an electric fence and other security upgrades at her homes. Mokonyane has dismissed the allegations as baseless and false. She said Agrizzi had never been to her house. The commission was supposed to hear evidence of Parliament’s chair of chairs, Cedric Frolick, but it was told he was sick. Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, postponed his testimony to a date that was yet to be arranged. The commission will resume on Thursday.
