NO amount of evil muthi used against Mthandeni Manqele will work. The maskandi star, who’s better known as Igcokama Elisha, has recovered from a mysterious illness which sangomas said could have been caused by a tokoloshe. He told Daily Sun prayer helped him after doctors failed to find out what made him sick. He said he’s a firm believer in God, and before he recovered he vomited a foam. He believed the foam was evil spirits coming out of him. He said he didn’t consult traditional healers because he didn’t want to give them credit. “I believe my body is starting to get back to normality,” he said. “Prayer gave me victory against these evil spirits. “Many people asked me to go to traditional healers, but I told them I wanted to die in God’s hands. “I come from a God-fearing family and we don’t mix prayer with muthi. “All praise belongs to God, who created heaven and earth. I won’t turn my back on God.” Mthandeni said he had a hard time on the last day of his illness. He said he vomited and cats scratched him. “I have scars on my body where I was scratched by cats,” he said “While I was sleeping, I dreamt a cat was scratching me and a dog was attacking me. I felt more ill when I woke up. “I vomited a lot of foam and I believe an evil spirit was coming out of my body because I felt better afterwards. “In a few days I’ll be able to leave my house and post photos to show my fans I’ve survived.”
