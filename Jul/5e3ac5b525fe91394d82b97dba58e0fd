THERE is still no clarity on exactly when the case of suspended Cricket South Africa (CSA) CEO Thabang Moroe will be wrapped up. Moroe was suspended by the organisation in December last year on allegations of alleged misconduct, but since then CSA has come in for heavy criticism for a failure to reach finality in the matter. In June, six months after his initial suspension, Moroe returned to work at the CSA headquarters in Johannesburg, claiming through his legal team that he had still not been formally charged with anything and that he had not yet sat in on a disciplinary hearing. CSA was quick to act then, responding by confirming that Moroe remained suspended and that his situation would be dealt with as a matter of urgency. Now, with Moroe having received full pay for over seven months of suspension, there is still no immediate end in sight. On Thirsday, CSA board provided an update on the disciplinary process of Moroe. "The CSA Board of Directors has received the first part of the forensic report which relates to the suspended CEO, Mr. Thabang Moroe," CSA said in a statement. "Using this report as a point of departure the Board has implemented a process that will provide finality to this unfortunate situation. "In line with the obligations it has, the CSA Board, as a responsible employer, cannot comment further on the process that is unfolding. "At the appropriate time, once the ongoing processes have been concluded, the CSA Board will be in a position to take all its stakeholders and the public in its confidence by making appropriate announcements."
