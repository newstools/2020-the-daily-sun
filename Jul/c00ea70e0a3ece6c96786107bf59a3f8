PHOLA Park Clinic staff are horrified after 28 of them tested positive for Covid-19. They told Daily Sun the clinic in Ekurhuleni only closed for one day after this. One worker had tested positive and was self-isolating. “I said I’d finish my 14 days of self-isolation and re-test before I went back, but I was told to come back in three days,” he said. Another staff member said management had told them to keep working, and that those cases were being dealt with. “We don’t see any fumigation. When we ask how these are being handled, our jobs are threatened. I don’t want to lose my job. I’m a breadwinner. It’s sad.” A third worker said: “When I get back from work, I leave my uniform in the car. “I head to the bathroom without touching anyone and bath. “If the clinic cared about us, we’d be doing our jobs with a smile, but we’re helping people in fear.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the clinic did mass testing for staff on 27 May and 174 workers were negative. She told Daily Sun a pregnant patient, whose status was unknown, came to the clinic on 14 June. Days later they heard she tested positive at Bertha Gxowa Hospital. “On 16 June, a positive case came to seek information on how to deal with other family members.” The patient was seen by a doctor and nurse, who tested positive and were sent to quarantine at home. “Following the positive cases, the facility was deep-cleaned and services suspended to allow for disinfection.” Kekana said positive staff members were sent for self-isolation at home for 14 days. “A list of close contacts was drawn and contacts sent for self-quarantine to re-test on Monday. “Some workers tested privately and told management. Positive cases increased to seven by 21 June.” Positive cases at the clinic stood at 28, but it was deep-cleaned again from 26 to 28 June.
