Elizabeth Mathabathe (58) is fuming. She alleged that cops shot her son, Thabo Mathabathe (36), and left him for dead in the bushes near Vaalbank in Mpumalanga. She said cops shot him in his legs and head on 17 July. Her son was saved by a man who was jogging early the next morning. Thabo is fighting for his life in hospital. Elizabeth said the man heard screams coming from the thick bushes. She said the man found her son lying in a pool of blood and called out for help. Elizabeth from Khayelitsha, near KwaMhlanga, said she wanted justice for her son. “Earlier this month, on 3 July, two cops stormed my house and found my son cooking with friends,” she said. “The cops pepper-sprayed and assault them. My son managed to escape and ran to a neighbour’s house. “The cops ransacked my house, saying they were looking for a gun but didn’t find it. They arrested his friends. “The cops released Thabo’s friends the following day. On 17 July the same cops came into my house again, still looking for my son. “They found him, tied him up and stuffed him into the boot of their car. They drove off towards the bushes near Vaalbank, where they shot and left him badly injured.” She said her son spent an entire night in the cold, bleeding profusely. “Luckily a man was jogging and heard screams and helped him. I want justice for my son. “He’s told me everything and how he was brutally assaulted by cops before he was shot.” Elizabeth alleged the cops took Thabo’s cellphone and wallet. She said her son and friends opened a case against the cops before they abducted him. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that cops opened cases. He said the matter had been forwarded to Ipid.
