Eastern Cape premier Oscar Lubabalo Mabuyane and King
Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo have welcomed the Mthatha High Court ruling against
Azenathi Dalindyebo. On Thursday, 23 July, Free State acting deputy judge
president Martha Mbhele dismissed with cost Azenathi Dalindyebo applications
stating that Azenathi has no grounds for his applications. Deputy judge Mbhele said the certificate of King
Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo remains, and if Azenathi was looking to terminate the
King’s certificate, they should have consulted the Presidency. Jb Mbhele was handing down the judgment virtually. This after Azenathi and some Amadlomo Royal family
member's chaired by Thandisizwe Mtirara approached the court challenging
Zanelizwe being dethroned. A month ago Oscar Mabuyane terminated Azenathi
"Zanelizwe" Dalindyeb’s acting kingship responsibilities and
reinstating King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. But Azenathi’s faction claimed that Azenathi was never
consulted before his acting responsibility was terminated. Speaking after the judgment on Thursday, 23 July, King
spokesperson Prince Mthunzi Langalibalele Mngonyama told Daily Sun that:
"Azenathi was just taking advantage of the situation, he has no basics
instead he was tarnishing the King's image" Prince Mngonyama said they hope that this thing will
never happen again under the AbaThembu Kingdom. "We have a huge task ahead of us to stabilize the
AbaThembu Kingdom".
