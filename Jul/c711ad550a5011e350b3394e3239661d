At the beginning of 2020, Tesla beat automaker Volkswagen to become the world’s second-most valuable automaker. Not did it surpass VW, it has now hit the number one spot and dethroned the Japanese giant, Toyota. Toyota has built its brand on affordability and reliability, including the Prius hybrid known for its environmentally friendly power generation. Shares of the electric-powered automaker Tesla doubled since the beginning of the year and climbed as much as 3.5% in trading on Wednesday. This resulted in the automaker's shares hitting a market capitalisation of $207.2 billion which about R350 trillion while surpassing Toyota’s $201.9 billion, which is about R340 trillion. The interesting part is that Tesla only produced 103 000 cars in the first quarter, which is about 4% of the cars that the Japanese giant produced. In the same period, Toyota had produced almost 2.4 million cars.
