Nigerian producer and artist Oluwa Kuwait wants to uplift spirits during the coronavirus pandemic. The artist, who is currently in Cape Town working on his EP, recently released a single to make people dance. The single titled On The Low featuring Ice Prince and D Main was released in April. Speaking to Sunday Sun, Oluwa said: "I believe that music is the cure for many illnesses and making people dance will uplift their moods. People have suffered enough during this pandemic, and music is one way of keeping people motivated and dancing, at home.” The Nigerian artist said he wanted people to dance at home. "Just because you can’t leave the house, or because we are faced with a deadly virus, it doesn't mean we can’t help to lift up our moods. And that's why I made On The Low," he said.
