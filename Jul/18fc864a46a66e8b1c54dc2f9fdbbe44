CHAOS broke out at Nqabakazulu High School yesterday when cops fired rubber bullets at matrics! The pupils at the school in KwaMashu, north of Durban, allegedly locked an education official and teachers inside the school. They demanded the school be closed, fumigated and tested for corona after parents got letters on Friday about a positive case. Pupils were told to return to school on Monday without being tested and wanted the education department to intervene. An official was sent to talk to them, but they claimed he wouldn’t listen, so they locked the gates. Cops were called and broke open the gates. They escorted the official and principal out. When cops asked pupils to leave, chaos erupted and they started firing rubber bullets. One pupil was arrested, but later released. Another pupil said the official wouldn’t listen to them. “We told him our lives matter, so we couldn’t allow teaching to continue,” said the pupil. The pupil said the official told them health officials were on the way, but cops arrived instead. “This angered us, which was why we stood at the gate and demanded to be tested.” Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi wasn’t aware of the incident, but said the school was fumigated over the weekend.
