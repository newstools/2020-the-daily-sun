HE attempted to take his life two years ago with a rope and he was fortunate to survive when a family member saved him but this time around, he was not lucky. George Mabangi (55) burned himself with petrol at Mikhomi village. Chief Mikhomi says that they are shocked as a family and do not understand what could have driven him to take such action. "He went to my sister to ask for R200 and took that money to buy Petrol. We don't know what could have led him to take such a decision," said Chief Mukhomi. "We got the news that he died at the hospital as a family we are deeply saddened." Mahangi was not married and had on many occasions reportedly complained to his brother that he was poor and did not see the reason to live. "Itâ€™s not the first time he attempted to kill himself, unfortunately now he is gone." Mukhomi told Daily Sun that the man failed to open up to the family so that they could help him. "We wish he had told us his problems, and we could have somehow helped. He was unemployed and we constantly assisted him with food and other necessities," said Mukhomi.
