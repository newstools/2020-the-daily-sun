HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has defended the second booze ban saying it was necessary to save hospitals
from trauma cases related to boozing. Speaking at an  inter -ministerial briefing in Pretoria today,Mkhize
revealed that Mzansi was a nation of boozers drinking above the global average. 

 “Six out of 10  drinkers are binge drinkers and  six out of 10 children over 15 years of age
binged on alcohol. We are one of the countries that drink the most.”  He said projections have shown that reducing
the pressure on hospitals by stopping thousands of alcohol-related trauma cases
by imposing a ban on alcohol could in one week only result in 3400 cases of
trauma centers. This would make more resources available to fight the virus.  “Many
have welcomed and supported the alcohol ban. We are very concerned about the
high alcohol consumption in the country. Research suggests that while an
alcohol ban could ease pressure on hospitals, it can also reduce intimate
partner violence in many households across the country,” he said.He added that by limiting alcohol related cases  in hospital, the department would be limiting exposure of people to the virus and thereby
reducing the burden of primary health care.  Last night during his address to the nation,President
Cyril Ramaphosa shocked many unprepared boozers by announcing the suspension of
booze sales with immediate effect.
