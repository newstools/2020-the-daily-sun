DURBAN gqom sensation Biggie died with a broken heart. This after he allegedly never earned a cent from his music. But it has emerged the vocalist, whose real name was Njabulo Zondi, will reap the fruits of his labour from the grave. This was revealed by his manager Ngcebo Mdima. He said Biggie’s family will get the money as he is no more. Earlier this year, Biggie accused some DJs of not paying him after they featured him on their hit songs. But Ngcebo told Daily Sun Biggie was not registered at Samro, which was the reason he wasn’t paid. ALSO READ: I AM POKING MY BESTIE'S DAD! “Unfortunately, he died after he had just registered. His family will get the money he was supposed to get,” Ngcebo said He said the family will get 25% for the song Obaleka, which Biggie did with DJ Websta and 50% for the song Jika, which he did with DJ Lag. “There are other songs such as Iyakhuluma, which he did with New Era. For this song the family will get 20%, and will get 20% for the song Vumani Bo, which he did with Nu Fashini,” said Ngcebo. He said they were still waiting for the family to appoint a beneficiary who will be able to claim the money on Biggie’s behalf.
