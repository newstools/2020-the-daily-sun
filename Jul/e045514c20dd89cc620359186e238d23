Football is a short career filled with uncertainties. And  AmaZulu striker Lehlohonolo Majoro is well aware of that. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates star seems well prepared for life after he eventually hangs up his boots. Already armed with a qualification, a Radiology diploma from the University of Johannesburg, Majoro is not done equipping himself for life after football. The 33-year-old, who is nearing the twilight of his career, has added another feather in his cap after he became a senior consultant with Herbal Life, a global nutrition company. The SA Football Players’ Union has previously  bemoaned the poverty that haunts players once they hang up their boots and Majoro is determined to buck that trend. He took to social medi to show off his latest achievement, saying: “Learn new skills and build your legacy.” Meanwhile on the field, Majoro is eager to bounce back from a tough time after he was suspended by Usuthu before the Coronavirus break along with teammates Michael Morton, Thembela Sikhakhane, Jabulani Ncobeni and Nhlanhla Vilakazi. He has since returned to training after the break and will be looking to finish the season strong with the KwaZulu Natal outfit. Majoro has made a total of 17 appearances for Usuthu in all competitions so far this season and is yet to find the back of the net.
