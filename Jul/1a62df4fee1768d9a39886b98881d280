TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have distanced themselves from rumours that they are on the verge of signing former Bafana Bafana coach, Ephraim Shakes" Mashaba, for the next coming season. Many names have been bandied about that they have applied for the TTM job, which includes Highlands Park coach, Owen Da Gama, Dan Malesela as well as Gavin Hunt of Bidvest Wits. TTM are very ambitious and are strengthening their side after acquiring the Wits PSL status. They have also beefed up their team with Joseph Molangoane and Oupa Manyisa over two years. Club Marketing manager, Tshidino Ndou, says they know nothing about Vhadau Vha
Damani been interested in the experienced Mashaba. "We have received a lot if CV from coaches who are
interested in coaching us," said Ndou. "But we don't have Mashaba's CV in our office. Maybe
those people who are spreading those romours want Mashaba to be in charge of
Tshakhuma. But we have not spoken with Mashaba at all." Nou however has declined to share names of the coaches who have thrown their names in the hat. But the 69-year-old Mashaba is not the only coach who
have been linked with Tshakhuma coaching position.
