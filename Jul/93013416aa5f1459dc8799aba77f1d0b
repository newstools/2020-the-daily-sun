SEEING the little kids suffer so much touched the hearts of their neighbours. Now the neighbours of five children aged between one and 13 from Pongola, northern KZN, are asking for help for the kids. The neighbours told Daily Sun the children suffered a lot because their mother often left them alone. They claimed the mum was failing to take care of her kids. Neighbour Thembani Ndlovu (34) said the children lived in a damaged house. “The condition of the house is terrible because it is old. The inside of all the rooms look like the outside. The children don’t have warm clothes,” she said. She said the kids’ mother often goes away for weeks and leaves the children alone. “She left them last Wednesday and hasn’t returned until today. We don’t know where she is. She leaves without telling the children where she’s going. She doesn’t have a cellphone, so nobody can contact her,” said the neighbour. Another neighbour, Nombuso Mthethwa (43), said the children’s mother boozes a lot. “Her family left her in the house with all five children. We tried to trace her sister who lives in Durban, but we couldn’t. We wanted to tell her about the poor conditions the children live in,” she said. Another resident said the mother leaves the children without food. “The children go around asking for food. It’s so painful. It’s also not safe because three of the children are girls, while two are boys. These children could even be raped,” said the neighbour. She said they wanted the Department of Social Development to intervene. “The social workers must come and see this. They should also take the children away from their mother because she is failing,” she said. KZN social developement spokesman Mhlaba Memela said he will contact the chief director in the area to investigate this matter and assist the children.
