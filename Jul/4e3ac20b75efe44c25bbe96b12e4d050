A TAVERN and tuck shop owner from G section KwaMashu north of Durban was closing her business for the day when she suddenly met her death. The Mabaleng tavern owner, Welile Shange (51) was shot dead on Saturday night at the gate of her tavern. Her death comes just two weeks after her husband was also shot dead at the Durban CBD by unknown gunmen as well. Itâ€™s still not clear why the woman was gunned down in this brutal manner especially a short while after her husband was killed. A resident who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that the woman had just closed the tuck shop when she was shot. "She has been taking care of the business since her husband died," said the resident. The resident said there is a tavern in the same yard. But since the shooting incident on Saturday, the container has also been closed. Another resident said she heard that the Shange family also had taxis, maybe their killing could be related to taxi violence. "But at this point, nobody knows," said the resident. The KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a 51-year-old woman was shot by unknown gunmen who then fled in their getaway vehicle. "She was taken to hospital for medical attention where she later died. A case of murder was opened at KwaMashu police station for investigation," said Mbele.
