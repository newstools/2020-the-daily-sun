MASKANDI star Khuzani "King Khuba" Mpungose is mourning for the passing of his grandmother. Gogo Gcinephi Mngadi Khanyile (75) passed on Thursday early morning after a short illness. Khuzani, who was the first maskandi artist to fill up the Moses Mabhida stadium last year, explained his gogo as the one who played a parental role and mother figure after his mother Sizakele Ngema passed away when he was 14 years. The Ishende hitmaker told Daily Sun that his late grandmother managed to fill in his mother’s shoes and raise him until he became a maskandi star. “I’m heartbroken about the passing of my grandmother. She was my everything in my heart and always ask me if I have eaten. Her passing came with a shock, I was not ready for it as she had no signs of illness. “When I became an orphan at the age of 14 years, she stood up and raised me to the level where I am now,” he said. Khuzani said his grandmother phoned him on Saturday asking him about the flu and asked him to come back home. “She said I must came back to Nkandla next to her and not having flu at Johannesburg far away from her. She told me that she was fine and healthy. On Sunday she phoned me saying I must send a car to take her to the doctor on Tuesday for check-ups as she was suspecting something. “I sent a car and she went to the doctor and came back but unfortunately out of the blue death came and stole her. "I release her to go to heaven and I will always thank her by raising me after my mother’s death,” he said. Family will still have to meet together and finalise the funeral arrangement.
