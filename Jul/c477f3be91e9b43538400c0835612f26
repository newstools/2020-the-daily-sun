GOGO Nokwakha Somdaka says her dogs are everything to her. The 64-year-old from Browns Farm in Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun she’d been keeping dogs for 25 years and they kept thugs out of her yard. The gogo said the dogs also fought spiritual wars for her. “They connect me to my ancestors. When something evil is going to happen they bark,” she said. “Nobody can throw muthi in my yard because these dogs are vicious.” Gogo Nokwakha has four dogs: Browny, Blackie, Dabs and Shackie. Queen and Zulu King's sister dies of covid-19! She said Blackie is her favourite because he takes no nonsense. She said her father used to have dogs, and that’s where she learned to love them. She said: “I started keeping dogs in 1995 while my father was still alive. “He was happy I loved dogs. I started with two dogs, which I bought as puppies. “They gave birth to five puppies. I’ve not looked back. Some went missing and others died of sickness or old age.” Gogo Nokwakha said her dogs protect her from physical and spiritual harm. “If you’re a witch, you won’t be able to enter my gate in the afternoon. My dogs sense when a person is evil,” she said. “When it comes to thugs, they know my house is a no-go area. Even if I leave my door open all day, no one comes inside.” The gogo said dogs don’t come cheap when it comes to feeding them. “Keeping a skinny dog isn’t a good thing to do,” she said. “I spend about R200 on food every month. “I buy bones, milk, rice and mealie-meal to ensure they have something to eat.”
