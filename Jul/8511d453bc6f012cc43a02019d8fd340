BIG Zulu is fuming following a car crash. The accident happened just outside his home in the Vaal, on Monday night. He said he was with his friends when one of them borrowed the car keys. “He said he was feeling cold and wanted to turn on the heater in the car. I initially refused because we were all seated in the house and saw no reason for him to be warming up in the car. But he insisted I give him the car keys and I eventually did,” said Big Zulu. He said he went outside a few minutes later, but the car was not where he had parked it. “I panicked and started calling him, but he didn’t pick up,” he said.  Big Zulu, who is originally from Bergville in KZN, said he then received a call from someone from the accident scene. “He told me to rush to the stop street. I was shattered when I got there. From my own assessment, my BMW is beyond repair,” said Big Zulu. He believes his friend was negligent. “This person had no permission to drive my car. Now that he crashed it, he can’t fix it because he doesn’t work. The only thing I got from him was a big sorry. I don’t need that right now. Instead, I need money to fix my car. ‘I didn’t even report the matter to the police because it’s not going to serve any purpose for me,” Big Zulu told Daily Sun.
