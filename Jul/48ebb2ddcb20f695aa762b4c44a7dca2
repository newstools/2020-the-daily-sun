KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune believes it would be key for them to resume where they left off when the Absa Premiership campaign was suspended in March. The Premier Soccer League is set to resume on the weekend of 8 August to finish the campaign which was halted y the outbreak of the coronavirus. Amakhosi who will use Orlando Stadium as their home ground for the remainder of the season are currently at the top of the Absa Premiership standings with 48 points after 22 matches. “It’s important for us to continue where we left off,” Khune told the club's website official website. “Luckily, we have new technology, like the Zoom mobile app, via which we could have video communication. “This helped the coaches to guide us on exercises to keep fit. It was a frustrating time, as we missed being on the field. We just had to hang in there. “I realise that the break, due to this Covid-19 pandemic, affected a lot of keepers, including Manchester United’s David de Gea and Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel. "They didn’t seem to have the same confidence as before the break. There was clearly a lot of rustiness. “Luckily, we have had a bit more time to prepare before the league restarts. We have also discussed various aspects on our ‘Keeper Corner’, which is us goalies communicating with our goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter. It’s basically about learning from the past to go forward. “Going back into the field will all be about mental strength… We just need to be ready come 11 August,” he added.
