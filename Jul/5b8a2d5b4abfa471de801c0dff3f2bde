DR Tumi stepped out as a TV presenter as his first show titled Heart to Heart With Dr Tumi premiered on Mzansi Magic. The medical doctor turned gospel superstar said the show’s aim is to spread healing and hope among the despondent and the broken-hearted especially during this difficult time that has seen so many deaths due to Covid-19. On Heart to Heart With Dr Tumi, he performs some of his inspirational songs that have earned him international fame, as well as music videos. He is also joined by pastors to share some words of encouragement from the Bible. "This is a new chapter in my life and I embrace it humbly," said Dr Tumi. "I’ve always been about hope and my music has always spoken to the heart with simple melodies and lyrics. With the power of TV I can reach bigger audiences that need to hear about the good news of healing and hope." Dr Tumi has been making great strides in his career, moving from being a medical doctor to becoming a gospel award winner. His Gathering of Worshippers concerts at The Dome in Johannesburg, Voortrekker Monument and Loftus Stadium in Pretoria have attracted tens of thousands and sealed his place as a legendary crowd puller. He recently returned to the hospital ward in response to the Covid-19 when he offered his services at Thembisa Hospital. Heart to Heart With Dr Tumi on Mzansi Magic premiered today, 5 July, at 2pm.
