Children don’t ask to be born. But certain women act like mindless creatures and abandon their newborn babies. READ: SKEEM SAAM ACTOR BUST BY COPS! Time and again, we read stories of mums who dump their babies in dustbins or in the veld. This evil behaviour is taken lightly in South Africa. What type of woman does such a thing? A mother is a selfless human who should embrace her child with unconditional love and acceptance. According to medical research, 65% of abandoned children in South Africa are newborns, and 90% are under the age of one. There’s so many stories about men who kill women and children, but little or nothing is done to women who dump their own children. Not that I’m saying men are right for what they do, but women should also be held responsible for their actions. ALSO READ: WIFE SHOT AT FUNERAL! Murder is murder regardless of whether it’s a man or woman, because failing to report the birth of a child is also a crime. There are options for women who don’t want children, such as abortion and adoption. Women who can’t handle children should also consider birth control options, which are available at clinics free of charge. Gauteng
