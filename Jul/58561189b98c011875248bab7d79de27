FOR years, shops have been selling their goods online. But who ever said you should be able to buy a coffin with the click of a button? More and more retailers and manufacturers are selling coffins online and recently, Takealot has put a traditional wooden veneer coffin up for sale – and at a discount. On its website the leading e-commerce retailer said the coffins were manufactured using real wood and available at their Cape Town warehouse. “The wood veneer is laminated onto chipboard, machine cut and hand polished with a variety of wood effects,” reads the description. The coffin is sold at R4 899, the delivery is free, but it can’t be returned. Many social media users are angry about this new item for sale. Kenneth Mochela said: “Black, sane people don’t do that.”  Pq Goje: “It’s nonsense! It’s the same as digging graves for sick people.” Kgomotso Kgatla from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni preferred the traditional way. “Let’s use a funeral parlour to take care of everything in conducting a funeral. We can’t risk the funeral being delayed over a coffin delivery.” Johan Rousseau from the Funeral Industry Reformed Association said funerals should only be handled by a registered undertaker. He blamed lack of legislation for online coffin sales. “There’s no control between the manufacturer, the buyer and the person who is conducting the funeral,” he said. Cultural expert, Professor Thabile Buthelezi, said a coffin can’t be delivered by strangers to a grieving family.  “It’s important for a family member to be present during the transportation of a coffin with a corpse to guard it against witchcraft that might take place at this critical time,” said Buthelezi.  At the time of going to print, attempts to get hold of Takealot were not successful.
