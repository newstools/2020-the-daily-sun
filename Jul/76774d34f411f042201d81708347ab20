THE Grade R pupils in Limpopo will not return back to school on Monday as it was initially announced on Thursday when the Department of Basic Education reported a phased approach to the return of Grade 6 and Grade 11. The little ones will be home until the 29 July 2020 as a reviewed date for them to return to school. The decision to delay the return of grade R was taken after consultation between Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo and  Minister Angie Motshekga of Basic Education which considered various aspects which have led to the new date. MEC Boshielo said this arrangement does not hinder schools that had already applied and granted to reopen for different grades as per the regulations gazetted and published by the Minister of Basic Education. She said "We are working in line with Minister Motshekga's pronouncement that we will adjust the reopening phases based on the risk-adjusted strategy which is a considered attempt to balance our approach to school reopening taking into account all factors that affect the work we do,” said MEC  Boshielo.
