THE Tsewu family from Samora Machel in Cape Town is shocked and angry about a 27-year-old neighbour who raped their 12-year-old daughter. Speaking to Daily Sun, the victim’s mother said her daughter sometimes sleeps over at her neighbour’s house. “The suspect’s sister usually asks that my daughter sleeps in her house because she has a small baby and she would ask her to go with her to the clinic,” said the mother. She said on Saturday, as usually, her daughter went to sleep over at the neighbour’s house and when she came back in the morning, she noticed that after she finished eating, she rushed to the bathroom. “She did that every time she finished eating and that made me curious. I decided to check what was the problem and that’s when I discovered that she was raped.” The victim was taken to hospital where the doctor confirmed that she was raped penetrated her anus and vagina. “The suspect usually comes in our home and we treated him like our own. We never thought that he would do something like this. We want him to rot in jail.” The mum said the rape has ruined her daughter’s life because the damage made by the suspect will make it difficult for her to have kids. The family said the suspect was arrested but seeing him back home made things more difficult for them. “Why did he come back here. We don’t feel safe,” said the mother. Captain Frederick van Wyk said the suspect was arrested and appeared in court. “After the accused was granted bail, he went to his residence in Samora Machel to collect his belongings and moved to another area,” he said.
