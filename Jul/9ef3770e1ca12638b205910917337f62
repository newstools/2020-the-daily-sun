STELLENBOSCH FC are thankful that Le Coq Sportif has stuck by them by signing a long-term agreement to help them through the current difficult times. The club said they don’t know where they would have been financially without the help from their sponsors as they are still adjusting to life in the Absa Premiership after gaining promotion last season. Stellies’ CEO, Rob Beanie, said the French sports brand committed to them on a longer term contract after both entities joined hands at the beginning of this suspended season. “We got a long-term relationship with them and we will be wearing their kit for the foreseeable future,” said Benadie. The sports goods company are also coming on board as kit sponsor of Safa. According to Safa officials, Le Coq has signed a 10-year bumper deal (eight years and two years option to renew). “Obviously in these economic times, it is tough for lot of companies,” added a grateful Benadie. “But fortunately, they are still providing us for this coming season and we hope to go from strength to strength with them. “It is a great brand and sadly we have only done a little bit so far with them, and we haven’t gone into a big way with supporters which is essential to build such a partnership to give them exposure.” Despite things looking assured off field, the Cape Winelands side had a slow start to life in the top flight but have shown a steady improvement. Stellies were lying 11th when the season was suspended in March due to Covid-19 with 27 points from 24 matches.
