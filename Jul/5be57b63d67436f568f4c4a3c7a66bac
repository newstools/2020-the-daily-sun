Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said anti-apartheid stalwart Andrew Mlangeni saw
that the country is surrounded by greedy vultures. He was
speaking at an official funeral service of Mlangeni which is underway at the
University of Johannesburg Soweto Campus. On
Wednesday the last chapter of Rivonia trialists has closed as the last
remaining trialist, Mlangeni is laid to rest. President
Cyril Ramaphosa declared a special official funeral for Mlangeni. Ramaphosa is
among delegates attending the funeral service as well as Minister of Transport
Fikile Mbalula. Lesufi
described Mlangeni as a reliable defender of the unity of the ANC and a true
freedom fighter. Lesufi
said: “His name occupies a special place amongst South Africans for his
unbroken service to the struggle against apartheid and a birth of a new South
Africa we all enjoy today.  “Some will
also be scared to declare that comrade Mlangeni was a communist, we know why
they will be scared to declare that he was a true communist is because they
don’t make communists like this anymore. 
A true freedom fighter indeed,” said Lesufi. Lesufi said
if nothing drastic is done Mlangeni’s sacrifices may be fruitless.  He said:
“You saw it Tata, instead of fighting for the development of our people we
spend time fighting for positions. You saw it Tata, instead of fighting for the
development of our country we are surrounded by greedy vultures. You saw it
Tata, instead of fighting for peace and prosperity our women and children are
killed and attacked. “Our people
must know we were led by people with personality and great sense of humanity,”
said Lesufi. Mlangeni
died early this week at the Military One hospital in Tshwane following
abdominal related complications. He was at the age of 95.
