GRADE 7 pupils from Esiphukwini Primary School might have to stay home much longer than the two weeks given to them. This is because their school was burnt down on Thursday by unknown people. It’s alleged that the school in Ngonyameni outside Umlazi, south of Durban, was allegedly burnt by people who wanted it renovated as they claimed it’s too old. A resident said he heard that some residents felt that the school was too old and was now due for renovations. “Apparently the school is over 50 years now, so they want it to be renovated,” said the resident. Another resident said this will disturb the grade 7 pupils. “The grade 7s are supposed to go back to school on the 10th. How will they go back to a burnt school. This is really not fair,” said the resident. The KZN Education Department is now assessing the extent of damage at the school. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has condemned the burning of the school under Umlazi district. “This unfortunate and barbaric incident sets us back in that it happens at a time when as a department we have redirected most of our financial resources to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. We ask the community to work with the police to ensure that the culprits are arrested,” said Mshengu. He said the department was assessing the extent of the damage. “After the assessment, we will know if the grade 7 pupils will be able to go back to class or not,” said Mshengu. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that the Bhekithemba cops are investigating a case of arson after a classroom was set alight. “A classroom and furniture was burnt. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” she said.
