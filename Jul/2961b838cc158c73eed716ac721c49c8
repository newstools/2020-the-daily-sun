THE relatives of the late North West co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC, Gordon Kegakilwe, said his death has left a huge void in the family. Kegakilwe succumbed to Covid-19 on Monday. Family representative Desmond Kegakilwe said the MEC was everything to them. “He was a father, mentor and almost everything to us. He was vital to the family, running family errands. He always brought wisdom and was an inspiration to many, especially in the family,” he said. Desmond said they had been receiving visits from friends, family members and people who worked with Kegakilwe. He said he appreciated that the people who visited them adhered to Covid-19 regulations. National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise said: “He grew up in front of us as a leader. “I knew him as an intelligent person and always sensitive. “I don’t remember him talking to anyone unpleasantly.” Modise said Kegakilwe was a good listener and was humble. “I am very strict and spoke to him badly sometimes, but he humbled himself. He respected people who were older than him,” she said. Modise said his death has left her devastated. “Sometimes God chooses one person among us to remind us that we are human,” she said. She pleaded with people not to take Covid 19 lightly.
