CRICKET South Africa (CSA) has promoted budding umpires Abongile Sodumo and Mazizi Gampu to the first class panel for the approaching 2020-21 season. CSA’s acting chief executive officer Jacques Faul congratulated the pair and confirmed that the organisation would continue to focus on developing umpires through exchange programmes with other ICC member countries Australia, India and New Zealand. Apart from the promotion of these two umpires, the reserve panel will remain unchanged as is the panel of match referees. Senior umpires Marais Erasmus (ICC Elite Panel), Shaun George, Andrian Holdstock, Bongani Jele and Allahudien Paleker (all ICC International Panel) serve on various ICC panels. “Congratulations to all our umpires on their deserved appointments for the approaching season. Umpires are central to the game of cricket, and we are unfortunate to have an extremely competent group of match officials. “The promotions of Abongile and Mazizi are indicative of the successes achieved within the CSA Umpire Acceleration Programme, and the progress they have made since joining the reserve panel two years ago. “We will continue to create opportunities for our umpires to develop through our exchange programmes with Australia, India and New Zealand,” said Faul.
