BOOZERS have vowed to continue drinking till they drop despite President Cyril Ramaphosa’s latest ban on alcohol. Tavern owners told Daily Sun they were very disappointed after the president’s address on Sunday night. Dikgotsi Moloi (60) from Naledi in Soweto said: “This shows government isn’t thinking of us. “How are we going to feed our families? We’re going to suffer, big time.” ALSO READ:TEACHER SHOT IN STAFF TAXI HAS DIED Nqoba Maseko, another tavern owner, said the worst was that they didn’t even know when the ban would be lifted. James Senotlelo said government couldn’t just chop and change. He said he’d continue buying booze. “It’s going to cost a lot to get alcohol, but I’m willing to go to great lengths for it,” he said. Another tearful tipple lover, Thatho Tlouele, said if people don’t buy booze taverns will go out of business. “Imagine all the booze they’ve stocked up and now needs to stay there. We can’t have that,” said Thatho. Nhlanhla Nqoko wrote on Facebook: “How can they want us to live a sober life in an effed up country like this one? “They’re digging graves for us while we’re alive. They’re taking our electricity in winter yet we must stay sober?” Freddie Botha said: “We should all just protest and do what we want. We’re all screwed in any case. The country can’t take it anymore.” Alcohol industry bodies reacted to the news with anger. The National Liquor Traders Council, the SA Liquor Brand Owners Association, the Beer Association of SA, VinPro and the Liquor Traders Association of SA were disappointed. The organisations said they were given no warning.
