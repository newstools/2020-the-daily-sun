Netflix will stop at nothing to keep us entertained, the popular streaming service is set to premiere a South African Rom-com, Seriously Single. The movie, which features popular actors such as Fulu Mugovhani, Tumi Morake, Bohang Moeko, and Yonda Thomas is set in Joburg. It tells the tale of the serial monogamist Dineo, played by Fulu, as she navigates the modern-day dating world alongside her best friend and partner in crime, the commitment-phobe Noni, played by Tumi. Dineo meets Lunga, played by Bohang Moeko, who appears to be the man of her dreams. She begins to uncover what she wants in life and love as Noni unfolds her own story with Max played by Yonda, who is the bar owner with a heart of gold. The wonderfully comedic misadventures of Dineo and Noni show the beautiful power of having strong friendships. In a statement sent to Daily Sun, the producers of the movie Rethabile and Katleho Ramaphakela said they are thrilled to partner up with Netflix. “We are thrilled for the opportunity to partner with Netflix as we share our latest project with the world. As a seasoned production company, we relish this new adventure as we extend ourselves outside of Africa into the world." "It truly is a time for Africa to own its voice and we’re honoured to be part of this significant movement,” they said.
