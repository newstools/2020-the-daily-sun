MAMELODI Sundowns have confirmed the signing of Lesedi Kapinga on a five-year deal. The 25-year-old has been the talk of the town since early this year. It was widely reported back in March that Kapinga has signed a pre-contract with the the nine PSL champions. Sundowns coach, Pitso Mosimane, gave a perspective on the club’s recruitment plan when he welcomed Kapinga. “Lesedi is a good young prospect and we are looking at getting as many young players as we can," said Mosimane in a statement. "He fits the programme with his age and the style of play. He is the type of player who likes combination play and loves one on one and taking defenders on. "He scores goals also and I wish him all the best." Kapinga can only be registered for the upcoming season when the transfer window opens and will not feature in any matches when the current season restarts.
