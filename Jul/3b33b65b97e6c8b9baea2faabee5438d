REPORTS that some people held a wedding in KZN, smack in the middle of the lockdown and videos of people having parties in different parts of the country, are incredible, to say the least. There are videos circulating on social media of a funeral that apparently happened on Friday in Soshanguve, Tshwane. In the video, it is evident that way more than 50 people were in attendance. In fact, the numbers could be several hundreds of mourners who were there. It is behaviour like this that will make it difficult to flatten the curve on coronavirus infections. When president Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday night that booze sales would be suspended again, many criticised his decision. What they forgot to say in their criticism was how irresponsible drinkers behaved during a few weeks after liquor was on the shelves. Rather than drink responsibly, Mzansi got excited and behaved as if things were back to normal. The sooner we admit that this virus is here to stay, the better. If not, the more than 4 800 deaths recorded so far will further rise.
