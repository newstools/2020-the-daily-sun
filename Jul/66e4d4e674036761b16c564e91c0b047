MZANSI's music sensation Ciza wants to be the pride of Africa. The artist, whose real name is Nkululeko Nciza, is a force to be reckoned with. The 18-year old gave radio listeners a taste of what he has in store for them, as his smashing hit single, Come Alive, played on the airwaves. The single is set to be released on 10 July on all digital platforms. Speaking to Sunday Sun, Ciza who recently dropped the name Liza as he was previously known as Ciza Liza, said his music sound received great reception. "It started very well especially with the younger market because my first single was hip hop and was popular amongst my peers in the youth," he said. Ciza continues: "My music is not meant to capture only a South African audience. It's meant to be a pride of many Africans across the world, and I believe I've got what it takes to represent my continent, through my Afrofusion sound. For my recent sound I've recorded 20 songs and only one of my singles are out on radio right now, the second single is coming out on my birthday 23rd of August." Ciza is the son of music moguls TK Nciza and Mafikizolo's Nhlahla. He said his parents told him never to limit himself. "My parents said I should never put myself in a box, respect my craft and always aim and push to be the best, image is everything. I'm preparing to shoot three of my music videos for my singles coming out in the next four months." Also read: BABES’ DAD IN MAMPINTSHA'S VIDEO!
