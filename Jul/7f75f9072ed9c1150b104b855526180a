IT'S official! Bidvest Wits will cease to exist as a PSL franchise next season. This is after the League approved the sale of their Premiership status to Limpopo-based upstarts Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivandila. Although news of the sale has long been in the public domain, the transaction needed ratification from the PSL. In a letter, PSL legal counsel Micheal Murphy informs both TTM and Black Gold Family Trust boss Lawrence Mulaudzi and Wits CEO Alan Fainman of the ratification. ”Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I have received the confirmation required and you have the approval of the transfer of Bidvest Wits FC to the black Gold Family Trust,” reads the letter. Clearance sale has already begun at the Clever Boys after the new owners made it clear they won't be retaining the majority of the players.
