AFTER
having survived bullets and the brutal system of apartheid, Zindzi Mandela
succumbed to the invisible enemy. That is how
EFF leader Julius Malema and ANC NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane described the
passing of former ambassador of South Africa to Denmark earlier today after the
burial. "She
dedicated her life to the struggle and the freedom of our people, and she
survived the most brutal regime. "We
thought with this crisis and the invisible enemy covid-19 we are confronted
with today she's going to survive because she had seen worse," Malema said
during a TV interview with SABC. Malema
added: "When people like mama Zindzi succumb to this invisible enemy, we
all remain hopeless and we are shattered because we always looked up to people
like her." Zindzi's
son, Zodwa has previously confirmed that his mum had tested positive for covid-19,
but said they couldn't rule it as the cause of death yet as they are waiting
for an autopsy report. Malema said
though it is hard to come to terms with her death, they have to accept and move
on. "We
are still in disbelief, the heart is refusing to accept, but there is nothing
we can do, that's what death demands of us, we must accept and move on." Mokonyane
said: "I will forever appreciate our looks, relationships and most
importantly the passion and respect we had for each other "Sadly,
the invincible enemy has taken her away from us. She had survived bullets,
torture, and pain inflicted by the apartheid system." Mokonyane
said she and Zindzi became activists at the early ages of 12 and 15 years old
respectively. "I
found a sister, friend, and a comrade out of struggle and pain. Added
Mokonyane: "She had been a doyen in her own right. Of importance is that
she was a feminist who valued life, who embraced everybody irrespective of
political affiliation."
