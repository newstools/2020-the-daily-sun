Although they can't wait to go back to school on Monday, their frustrated parents don't share the same sentiments. Speaking to Daily Sun a mother of a grade 6 learner. Nonjabulo Kubheka (32) said she's not ready for her child to go back to school. "There are cops everywhere today and she still isnâ€™t worried about keeping her mask on. These kids don't listen, they won't survive a day with all these rules," she said. She added that the government should just implement a pass one passes all policy for grades R to eleven. "They are risking our children's lives; the cases have reached a ridiculous number, but they are taking them back to school. I can't home school her; I'm not educated myself, so it's a big problem," said Ntombi who is also a parent. The mother of a Grade R learner Boipeli Moeti said her child is not going back to school on Monday. "She will start again next year, I'm in no hurry and have no money for a funeral. I'll look after her for the rest of the year," she said. This comes after Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced that only grades R, 6, and 11 would go back to school following calls for schools to shut down due to escalating Covid-19 cases.
