ACE Ncobo has opened up his heart and volunteered to help fund Senzo Meyiwa's child, Namhla. The People's Paper reported on Sunday that Red Farm decided to withdraw its R1 500 commitment to finance the child of the late former Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, at the end of this month. Now the former PSL and General Manager has come to rescue the daughter of Meyiwa and continue paying the R1 500 monthly for the well-being of Namhla. Ncobo said he will look into Namhla's upbringing from this month end. Ncoboâ€™s good heart commitment to 14-year-old, Namhla, until she turns 21. "I wish to challenge nine other people within the football family to join me on the same amount so that the 10 of us jointly make this R15 000," Ncobo said on Monday. "Senzo embodied the full spirit of football as the most potent weapon and agent for social cohesion. It is in the memory of that spirit that his child should never be reminded of his absence by hunger pangs."
