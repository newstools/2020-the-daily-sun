Celtic have been under serious financial trouble where the technical team would go for months without salaries, while on a better month they would get half of their pay. The team is currently on sale with most businessmen apparently interested in buying the club, including Tim Sukazi of TS Galaxy. When contacted for comment, Seema just sounded down and was in no position to confirmed the news.  Seema took over as Celtic head coach in December 2018, following the shocking departure of Steve Komphela who left to join Golden Arrows. He started with the club back in 1998 to 2005 as player and left to join Orlando Pirates. He came back to Bloemfontein as scout in 2013 and promoted to assistant coach a year later. He worked under Serame Letsoaka in 2015 and has been with almost all the coaches ever since them until he took total control.
