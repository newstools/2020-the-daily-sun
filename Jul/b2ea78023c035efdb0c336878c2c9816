FORMER eThekwini municipality mayor Zandile Gumede is returning to court today for corruption that involved the solid waste tender scandal. Gumede is expected to appear at Durban Specialised Commercial Court along with not less than 20 other suspects including ANC uMlazi councillors who were added to the corruption case. Another city official who is expected to join her in the dock is city manager Sipho Nzuza who was arrested and linked to the case earlier this year. Since Hawks arrested Gumede and former housing head councillor Mondli Mthembu last year in March the number of suspects that had been added to the case has grown. Among them are the municipalityâ€™s supply chain head Sandile Ngcobo and his wife Vuyiswa Ngcobo. Hawks alleged that Ngcobo's wife was bought a car worth over a million by three businesses who were awarded the waste tender by Vuyiswa's husband which was apparently a kickback for tenders. The businessmen are Nkululeko Blose (39), Hlenga Sibisi(44), and Mzwandile Dladla(24), who were charged with corruption and were released on R10 000 bail each. In her last appearance in April the state said the money involved in the tender scandal has risen from R208 million to R389 million.
