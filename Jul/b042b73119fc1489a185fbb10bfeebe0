Actress Zikhona Sodlaka stars in this play about typical life in Mzansi. She
  plays Agnes in Lazyboy, which is on at the Market Theatre. She’s being kicked out of her house by the Red Ants at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Zikhona told SunBuzz she’s glad to tell a story from the perspective of people who aren’t usually listened to. “People from informal settlements aren’t paid attention to when they voice out their opinions. “They’re seen as people from the wrong side of South Africa. “Agnes is proud to be South African and vocal about the country’s politics. “While they’re being evicted, she’s in her house talking about the country and everything affecting it at the moment, the pandemic included. “The play is relatable to many South Africans. We’ve seen a lot of people being evicted by the Red Ants.” Recording the play was challenging. “Firstly, this was a one-woman play, but I had to speak to other people as well. “These people were non-existent, but I had to make sure people don’t feel the people aren’t there. “Secondly, there was no audience. As performers we live for audiences, and recording without it wasn’t interesting. But there were four crew members there and I made them my audience.” Zikhona wanted the play to remind people of their fighting spirit. “Although Agnes is being evicted in the middle of chaos, the pandemic, she hasn’t lost hope,” she said. “She has an unbreakable spirit even though she’s losing her home and most of her stuff. “She also reminds people to appreciate the little they have and that they should never give up.” ) Catch Lazyboy on The Market Theatre’s Facebook page
