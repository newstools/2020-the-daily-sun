AS part of lockdown rules, booze is banned in Mzansi, leading to many dry throats. But Christmas came early for Tshwane residents on Monday. A truck carrying booze lost control on the Mabopane highway and residents helped themselves to the booze. The incident was caught on videos and circulated on social media. In one video, hundreds of people are seen running to grab packs of beers from the truck. In another video, a man is heard saying the truck fell and people are taking beer. “Cyril Ramaphosa said alcohol is closed, but it fell here and people are picking it up,” he said. “This lockdown is hard. Cyril, my brother, people are leaving with packs of beers. It’s lit. Lockdown is failing you.” In another video, a woman is heard saying she wished she wasn’t wearing work uniform. The sound of shooting can also be heard in another video and people run away with beer in their hands. Many social media users rejoiced. Captain Mavela Masondo said: “No arrests have been made yet and investigations continue.”
