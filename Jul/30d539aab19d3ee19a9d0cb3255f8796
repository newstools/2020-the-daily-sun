GUGULETHU residents are in shock after a man allegedly stabbed his mum nine times in front of his eight-year-old child. The 29-year-old allegedly stabbed his mum after she refused to give him money for drugs on Tuesday evening. Witnesses said the body had nine stab wounds and was bleeding profusely when the woman was rushed to hospital. She was in the kitchen preparing supper when her son apparently demanded money from her. Neighbour Veronica Libido (66) said: “How can he do that to his own mother, who did everything for him. “I was at my house when I heard her screaming. When I got there he sped away in her car and left her in a pool of blood. She was rushed to hospital but died on the way.” Residents told the SunTeam the dead woman took her son to rehab more than twice. She was a member of the Salvation Army in Gugulethu. Witness Langa Jinya said he was walking past when he heard screaming coming from the house and saw the son fleeing. “He got into the car and drove off at high speed,” he said. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops were looking for the suspect. “A case of murder was opened for investigation after a 66-year-old woman was stabbed and later died due to her injuries.”
