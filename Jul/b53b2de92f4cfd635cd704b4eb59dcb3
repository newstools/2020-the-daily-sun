Khanyi Mbau took to Instagram to explain why she lightens her skin and in the process, educated the masses about skin lightening. She said she has been lightening her skin for the past 12 years. Khanyi said she has had good and bad results, but most importantly, she has spent a lot of money."The reason why I lightened my skin is it is easier for lightning on a movie set, number two, it looks better on the gram. I use products guys, I endorse brands and my content needs to pop. So your lifestyle and mine are not the same. I don't like wearing make-up, so the lighter I look, the fresher I look, but I'm not saying that dark people don't look fresh, it is my choice," she said.She furthermore spoke about her journey of skin lightening. Khanyi addressed several issues, including people accusing her of being ashamed of being black."Being black doesn't mean you have to be black. Being black is a state of being, being black is a state of spirit. Being black is a state of how you think and how you see yourself. But it doesn't mean you need to look indigenous, why are we living in a world that won't allow us to explore and be who we want to be?"
