KAIZER Chiefs veteran Bernard Parker has spoken of his delight as the squad returned to training this week, nearly four months since they were last together. Chiefs are hoping to wrap up a first Absa Premiership title in four years this season, and lead second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns by four points, though they have played a game more and have eight matches remaining. But for Parker, just being on the training pitch again is a big step forward and a reason for celebration, before they start to think about matches. “It really feels good to be back at training,” Parker told his club’s website. “This virus caught us all off-guard. I was so used to training at the High Performance Centre at the Village, often working out extra, and never acquired a treadmill at home. “Luckily, I have a nice garden, so I worked out in the garden, doing a lot of running and all kinds of other exercises.” “It’s also great to be with your teammates again. It’s like a breath of fresh air" Parker hopes that at some stage the go-ahead will be given to resume and finish the 2019-2020 Premiership season. “We will take it one step at a time. At present, I am just happy to be back on the field.”
