 IT ALL started when young Nqubeko Ndlela used to impersonate his favourite radio hosts for fun. But now the 27-year-old works on radio and he’s never been happier. The DJ from Nongoma, KZN, realised his radio dream when he was featured on Ukhozi FM’s youth show, Teen Zone, in 2015. It was hosted by Nomfundo Mkhize on Saturdays. Nqubeko told SunBuzz: “While doing Teen Zone I was inspired by well-known presenters such as Mroza Buthelezi, Selby Mkhize, Dudu Khoza and DJ Sgqemeza. “I told myself that I can do what they are doing.” He joined local radio station Nongoma FM in 2015 through auditions. “I’m still with the station to polish my presenting talents. Hopefully I’ll join Ukhozi FM when the time is right,” he said. In 2016 he scooped the Best Radio Presenter award at the South African Volunteers Awards. And in 2017, he was nominated at the Live Your Dream SA Awards for Best Radio Presenter, but didn’t win. When he’s not on radio, Nqubeko is an MCs at various events and is also a motivational speaker. He said he motivates the youth on how to follow their dreams. He’s also the co-owner of Nonzamela and a marketing director of Khuthazeka foundations, which helps Nongoma villages. Nqubeko said 2020 has been good as he became the brand ambassador of many clothing labels and food companies.
