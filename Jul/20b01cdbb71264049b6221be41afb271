PEOPLE across the country were furious when government officials visited gravesites being dug this week. On Wednesday, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku visited Honingnestkrans Cemetery in Tshwane to check the state of readiness. However, the sight of TLBs digging graves for coronavirus victims upset many. The MEC said: “We’ll be visiting other places to check the readiness. The nature of this disease is that 1% of people infected do die and those are mostly elders.” Masuku said that the provincial government had 1,5 million grave sites ready. Sedibeng and Ekurhuleni district cluster manager for forensic pathology, Moeketsi Ramatsa, said the dead were put in double body bags. “We encourage families to go with funeral undertakers to identify bodies before they’re put in double body bags, which are sealed,” he said. “The body will not be taken to the family home overnight. “It will be taken on the day of the funeral and the coffin will not be opened at home.” Masuku said he had been visiting a number of hospitals, gravesites and mortuaries over the past few weeks. However, his latest visit had social media abuzz. “They’ve lost hope and already gave up the fight against the virus. “Why didn’t they build hospitals like China? This is an ANC government. Only the strongest survive.” Traditional expert Refiloe Khunou said graves in African culture were not dug up before people died. “We dig when people are dead and normal people dig graves on the day of burial,” he said. Mkhulu Kenneth Jeta of the Greater Tshwane Traditional and Faith Healers Sector said that it was not allowed for a grave to stay open as it invited death to a family.
