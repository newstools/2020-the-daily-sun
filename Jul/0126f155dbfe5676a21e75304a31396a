MASKANDI is the one genre where musicians thought live was the only way to perform. But because of Covid-19, these artists have had a change of mind as they prepare for the Lockdown Maskandi Festival, their first online festival which will be held in Durban on 5 September. The purpose of the festival is to rescue artists and help them with some income during these tough times, as well as raising awareness about Covid-19 and gender-based violence. Event organiser, former Ukhozi FM maskandi and SABC1 Roots presenter Ngizwe Mchunu told Daily Sun he was tired of seeing other genres’ online festivals while maskandi artists were just sitting at home, waiting to be rescued. “This will be the first-ever online maskandi festival. Corona has pushed us amabhinca to consider using technology,” he said. “I hope artists will get money to help their families, as many of them are not working.” He said fans will get information about Covid-19 and the fight against GBV. “People will watch the festival on their cellphones,” he said. Ngizwe, who now owns online radio station Ngizwe Mchunu FM, said artists will get an opportunity to motivate their fans about Covid-19 and convey messages of support to make sure people were following the lockdown regulations. “All maskandi people must accept their way of life has changed. We must try to move with the times and not be left behind. We will start September, the culture month, on a high note,” he said. The festival is being presented in partnership with the Department of Arts and Culture.
