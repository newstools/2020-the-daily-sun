MAMA Joy Chauke says she’s ready to beat the coronavirus. The well-known Orlando Pirates supporter told Daily Sun she tested positive but would beat it. Speaking from a hospital bed, the 46-year-old said she believed she’d tested positive in order to serve as an example to those who don’t believe the virus exists. She said: “I have no clue where I might have contracted the virus. I was careful. Those who’re still in denial, take note and start taking it seriously.” Joy didn’t show any symptoms, but collapsed at home on Thursday morning. “My son rushed me to the nearest clinic and I was taken to hospital,” said Joy, who’s from Dobsonville in Soweto. “On arrival, I was immediately taken to a ward where I was tested. “At the time I had blurry vision and had begun to feel chest pains. I was struggling to breathe. “Days before my results came back, I constantly had a dry throat and I couldn’t smell or taste food. “By the time I received the results, I was ready and determined to fight the virus.” Joy, a security guard, said she took precautions at work and never left the house for any other reason. Joy said one of the people who reached out and prayed for her was Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng. “I was in so much pain and struggling to breathe. “I called Prophet Mboro asking him for prayer. We prayed over the phone and I’ve been feeling better since them. “I’ve also been receiving messages of hope and comfort.” Her two sons were self-isolating while waiting for their test results. Mboro, who’s on a campaign of prayer against the virus, said: ““I believe she’ll receive healing from God and I’m grateful that she trusted me to pray for her.”
