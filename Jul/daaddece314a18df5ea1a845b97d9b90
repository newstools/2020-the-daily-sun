VETERAN actress Candy Moloi has died aged 67. The actress, who played vho-Makhadzi on SABC2’s Muvhango, died in a Tshwane hospital on Tuesday. Family spokeswoman Nthabiseng Moloi said she had been battling cancer for two years. “We’re all still processing the news because you don’t expect death. The pain is still fresh and raw.” Candy won a Safta in the Best Supporting Actress category for her role on Muvhango in 2009. She was recently on SABC2’s Giyani: Land of Blood and also starred in Ring of Lies, Thola and Death of a Queen. Her daughter Lerato Zah Moloi followed her into acting. In a statement yesterday, Muvhango and production company Word of Mouth paid tribute to Candy: “Mme Candy played the original vho-Makhadzi on Muvhango and was one of the original cast members who started with the production in 1997.” Advertising agency Candymol Productions described Candy as a mentor to many actors, a businesswoman and agency founder. She was also a broadcaster and owned production company Candy Moloi Productions. Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane tweeted: “Rest in peace Candy Moloi. Your contributions will not be forgotten.” Actress Didie Makobane wrote: “I’m saddened to learn about the passing of Mme Candy Moloi, the original Vho-Makadzi. Thank you for paving the way.” Funeral details haven’t been finalised yet, but Candy will be buried in Thohoyandou.
