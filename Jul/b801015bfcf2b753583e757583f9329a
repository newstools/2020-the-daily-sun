AFRO HOUSE singer and songwriter Mbulelo Qala (29) has released a single titled Lu Nqabile. This is a step forward for the talented artist who was part of a musical group called The Gauge. Speaking to SunBuzz, Mbulelo said: “Lu Nqabile is about the hardships and heartache that people experience in relationships. “The song tells people that instead of breaking your partner’s heart you should appreciate them, take care of them and protect them.” Mbulelo loves making music. “Even though I do jazz, I’m not one to box myself in. “I experiment a lot with music and most of the time I draw inspiration from my personal experiences. “I believe when you give something a personal touch, that’s when you win the listeners hearts. “It shows people that you are not different from them, and it makes you and your music more relatable,” he said. The musician said since he burst onto the music scene, it has not been easy for him. “I once signed a sour deal with two other guys I was in a band with. “The deal kept me hostage. It prevented me from working with any other artist or making money on the side,” said Mbulelo. Because of that I fell into a state of depression, but I eventually managed to get myself out of that deal. Soon after, I was booked for my first show and my fan base started growing and bookings started trickling in.” Mbulelo said he’s working on an album. “I’m not in a rush to release an album, but people can expect heart-warming stories from it. At the moment I want to keep pushing this single.” His single is available on all digital platforms.
