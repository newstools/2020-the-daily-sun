A KwaZulu-Natal teacher, who was shot and wounded when gunmen
opened fire on a taxi carrying school staff members three weeks ago, has died,
the education department said on Monday. On 23 June, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/three-teachers-fighting-for-their-lives-driver-dead-as-gunman-shoots-at-staff-taxi-in-kwazulu-natal-20200623" &gt;driver of a school staff taxi died and three teachers
were critically wounded&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after a gunman fired shots at the
vehicle transporting them to Masijabule High School. Now, three weeks later, one of
the wounded teachers has died. "The MEC for Education Kwazi Mshengu sends his condolences to the family,
friends and learners of Masijabule High School, due to the tragic loss of its
educator who passed away this morning," the MEC said in a statement. "The deceased educator was
in the taxi that got involved in a shooting incident last month near Wartburg
in the Umgungundlovu District. He was discharged from the Inkosi Albert Luthuli
Hospital last week, Thursday, 9 July." Mshengu didn't share more
details. "Our fervent prayers are
with the family of our departed educator during this difficult period." Shooting News24 in June reported that
teachers were travelling in a staff taxi when unknown gunmen opened fire on the
vehicle. Three teachers, aged between 40
and 53, sustained gunshot wounds, while a 35-year-old driver was declared dead
at the scene after sustaining a gunshot wound to his upper body. The three teachers were in a
critical condition at the time of the incident. Mshengu had called on Transport
and Community Safety and Liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli to deploy a police task team
to investigate incidents of taxi-related violence following the incident.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/teacher-dies-after-kzn-shooting-three-weeks-ago-20200713
