AJAX Cape Town could gain automatic to the Absa Premiership without playing the remaining games of the GladAfrica Championship. SunSport has reliably learnt that the Premier Soccer League's main priority now is to complete Absa Premiership and Nnedbank Cup all costs. There is a proposal that the GladAfrica could end where the log standings stand at the present with leaders Ajax Cape Town promoted. The fate of the remainder of the GladAfrica Championship season could be decided on Tuesday when the Board of Governors meet to rubber-stamp return to play plans. This will mean second-placed Moroka Swallows and third-placed Uthongathi FC qualifying to go into the promotion and relegation play-offs with the team who finish second-from- bottom in the Absa Ppremiership.The question was put to PSL chairman Dr Irvin Khoza on Monday, who said that for now the plan was to complete the season in the bio-bubble in Gauteng, but admitted that could change. “As for the GladAfrica Championship, the board of governors resolved that all 32 clubs must go into the bubble, which is what was part of the submissions to the minister,” he said. “There’s another BOG meeting taking place tomorrow [Tuesday]. Whether there will be changes is another story. But for now, as things stand, all 32 clubs must go into the bubble.” If the PSL did halt the second-tier season now it would solve several logistical and financial headaches around accommodation, training venues, testing and so on, and might be popular with most clubs who face an expensive bill to complete the campaign away from their bases. It would also allow the PSL to concentrate on finishing the top-flight campaign by their self-appointed 31 August deadline. The PSL suspended matches more than 100 days ago‚ on March 16m due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
