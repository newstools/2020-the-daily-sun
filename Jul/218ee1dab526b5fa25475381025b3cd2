Most companies don’t employ people who have a criminal record. Ex-cons don’t have sympathy where money is concerned and can dupe you with nice talk. Mzansi is sinking due to corrupt ANC leaders. I was touched by the story of workers who weren’t paid by a tenderpreneur with ANC links. Shame on these leaders: you’ll leave those bags full of our tax cash when death visits. Poor people still live like animals, drink dirty river water, and don’t have electricity. The money that was supposed to service them was stolen by leaders.
