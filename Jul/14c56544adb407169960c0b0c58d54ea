Criminals who kill school security guards are barbaric. A few guards died recently in schools this year after they were shot during robberies. Iâ€™d like to condemn such senseless killings. It goes without saying that security guards make sure schools are safe during lockdown. Unfortunately, some of them have had to pay with their lives. The security guards are also breadwinners, brothers and fathers. It would appear that South African schools are under siege. Therefore, communities need to stand up against the crimes that take place on school premises. They must work with law enforcement to provide information that will help solve crime. Security guards need our protection.
