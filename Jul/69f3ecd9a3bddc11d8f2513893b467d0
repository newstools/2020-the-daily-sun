Itumeleng Khune says he wants to play until he is 50 after praising recently retired Essam El-Hadary for a sensational career. The 33-year-old Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper revealed his admiration for the Egyptian shot-stopper, who called time on his career at the age of 47. With a post on his official Twitter account, Khune, who has been a professional footballer for 16 years, wrote: "Retiring at the age of 47. You are a living legend that shows that age is just a number. "You ran a great race El-Hadary, you inspired a lot of goalkeepers to continue playing at the highest level. Happy retirement.
