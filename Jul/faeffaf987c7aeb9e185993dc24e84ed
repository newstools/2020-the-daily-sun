THE Independent Music Performance Rights Association has lost its licence. Impra’s accreditation lapsed on 19 July and the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission has refused to renew it. According to trade and industry spokesman Sidwell Medupe, Impra refused to submit financial statements and to be audited by the commission. The refusal was used as grounds not to renew its accreditation. Medupe said the association couldn’t distribute any funds as it needed the commission’s approval. “Impra failed to provide necessary information in its application after the commission provisionally refused the renewal application. “In addition, Impra doesn’t want to allow the commission to audit its books on how it distributed the collected monies.” Meanwhile, the SABC has paid a R10 million relief fund to artists. The money was paid into Impra’s account. ZODWA PAYS R240K FOR BODYGUARDS! SABC spokeswoman, Mmoni Seapolelo, said: “It was agreed that societies would distribute the funds to their members. “This decision was prompted by challenges faced by artists, who’ve been unable to generate an income during Covid-19.” CEO Dodo Monamodi confirmed the commission no longer had accreditation and that it refused to renew it. He said: “On 20 July, Impra received a letter from the commissioner informing Impra that its application for renewal of its accreditation had been refused. “In terms of the provisions of the Collecting Society Regulations, the registrar must furnish Impra with formal reasons within 30 days for the commission’s decision not to renew Impra’s accreditation. “We’re therefore awaiting reasons for the non-renewal and will bring an application for a review. Impra has no doubt as to its right to renew its accreditation.”
