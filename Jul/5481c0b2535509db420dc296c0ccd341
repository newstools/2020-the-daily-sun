FORMER Bafana Bafana defender Mark Fish found himself in hot water on Wednesday for liking a controversial post on Twitter in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. In an explative filled Tweet, a user named @Chris_ZAR280 criticised everyone who has supported the Black Lives Matter movement from the Proteas, the Springboks, to Formula One and Siya Kolisi.The user went on to claim that Springbok captain Kolisi, who supported the movement in an powerful video on Sunday, was “a BEE appointment”. Fish, who played 62 times for Bafana Bafana during his almost 15-year career, liked the tweet. Fuck BLM, Springbok rugby, SA cricket, F1 and everyone bowing to BLM. Fuck Kolisi, he's a BEE appointment, he is a kak player and even worse captain. Racist MN arrived to a white girl, just like Mmaimane! Hypocrisy at its best! “Mark Fish, since you liked this post, please tell us where you stand on this matter?” the ex-Orlando Pirates star was asked by Twitter user @Terryboysa73. Fish replied: “All lives matter.” All lives matter...!! He continued, “If you stand for nothing you will fall for everything. All Lives matter.” The former Leeds United centre-back then added that he was "certainly not a racist" for proclaiming 'All Lives Matter' and asked his Twitter followers "when will we move forward". If you stand for nothing you will fall for everything....All Lives matter??  Mark Fish’s denial of the legitimacy of Black Lives Matter reflects the failure of the rainbow nation ideology his sportsmanship in Bafana Bafana represented. It tells you that within rainbowism is a denial of the black condition, false equality & fake unity!
