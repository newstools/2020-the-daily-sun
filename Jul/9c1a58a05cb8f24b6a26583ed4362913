MEASURES have been tightened against Covid-19 as the number of cases rise in Limpopo. In preparation for the worst, Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha and Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba opened the province’s Covid-19 High Care Facility in Modimolle yesterday. Limpopo previously had 54 ICU beds and the high care beds have now increased to 310 after the converted Modimolle Multi-Drug Resistant TB Hospital was opened. The hospital was previously criticised when healthcare workers who tested positive were kept there for self-isolation, but complains were brought forward that the premises weren’t suitable. The facility has since been refurbished with high class wards for the admission of critical patients. Mathabatha said they realised they would need a comprehensive plan with thoroughly researched projections. “We first reached out to our people to teach them about the dangers of Covid-19, and that campaign has really opened their eyes. Developing health facilities and water and sanitation at our schools was prioritised in our budget. We have a plan to build permanent toilets in schools and provide water as well,” he said.  Mathabatha also took a walk-about at the refurbished facility. Ramathuba said there would be a need for beds as more people got infected.  Limpopo has 5 746 infections with 64 deaths, while 2 796 people have recovered.
