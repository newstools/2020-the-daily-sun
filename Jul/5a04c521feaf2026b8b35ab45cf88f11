 It has been an interesting two weeks where the PSL and Safa have been in disagreements when it comes to the return of football. Now Safa is using the referees as another reason why the 2019-20 PSL season cannot resume on 18 July, as initially proposed by the league. The NSL Board of Governors met on Tuesday, 14 July, to deliberate on the way forward as they seem to have hit a brick wall with their plans for the resumption of football on 18 July. Tebogo Motlanthe, PSL CEO, tells SunSport Radio that their referees are not prepared to start officiating football this weekend, but can only be ready on the first week of August.
