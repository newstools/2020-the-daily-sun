The president is actually doing good by not considering another hard lockdown. He’ll be criticised a lot. There are rapid increases in the number of infections, and so people are panicking, saying it’s still not safe for this, it’s still not safe for that. The question is: will it ever be safe? What if this virus is here to stay? DIVORCE ON THE RISE DURING LOCKDOWN! The problem is that people are convinced that the virus will go away for sure, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. If we go back to a hard lockdown and things don’t improve, two things will happen. Firstly, people will blame the government for not doing enough. Secondly, they will eventually get fed up and start violating the lockdown regulations. We will have more people dying in the streets fighting for their freedom than people dying of the virus itself. Then there are job losses, and therefore loss of revenue for the government, as well for many street vendors.
