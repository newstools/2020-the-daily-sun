BUYISWA Manono needs help getting her 17-year-old son Asanda off drugs. The 39-year-old petrol attendant from Philippi, Cape Town, said she had been trying to get him to stop using drugs for four years. She tried sending him to stay with relatives in Malmesbury, but when he came back, he just started doing drugs again. She said she had no option other than to chain him to her bed.

Buyiswa said the teenager was brought home by a crowd accusing him of stealing a phone and she feared he’d be killed, which was why she chained him up when she left to work night shifts. “When he goes out and steals from people to buy drugs, they will take the law into their own hands. My fear is they will kill him,” said the worried mum. Buyiswa said when Asanda wanted drugs, he’d sell whatever he could find in the house. “It looks like I’m unemployed because everything in my house is old. The property you see here is old because no one will buy it. STRIPPER: I'M NO BABY MAKER! “He sells anything he can,” said the devastated mum. Buyiswa said she was desperate for any form of help to rehabilitate him. “If he gets help, I will try and move away from this place to an area where he won’t have drug buddies.” Social development spokesman Joshua Chigome said they were aware of the matter. “A team has been sent to investigate and determine the full nature of assistance needed. We’ll be able to provide more information once the investigation has been completed.”
