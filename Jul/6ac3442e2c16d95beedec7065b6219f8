Cartoonist Mhlonishwa can’t believe his self-titled animated cartoon series is loved all over Mzansi. The artist, who wanted to remain anonymous, is excited that people are responding well to his work. His Swati videos have been trending all over social media. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “It’s crazy how my videos are everywhere. When I started this, I posted the videos on my WhatsApp and my friends loved them. “They asked me to open a page on Facebook. I did and the videos just blew up. That gave me the courage to continue.” Mhlonishwa said he was inspired by Noko Mashaba and Izikhokho. “They were quite big in South Acrica and a lot of people loved and enjoyed watching their videos. “I was one of the people who really enjoyed their videos, to a point where I was inspired to start my own thing. “However, I didn’t know how and where to start. I was introduced to a software. I’m still learning and my cartoons are improving every day,” he said. The rising star said he wants to make Swati comedy big. “I used my home language because I noticed there aren’t a lot of Swati comedians. “So this was my chance to make my language big. Choosing Swati was a great decision. It’s part of the reason my cartoons grew and attracted fans.” His plan is to grow even bigger. “I’d like to see Mhlonishwa on TV and I’d like to work with experienced people,” he said. “At the moment I’m doing adverts for small companies, but I’d like to work with big companies too.”
