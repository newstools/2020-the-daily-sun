Dear MizzB I’M an 18-year-old girl and have been sleeping with my best friend’s dad for six months. He buys me everything I need and gives me attention as well. Some people saw us at the mall and I’m afraid they’ll tell my friend. I don’t want to lose my friend as she’s like a sister to me. Do I tell her or just keep quiet? Dear Sistas As people, we have different understanding of what a “friend” is. When you consider someone a friend, you protect their feelings in every way possible and avoid doing anything that will harm them in any way. Put yourself in your friend’s shoes and ask yourself how you’d feel if she were to be romantically involved with your dad. You are old enough to decide on what matters the most for you. You need to choose between your friendship or your relationship with her father. Unfortunately, you can’t have both. Choose wisely. All the best!
