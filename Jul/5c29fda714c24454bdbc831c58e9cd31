A 21-year-old Limpopo mother and her 19-year-old accomplice have been bust and are expected to appear in Dzanani magistrate court on Monday. This is after they gave zol and booze to the 21-year-old woman’s son, whose is 2 years old. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects were arrested on Saturday soon after the police assessed video clips that went viral on social media, showing the woman giving her son dagga to smoke and alcohol to consume. Her accomplice can be heard in the background persuading the little boy to indulge. The mother was arrested in Rabali village and her accomplice at Dzanani under Siloam policing area. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has strongly condemned the actions of the two women and has commended the police for their swift response. The child has been removed and handed over to the grandmother for caregiving. The suspects will face a charge of contravening the Children’s Act, 38 of 2005 (Child Abuse) and if convicted, they will be sent to jail for a period of up to ten (10) years, or fine or both these sentences.
