TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday inspected different sites belonging to Prasa. His inspection came as the rail agency prepared to gradually start offering its services again. The minister inspected the Wolmerton Depot, Pienaarspoort Station and Pretoria Station in Tshwane. He observed the social distancing measures in place, the sanitisation of facilities and the use of PPEs by officials. Mbalula said he was pleased with the measures taken by Prasa and its overall state of readiness. However, he said there was still work to do. Trains were due to reopen today. “The number of commuters will be monitored to ensure the virus doesn’t spread,” he said, stressing that security would make sure social distancing rules were observed. Mbalula said his department was on track to bring stability to Prasa. He said the outbreak of the coronavirus had interrupted the work being done to repair the organisation. “Infrastructure upgrades and rolling stock refreshments were also suspended under the initial lockdown regulations. To make matters worse, vandalism continued to plague the train sets and stations.” When asked about taxis, Mbalula said he met with associations on Monday and talks were being treated as a matter of urgency.
