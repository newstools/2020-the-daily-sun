DRESSED in all black and wearing a sequenced mask, Somizi Mhlongo-Motaung gave a moving tribute to his mother. The funeral service was held at Grace Bible Church in Pimville, Soweto, yesterday. A visibly shattered Somizi stood bravely next to his husband Mohale Motaung-Mhlongo and spoke about his relationship with his mum “I might have lost a mother in this life, but I have gained a powerful ancestor who loved me unconditionally,” he said. Somizi said he planned to bury his mother in the cheapest coffin with one rose on top because he took care of her while she was still alive.  “A lot of people give their parents an extravagant send-off to try to make it look like they were there for them, trying to ease their guilt. I have no point to prove because my mother was always a priority and part of everything I did,” he said. Mama Mary (80) died at Netcare Park Lane Hospital in Joburg on Saturday. She had been in and out of hospital for several months.  Somizi said before mama Mary died, she told the doctor she wanted a lot of flowers at her funeral and to be buried in the same dress she wore at Somizi’s wedding. Praising his mum’s work ethic, humour and humility, Somizi said his mother was very successful at home and on screen. Messages from industry friends who could not attend the funeral were shared in a video. Among those who spoke were Connie Chiume, Rapulana Seiphemo and Jerry Mofokeng. Rebecca Malope sang at the service.
