NORMAN Mkhonto is worried he might not be able to provide for his family after three of his donkeys mysteriously died last week. The 53-year-old from Edinburgh Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, said he believed a jealous person might be behind the deaths. He told Daily Sun three of his nine donkeys, which were his only source of income, died and four more were weak and sick. Norman told the SunTeam he was trying his best to save the animals, but he’s fighting a losing battle. “My heart is bleeding after seeing my donkeys dying one after another. Last Wednesday, two of them died and on Friday, the third one died. On Friday, I noticed the others were not eating and looked weak. I fed them maize, crops and water, but it didn’t help,” he said. “Evil people are behind all of this. They are jealous of my animals because they put food on my table. I am helping the poor by transporting water, sand and firewood with my donkey cart at a reasonable price,” he said. In 2009, Norman approached Daily Sun about the same issue. At the time, a number of his donkeys died and he put a healing charm around the neck of one to protect it from being bewitched. An SPCA doctor from the Free State saw the article and drove to Norman’s village to deworm his donkeys, which saved their lives. Patrick Nyathi of the Ehlanzeni North agriculture department offices advised Norman to contact his office, so vets could be sent to help him.
