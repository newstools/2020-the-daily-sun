MTHANDENI “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele has revealed his HIV status. The maskandi artist said on Facebook: “Due to my illness I had to do a full body check up and today I am glad to announce that I’ve been cleared.” He said he was 100% clean and HIV negative. I’m actually healthier than I thought. He encouraged his fellow colleagues in the entertainment industry to visit their local clinics or health care centres and do HIV test. “I understand it’s not an easy decision and it’s scary, but it’s important to know your HIV status. That way you can prevent opportunistic diseases and improve your lifespan,” he wrote. He said he went for a check up after falling ill. “I didn’t know what was wrong with me as I was had colds and hot flushes. I suspected witchcraft, but I knew it’d have no power over me as I’m a child of God.” Mthandeni said it was not the first time he did an HIV test. “I practise safe sex and I make sure I watch what I eat. In our industry we’d rather blame witchcraft instead of confronting the truth. “But this time around I posted my results for all to see, so my fans and colleagues can be inspired to get tested. “I know I can influence people by showing my results.” Daily Sun reported on how Mthandeni fell sick. At the time it was suspected tokoloshes had a hand in his illness, as doctors couldn’t find anything wrong with him.
