The 35-year-old Kabokweni father in Mpumalanga who is facing a rape charge for the alleged rape of her 20-month-old baby reportedly exposed the child to pornographic material. The father is due to appear at the KaBokweni Magistrates Court today. The mother told Daily Sun that early this year she suspected that the father was sexually abusing her daughter. She said the father had previously ordered her to leave the child behind while she was going to work. "When I came back from work, one of the girls that live around told me that they heard my baby crying. The girl told me she had tried to push the door to investigate what was happening, but the father chased her away. “I didn't take it seriously because I never thought he would do something like this," she said. She said she noticed later when she was bathing her. The toddler was crying and didn't want her mother to touch her on her private parts. She said the father had once pretended to be sleeping, and allegedly put in a pornographic video, switched off the volume and tried to penetrate her daughter. She said she woke up and asked him what he was doing but he pretended to be peeing.
