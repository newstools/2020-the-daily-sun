Radio presenter Relebogile Lairi is glad she didn’t give up on her dream. Relebogile didn’t crack it the first time, but didn’t give up. Speaking to SunBuzz, the 32-year-old from the Vaal, south of Joburg, said: “I left theVaal for Joburg in 2008 to pursue a career in radio. “I applied at the Y Academy, but didn’t make it. “However, that didn’t kill my dream. “I stayed in Joburg and got a job at a call centre. “After seven years at the call centre, I quit and studied radio.” After graduating in 2016, she didn’t have a job. She went back to call centre work, but took a job with less work, so she could pursue radio. “In 2017, a friend of mine who worked for Massive Metro asked me to be a researcher on her show,” she said. “Later on she gave a five-minute slot, and that was my first time on radio.” Sadly, that show was canned. She was a presenter on Sedibeng FM from 2018 to March this year. She’s now with Hope FM. Relebogile wants to be on a commercial radio station in 24 months time. “This is a 24-month goal that I’m working towards,” she said. “But beyond that I’d like to be a community radio pioneer.”
