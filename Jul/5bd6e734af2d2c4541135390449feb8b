CORRUPTION allegations about the allocation of RDP houses have again surfaced in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Residents claim many RDPs are given to foreigners in Siyanqoba, while rightful beneficiaries are sidelined. Gogo Emmah Mahlangu (67), who shares a two-bedroom house with 16 people including her kids and grandkids, two of whom are living with disability, told Daily Sun she hoped one of her kids would get an RDP after applying years ago. She hoped that by this year, some of the family would have been in their houses, but foreigners are benefiting. “We cannot follow Covid-19 regulations because we are overcrowded. There is no social distancing here,” said gogo. “It’s a mess. There’s no privacy and it’s hard to survive.  “It will be better if my children benefit because I don’t have money to build them houses.” Gogo Anna Moa (67) said she was disappointed in how government processed things. “My child has been waiting 27 years. When we go to the municipality to check, they tell us to wait because there are many houses and we’ll get them.” In May, it came out that a local councillor was allegedly selling houses, but apparently no action was taken. Mpumalanga human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe said the multi-year project was expected to deliver about 10 000 housing units and other social facilities and to date, 3 473 housing units were completed and a process of handing them over to rightful beneficiaries is ongoing by both the municipality and the department. “We identified potential beneficiaries through the beneficiary management policy which prioritises vulnerable groups such as the aged, child-headed, orphans and people living with disabilities. As far as the department is concerned, the application and allocation processes are followed to the letter, however, allegations of corruption, fraud and illegal selling of houses are being attended to on a case basis. Residents are urged to report such matters to law enforcement.”
