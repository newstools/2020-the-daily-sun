AYANDA Patosi is pleading with Safa to get more scouts that will assess overseas based players performances. Patosi, who currently play for Iran side Foolad on loan from Cape Town City stressed that not having enough scouts abroad has robbed talented players like Mihlali Mayambela the chance to get at least an Under-23 call-up. The 23-year-old Mayambela plays for Israel side Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv on loan from Portugal outfit Farense. Said Patosi: “We need scouts to look after South African players abroad. When Phiri (Lebogang) was playing in Denmark (for Brondby IF) he was not called, but now that he is playing in France they call him. Mihlali played in Portugal and now Israel, he is young, talented, but didn’t get Under-23 call-up. We need scouts, I don’t have to talk more as If I am judging SA scouts, but we need to improve on that. You can’t tell me that Mihlali doesn’t deserve to play for Under-23’s.” The 27-year-old Patosi is concerned that more overseas based players are overlooked for local players without experience. “When you select players from the Vodacom League (ABC Motsepe) and leave out a player from Israel it’s something else. I am not saying you should give guarantees, but if he is playing week in week out in Israel, Holland and Belgium he deserves a chance to play for the Under-23s. I don’t want to get too much into it as it will get me in trouble.” Despite the setback, Patosi is still hopeful that he will get another chance to represent South Africa again having last donned the national jersey during the 2013 Africa Nations Cup on home soil. “I started my Bafana career in 2012 under coach Gordon Igesund. I got injured in 2013 Afcon and I was out for nine months injured. After two months injured it’s always difficult to come back to the performance I had before.  I am doing my bit and hope coach (Molefi Ntseki) will give me a chance even if it’s for training.”
