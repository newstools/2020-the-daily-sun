 The Department of Transport has given motorists a lifeline and extended the validity of expired licences until November. In June, the Road Traffic Management Corporation announced that all learner’s licences, driving licences, motor vehicle licence discs, that expired during lockdown were deemed valid and their validity period was extended by 90 days from 1 June to 31 August 2020. “The extension to the end of November is a great start, and we certainly welcome this move by the Department of Transport. It’s the correct decision and it indicates that the department is aware of the problems motorists are facing. “However, we still believe this does not provide enough time to deal with the backlogs and we will continue with our petition which seeks extension until at least the end of January next year,” said Automobile Association CEO Willem Groenewald. Groenewald said: “We applaud the department for taking a pragmatic approach to this issue, and for acknowledging problems at the Driving Licence Testing Centres. “Now that we have reached this point, we think it is vital to press ahead with our call for a further extension. The interests of the motorists must be protected and we cannot stop until we have reached our goal of an extension to at least the end of January 2021,” added Groenewald. Groenewald said the majority of drivers in South Africa prefer to remain compliant with the regulations and to be on the road legally. “Despite the system being problematic, drivers take the necessary steps to ensure they remain within the law. However, given the current constraints on the system, many are faced with the real possibility that they may not be able to do this”. He noted that an issue that would be faced by drivers who are unable to renew discs or driving cards may have problems if they are involved in crashes as insurers may repudiate claims based on the fact that the drivers are not on the road legally.
