Pitso Mosimane says Mamelodi Sundowns are finding new and "clever" ways to prepare their players ahead of the restart of the 2019/20 Absa Premiership season. The Brazilians are hoping to defend their 2018/19 league title by overtaking current leaders Kaizer Chiefs in their final nine games of the currently suspended campaign. With teams still uncertain as to when the league will resume, and with a number of conditions in place to ensure a safe training environment, Mosimane is taking each challenge as it comes. Speaking to his club's official website, the Sundowns boss said: "Training has been good and it has its challenges, the new training programmes... like training in small groups and to train according to social distancing regulations." He added: "Even with match analysis, we have to set up in a balcony and put a projector because we can't be in the conference room and it is challenging. You cannot hear the players when they talk because they are wearing masks. "Training under these regulations means you must be clever, must find alternatives. We not complaining, we been doing well. "The tactical side has been a challenge because we can't do 11 v 11 so we train in departments."  SOURCE:Â SPORT24
