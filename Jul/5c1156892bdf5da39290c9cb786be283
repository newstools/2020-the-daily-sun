THE Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa officials visited Loftus Station in Tshwane. The visited station is one of the vandalised areas as cables were stolen. During the site visit PRASA has appealed to community to also help in monitoring it's infrastructure as it is theirs too. PRASA introduced a diesel train between Pienaarspoort and Pretoria Station on Tuesday. According to PRASA other corridors in the country are vandalised. PRASA's Head of Security Retired Brigadier General Tebogo Rakau said they are not only losing revenue due to the vandalism but also lives. He said PRASA's problem was that the infrastructure is open and want to change that and make it look like Gautrain as a phase they are taking as an entity. "In two weeks we will beef up our internal security, we will also employ the utilisation of drones to ensure that we have an eye on the ground especially on the corridor that will be open," he said. He said they are working very hard to utilise thier internal capacity and they have a memorandum of understanding with police even though they work mostly in day shifts. PRASA Rail Chief Executive Officer Nosipho Damase said the issue of theft of copper wire has affected their work in corridors. She said they are running diesel trains because of vandalism.She said they will be running diesel trains until the security is right and will bring the cable down. "When you run diesel train you reduce the work of the security as the security will worry of watching the signals.Â "Our plan going forward is to integrate and fixing and clearing of the rail line," she said.
