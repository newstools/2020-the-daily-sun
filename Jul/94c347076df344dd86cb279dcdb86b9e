FRIDAY'S planned National Soccer League (NSL) Board of Governors (BoG) has been postponed until Monday, SunSport has learnt. The postponement could be due to the death of Irvin Khoza's wife, Mme Matina Elsie Khoza who passed on early on Thursday morning. The PSL was due to make a big announcement on Friday whether the Absa Premiership will continue on 1 August as proposed by mother body, Safa. There was no specific reason for the postponement in a statement sent to NSL BoG late on Thursday. "Kindly take note that the meeting of the Board of Governors has been postponed from Friday to take place on Monday..." the message to members read.  Wide speculation is that the PSL might nullify the Premiership and the GladAfrica Championship after Safa objected to their proposed 18 July restart day, with their intention being to complete the season on 31 August. This postponement could suggest that the PSL will either cancel or move the restart to a later date to afford the 32 clubs enough time to prepare and assemble in the Gauteng bio-bubble camp. Safa referees, who were part of the reason Safa objected to the PSL's proposed 18 July date as they were deemed not ready, are currently at south Joburg's Road Lodge Hotel after undergoing Covid-19 screening on Thursday. It is expected that the referees will be tested for Covid-19 on Friday afternoon, as they gear up for the big kick-off.
