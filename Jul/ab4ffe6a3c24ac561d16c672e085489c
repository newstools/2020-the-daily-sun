KAIZER Chiefs midfielder Kearyn Baccus has welcome the opportunity to call the Orlando Stadium home for the remainder of the season. The early days of Chiefs saw them play regularly at the venue and it was a happy hunting ground, but in more recent times it has been the sole venue for Pirates, which will no doubt be an eerie feeling for the AmaKhosi. A quirk of the Premier Soccer League’s draw to see which of the 16 Premiership teams would use which venues in their Gauteng bio-bubble when the league resumes on August 11 has seen Chiefs use a stadium adorned with Pirates significance, history and regalia. But Baccus says it can be a positive for the side, given the good infrastructure and lush pitch. “It’s a nice stadium and the pitch is very good,” Baccus told his club’s website. “I am happy with the outcome of the draw to play at Orlando Stadium.“Now it’s important that we all focus, be mentally strong and play as a team in those eight remaining fixtures.” Chiefs lead second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns by four points, but have played a game more.
