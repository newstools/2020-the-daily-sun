UNHAPPY business people in Durban said they want to know what processes the KZN Department of Education has been using to award tenders. They woke up in the early hours this morning and stood outside the department’s Pinetown district offices to enquire about tenders to deliver PPEs to schools around Durban. Apparently, they have protesting and demanding answers since last week. But until today they haven’t been given an explanation. Instead of giving them answers, the department sent soldiers to chase them away from the offices. One of the business people told Daily Sun they were concerned the department wasn’t following the correct procedures in awarding tenders. “They are giving the tenders to the same people who are also not doing a good job,” she said. Another one said this was unfair because there were many people who deserved to be given the tenders, but they were not. “We want the department to explain to us. Maybe we will understand,” he said. Department spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “There is no one who will speak to them. That someone will be flaunting the Public Finance Management Act in terms of procurement.” Mahlambi said there was an advert that called for anyone who wanted to bid for a tender to do so and more than 600 entities applied. He said due processes were followed and the awarding was done. “Everything was done above board. As business people, they know that if one has a dispute how that is handled,” said Mahlambi.
