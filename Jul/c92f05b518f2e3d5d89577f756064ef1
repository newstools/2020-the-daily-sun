Being creative seems to be our new survival skill and some people are excelling at it. A UK man created an ingenious way to use empty whisky bottles by creating a whisky bottle fountain. "I was saving the bottles to put candles in them. It was my partner's idea to make a water feature out of them. She did most of the design, to be fair. It was a pump from an old water feature that I adapted with LED lights. The smoke machine was bought years ago,‚Äù Dave told LAD Bible. At night, the fountain is boosted with some LED lights. All lit up!
