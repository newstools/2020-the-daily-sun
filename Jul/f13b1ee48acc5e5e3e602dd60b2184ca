THE raging fire not only destroyed the house, it also killed their loved ones. Gogo Agnes Mokone (68) and granddaughter Tshireleto Mokone (5) died when the house in Meadowlands, Soweto, caught fire at about midnight on Saturday. Tsholofelo Mokone (24) told Daily Sun they hadn’t had electricity all day, and when the lights came on it caused a fire that destroyed everything. Tsholofelo said gogo Agnes was sleeping in the room with Tshireleto and a 19-year-old relative. She said the older sister had woken up and tried to rouse gogo and the little one. “Tshireleto was already dead and gogo tried to crawl from the room, but she was too weak,” she said. She told Daily Sun two of her brothers caught in the fire managed to leave the burning house. “They were sleeping in the dining room and their feet caught fire, but at least they’re okay,” she said. She said five other family members were sleeping in back rooms. Gogo Agnes’ daughter, Dipuo Mokone (49), told Daily Sun her mother was a loving, respectful person. “She was a mother to many people in the community,” she said. “She was a wise woman. Many people would come to her for advice.” The family lost everything and needed help to rebuild their home. “We’d appreciate anything anyone can donate right now,” said Dipuo. “Starting over is going to be a huge mission for us.”
