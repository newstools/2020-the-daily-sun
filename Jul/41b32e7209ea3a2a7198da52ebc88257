SHE never thought her daughter would one day be a rape victim. And she definitely never thought she’d be raped by her grandfather. But the mum’s father was caught in her daughter’s bedroom. His trousers, as well as his granddaughter’s panties, were found on the floor. Now angry residents of Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, are baying for the 65-year-old madala’s blood. The mother said she made the gruesome discovery last Tuesday. She immediately called the police and the madala was arrested. “I’m heartbroken about what happened. What my dad did is evil and I won’t forgive him,” she said. She said her nine-year-old daughter’s life was turned upside down by the rape. “I can’t face anyone because I feel I have failed to protect my child,” the mum said. But the community accused her of trying to shield her dad. She claimed they wanted to burn their home. Angry community members said they wanted the man to rot in jail. They said the family refused to let them in when they went to confront the man. One of the community members, Matilda Mothoa, accused the family of wanting to sweep the incident under the carpet. “We won’t live with a rapist in our community. If his family is protecting him, we’ll chase them away,” said Mathilda. Another community member, Koketso Tau, said: “What if the man rapes our kids as well? Maybe he has already done it. What kind of a man rapes his own grandchild?” A case was opened and the suspect was taken into custody. His daughter confirmed to Daily Sun he was in custody. But at the time of going to print, cops hadn’t come back to the People’s Paper.
