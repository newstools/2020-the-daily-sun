 Twenty-nine-year old Regiment Maluleke from Agincourt outside Thulamahashe Mpumalanga will spend the rest of his life in jail. This is after he pleaded guilty to raping of an 82-year-old gogo in January 2017. In his plea, Maluleke told the court that on the day of the incident, he went to the gogo’s house in Newton Trust pretending to be looking for his girlfriend. Mpumalanga NPA spokesperson Monica Nyuswa said Maluleke found the gogo alone and raped her. In aggravation of sentence, the prosecutor, Matume Maake, told the court that Maluleke pleaded guilty not because he is remorseful, but because of the DNA evidence that is linking him to the offence. He added that Maluleke committed a serious offence, an offence that is prevalent in the country and the scourge of gender-based violence. He requested the state to impose a harsh sentence in order to protect elderly women, who are vulnerable from criminals that view them as easy targets. The victim impact statement showed that the victim suffered emotional stress and physical injuries was also handed in. Magistrate Elmarie Theron, found no substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment. The Director of Public Prosecutions adv. Matric Luphondo, welcomed the conviction and sentence in light of the current spate of gender-based violence cases in the country.
