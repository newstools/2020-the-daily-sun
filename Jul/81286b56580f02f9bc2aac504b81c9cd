VETERAN goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs has revealed that he is planning to return to Johannesburg, but he cannot pass up on the opportunity of coaching AmaZulu. The 40-year-old is currently serving as the third-choice goalkeeper and assistant coach to Ayanda Dlamini at the club. Early this week, he agreed to stay with the club until the end of the current campaign after his contract with Usuthu expired at the end of June. He is set to continue working under the club's caretaker coach Dlamini when the Absa Premiership campaign which resumes. “I’m grateful for this opportunity, I’ve worked with this squad for two seasons now and I understand how they think," he said. "As an experienced player, I can assist them in the aspects that we lacked in before, the motivational side of it, to help them believe that they are capable of achieving more. He added: “I’ll be honest, I have plans to return to Johannesburg and startup my own business at a later stage but for right now, this is an opportunity I cannot pass up on. "I am a person who loves challenges and it gets no better than trying to help save the team that is filled with so much potential.” The PSL season was suspended in March after the coronavirus outbreak. AmaZulu will be hoping to escape the dreaded relegation axe when the season resume in the new few weeks. The club is currently occupying the 15th spot on the table with 23 points after 24 matches. Josephs said players are eager to ensure the club retain its status in the top flight. “We are one group now, everyone buys into the plan that coach Dlamini has laid before us," Josephs was quoted by the club website."We are motivated to achieve more. The players want to be here and fight to stay up."
