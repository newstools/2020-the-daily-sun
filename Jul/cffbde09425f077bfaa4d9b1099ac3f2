THE taking over of
ambulance services from municipalities by the Gauteng government has brought
nothing but chaos. The Ekurhuleni
Municipality was the latest to have its ambulances taken on Wednesday. And Fanie Dladla (20) from
Gugulethu/Everest squatter camp had to spend more than two hours lying on the
side of the cold road waiting for an ambulance. This after he was knocked
down by a grey Mercedes- Benz on Grootvally Road near Payneville Primary School
in Springs, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday. The Sun Team drove to a
nearby fire station to try to get help, but found ambulances waiting to be
taken away by the provincial government. And frustrated paramedics
told Daily Sun there was nothing they could do to help. They said they feared
being attacked by residents who might think they were not willing to serve
them. Residents from Gugulethu/
Everest felt the provincial government was taking them for granted. “This was clearly a
political decision taken without consulting people on the ground. We are now
bearing the brunt,” said resident Sidney Ndlovu (51). Another resident Salphinah
Mahlangu (39) said: “We fear this kind of incompetence will result in many
people dying while waiting for ambulances.” Residents are angry,
saying ambulances have to be dispatched from Far East Hospital instead of the
nearby fire station. Daily Sun also visited the
Brakpan Fire Station and found 12 Ekurhuleni Municipality ambulances parked, with
paramedics doing nothing. The provincial government
decided to take over ambulance services from municipalities in September. The City of Joburg was
among the first to have their ambulances taken. Zweli Dlamini, spokesman
for Ekurhuleni city manager, confirmed Ekurhuleni would no longer be rendering
ambulance services as of 1 July. “This function was taken aback
by Gauteng Health. Ekurhuleni will only be doing fire and rescue services,” he
said. Should residents need an
ambulance, they can call 011 564 2211 or 011 564 2210.
