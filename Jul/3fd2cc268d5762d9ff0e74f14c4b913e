Dear MizzB My boyfriend’s friend has been making moves on me and I am enjoying the attention. I love my man, but his friend is interesting and funny. Would I be wrong to have a secret relationship with him? READ: WATCH: THE QUEEN CAST JAM TO JERUSALEMA! Dear Sistas Dating is defined by people differently. Trust is the foundation and the rock that keeps any relationship standing firmly. Dating your boyfriend’s friend or even any man while you are in a relationship is cheating. Keep in mind that the friend might tell your boyfriend should anything happen between you two. Before making any move, ask yourself if what you are doing with your boyfriend’s friend is all worth you losing your relationship over. All the best!
