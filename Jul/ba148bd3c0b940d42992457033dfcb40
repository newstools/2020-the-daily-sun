A GUN was seized after two cops noticed a group of kids, aged between six and nine, playing next to dumping site in Delmas, Mpumalanga on Wednesday. According to the police, the kids were spotted holding it as if it was a toy gun but when the cops got closer, they realised it was a real gun. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the cops became curious to know what the kids were playing with before they ran away. “Upon checking it, they realised that what they thought was a toy gun, was actually a real gun, a 6,35mm Beretta that was stolen from a housebreaking incident that took place last September in Bloemspruit, Free State,” said Hlathi. He said a boy (18) was killed near a cemetery in Barberton in Mpumalanga. “The victim was with a group of friends next to a cemetery, and one of them also had a firearm in his possession. The firearm allegedly went off and hit the victim in the upper body. Paramedics certified him dead on the scene. Investigations revealed that the suspect (18) was the one who allegedly pulled the trigger and was arrested. Police uncovered that the firearm was stolen from a police officer during a hijacking incident at Masoyi outside White River in January last year,” said Hlathi. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said: “I strongly urge the public to report those possessing firearms illegally to prevent unnecessary loss of lives.”
