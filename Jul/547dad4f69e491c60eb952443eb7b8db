Andrew Mlangeni never
saw the Economic Freedom Fighters as an enemy! These are the words of
the EFF Commander-in-Chief and President, Julius Malema. On Monday, Malema
visited Mlangeni's family in Soweto to offer his condolences. Speaking to the media
outside Mlangeni's home, Malema said Mlangeni was a very good leader and had a
strong passion for grooming young people. He said: "When we
formed the EFF, Ntate Mlangeni never isolated us or saw us as enemies because
he knew that he fought for multiparty democracy, and the multiparty democracy
means the existence of different political formations, therefore he didn't see
contestation of different parties as constituting enmity. He saw it as a
healthy contestation in a democratic society, " said Malema. Last week Mlangeni's
family reportedly called on the government to ensure that Mlangeni's burial is
handled in a transparent manner, without any acts of corruption. Malema said the family
did the right thing to caution the government. He said Mlangeni never
stole from government, adding that people rather steal during the funeral of
former President Jacob Zuma when he dies. He said: "The
funeral of stalwarts and high profiles in South Africa is now seen as
opportunities for self-enrichment. No one should steal in the name of Mlangeni
because Mlangeni himself never stole. He added: "If you
steal during Zuma's funeral there's no problem his own deeds will be following
him."
