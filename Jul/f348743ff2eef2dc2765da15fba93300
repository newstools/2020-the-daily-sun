THE ban on cigarettes sales during the Covid-19 lockdown has seen a spike in their illegal trade and smuggling, including those who must protect the law. More than 50 suspects have been bust in Limpopo since the beginning of lockdown, including a 41-year-old police sergeant for alleged possession of R350 000 worth of illegal cigarettes. The sergeant, stationed at the Beitbridge border post in Musina, arrested on Tuesday at 10pm along the N1 south of Polokwane. He was transporting the cigarettes at the time. Cops patrolling the area near Tweefontein stopped a blue Toyota Hilux bakkie driven by the suspect in police uniform. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo told Daily Sun the vehicle was thoroughly searched. “Twenty boxes of illicit cigarettes were discovered and confiscated.” Mojapelo said the cop was disarmed and bust on the spot and the vehicle seized. “The suspect is expected to appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon while investigations are continuing.” Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba praised brave cops who performed their duties without fear or favour of who they were dealing with. He said no one was above the law and those found guilty of criminal activities will face its full might “I urge all police members to maintain discipline and integrity at all times. They should also actively participate in rooting out any corrupt activities, wherever they are manifested, to make our province a better and safer place for all,” said Ledwaba.
