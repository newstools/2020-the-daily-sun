The South African Football Association (SAFA) has set the ball rolling on processes on return to training and play protocols. This after Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa sent a letter explaining all procedures on the return to football and play. The Association has started to put all the processes into motion by appointing Dr Thulani Ngwenya and Mlungisi Ncame as Compliance Officers to oversee the entire process. Mthethwa has requested that SAFA be the ones that oversee the whole process on the eagerly anticipated return to training and play. Part of the letter from the Ministry reads Dr Ngwenya and Mr Ncame as well as SAFA CEO Advocate Tebogo Motlanthe, will be meeting with the National Soccer League (NSL) to discuss the logistics and implementation of the compliance requirements as set out in the compliance protocol put together by the Joint Liaison Committee (JLC) and approved by the government. Meanwhile, SAFA will await the PSL meeting scheduled for Thursday, and for the Special Member’s input before rolling out the entire process. - Safa
