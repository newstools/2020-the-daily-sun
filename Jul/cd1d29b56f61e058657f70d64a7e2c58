PORTIA Mbangeni is desperately looking for her father. According to the 25-year-old from Mooiplaas in Tshwane, her dad Matthew Sithole from Siyandhani Village in Giyani, Limpopo, left when she was only two years old. She said nothing worked in her life as some things needed a father to resolve. “People see me happy when I walk in the streets, but my heart bleeds for my father and I feel so empty. “I need my father as things are not working for me,” she said. ‘I can’t fix anything without meeting him. I am suffering.” Portia said it hurts to live without a father because life was miserable. She said she also struggled to sleep as she thought about her father often. Portia told Daily Sun she had a boyfriend, but they were always fighting for no reason. She believes bad luck is following her everywhere and it’s caused by her father’s absence. Portia said she’s needs her dad to help her apply for an ID because her mum lives in Mozambique. “I was born in Giyani but I grew up in Mooi­plaas,” she said. The mum of one said even though she works as a domestic worker, she can’t hold onto her money. “I always think of my father. I want to meet my siblings in Giyani, but can’t recall anything about that area because I moved at a very young age.” Portia is pleading with anyone who knows her father to please tell him she’s looking for him.
