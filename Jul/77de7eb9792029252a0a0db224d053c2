Have you ever been told: "You cant have your cake and eat it?" In other words, once you act upon something, you cannot undo or reverse it. This quote draws similar lines between a crush and a lust. A crush by definition is a word used to describe special feelings you have for another person, a classmate, or friend that you really like. These feelings are often not acted upon as they can be nerve-wrecking depending on how he/she feels about you. With a lust, it is also a feeling but it differs because it involves sexual desires. So the two walk a parallel journey in terms of both speaking to feelings, but both have very different outcomes. The one allows you to have your cake, and the other forces you to also be able to eat. Crushes are normal, and according to human psychology. Every human being in their lifetime will experience a crush moment, and that is completely normal. However, things become a bit complex when you lust for someone. According to sexologists, lusts lead to masturbating and being accused for micro-cheating. https://www.dailysun.co.za/Sunday-Sun/when-micro-cheating-hurts-20200530     https://www.dailysun.co.za/LIfestyle/is-self-catering-during-lockdown-healthy-20200413 So the next time you crush on someone, that's you having your cake of fun. Then if you lust for someone, it's you mentally eating that cake. So never mistake the two.
