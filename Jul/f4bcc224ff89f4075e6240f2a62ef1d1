BONGANI Zungu has wasted little time getting back in the saddle with his French side Amiens SC. But it’s looking increasingly unlikely that he will be there for long as interest in his services from Scottish side Glasgow Rangers grows everyday. The Bafana Bafana midfielder returned to the city in northern France this week, having spent time in Mzansi. Despite reports suggesting he is close to a move to Steven Gerrard’s team, Zungu has refused to be drawn on his future. According to the Scottish newspaper the Scotsman, talks between Amiens and Rangers are at an advanced stage, and a deal could be struck for the 27-year-old midfielder. Gerrard is understood to have inquired about Zungu’s availability as early as April, having maintained interest in the former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder. With Amiens relegated to Ligue 2, Zungu has more reasons to move to a club which will afford him Europa League football. Rangers are not the only club eyeing Zungu. The midfielder has also attracted attention in Germany and other Ligue 1 teams. “Yes, I’m back in France and about to begin training with the team. I’m happy to be playing football again under these tough times... just the smell of the grass and the opportunity to run on the pitch,” said Zungu. “My manager is the one who can comment on your questions. I’m focused on training and getting back the right fitness levels.” Zungu spent well over a month with his family in Joburg, having travelled to Mzansi under strict lockdown regulations. He said: “It was important for me to be with family, especially after the outbreak of the coronavirus. It was really tough being unable to travel home in the middle of a world crisis. We just have to follow lockdown regulations put in place to curb the spread of the virus.” Zungu joined Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes four years ago, en route to Amiens where he made a name for himself with ever-improving performances.
