Dunked and swirled in molten gold, these chicken wing once drove the internet crazy. The gold metallic wings are sold in Yew York and are swirled in an iridescent, vividly yellow sauce that resembles molten gold. Jonathan Cheban is the brains behind this idea. Cheban is still trying to rebrand himself as a culinary influencer but remains best known as a friend of Kim Kardashian. Brian Mazza, the president of the company that owns the Ainsworth, explains in the video, which was shot in one of the restaurant’s Manhattan locations, that he knows Cheban from the world of night life, and was inspired to work with him: “I said, ‘Bro, let’s do a collab.’ ” The video was produced by Insider, the lifestyle arm of the media company Business Insider.
