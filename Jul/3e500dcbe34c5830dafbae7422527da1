THE bishop wanted his daughter to leave Mampintsha – but now he’s seen working with the man in a video! It is well-known that Babes Wodumo’s father, bishop Welcome Simelane, was unhappy that she stayed with Mampintsha. But now he is working with Mampintsha on a video of his song titled Elamonti, featuring Babes and Professor. Simelane accused Mampintsha of bewitching his daughter into falling in love with him after the video of assault went viral last year. Now the bishop is in the video shot in Lamontville, Durban, where he lives. But he told Daily Sun being part of the video had nothing to do with his relationship with Mampintsha. “I support my daughter and the decisions she makes about her life,” he said.  He said he has accepted that Mampintsha is part of Babes’ life. “I will always support Babes. Supporting her means I support her decisions and her music.  “She is a grown woman now. I can’t choose who must be part of her life. It is not my decision if Mampintsha is part of her life or not. My job is to support my daughter. That’s all.” Simelane made it clear last year that Mampintsha was not suitable for Babes, going as far as claiming he was the reason she would miss gigs.
