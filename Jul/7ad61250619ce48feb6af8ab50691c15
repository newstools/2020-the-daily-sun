THE cast and crew members of Mzansi Magic's telenovela, The Queen, has also jumped on the bandwagon and took part in the Jerusalema Challenge. The show's executive producer, Shona Ferguson, recently took to Instagram and shared a video of the crew and cast members having a wonderful time together. Ever since the Jerusalema Challenge took the world by storm and went viral across the globe, the hit song by Limpopo-born producer Master KG, which features Nomcebo Zikode, reached the 50 million mark on YouTube. This is a new high for the house maestro as he is one of only a few South African artists to claim this feat. This surge of interest in the song came after the release of its remixÂ featuring Burna Boy. Jerusalema has also secured a spot as the fourth most searched song on the app Shazam the world over, further cementing his huge international achievement.
