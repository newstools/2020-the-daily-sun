The long wait for Premier Soccer League (PSL) football is almost over. Clubs have finally started to return to training with Cape Town City the first to do so. The Citizens wasted little time securing their clearance to commence full training in compliance with Return to Training Directive.  They are officially one of the first PSL teams to be fully COVID compliant and have since got cracking with their training sessions. City met all the stringent protocols that have been set out by the league and were given permission to resume training. Other clubs are also working around the clock to meet the requirements. COVID CLEARANCE ?The club has received clearance to commence full training, in accordance with Return to Training Directive. Congrats to management who have worked around the clock to ensure we are one of the first PSL clubs to be fully COVID compliant.#iamCityFC#COVID19 pic.twitter.com/PfZ9qCBc0R
