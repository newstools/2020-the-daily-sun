I want to salute the government for seeing their mistake and banning the sale of alcohol again. When sales were banned the first time, we thought the government was unfair. We thought it would have been better for alcohol to be sold, with the restriction for people rather drink at home. But we did not believe it when parties started around the country so soon after sales were permitted. Boozers misbehave when drunk and that has caused a spike in Covid-19 infections. Whatever can be done to prevent the spread of the virus needs to be done – wholeheartedly so. Boozers must stop serving their selfish needs and focus on the invisible enemy which the nation is fighting against. If we don’t join hands in the fight against this virus, it will probably live with us for years to come. Surely that’s not what boozers want. - Letter by Abigail Ledubuko, Bochum
