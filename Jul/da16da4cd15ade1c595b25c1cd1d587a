Actor Cornet Mamabolo, who stars in the country's second most watched soapie Skeem Saam, has denied reports that he was nabbed for drunken driving. In a statement he said the reports were false and without merit and that he would never do something like that: "The reports are not true, they're false and aim to tarnish my name." ALSO READ | JOY ARRIVES FOR KEA AND OMEGA To jog your memory Sunday Sun reported that the actor last year in September was charged at the Sandringham Police Station for drunken driving. This was after he was pulled over by police while driving on the N3 North and Modderfontein roads and found to have been above the allowed legal boozing limit. A part of a police statement that was obtained by the SunTeam said: "The complainant alleges he was on duty for a drunken driving operation when he stopped a white BMW X4. "He explained to the driver for stopping him. After breathalising the driver, he was found to be 0,75, which is over the required limit of 0.24MG. "He was then arrested and taken to Sandringham Police Station where blood was drawn with blood kit AM1364597." Police Spokesperson Mavela Masondo confirmed the case to Sunday Sun. "The case number you provided relates to a case of drinking and driving. The case is temporarily withdrawn pending further investigation," he said.
