WHEN his two kids fell ill, Raymond Ubisi took them to
hospital. But little did Raymond know his whole family would
almost die on the way. He told Daily Sun while driving his Toyota Hilux in
March, a car belonging to Bull Security crashed into him on Solomon Mahlangu
drive in Tshwane. The 36-year-old from Plastic View said the crash
almost killed him, his seven-year-old daughter, two-year-old daughter, wife and
brother. He said the security company took his car, promising
to fix it, but was refusing to return it. Said Raymond: “I’m going through a lot. “My daughter isn’t well, and the security company is
refusing to give me my car.” He said his car was a source of income as he hired it
out. “They must bring back my car. I will fix it myself,”
he said. “I’m locked up in a shack not doing anything.” He said the company told him not to come near their
premises. “They told me to find a lawyer, but I don’t have money
for that,” he said. Raymond said he saved for 14 years to buy the bakkie. Bull Security reaction manager Johnson Brown said his
security company doesn’t repair cars. Brown admitted to the SunTeam that a towing company
took the car, but that Raymond should come to Bull Security for the
information. Cop spokesman captain Mavela Masondo said: “A case of
theft of a motor vehicle was opened.”
