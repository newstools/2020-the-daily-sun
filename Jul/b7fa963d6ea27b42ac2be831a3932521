BOXING Legends Union (BLU) founder Danny Myburgh believes his newly established organisation is a beacon of hope for the Mzansi boxing community. The former South African lightweight champion launched BLU in March before the Covid-19 outbreak. The organisation was formed to unite boxing people and support one another. More than 400 local boxing enthusiasts attended the launch including SA boxing legends. Myburgh believes his initiative will change the boxing landscape. According to the Pretoria-based former champion, the foundation was formed to help boxers in various ways. Among the objectives is to help boxers plan after their fighting days are over. “Our first step is to unite the boxing community through reunions. “There are other plans such as starting a retirement fund and funeral plans for boxers and also helping them with career development outside boxing. “After a boxing career is over, a fighter need to start a new life. Once they retire (from boxing) they can start a business or (start a new) career. “With the funeral plan, we want to give our legends a dignified send off. It always good to bury a loved one with dignity,” said Myburgh. However, all the plans has been put on hold due the lockdown. Once everything is back to normal they will start by registering the BLU as a non profitable organisation (NPO). The next stage after the coronavirus is contained is set up a meeting with Boxing SA and find sponsors. “During the launch the money that was raised has been used to assist the boxing family with food parcels during lockdown,” said Myburgh. “Everything is on hold for now. There are further goals in the business plan like assisting clubs with kit and transport. We have also helped boxers and families find employment.”
