READ: KING MONADA MOURNS CHILD Alina then got arrested. Earlier this year she spent the night in jail after Ponyo Isaacs (35) apparently opened a false assault case. It was dismissed in court the following day because of lack of evidence. “I was hurt and humiliated. Sleeping in jail and leaving my two kids was the most painful thing I had to go through,” she said. The 33-year-old from Makause in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, said the man begged for forgiveness, and they continued living together. But she discovered he’d sold their shack for R6 000 without telling her. “I don’t know where I’ll go with my two kids. He abuses me emotionally,” she said. “I want to buy the shack back from the person he sold it to, but I’m struggling to raise the money because I don’t work.” ALSO READ: WIFE SHOT AT FUNERAL!

But Ponyo denied being spiteful and said they fought like any other couple. He claimed he wasn’t abusive and wouldn’t say why he sold the shack.
