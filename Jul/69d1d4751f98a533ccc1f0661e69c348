HE was dragged out of his shack naked by law enforcement officials and claimed they stripped him of his dignity. Now he doesn’t know how he’s going to face his mum and siblings after a video of the incident was shared on social media. Bulelani Qolani (28), a Khayelitsha backyarder in Cape Town, said he was bathing when the officials stormed into his house. “I told them to wait outside so that I can dress up. They told me they are not here to negotiate with me and started dragging me. They beat me when I resisted,” he said. The father of four said what pained him was the trauma his children experienced. Bulelani is one of 49 Empolweni squatter camp backyarders who were allowed by the Western Cape High Court to live in the area.  The City of Cape Town was ordered not to remove them during lockdown. Axolile Notywala, secretary of the Social Justice Coalition, said they were shocked. “These people are not held accountable. “There’s no oversight structure to monitor the conduct of municipal police,” said Notywala. The City of Cape Town has since suspended officers involved in the incident. Executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman said: “The city takes these allegations very seriously. We will not condone violence of any nature by law enforcement staff.” He has asked for an investigation to be concluded without delay.
