In my opinion, booze is meant for relaxation. But it’s being made a shield lately for hiding pain, sorrow and hurt. When used that way, it’s called alcohol abuse and often has bad consequences. When you drink irresponsibly, you lose your sense of self. Many people have lost their jobs, families, belongings and other important things. I’d like to discourage this school of thought. Alcohol causes more harm than good, especially when taken excessively. It’s not meant to solve problems – it’s meant for fun. Rather face your problems head on rather than falling into a trap. Sober up or at least drink responsibly, knowing that you’re accountable for your own life and the lives of those close to you.
