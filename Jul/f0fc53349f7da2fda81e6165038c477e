DJ VUSINATOR wants to warn up-and-coming artists about the music industry. The Gigabyte producer said he learnt things the hard way and doesn’t want other artists to become victims. Speaking to Daily Sun, the musician, whose real name is Vuyisile Mathwasa, said: “Our song went platinum in November. “That makes people think we have money, but we don’t. The money we got wasn’t what we expected. “We didn’t benefit as owners of the song, but the song did great. This was a lesson for me, one I want to teach other artists about. “The reason I’ve been vocal about warning artists is because I feel it’s important to educate and warn them. I don’t want to mention or fight with any music companies. “But artists don’t need companies to get their music to radio stations and TV. They can submit songs themselves and still be successful musicians. “My goal is to teach artists they mustn’t measure success as being signed under a label.” He said artists must strive to be independent because the industry is full of sharks. He said this ordeal has not stopped him from working. “I’ve made peace with what happened. I’m working on new music. In fact, I am dropping a single titled Kwenzeka with Killer Kau, Jadenfunky and Jobe London today,” he said.
