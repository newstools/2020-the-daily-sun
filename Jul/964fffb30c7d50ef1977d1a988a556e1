AS they say, there is no place like home. These profound words are certainly ringing true for Rhulani Mokwena as he heads back home to Mamelodi Sundowns as assistant coach. Mokwena, the former Orlando Pirates and Chippa United coach, was confirmed as a Downs employee again on Wednesday. He will travel to Rustenburg to join the Brazilians in camp as soon as he has received the results for his Covid-19 test. “If everything goes according to plan, he will join the team by the end of this week,” said club in a statement. “Mokwena spent more than 3 years with Sundowns before embarking on a journey to coach some of the most competitive sides in the PSL. He also took the time to capacitate himself by travelling to Europe to study at the current EPL Champions, Liverpool.” Downs president Patrice Motsepe welcomed Mokwena back home. It’s expected Mokwena will add a “new dimension to our already accomplished technical team and will make a valuable contribution to Sundowns”. Mokwena served as Pitso Mosimane’s assistant coach for three years, where he enjoyed success as part of the Caf Champions League-winning team. He left the Brazilians to take up the position of assistant coach to Milutin Sredojevic at Pirates in 2017, and later became the interim head coach when the latter quit in a huff in August. Things didn’t quite work out for him in the hotseat ,and he was summarily relegated back to the assistant seat when Josef Zinnbauer took over. He became a misfit in the team, unable to work with Zinnbauer and it was surprising to see him joini Chippa on a six-month loan deal. Without football activity due to the Covid-19-enforced lockdown, Mokwena couldn’t quite prove himself. Disagreement over a long term deal led to his departure when the loan deal ended last month.
