ALL Thoko Sibuyi dreamt of was to extend her house, but electricity poles in her yard made it hard. Her story was published in Daily Sun in March under the headline: “Poles crush Thoko’s dream.”  At the time, the 57-year-old from Thulamahashe section C near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, told the People’s Paper Eskom workers installed poles in the area and supporting poles were placed in her yard, making it hard for her to extend her house. “A contractor from the power utility came in 2005 to connect electricity lines in the kasi, but the workers erected power lines with supporting poles in my yard.” But Thoko is now happy the poles in her yard will no longer stand in her way of achieving her dream. “I tried to address the matter for years with the relevant people, but my attempts were fruitless. But the headache is now gone and I have peace of mind, thanks to the People’s Paper,” she said.  Yesterday, Thoko couldn’t believe her eyes when the Eskom team arrived to remove the poles from the yard. “I am really excited and I couldn’t believe it when Eskom officials told me they were here to fix my challenge. It clearly shows our stories are heard through this paper and I am grateful for that,” said Thoko. Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said: “We are thankful and happy when our clients are happy and finally get the help they need.”
