THE national women’s cricket team is set to return to training today in preparation for the proposed tour of England in September. A 24 member squad assembled at the High Performance Centre (HPC) in Pretoria yesterday for a week-long skills-based training camp. The camp will include pre-season medical assessments. The players will then return to their respective provinces for individual training from 3 - 14 August before regrouping for a two-week camp from 16 – 27 August. This will be the first time the players will train together since March. During the camps, the squad will train and live on-site at the HPC in a bio-secure environment. This week players and support staff will undergo Covid-19 testing and will be required to test again before entering the second camp. CSA Director of Cricket Graeme Smith said: “We were very encouraged by the success of the health protocols in the lead-up to the 3TC Solidarity Cup and on the actual match day as well. Safety remains our priority at all times for players, support staff and all other people involved. “The projected tour of England will have a heavy emphasis on the 50-over format as we start preparing for the ICC Women’s World Cup which is still scheduled to be played in New Zealand early next year. “We have been through a frustrating period with our Proteas not able to build on the excellent form they showed at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup and next week’s camp represents an important new starting point.” CSA has confirmed that 34 Covid-19 tests were conducted on the players and support staff ahead of their first training camp, three people have tested positive. The squad and support staff will undergo a second round of testing in preparation for the second training camp, which gets underway from 16 - 27 August, ahead of the proposed tour of England in September.
