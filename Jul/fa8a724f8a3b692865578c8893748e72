FOR years, every day has been a struggle for survival. But the coronavirus lockdown has made life even tougher for squatter camp residents and many have lost all hope. NO MORE BOOZE! As Gauteng became the epicentre of the virus, the SunTeam spoke to residents of squatter camps around Soweto. They told Daily Sun they felt they had no chance against the virus as they lived on top of each other and shared toilets, making social distancing impossible. Many said they couldn’t afford masks or sanitisers. Madala Robert Motake (71) said he had been living in Waterworks squatter camp, near Glen Ridge, for more than a decade and although he had always dreamed of one day getting electricity, he was ready to die. “The only thing I have is a mask. We live under hard conditions. Our shacks are close to each other and there are little kids playing outside all the time,” he said. “I’m old and I have lived my life the best way possible. This virus keeps getting closer and closer and there is nothing else I can do to protect myself. Should I get infected, I’m ready to die.” Samuel Moagi (56), who shares a two-roomed shack with his wife and daughter, said if they died, they died. “We have more than 10 families sharing a tap. If any one of them gets infected, we will all get infected. “I hope they find a cure for the virus before it gets here,” said Samuel. Abraham Mncube (50) said life had become very difficult. “We struggle for food and now we have to fight the virus. “Sadly, many of us will die and there’s nothing we can do about it,” he said. Gogo Sana Springbok (61) said she was worried about her husband, who has diabetes. “I share a tap and a toilet with my neighbours. I plead with the government to supply us with sanitisers.”
