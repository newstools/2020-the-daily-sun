As part of the build-up to her birthday celebrations, Lerato Kganyago has followed in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and has started her own long walk to help the girl child in South Africa. The Metro FM presenter recently launched her own locally-produced sanitary pad brand called Flutter by LKG. It's a 100% black owned, female-run company established to provide sanitary solutions for underprivileged girls. Lerato’s birthday journey started in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, on Friday where 200 sanitary pads were donated to a non-profit organisation called Ubuhle be’Ntombi zeNgcuce. It's a life skills organisation that focuses on mentoring young Zulu maidens about women empowerment and the importance of education. The second leg of the journey took place on Mandela Day. Lerato joined forces with the Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina to distribute sanitary pads worth more than R120 000 in Daveyton. As part of their 67 minutes of community service for Mandela, Masina and Lerato started the day by distributing 67 food parcels and 3000 face masks in the Etwatwa area. An additional 12 000 more sanitary pads were also donated to NPOs in Tembisa and Katlehong yesterday.  Lerato’s birthday journey will conclude on Wednesday, with the last sanitary pad handover at a NPO in Jburg. Thousands of #FlutterbyLKG pads where distributed in Hamaanskraal, Ekhuruleni and KZN. Women’s sexual and reproductive health are not just women’s issues, they are societal issues. Flutter’s main objective is to uplift our society, one female at a time.
