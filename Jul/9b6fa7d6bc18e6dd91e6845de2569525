SINCE Friday six people, including five taxi drivers, have been killed while four others were seriously hurt in Philippi East and Nyanga, Cape Town. In the latest shootings in Nyanga on Monday, three people were gunned down. Speaking to Daily Sun, one of the taximen said they feared for their lives. “We don’t know the reason for this, but we are afraid because all these drivers were shot inside their taxis and we don’t know who is next,” said the driver. He said one of the incidents happened at about 5am, which left them worried as most of them woke up in the early hours of the morning to transport passengers. “We don’t know if they were being followed or what, but we are all afraid,” he said. Another taxi driver said the recent incidents were confusing. “We are still shocked and hoping the police will arrest whoever did this before many more people lose their lives. “We can’t carry on like this,” said the taxi driver. Brigadier Novela Potelwa confirmed the incidents. He said the cases were being investigated by the Organised Crime Taxi Investigation team. “Anyone with information on the incidents is urged to contact Lieutenant-Colonel Julian Tarentaal on 079 894 1379,” he said. Western Cape Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said he met the leadership of the taxi industry to resolve the ongoing taxi-related murders in the province. “It’s not yet clear what is behind the recent killings. However, the issues of operating licenses and route invasions have been identified as the main causes behind the taxi conflict,” said Madikizela. He said since January there have been 40 taxi-related murders and 20 cases of attempted murder, including cases in Paarl, Delft, Bloekombos, Ceres, Bellville, Masiphumelele and Nyanga. Madikizela condemned the murders. He called on the police to bring the culprits and their bosses to book as soon as possible.
