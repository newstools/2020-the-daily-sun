When my partner made a joke about Casper “Matome” Badenhorst’s bad situation, I couldn’t join in the fun. He said the mlungu, whose story was published in last week’s Daily Sun, was a fake. My partner said Matome had been rejected by his own people, even though white people had it all during apartheid. MLUNGU DUMPS SUBURBS FOR KASI It’s not right to look down on others, even if Matome was rejected by his family, walks barefoot and claims to be a security guard who can’t pay lobola. We are all humans who are different because of the colour of our skin. Many people who were rejected by their loved ones have committed suicide. But Matome chose to leave everything behind, even if it meant living in a shack. He is a strong and courageous man who deserves praise. In the same edition of the newspaper, Lehlohonolo Mamabolo was also looking for indoda. I don’t think she would even bother Matome for lobola, because both have been experiencing the same challenges. There’s a sad story behind the white man’s circumstances. We are all imperfect humans who should not be laughing at other people, because what goes around comes around. ) Letter by Fatima Julius, from Florida
