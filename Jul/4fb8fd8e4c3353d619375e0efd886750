As the ANC's treasurer general Paul Mashatile mourns yet another
tragic death in his family, he does so, going into self-isolation after a
staffer in his office tested positive for Covid-19. The ANC made the announcement on Monday, a day after announcing the death of
his wife Manzi Mashatile and a week after he laid his mother to rest. "This situation will allow
him to observe the 14-day quarantine period to enable him and family to monitor
his health and determine if he is safe as a prescribed practice and in
compliance with Covid-19 regulations," said the party's national
spokesperson Pule Mabe. On Sunday evening Mabe said the ANC was liaising with the family over funeral
arrangements. Mabe said Mashatile's
quarantining would run parallel with his mourning period, which would see him
bidding his wife farewell through virtual platforms. While he said the family and the
party had done their best to ensure Covid-19 regulations such as social
distancing, the wearing of masks and sanitising was adhered to during the lead
up to Mashatile's mother's funeral, family was urging the public to minimise
direct contact with its treasurer and his family. Mabe told News24 most of the 50 people who also attended
Mashatile senior's funeral had tested and were in the clear. "Even with that we are
encouraging people to practice the necessary precautions, if they see any
symptoms, they must self-quarantine and test," said Mabe.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/paul-mashatile-goes-into-self-quarantine-after-staffer-tests-positive-for-covid-19-20200706
