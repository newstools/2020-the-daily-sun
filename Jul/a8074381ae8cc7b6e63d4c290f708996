A YEAR ago this week, Lazalous Kambole joined Kaizer Chiefs amid much fanfare in the transfer market. Needless to say the Zambian international hasn’t quite lived up to expectations since his switch from Zesco United to Amakhosi, having yet to break his scoring drought. But perhaps the coronavirus-enforced break is what the 26-year-old needed, now sounding upbeat ahead of the Absa Premiership restart and looking to contribute to the success of the team. Amakhosi still lead the pack on 48 points – four ahead of closest title-rivals Mamelodi Sundowns with less than nine matches left in the league. If all goes well, they will be back on the pitch on Saturday as the PSL season resumes since it was suspended in mid-March due to the Covid-19 outbreak. “I’m putting in a lot of hard work, looking forward to resuming play again,” said Kambole. “It’s good to be back. We missed the football. I’d missed my teammates and so it’s good to be around them again. “As a team, we are on the right track and we are doing a lot to ensure that we will be ready when we play our first game. “The response from each player is good and we are working in the right direction and I’m certain we will continue from where we left off before the lockdown. “We are professionals and we know how to handle the challenges that lie ahead. Being the log leaders requires a lot of hard work from the team because the pressure is on us.” Kambole’s talent has never been in doubt, judging by his records in the last two seasons. But admittedly, he has battled to fulfil the philosophy of coach Ernst Middendorp, who has so far done well to steer the Soweto giants back on the path to recovery. He added: “It has been a season of adaptation for me. I have gotten used to the coach’s philosophy, the environment, the style of play, and have a better understanding of my teammates.”
