PORNOGRAPHY in today’s world has become too high to get over, too low to get under and too wide to get around. Not only is the industry lucrative, it’s easily accessible online and has an extremely wide footprint globally. According to recent stats by the world’s leading free porn site, Pornhub, more than 120 million people around the world have streamed porn daily. This since the start of the global lockdown period to curb the spread of COVID-19. An average user reportedly streamed about 5-gigabits of porn daily, which converts financially to roughly between R400 and R500. Pornhub also ran polls to find out who streamed their content. And the bulk of the people polled stated they watched the videos with their partners. So, has porn become a pleasure couples share? Sandton couple, Senazo Mbense (24) and Bonga Khoza (29), said watching porn together had spiced up their relationship. Explained the lovers: “Before lockdown, we invested in a special hard-drive disk to download and store all our porn movies. When the lockdown was implemented, we resorted to streaming as it was more convenient and fun. “This hobby, as we call it, has helped keep our relationship fun and exciting. It’s also provided us with tutorials to try out later on each other.” Thabo Sedibe (30) and Nomsa Buthelezi (25), a couple based in Dube, Soweto, have opened up about their love for porn. Insisted the pair: “My boyfriend would secretly watch porn on his laptop and phone, while trying to hide it from me. After confronting him, I took the liberty of exploring these videos and, I must admit, we’re hooked.” According to sex therapist and psychologist, Dr Janet Brito, porn is neither good nor bad for relationships. In her article published in the Mind Green magazine, she said porn could either be a huge stumbling block in one’s relationship or stimulate it.
