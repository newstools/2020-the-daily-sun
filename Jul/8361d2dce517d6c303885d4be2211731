CHRISTIANS should never be in a fight for leadership positions. "It just shows that there are many things that are happening in churches, by church people who don't understand what the Bible teaches." These are the words of ACDP leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe who described the hostage saga at International Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zuurbekom as unfortunate. Five people died and scores were injured in a shootout at IPHC on Saturday morning. HOLY WAR AT MODISE'S CHURCH! Meshoe said "Christian churches should never fight over leadership, because the bible says 'he who wants to be first must be last', a leader must be a servant and servants never fight for positions." "In the church, people who want to be leaders, must first be servants and if they do that, the need for fighting will not be there," he said. Meshoe said Christians who don't understand scriptures or apply scriptural principles are prone to make serious mistakes which is what happened at Zuurbekom. "If people said they don't want me to be a leader anymore, I will never fight because I understand scriptures." He said it is very saddening and unfortunate that lives were lost during the hostage saga. "We are very sad that lives have been lost. "We convey our condolences to those who lost their lives, and we are asking the police not to be soft with the gunners, those who took guns to a church compound, those people must be punished"
