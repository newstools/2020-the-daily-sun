PORTIA Baloyi and her family were left homeless after a fire devoured their three-roomed shack on Saturday. The 25-year-old from Block Mokone in Stinkwater, north of Tshwane, saidshe told her kids on her return from the shops to go watch TV. “They always watch TV, so they don’t disturb me while I’m cooking,” she said. “One of them started screaming that there was a fire in the shack. “It started at my bedroom door. We quickly had to escape outside.” Neighbours helped them fight the fire, but it was too late. “Everything was burnt to ashes, from clothes and furniture to important documents,” she said. “I thank God we were able to get out before the fire got too strong. “It would have been much worse if one of us had died.” Portia said she had no idea what could’ve caused the fire, and she suspected it was vutha. “There’s no electricity problem. It came out of nowhere,” she said. “I don’t know who sent this to us, but clearly someone did. “My boyfriend and I are loved by people, and we don’t have a problem with anyone. “It really shocks me that someone would do this to us.” Portia pleaded with SunReaders to help with donations. She said: “It’s cold and we don’t have a place to stay now. We need clothes and even blankets. “It would mean a lot if someone helped us with something. “My kids both go to school, and now their uniforms are burnt. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said vutha is sent by jealous people. “The family must consult a sangoma to protect themselves.  The person who sent the fire wanted to kill them.”
