WITH all that’s going on around the world, people will need to get back together once it passes. US singer Anthony Hamilton expresses this in his new single Back Together, featuring the late Rick James. Speaking to Daily Sun from the US, Anthony said the song was about getting back with loved ones. “With quarantine and all the stuff going on, you just want to get back to life and how you know it and being able to see friends and enjoy concerts, food and family without all of the mess, really getting back to loving ourselves and one another.” Back Together was released in May and has made waves on radio stations and the internet. Anthony recently launched his label My Music Box, in partnership with BMG, and Back Together marked the partnership’s first release. His book, Cornbread Fish & Collard Greens, shows his journey in music. “The book speaks about my journey, the good and the bad, and relationships that created songs like Charlene. “It speaks about such songs and how they came about and talks about the food I loved. “There are recipes in there that I’ve cooked and Bible scriptures that are important to me. The book is raw and honest.” Of the coming Women’s Month, he said: “I wish I could be there, show my love, hug them and tell them how precious they are. I love South Africa and South Africa loves me.” He spoke strongly against abuse. “I want to be part of whatever is happening and it’s happening a lot. “Women are afraid and I think men need to step up and protect women and girls.” He’s been at the forefront of Covid-19 relief efforts as part of BET’s Saving Our Selves and supported the MusiCares Covid-19 Relief Fund.
