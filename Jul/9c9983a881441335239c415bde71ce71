UKHOZI FM radio drama actor and Izwi Lomzansi community radio station programme manager Mfanafuthi (FK General) Khumalo has died. Mfanafuthi made his name by playing the character of the noisy Zikwe on the kid’s puppets IsiZulu drama show called Takalani Sesame on Ukhozi FM while he also played in many popular dramas. He died at RK Khan Hospital in Durban on Monday night after he was admitted after collapsing. Mfanafuthi (42) died as he was focusing more on his work as station programme manager of Izwi Lomzansi FM located at Durban station. His sister Thulisile Khumalo told Daily Sun that his brother died in the hands of doctors who were helping him. “He started to be in and out in hospitals long time ago seeking help but doctors always said they can’t find the disease that led him to collapse. He used to shake his one side of the body and his eyes turned to white,” she said. She said they even cried in the beginning of the year when they received that call coming from St Mary’s Hospital telling them that he was no more. “Later they phoned us and said it was a mistake, he was still alive. We passed that because KZN department of health also called us and apologise saying it was a mistake. We had hope that he will still have more many years after that incident but now he is really no more,” she said. Thulisile added that the family is still going have a meeting to make funeral arrangements. Mfanafuthi presented many radio shows before he became station programmes manager for Izwi Lomzansi FM.
