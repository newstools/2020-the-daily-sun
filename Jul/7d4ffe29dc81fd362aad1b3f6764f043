 French car manufacturer Renault announced that it will give an entire town free cars. The town of Appy in the southern isolated part France will all be cruising around in a free Renault Zoe and will receive free charging units as well. Renault says as a founding member and Global Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation since 2010, Groupe Renault affirms its commitment to the circular economy and positions itself at the cutting edge of this industrial movement. The Appy residents are expected to drive the Zoes for three years and they will share their impressions and experiences of the car. .@Groupe_Renault believes that the transition to #electric mobility is possible for everyone. We’re testing this theory over the next 3 years in Appy in Ariège, an isolated town in France that has become the 1st Electric Village with the New #RenaultZOE available to inhabitants! pic.twitter.com/I8DAvtmY8k  According to Renault, the scheme will likely inform and help understand the way customers interact with and use electric vehicles from day to day. “If the inhabitants of one of the country’s most isolated towns can adopt an electric way of life, it’ll prove that everyone can. That also means the myths around buying and running an electric car can be dispelled once and for all."
