POLOKWANE City defender Simphiwe Hlongwane is grateful to still be on the books of the Limpopo club, albeit on a short term deal. The 27-year-old from Mpumalanga is one of a number of players who were out of contract at the end of last month. Hlongwane, along with players such as captain Jabulani Maluleke, vice-captain George Chigova, Lehlohonolo Phali, Thabiso Semenya, Edgar Manaka and Bongile Booi were offered two-month contract extensions. The pair of midfielder Wiseman Maluleke and defender Sibusiso Mbonani, however, were not so fortunate as they were released. Hlongwane, who has played 20 matches in all competitions for Rise and Shine, is determined to keep impressing and prove his worth. He wants to repay the faith the club continue to show in him by helping them stave off the dreaded relegation axe hovering above them. Polokwane are currently third from bottom on the table with 23 points from 24 matches, level with AmaZulu just below them. “The position that we find ourselves in is not ideal,” Hlongwane said. “We have to do everything in our power to ensure that we save the team from relegation. Personally, I’m grateful that the club has trusted me to play a part in that. “I have confidence in our team that we can pull it off. We have done it on numerous occasions, we can do it again this season.”
