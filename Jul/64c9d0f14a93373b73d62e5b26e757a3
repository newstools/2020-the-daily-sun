THE Khumalo family needs help to bury their loved one. Bongani Khumalo (30) died on 1 July after a long illness. He hasn’t been buried because his family has financial challenges. Bongani’s mum, Sophie (66) from Snake Park in Soweto, saidher son’s body is in a mortuary. She pleaded with SunReaders to help her. Sophie said someone offered to loan her R5 000 to bury her son, but she was scared to accept the money as she was unemployed. “I don’t have money, but I don’t want my child to be buried by the government while I’m still alive. I can’t send him to his resting place without dignity,” said Sophie. She described her son as a respectful man who was loved by many people. “He was friends with everyone and you’d never find him in a bad mood,” she said. Sophie said that Bongani left a two-year-old baby girl. She said any kind of donations were welcome. Bongani’s cousin, Nomsa Ngobeni (28), said she wished to help her aunt with the burial, but didn’t have money. “All I can offer her is emotional support. I hope people can come through for us,” said Nomsa.
