ZINDZI
Mandela will be laid to rest tomorrow next to her mum, Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela who was buried in Fourways two years ago. The
funeral is expected to take place at 7 am in the morning. As
funerals have been affected by the covid-19 regulations, the Mandela family
said they are going to follow the laws. "We
are going to conform to the laws and regulations, we'll just focus on giving
her a respectable send off without trying to make COVID-19 related case,"
Zindzi's son Zondwa Mandela told SABC yesterday. In
the same interview, Zondwa confirmed that his mum tested positive for COVID-19,
however it has not been ruled as the course of death as the family awaits
autopsy results. "There
were other tests that were conducted, and my mother did test positive for COVID-19." He
said that however doesn't mean she died from COVID-19 as she only tested
positive for the disease. He
said more tests will help the family find out what could have been the cause of
her untimely death.
