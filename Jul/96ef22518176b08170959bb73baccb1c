HIGHLANDS Park director Brad Kaftel has welcomed news that PSL fixtures will stay the same as when brakes were hit on football in March. Kaftel is also happy that they will save costs since they’re based in Gauteng, the same province where the bio-safe environment (BSE) will be headquartered for the remainder of PSL matches. Gauteng was chosen as the BSE because the province has the most suitable resources and facilities. Kaftel said they were due to play three away fixtures – travel to Durban, Polokwane and Eastern Cape, and the rest at home. According to the original fixture list, Highlands were due to visit AmaZulu at King Zwelithini Stadium, Polokwane City at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium and Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium. The Tembisa-based team’s home games are against Cape Town City, Maritzburg United and Mamelodi Sundowns. But as all fixtures will now be played on their doorstep, it means they won’t be paying flight fees and accommodation in those provinces. Kaftel said things have been made easy for them and that money saved will go to pay for the bio-bubble. Each club will foot their own BSE bill, which could cost just over R3 million. More encouraging news for them is that their sponsors, Jonnson Workwear, will resume paying the club, once games restart behind closed doors. The sponsor had stopped paying the club their monthly financial agreement after they lost visibility since games were indefinitely stopped in March. When the season was suspended, Highlands were lying eighth on the table on 31 points from 24 matches.
