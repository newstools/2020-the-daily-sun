FOR the past three weeks, 61 homes have had no electricity. Residents of zone 9 in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the problem started when a transformer caught fire after Eskom technicians bridged it. Affected resident Matome Masetla (56) said they had been trying to contact the power utility with no success. “When we call them, they don’t answer and when we do get hold of them, they say they can’t come. Our lives have been put on hold. “I have two children at school, so we have to buy wood to make fire or use gas, which is very expensive. It doesn’t even last four days. Moshe Matang (45) said he had been forced to buy takeaways every day. “I can’t afford it anymore. I have a big family. My family has to bath with hot water to prevent them from getting flu. I have to buy gas to boil water and as I’m self-employed, it’s difficult to work with the current coronavirus lockdown regulations,” he said. Moses Mpye (52) said they needed help to solve the problem. “Eskom is dragging its feet. “It’s been a while and now that the temperature is going down, we can’t sit in the cold without electricity,” he said. Eskom Gauteng spokeswoman Reneiloe Semenya said they could not replace or repair equipment that failed repeatedly as a result of illegal activities. “We have a process that has to be followed now. In the past, we used to just repair and replace, but it’s becoming financially unaffordable to keep on replacing equipment without dealing with the root causes,” she said.
