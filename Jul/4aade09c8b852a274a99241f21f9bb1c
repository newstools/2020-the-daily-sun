PONANI Shikweni is making a difference one stitch at a time. She started her sewing company Hluvuko Designs in Alexandra, east of Joburg, to empower women in her kasi. And the 32-year-old self-taught tailor has trained more than 30 women to become entrepreneurs through sewing. Ponani told Daily Sun she never knew she’d make a difference in her kasi when she started needlework. “Having no income and a job can lead to desperation and dangerous actions. “When we offer young women job opportunities, we are also helping youngsters to stay away from drugs and crime,” she said. “These young women were unemployed and had very few opportunities until I recruited them to join our co-operative. Today they earn a living through sewing.” She said her life changed in 2015 when Netcare recognised her work. “With the Covid-19 outbreak, Netcare asked us to make 10 000 cloth face masks for their staff, and we got another big order for 20 000 masks from the Youth Employment Service initiative and Exemplar,” she said. “I feared for my workers when lockdown started because I thought my business would be forced to close and the workers would starve.” Just like other small businesses, Ponani said government was not doing enough to help them. “We are on our own. We don’t know where our next meal will come from if there’s no work,” she said. “If you’re an entrepreneur and are still trying to get things together, don’t give up. Use your business to uplift people in your community.”
