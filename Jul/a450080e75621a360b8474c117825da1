The last thing a person wants to see in their Kasi is a
leopard roaming around. But this is what the residents of Klipgat in the North
West got to see in their Kasi this afternoon. The residents were left, scared, thrilled and shocked
when they spotted the leopard in their area. Residents took several videos of the leopard while trying
to maintain their distance for safety.  "There’s a leopard in my yard” pic.twitter.com/SmhA2Mi1P8   One of the witnesses said it was weird to see such a wild
animal in their area, where there is no bush around. She said this was not the first wild animal to come pay
them a visit. "Two weeks ago, we saw a monkey and it was also
taken away, today it's a leopard I wonder what will come next," she said. She said the leopard was first spotted in a yard hiding
under an old parked car. She added that after the community spotted it, some of
the brave residents locked the gate to prevent it from escaping as it could end
up hurting someone. North West Police spokeswoman, Maria Nkabinde, said they
were called by residents about a stranded leopard in their area. She said there was nothing out of the ordinary about the
leopard and no one was harmed by it. "When police got there, they called the Nature
Conservation department since they are the right people who will be able to get
the leopard out of the area safely," she said.
