Possibility of load shedding has increased, Eskom has warned. On Friday, the power utility said it may be forced to implement load shedding between 4 pm to 10 pm. It said the power system is severely constrained. “Five generation units were taken off the grid, significantly raising the possible need for load shedding. “Should the need arise, load shedding could be implemented in order to protect the integrity of the system,” said Eskom in a statement. It is understood that two units at the Amot power station, as well as a unit at Kendal, Tutuka, and Majuba, were taken off the grid. Eskom said these removed more than 2 600MW of capacity from the system. “The delayed return to service of a generation unit at the Duvha power station has also added significant pressure to the generation system,” said Eskom. Residents are urged to reduce electricity usage peak hours to help avoid more power cuts. Earlier on Friday morning, Eskom implemented load reduction in most parts of Soweto and Ivory Park. Areas affected included, Braam Fischer, Dobsonville, Meadowlands as well as Glen Ridge. In Ivory Park, residents of Tswelopele, as well as Kaalfontein, were among those affected.
