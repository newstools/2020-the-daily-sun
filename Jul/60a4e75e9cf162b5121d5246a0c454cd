MPUMALANGA police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma, said killing of cops was an attack on law enforcement agencies in the country and perpetrators must face the music. This after a police warrant officer was killed yesterday at Lynville, near Emalahleni, during a robbery. His 53-year-old colleague was taken to hospital after sustaining gunshot injuries to his right hand. Zuma has since called on residents to assist police with the investigation and sent his deepest to the deceased’s family and wished the injured colleague a speedy recovery. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a group of six suspects stormed into a petrol station, where they tried to rob workers of their belongings before allegedly placing explosives on the counter and threatening to set them off, should the staff try to alert police. “But their plans were interrupted by municipal law officers, who went to the filling station not knowing a robbery was in progress, and their crossfire led to the officer being fatally wounded. Medical services certified him dead on the scene.” A murder case has been opened and police had launched an intensive manhunt for the suspects. “We urge anyone with information to call Colonel One Thobejane on 082 372 2195, or call CrimeStop on 08600 1011,” said Hlathi.
