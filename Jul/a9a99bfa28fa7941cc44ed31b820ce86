RESIDENT are still in
disbelief after witnessing a tragic shooting incident. This is after the
residents from Inanda north of Durban witnessed a fully loaded quantum taxi
being fired with several bullets at close range on Saturday. It is alleged that
while the taxi that was loaded with passengers and driving along Inanda, a
white van drove towards it and gunmen inside the van who were carrying rifles
opened fire, fatally wounding one woman while eight other passengers sustained
injuries. The resident who were
watching from a distance managed to record a video of the tragic incident. In the video, taken by
the residents a white van can be seen firing several shots at the quantum,
passengers who didn't get shot can also be seen getting out of the quantum and
running away. The white van can be seen driving away while the gunmen are
holding the gun. It is still unclear
why the shooting took place. A resident who asked
not to be named told Daily Sun that the quantum was heading to Mzinyathi. "It was so
frightening to see people being shot like that. I suspect that the gunmen were
aiming at the driver because they were shooting from his side. It’s so sad that
other people ended up being shot," said the resident. Another resident said
this was the first time seeing such a tragedy. "It will take some
time for me to get over what I saw," said the resident. The KZN cop’s
spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a taxi with passengers was
shot with rifles by unknown men in a bakkie on the M25 highway at Mshayazafe. "A 51-year-old
woman was fatally shot, and eight passengers sustained gunshot wounds. They
were taken to hospital for medical attention," said Mbele. She said a case of
murder and attempted murder was opened at Inanda police station.
