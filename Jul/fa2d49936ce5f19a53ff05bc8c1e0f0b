IPID is investigating the death of a policeman as a result of police action. IPID spokeswoman Ndileka Cola told Daily Sun that this incident occurred in Daveyton. Cola said it's alleged that five members of the police were on duty for Vispol, driving in a state vehicle. "They were at the Daveyton Client Service Centre when they received a call to provide back up," said Cola. She said the five members proceeded to Sia Street. Upon their arrival, they were informed by their colleagues that the suspects had run away. She further stated that the five officials who were called for back up left their colleagues to patrol in the area. "As they were patrolling, they noticed the four suspects and approached them," said Cola. "The four allegedly ran in pairs in two different directions. The police van chased one pair. The police officer who was sitting in the back behind the passenger seat took out a firearm and opened the door, preparing to jump out and chase the suspects as soon as the vehicle stopped," said Cola. Things didn't go as planned. Cola told Daily Sun that the driver turned in the direction where the suspects had gone. "The firearm of the officer in the back seat went off and shot their 27-year-old colleague who sitting in the front passenger seat," she said. The police officer was taken to Glenwood Hospital where he succumbed to his injury.
