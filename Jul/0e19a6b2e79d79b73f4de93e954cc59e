HE WAS fast asleep when he was woken up by a knock on the door on Monday night. The people on the other side of the door produced a R100 note and demanded change as he sells kotas. But the 29-year-old didn’t have change and the suspects shot him in the thigh and fled. The man asked for help from other tenants in the yard and was rushed to hospital. He’s now recovering at home in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. The man said he’s now living in fear as he didn’t know the people who came to his shack. “It was at night and it happened so fast. “I don’t know them and it’s clearly people who know me because they know I sell kotas,” he said. The man said he has never been attacked or robbed. He said he was shot on his right thigh. “I thought they were going to kill me and I begged them not to,” he said. The man said the suspects ran away afterwards. Residents said they were disturbed by the high crime rate in the area. Jones Molete (50) said the thugs targeted businesses and vendors. “We don’t know who is going to help us.  We’re trying to make money to buy bread for our kids and tsotsis just come to take what we worked for. “The people who attacked this man came to rob him. “How can you want change when everyone is sleeping,” he said. A case of attempted murder was opened at Tsakane Police Station. Cops said the suspects were unknown and they were looking for them.
