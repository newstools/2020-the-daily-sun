A DISTRAUGHT mum wants her son’s remains so she can bury him to get closure. Rose Mametjie (54) from Marite Trust in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said her son Given Shabangu (35) died as a result of burn injuries. After he was killed, his body was found dumped in the veld. She said her son’s body was burnt beyond recognition and DNA results were taking too long. She said she felt the police were dragging the case even though a suspect was arrested in connection with the murder. “We were happy when the police told us they arrested a suspect who led them to the scene where my son’s burnt body was dumped. We believe it was Given as the clothes matched his,” she said. Rose said she tried to contact the police, but she was told the process was slow due to the lockdown. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said investigations continued in the case after they made a breakthrough in February when two suspects were found in possession of the victim’s vehicle. Hlathi said the victim was reported missing in January and the suspects confessed to hijacking, murdering, and dumping the decomposed body in an open veld. “The suspects Polosho Molimi (17) and Bongani Ndlovu (25) are being charged with murder, kidnapping, hijacking, and defeating the ends of justice. “They were previously denied bail by the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court and are expected to appear again on 3 August. The case was postponed due to the pending forensic results,” said Hlathi.
