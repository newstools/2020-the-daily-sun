About 2.5 million pupils returned to their classrooms on Monday following months of staying at home due to the corona pandemic. The Grade R in some provinces, grade 6 and 11 joined the grade 7 and 12 pupils who have already returned to class. But their back to school was not as smooth sailing, with some minor hiccups along the way. Pupils at Ekangala Comprehensive High School in the east of Tshwane were turned back home, after it was alleged that seven of their teachers were COVID-19 positive. The pupils said they were told that they will be sent SMSes on when they should go back to school. Gauteng department of Education spokesman, Steve Mabona said he cannot confirm or comment on the closure of the school. He said update on schools with COVID-19 cases will only be released on Thursday or Friday.
