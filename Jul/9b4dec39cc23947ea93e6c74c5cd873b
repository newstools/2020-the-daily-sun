SOUTH AFRICAN bantamweight champion Ronald “The King” Malindi has advised fellow athletes to learn other skills. The 25-year-old boxing sensation has learnt the hard way during this coronavirus outbreak. Malindi used to juggle two jobs, working as a taxi driver and a professional boxer. Early last year, he quit his taxi job to focus on his boxing career. But after COVID-19, the talented fighter returned to his taxi driving job to keep the wolf from the door. “Sport stars should learn other skills to have something to fall back on when their careers aren’t doing well. “Since the coronavirus outbreak, life has been difficult for athletes, especially those who don’t have sponsorships. “This situation has taught me a lesson, that as sportsmen we need to have other skills. “I returned to the taxi industry because all sporting activities had been halted. “I had no choice but to go back to the taxi rank as I had previously depended on fights for income,” he said. According to the unbeaten former amateur star, when he quit his job he wanted to give his boxing career attention, in order to prove himself locally and then take on international opponents. “I’ve achieved my short-term goal, which was to prove myself on local opponents. “Now, I’m ready for the next level. Hopefully, once the COVID-19 storm is over, I’ll get an opportunity to compete internationally,” he said. Malindi, who has successfully defended his SA crown four times, said he would continue balancing his taxi driving job and boxing career. “Out of this COVID-19 I’ve learnt valuable lessons, instead of quitting my job I’d buy a taxi so that it can work for me,” said Malindi. The Limpopo born pugilist has stamped his authority against the local opponents when he outpointed former two-times world champion Lwandile Sityatha in March.
