SAFA President Dr Danny Jordaan has joined millions of South Africans in mourning struggle hero and last remaining Rivonia Trialist, Andrew Mekete Mlangeni. Mlangeni, who turned 95 on 6 June 2020, was admitted to 1 Military Hospital in Thaba Tshwane, Pretoria, on Tuesday, 14 July, 2020, following an abdominal complaint. Dr Jordaan said Mr Mlangeni’s sacrifices to the new South Africa are well documented and his anti-apartheid stance made him a global icon. “We celebrated Bab’ Mlangeni’s 95th birthday’s last month and little did we know that this will be his last but he has run his race and we are grateful of the legacy he left behind. May his soul RIP,” said SAFA President. Dr Jordaan said ‘Bab’ Mlangeni remained steadfast to his leadership ethics and was a caring cadre of the liberation movement. “My thoughts and the football family’s thoughts are with the Mlangeni family. Here is a selfless man who dedicated his entire life to an equal and free society,” added Dr Jordaan. SOURCE: Safa
