MAMELODI Sundowns have set up their training camp in North West, at the Royal Marang Sports Complex in anticipation of Premier Soccer League football resumption. The club announced on their website on Tuesday that they had first training session after more than 100 days since the Absa Premiership was suspended. "Sundowns had complied with all the stringent COVID-19 Return to Play Protocols and had submitted the same to the PSL before the club was given the green light to commence training," the club said on the website. "Having to move the team away from the epicentre of the coronavirus was critical for the Brazilians and the North West province was an easy decision, with Mosimane and his technical team being no strangers to Rustenburg having hosted several pre-season training camps here in the past." North West is one of the provinces that have been considered to host the remaining PSL and GladAfrica Championship matches, with Royal Mareng Hotel and Sun City touted as possible venues to offer accommodation for the clubs. Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Olympia Stadium and Moruleng Stadium are the grounds said to have all the required facilities to host the remaining fixtures of the two divisions. The Brazilians close their laptops on the Zoom training sessions and lace up their boots for group training sessions again!?? https://t.co/vbx9DDzVVm#Sundowns pic.twitter.com/9797jM6Q0B
