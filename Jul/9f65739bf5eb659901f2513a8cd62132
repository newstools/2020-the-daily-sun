RAPPER Emtee has ventured into the clothing and sneaker business. The artist, whose real name is Mthembeni Ndevu, will be launching his brand, Emtee, soon. He told Daily Sun the idea for the sneakers came after he was approached by a guy called Spelete. “Spelete owns a clothing shop. He makes his clothes from scratch,” he said. “He approached me and asked that we do a collaboration. We met, spoke and came up with ideas. We have samples now.” Emtee said he didn’t know when the sneakers would be launched. “The only thing I need right now is money, which I don’t have. “Everybody knows why I don’t have it,” he said. “I don’t know when we will officially launch the sneakers and make them available. “We’re currently looking for sponsors or anyone who would want to buy in bulk and sell the sneakers themselves.” He said he wanted to expand into the clothing business because he learnt some hard lessons in the music industry. “I will add tracksuits, hoodies and caps to the sneakers.” In the meantime, he said he was working on music, but that was also going slowly.
