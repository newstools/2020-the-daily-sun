Eastern Cape-born singer Zahara bared her soul last night during an interview with Somizi Mhlongo-Motaung on his show Dinner At Somizi's, where she was a guest. She addressed a number of issues, including her highly publicised alcohol  problems. "The problem wasn't the drinking, it was what was making me drink. In 2014/15, I used to cry myself to sleep because of what was happening in my life at the time," she said.
