NEZISWA Mbovane (31) from Mfuleni in Cape Town is grateful to God for blessing her with triplets. But she’s struggling to take care of her bundles of joy. “When doctors told me I was carrying triplets, I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was just a mistake,” said Neziswa. Her babies are seven months old. “My husband is trying everything he can to provide for us, but lockdown has made things. The piece jobs he normally did dried up,” she said. Her triplets’ names are Iyazi, the boy, as well as daughters Izibele and Emile. “I know people will ask about the kids’ grant money. Yes, I’m getting R2 700. “I use R800 for rent. I use the rest to buy baby formula and groceries.” Neziswa said she’d love if people could help her with anything they could offer. “I’ll take anything, from clothes to baby formula and groceries. Sometimes I struggle to feed them from my breasts because of not having food.” Before having the triplets, she already had two kids. “I don’t want kids anymore. Before I knew I was having triplets I told myself I’m pregnant with my last child. I never expected to get triplets,” she said. She told Daily Sun that just after she gave birth, she wanted to leave one baby in the hospital. “I was stressed and panicked. I asked the nurses if I could leave one, but she told me the two I was taking home would give me problems if I left one behind.” She said she’d be happy with anything SunReaders could donate to her. “My kids’ formula is Lactogen. I know that God gave me the triplets for a purpose, but I’m not coping. I’m struggling. Please help me.”
