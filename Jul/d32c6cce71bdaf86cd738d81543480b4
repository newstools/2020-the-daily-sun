POLOKWANE City head coach Clinton Larsen has made it clear to Rise and Shine management that he wants former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Kabelo Mahlasela to remain with the club beyond this season. But for that to happen, the 29-year-old player will have to agree to a new contract with the Limpopo-based side. Mahlasela joined City on loan from Amakhosi during the January transfer window period. And the Soweto giants have already alerted the Sebokengborn star that he should look for a new club as his services are no longer required at Naturena. “I rate Mahlasela highly and he is one of the players we would love to continue to work with,” said Larsen. “He (Mahlasela) has impressed me every time I gave him a chance to play. I think he is one of the best midfielders in the PSL and people will see that when the league restarts.” Added the former Bloemfontein Celtic and AmaZulu coach: “But for him to stay it will depend on his negotiations with management as I don’t get involved in that. But I want him to stay with us.” Mahlasela joined Chiefs in 2018 but struggled for game time under Ernst Middendorp in the past two seasons. At City, he has become a key player for Larsen. “Mahlasela is one of the players we are expecting to help us move away from the relegation zone,” said Larsen. “I hope he can continue with the good form he has been in before the league was halted by coronavirus.” Since he joined City, Mahlasela has played six matches before the league was suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
