PHUMZILE Maseko is tackling Covid-19 with online make-up tutorials to train poor make-up artists. The founder of Melanin Zone from Ermelo in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she wanted to help protect people from the virus. “I became aware there is a skills gap in the industry. “I want to give artists from disadvantaged backgrounds who have an interest in the make-up profession an opportunity to develop their technical and client skills and identify their goals,” she said.  Phumzile, who is also known as Phumie PE, said she will focus on smashing the misinterpretation of beauty in the media, which is holding women back from reaching their full potential in all areas of their lives. “My versatile approach to make-up grants me the capability to work in different environments or fields, using my creative skills and my soothing touch,” she said. Phumie PE said she has worked at many events, which include last year’s Samas and recently did make-up for singer and TV personality Mmatema Moremi, SABC presenter and producer Nombuso Mahlangu and TV personality and actor Princess Nyaleng Thibedi. “I’ve grown to become a professional name to be reckoned with,” Phumie PE said.
