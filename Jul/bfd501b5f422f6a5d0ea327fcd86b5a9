Actor and rapper Kope “Tswyza” Makgae has started a show on YouTube. The show, The Tswyza Show, is shot in a garage. Speaking to SunBuzz, the 34-year-old said: “I’ve always wanted to present a show for a bigger platform like Trevor Noah’s The Daily Show. “But I believe it’s also important to create your own opportunities.” He said it felt good to create something on his own. “It’s a one-man produced show, meaning I had to learn how to shoot, edit, use green screen, sound, lighting and even makeup. “It feels good to create something with your own hands and know you’re capable of doing anything, as opposed to being at the mercy of industry leaders.” Kope said with this platform he wanted to create a space where he could collaborate with brands and other less famous artists to propel their ambitions. The Limpopo-born actor said he’ll invite industry colleagues to his show. “I don’t want to do what everybody is doing with content and topics. “There’s life beyond Covid-19, so I want to keep it normal and discuss issues that will still exist post Covid-19.” The Generations: The Legacy actor said it’s important to create balance. “The show doesn’t affect any of my work with Generations,” he said. “The thing we avoid about time is that it’s what you make of it. “It’s important to prioritise and know how to balance your time, work and passion with everyday life. “This will help you achieve more and chase your dreams without sacrificing other aspects of you.” The Tswyza Show is available weekly on YouTube.
