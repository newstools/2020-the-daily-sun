THE bail application for the five men accused of mutilating a 13-year-old boy’s leg for muthi has been postponed to Friday. They appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court in Thulamahashe today. Prosecutor Kedibone Bareng asked for the postponement, saying the investigating officer was sick and under quarantine. But the accused’s lawyer, Eric Mashele from the Legal Aid Board, argued his clients’ rights were being violated after they were kept in custody for more than six months. “My clients have spent over six months in jail without bail. This matter was remanded for bail application arrangements and DNA tests results, which today are still outstanding and have not been brought before this court,” said Mashele. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba had the matter remanded to Friday for a formal bail application and for DNA tests results.
