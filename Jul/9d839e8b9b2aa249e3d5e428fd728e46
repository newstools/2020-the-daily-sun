Your budget is an important financial tool that helps you
manage your spending, debt and savings every month. How to draw up a budget Use the envelope method to stay on track Stick to your budget by using the envelope method. Put the monthly budgeted
amount for each expense in an envelope. When it is spent wait for the next
month before spending any more. For example, if you budget R1000 for food every
month, put this amount in an envelope and when it is spent, wait for the next
month before you spend any more money on groceries.
