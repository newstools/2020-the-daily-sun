BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic, in need of some reprieve after recurring off-field issues lately, have received a major boost after full-back Ronald Pfumbidzai made steady progress in his long injury layoff. The extended coronavirus lockdown has come as a blessing in disguise for the Zimbabwean star, who was initially thought to be out of the rest of the season. Now, with indications that the league will resume at a later stage, the 25-year-old seems likely to feature. He has started light training back in Harare. “I am coming alright,” said Pfumbudzai regarding his progress. The soft-spoken defender said despite recuperating in his home country, he was fully aware of the uncertainty characterising the club of late but could not delve much into the issue. Lehlohonolo Seema, the Celtic coach, confirmed the positive developments around his player. Pfumbidzai had been one of the most consistent performers since joining the Free State side in 2017 after a spell with Danish Superliga side, Holbro. He was on loan from CAPS United, the former Zimbabwe champions. Before his recovery, the player was enjoying another consistent spell, having played 12 matches, including 11 in the Absa Premiership and another in the Telkom Knockout. He weighed in with a goal, albeit in a 3-1 loss to Orlando Pirates in August last year. Pfumbidzai has also provided an assist. The versatile defender played his last four matches at centre-back. The Zimbabwean’s last match was in December when he featured in the 5-3 thriller Celtic lost to log leaders Kaizer Chiefs. He missed the next 10 fixtures with a groin strain. His return will come as a major boost for Celtic. Siwelele are placed ninth in the standings and chasing another improbable finish in the top eight. The team had another tumultuous campaign due to financial troubles. – CAJ News
