A TRAFFIC cop and his alleged accomplice were bust for poaching on Sunday afternoon. Paul Raboshoane (28) and Paul Romance (38) allegedly shot an ostrich on a farm, cut the fence and loaded it onto a Ford Ranger bakkie. The two suspects and two other men were driving on the N1 near Botlokwa, Limpopo, when they allegedly stopped and shot the ostrich. They were later bust on the same road after the farm owner reported the matter to the police. They were both granted R2 000 bail by the Morebeng Magistrates Court. The case was postponed to 7 September for further investigation. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo told Daily Sun the cops started investigating as soon as the matter was reported. He said two other suspects were allegedly involved, but managed to flee. “During the arrest, we confiscated the ostrich that was killed and two hunting rifles,” he said. Mojapelo said police were still looking for the two suspects who fled on foot.
