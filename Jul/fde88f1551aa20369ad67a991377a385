Police need help busting unknown suspects. This is after a 61-year-old woman was murdered and raped by two suspects. The Gauteng SAPS spokeswoman, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told Daily Sun that this incident happened in the early hours of today. "This took place in her home. Her granddaughter was also rapped and the suspects managed to flee the scene," said Peters. She also told Daily Sun that preliminary reports suggest that the suspects allegedly gained access into a house after breaking the burglar bar and entering through the sliding door. "One suspected who was allegedly armed with a weapon raped the 21-year old victim while the second suspect raped and severely assaulted the old grandmother in a separate bedroom," said Peters. "The grandmother was rushed to nearby Tshepo-Themba clinic in Soweto where she was declared dead on arrival," she added. The Gauteng Acting Provincial Commissioner of police, Major General Johan Ndlovu has ordered the urgent mobilisation of maximum resources towards finding the suspects behind this incident. "Those behind this horrendous act of gender-based violence deserve to spend the rest of their cowardice life behind bars. It is for this reason that police will leave no stone unturned in prioritising this investigation as we do with cases where women, children and vulnerable persons are victims," said Ndlovu. Members of the public who may have information that could assist in apprehending the suspects, are urged to report to their nearest police station or to call the crimestop number 08600 10111.
