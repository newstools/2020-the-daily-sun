Irvin Mahlangu who is accused of murdering his 3-month-old baby girl will today appear at the KwaMhlanga Magistrates Court. His case was postponed in April due to missing statements and post-mortem results. The 27-year-old allegedly killed his baby on 28 January by throttling and slitting her throat with a broken bottle. The incident took place at his rented house at KwaMhlanga. It is alleged on that fateful day the accused lured her baby mama Pearl Mtsweni (22) to his rented house by telling her that he doesn't have transport to go to work.  The girlfriend then took her mom’s car and went to the boyfriend’s place and when she got there, she found him not ready and immediately became dizzy and took a nap. The court previously heard the girlfriend then later realised the baby wasn’t next to her and noticed the boyfriend had killed her. Magistrate Andre du Preez postponed the case to 6 July for further investigations.
