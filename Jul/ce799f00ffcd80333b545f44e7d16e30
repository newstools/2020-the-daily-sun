KHUTJO Green is the new sheriff in town. She plays the new councillor, Maki Mthethwa, on SABC 2 telenovela Lithapo. Councillor Mthethwa used to work in the mayor’s office in Sandton before she became a councillor, in one of the wards in Alexandra, east of Joburg. She took over from councillor Jericho, who was murdered. “Mthethwa cares about changes in her ward. But there’s tension between him and businessman Senzo Hlongwane, played by Mangaliso Ngema. Senzo realised that Mthethwa is not the same as Jericho. “He feels that she’s a stumbling block to his project as she wants things done according to the books,” Khutjo told SunBuzz. We also see Mthethwa coming closer to Nolo, played by newcomer Khojane Morai. Her personal life takes interest in the street of Alexandra as she moves from Sandton to live in Alex. Khutjo said she auditioned for the councillor and prison warder roles and producers found that she’s fit for the councillor’s role. “I drew my character from Zuma’s third wife Thobeka Madiba. She is very contemporary, well-travelled and her dress code compliments her figure,” Khutjo said. She said it’s an honour and privilege to work alongside Ngema. “I grew up watching him and sharing a frame with him is a pleasure. We are so in tune. He allows me to give more than writers needed,” said Khutjo. She also worked alongside Arthur Molepo on Skeem Saam, where she played the role of detective Ledwaba. ) Catch Khutjo on Lithapo on SABC2 from Monday to Wednesday at 21.30pm
