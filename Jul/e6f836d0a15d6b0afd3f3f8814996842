WHEN she
put on her jacket that day, she never thought it would save her life. And it did
just that as it turned into a bulletproof vest, saving her from a hail of
bullets. THIS AFTER
HER BOYFRIEND SHOT AT HER ON FRIDAY. ONE bullet hit Jaqueline Lepelle in the chest, but the jacket miraculously saved her life. Instead, the bullet grazed her left breast. But seeing that she wasn’t dead, her boyfriend fired another shot – and this time it flew over her head by an inch. The 43-year-old from Daggafontein in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said as her boyfriend fired the third shot, she threw a gas bottle at the gun and the bullet missed her again. “He fell on the bed and I managed to run out of our shack,” she said. “I don’t understand where I got the courage to throw the gas bottle at the gun. “I guess I’d have died if I didn’t. The man was angry.” Jaqueline said her boyfriend ran after her while still firing shots. Residents came out to help her. But her boyfriend became mad and started firing randomly, injuring one person. This angered residents, who chased after him. “He threw away his gun, but residents grabbed him and beat him up,” she said. The man, a security guard, was badly beaten up and admitted to hospital. Jaqueline said the shooting started while she and her man were having a heated argument. She said he demanded things he’d bought for her. “He took a generator, chest of drawers and other things he bought for me,” she said. “I wish he could have left in peace instead of chasing me around and shooting randomly at innocent people.” She thanked her jacket and God for saving her life. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of attempted murder was opened. He said the suspect was in hospital under police guard.
