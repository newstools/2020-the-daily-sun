Actress Nozipho Langa has taken her acting career to new heights. She’s scored herself a role on SABC2 soapie Muvhango. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “Getting the role was a blessing. “It was validation that I’m indeed on the right path. I have to keep praying.” The 26-year-old actress says playing Bonolo is fun and challenging. “It’s been fun, especially because it was a challenge to remove myself from Nozipho and Glenda and step into shoes of Bonolo,” she said. To prepare for the role, the Polokwane-born Nozipho read a lot. “I read extensively into the script to be able to learn her behaviour and understand the way she makes decisions.” Nozipho runs an initiative that tackles mental issues and emotional health. “Open Discussion is an initiative that came about through my passion for speaking about issues of mental and emotional health,” she said. “We speak to the youth about the importance of understanding your mental and emotional journey.” But due to Covid-19, she said, she wasn’t able to speak on these issues as she would normally because gatherings are prohibited. “But we’ve decided to sell masks on Lida Media Hub online Store and will donate R5 from each purchase to an identified organisation. “This will help in buying personal protective equipment to keep communities safe during this tough time.” ) Catch Nozipho as Bonolo on Muvhango on SABC2 (DStv channel 192) on weekdays at 9pm, and as Glenda on Skeem Saam on SABC1 (DStv channel 191) on weekdays at 6.30pm
