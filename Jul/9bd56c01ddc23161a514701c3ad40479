PASTOR Mantsha Pheeha encouraged people to know who they were in the characteristics that defined them in Christ. Pheeha, a pastor at the Church of Jesus Christ in Midrand, Joburg, gave an example of a small Norfolk terrier dog named, Tiki, that she owned as a young girl. Explained Pheeha: “Tiki was friendly but cheeky, especially when people walked past my house. “She barked at and chased them. A lot of them ran away because they assumed Tiki would bite them. They weren’t aware they were more powerful than the dog and that Tiki was afraid of them.” She said this was what most people went through. “We go through life afraid of things that are afraid of us because we don’t know ourselves. “If you don’t know yourself, you’ll run away from things that should be running away from you.” The pastor said she’d like to remind the children of God t to remember their true identity in Christ amid the COVID-19 crisis. “In the midst of sickness, disease, death and economic ruin, we need to all pause and say, ‘I know who I am, I know who my Father is and I’m bigger than this, Genesis 1:26-28.” According to Pheeha, what the world was facing provided an opportunity for Christians to rise and comfort it, to minister heal, save, preach the message of hope. “There’s hope in God. This isn’t the end of the world,” she said. “Accept Jesus as your Saviour and Lord. Let’s shout His name on the mountains and hilltops (Colossians 3:1-4). “This is an urgent time in the history of mankind for the children of God to remember who they are and do what they are called to do (Romans 8:37).”
