 The armed robbers climbed on the roof of the house and left one man in the grey Audi at the gate. Reaction Unit South Africa Prem Balram said they received a call of a robbery in progress from a homeowner on Belvedere Drive in Belvedere. “The caller informed the controller on duty that armed men were on the roof of his house and that a grey Audi was parked near his property with a man remaining in the driver’s seat,” said Balram in a statement. Reaction officers were dispatched to the home and they noticed the Audi with the circulated number plate speeding down Belvedere Drive. One of the officers gave chase in a bike, the car was then spotted near King Shaka International Airport and a high speed ensued.  Reaction Officers from the Phoenix area intercepted the suspects near Ottawa and boxed the vehicle in. “The suspects attempted to flee on the R102 by driving on the center medium between the north and southbound lanes. They then flipped the vehicle several times and fled on foot.”  One of the suspects was arrested an hour later, several kilometers from the scene. He suffered injuries from the car crash.
