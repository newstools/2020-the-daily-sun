MOST people fear pit bulls and consider them dangerous. So Kamogelo Thema started Seshtown K9 Club in 2013 to make people love pit bulls instead of fearing them. The 22-year-old from Seshego zone 8, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said people make pit bulls fight each other to make cash. “I’m trying to change all that because people tarnish the name of pit bulls,” he told Daily Sun. “I’m doing this by allowing pit bull owners to let them take part in shows.” Kamogelo has been breeding pit bulls since he was seven. The club has 65 members, who meet twice a year at shows. “We train our dogs and teach them different stunts,” he said. “During our shows, we let them perform the stunts we taught them. “We also let them showcase their strength.” He said the aim was to teach people to love and appreciate pets. He said pet behaviour depends on training by owners, and they perform the way they were trained. “We train our dogs not to attack people. We only train them to live with people,” he said. Sammie Tladi (32) joined the club last year when his dog, Gin, was three weeks old. He said he joined the club to show off his dog and to show people how to treat their dogs. “People should regard their dogs as part of the family,” Sammie told the People’s Paper. “I love my dog and the club has given me a lot of experience on how to treat a pet.”
