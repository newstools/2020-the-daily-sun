  THE City of
Joburg has honoured Tata Nelson Mandela on Friday at the site where he planted
a tree back in 2008 at Soweto's Thokoza Park. This was
done on the same day his daughter Zinzdi Mandela was buried in Fourways,
Joburg. MMC for
Community Development, Margaret Arnolds said they also came to the site to
honor Zindzi Mandela who was a role model for women in Mzansi. Arnolds said:
"What we are doing is coming here to honour him. We also came here to
honour Zindzi. "She
didn't capitalise on his fame, neither did she capitalise on her mum's fame,
she was a person of her own, she had integrity. She said
Zindzi was active in student politics and adult activism. "As we
women, feel proud to have this person coming from Soweto, to have this person
that has become an icon for us as women besides Mama Winnie."  City Parks
spokeswoman Jenny Moodley said: "In 2008, Madiba came into Thokoza Park
and planted this tree, which it's over four metres tall now. "It is
a Stinkwood tree; it is indigenous to South Africa." She also
said Madiba also unveiled a mural of himself. According
to Jenny, several trees were planted around the champion tree, which Jenny said
makes shade for people who visit the park during summer. She said
one thing people can do this Mandela day, they must ensure that they keep
children safe.
