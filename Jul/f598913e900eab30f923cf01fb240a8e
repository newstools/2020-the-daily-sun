ANGRY service delivery protesters from Lamontville kasi torched government cars and buildings yesterday. Protesters gathered in the early hours and blocked all exists and entrances to and from the small kasi in the south of Durban. Before cops from the public order unit arrived, the protesters had already burnt several cars belonging to the Social Development Department and eThekwini Municipality. They also torched eThekwini’s Sizakalala offices where residents pay for municipality services such as electricity and rates. Ward 74 councillor Nolubabalo Mthembu said she didn’t know why residents were protesting because she was attending her family member’s funeral arrangements at the mortuary outside the township. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said protesters burnt down six cars belonging to eThekwini Municipality and social development department, and public order police were breaking up crowds and were getting more information. She said protesters also blocked the South Coast freeway, bringing traffic to a complete halt, where a truck also was torched. Attempts to get comment from protest leaders failed.
