ALL she wanted was for her husband to have eyes only for her. So last month, she visited a sangoma so her husband could dump his nyatsi. But her plan backfired. Instead of taking her husband’s socks, she mistakenly took her makhwapheni’s socks to the sangoma. And the man now can’t get enough of the woman. The 43-year-old woman from Orlando West, Soweto, said the sangoma performed some things on the socks. “I was instructed to tie them together and throw them in the nearest river. “I did exactly as I was told, but after two days my side guy started texting and calling me non-stop,” she said. She said she immediately knew something was wrong because her makhwapheni had never behaved like that. “He has a girlfriend, but he told me he wanted to dump her,” she said. “I told him he was being ridiculous, but he threatened to tell my husband.” The woman said she went back to the sangoma, but he was nowhere to be found. “I was told he’d gone to Mozambique. I called him, but wasn’t able to get a hold of him,” she said. So the woman went to a new sangoma, who told her she mixed up the socks, which might end her marriage. “She gave me something to bath with and drink, but none of it works. “I went back to her and she told me I’d have to wait for the first sangoma who helped me. I’m devastated.” She said she told her makhwapheni about the mix-up, hoping he’d be understanding, but he didn’t buy it. When told about the socks mix-up, the makhwapheni said the woman was lying. “We’re destined to be together and nothing will come between us,” he said. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said he had dealt with this kind of problem. “She can come to me. We’ll fix this problem,” said Dungamanzi.
