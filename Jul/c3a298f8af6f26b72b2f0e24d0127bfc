A WELL-KNOWN alleged Mpumalanga rhino poaching kingpin and his accomplice were bust today. The 56-year-old suspect was arrested at his house in Hazyview in connection with the murder of his neighbour in February 2010, while the other suspect was also bust at his house. The victim, an Eskom worker, was allegedly working with the suspects at that time in illegal sales of transformers to neighbouring countries. The suspect, a former cop, allegedly failed to pay the victim for his work. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the victim went to the suspect’s house and took equipment as payment. “The suspect, with his brother and another 50-year-old went to the victim’s home, kidnapped and killed him. They later threw his body in a nearby dam around the Bushbuckridge area. Later, the case was investigated and not finalised. It resumed again recently, where it led to today’s arrest,” she said. The third suspect was not found at his place. The main suspect, who is out on R120 000 bail after his arrest in 2018, faces multiple charges which includes possession of rhino horns, money laundering and conspiracy to commit crime. For the past couple of years, he has been in and out of the police cells. He’s apparently a member of a syndicate that allegedly ran a poaching group with the support of police officials as well as authorities from private game farms in the Bushbuckridge area. The suspect was released on condition that he doesn’t interfere with witnesses and the investigation. His racketeering cases are currently being heard in the Mpumalanga High Court. Sekgotodi said the suspect was expected to appear in the White River Magistrates Court soon.
