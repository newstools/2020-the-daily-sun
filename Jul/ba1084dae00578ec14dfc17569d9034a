 THE eighth accused in the VBS Mutual Bank heist matter, Philip Truter finally had his day in court. On his first appearance at the Specialised Commercial Crimes court sitting at Palm Ridge Magistrate Court in Ekurhuleni, Truter said he intends to plead guilty to all the charges. He faces 47 charges relating to the alleged R2.3 billion heist. The former CFO of VBS apologised to the Victims of the VBS scandal through an affidavit read by his defence lawyer, WJ Hattingh. "I Intend to plead guilty, I apologise about what happened, I'm sorry about what happened to the victims of VBS." On the previous court appearance, where his seven co-accused appeared, he was in quarantine and could not be part of the seven. But he will be joining them on the next appearance as their case has been postponed to October 8. Truter was granted bail, with a capped amount R50 000. Some of the conditions attached to the bail included not leaving the country and handing over his passport.
