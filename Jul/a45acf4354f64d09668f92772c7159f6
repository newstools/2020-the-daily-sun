WITHOUT hesitating, Kwabi Sello (61) jumped in to save his two tenants from their burning shack. But then Kwabi himself got trapped – and if it wasn’t for his brave daughter who saved him, he’d be dead today. His brave daughter, Avuyile Nkunzana (20), saw her dad was inhaling smoke and couldn’t get out. So she jumped in, grabbed her father by his belt and pulled him out. It was in the early hours of Monday morning when Kwabi’s tenant’s shack in Bekkersdal, North West, caught fire. The other tenant whose shack was next door heard her scream for help and rushed to help, but both of them died in the flames. “I thank my daughter for pulling me out of the fire. I would have been dead if she didn’t save me,” said Kwabi. He said he was shocked that he lost his two tenants who were also his friends.  He said the women even joked about death. “I believe they saw their death coming and I’m heartbroken I’ll never see them again.”  Avuyile said she surprised herself when she jumped into the strong flames. “But I wasn’t going to let my dad die in that fire. I couldn’t have lived with myself if I did.” Colonel Andile Mushani of Bekkersdal police said an inquest docket has been opened.
