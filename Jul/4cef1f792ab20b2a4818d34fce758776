A 20-year-old woman has been admitted in hospital after she allegedly gave birth by herself and threw the baby inside a pit latrine. This happened on Saturday in Motlhabeng village in Mahikeng in the North West. According to a neighbour, the woman has been pregnant but did not want to go home fearing that her parents will shout at her. “She is originally from Rustenburg and was a student at Taletso college. After lockdown she told me that she cannot go back home because her parents will not approved the pregnancy,” she said. The woman  was taken by an ambulance after complaining that she was having abdominal pains. Police spokeswoman Amanda Funani said on her arrival at the hospital nurses noticed that the woman had gave birth. She said police were then called and the woman was questioned about the whereabouts of the baby. “That was when she told the police that she threw the baby inside the toilet,” she said. The police together with the forensic pathologists then went to the woman’s rented room and removed the body from the pit. Funani said the police were investigating a case of concealment of birth. “We are not sure whether the baby was still alive when the mother threw her or him inside the toilet. The case might change to murder if post mortem proves otherwise,” she said.
