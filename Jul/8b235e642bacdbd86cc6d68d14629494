So you are seeing someone and your'e really into him or her. Your relationship goes through the time period referred to in relationships as the "honeymoon" phase, which is the first three months of the relationship. After this fun and rosy period, you enter the key stage called the "touch and go", which is the three months after the honeymoon phase. This is when you begin to understand and learn a lot about each other. From habits, moods and other personal aspects of yourself. After constantly sleeping over and slowly becoming a resident at his/her apartment, flat, room or house, the question becomes when should you move in with each other? According to stats, about 37% couples move in together after they've been in a relationship for six months to a year, according to a 2015 study by Rent.com. So, when is the right time to move in with him/her?  Besides having sex, you are constantly with each other. His/her belongings are beginning to take up space in your closets. Should this be the picture of your relationship, then it is time you consider moving in with each other.  Communication is key in a relationship, and if its not up to scratch, a lot tends to go wrong in any relationship. Should you now have learned how to communicate with one another in terms of addressing issues. Then your boxes should have been fully packed and ready to be moved in.  If there are no awkward moments between the two of you, then you are ready to live together. From farting to walking around naked in the each other presence, your sense of comfort around him/her will tell you are ready to move in.  By definition, compromise is an agreement or settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions. Simply put, when parties meet each other half way. If you can meet each other half way on things closest to your heart, then where is his or her spare key.
