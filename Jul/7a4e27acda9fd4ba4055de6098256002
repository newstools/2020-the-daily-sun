SKHUMBUZO Duma says having a child is the best thing that has ever happened to him. The 36-year-old told Daily Sun he was a drug addict when his daughter was born, but she gave him the will to get clean. “When I first saw her, I knew I had to be a responsible father and started to try quitting, but it was hard. “Only her smile gave me the will to work harder and I did it for me and her,” he said. But tragedy soon struck as the child’s mum disappeared not long after she was born. “When my daughter was seven months old, her mother dropped her off to go to the shops and never came back,” he said. Skhumbuzo said he looked all over Joburg for the mum, but couldn’t find her. He was later told she had abandoned her two other kids as well. He said he decided to move from Soweto to Lethabong, Ekurhuleni, to get a fresh start. “I wanted to raise my kid away from bad influences and my former addict friends,” he said. Skhumbuzo said although it’s hard to take care of his daughter alone, he wouldn’t have it any other way. “I survive on piece jobs. If I had a child support grant, it would be better. “It’s very hard, but I make sure my daughter has a meal every day.” Skhumbuzo said he had knocked on many doors to get his daughter registered with Home Affairs. “I’ve seen social workers and I’ve approached NGOs for help getting a birth certificate, but I have not had any success,” he said. He said not having a birth certificate would badly affect his daughter. “She’s three years old and she will have to go to school soon. “I will have to get a birth certificate to register her,” he said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said Skhumbuzo would have to go for a DNA test with a government-approved lab. “Once the results are available, he can visit the nearest Home Affairs office for assistance,” he said.
