Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has gone into isolation
after he tested positive to COVID-19 today. Winde said he felt some flu-like symptoms over the weekend and decided to test for Covid-19. “I received a positive test result for Covid-19 this
morning,& I am in self-isolation at home for 14 days. On Sunday, I started
to develop mild flu-like symptoms. As I am Diabetic (type 2)& over 55 years
of age, I know I am at a higher risk of developing a more serious illness,”
Winde announced on Twitter. The Premier urged residents to keep on wearing their masks,
sanitise and follow everything that government has been urging them to do. “Follow the 5 golden rules at all times, including wearing a
cloth mask, cleaning surfaces regularly and washing or sanitizing your hands
often. And, please be kind, and compassionate at all times,” saidWinde. Although he will be in isolation, the provincial leader said
he will continue to do his job. He will be having a meeting with President
Cyril Ramaphosa on tomorrow afternoon. “I also look forward to meeting with President Ramaphosa online during the scheduled
President’s Coordinating Council meeting on Thursday afternoon, and will be chairing our second cabinet meeting of the week on Friday
morning, which takes place on MS Teams,” he said. Winde is the latest top government official test positive to
Covid-19. On Tuesday this week, Premier of North West province Job
Mokgoro tested positive to Covid-19. This happened a day after the death of the
Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs MEC Gordon Kegakilwe in the same province.
