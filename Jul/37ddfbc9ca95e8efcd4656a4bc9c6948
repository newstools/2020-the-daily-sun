SHE knew one day she’d get caught, but that never stopped her from pushing herself to make more money. Frauline Mothlaga (46) from Gezina, Tshwane, said the 12 years she spent as a drug mule inspired her to share her story. She told Daily Sun a friend introduced her to that lifestyle and it became addictive. “I was having marital problems and needed money,” she said. “I was a flight attendant for 15 years, and in 2009 I was arrested for drug trafficking.” She had nightmares about getting caught but couldn’t stop. She used the money to build houses for her nanny and aunt and paid for her MBA studies. She spent the rest on clothes and imported furniture. She was bust in the UK and brought back to Sun City Prison. She’s started a charity organisation, Favorline Foundation, to raise awareness about drug trafficking and domestic violence. She’s partnered with other charity organisations in various parts of the world. “Most drug trafficking starts in unstable homes where there’s domestic violence and homes without fathers,” she said. She plans to travel the world educating people in prisons, schools and other institutions. She’s also entered Mrs Universe to expand her work. Frauline pleaded guilty and paid a R5 000 fine. She only spent a total of 11 days in prison. She’s written a book, The Vow of a Flight Attendant Drug Smuggler, which will soon be turned into a movie. .
