THE death of Amahle Quku (17), who was raped and murdered last month, has convinced Pastor Anitha Pamla (28) that it’s time to do more to help rape victims. Pastor Anitha from Philippi in Cape Town, who was raped when she was 15, has started the Wipe her Tears project and is now working to change the lives of rape victims around the country. She said she never got any counselling and believed there were many women like her who needed her help. “Many rape victims keep quiet, leading to depression and even suicide.” She said she’d use her existing NPO to run the Wipe Her Tears project. “Counselling doesn’t need funding. It just needs skills,” she said. Anitha, who is a pastor at Methodist Church in Philippi, said she and her cousin were raped at knifepoint at Siyahlala squatter camp in 2007 by two men. The men took their jewellery, and then, in between the shacks, raped them. “While he was on top of me I begged him not to kill me,” she said. A case was opened, but the rapists were never arrested. Anitha, like many rape victims still doesn’t have closure. She was promised counselling by the cops and her class teacher, but it never happened. She managed to get counselling from her church when she started her training as a pastor in her early 20s. “The more I spoke about it, I got better. I was a mess, but now I’m getting better,” she said. Anitha, who is also a counsellor at her church, believes that the incident was meant to prepare her to assist rape victims. “I use the pain I went through to connect with the people I counsel,” she said.
