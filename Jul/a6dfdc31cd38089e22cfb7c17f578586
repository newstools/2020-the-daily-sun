Willard Katsande says Kaizer Chiefs must not become distracted by Mamelodi Sundowns in their quest for Absa Premiership glory. Amakhosi entered the enforced break, as a result of the coronavirus, on top of the league standings, four points clear of Sundowns but having played a game more. As Chiefs fight for the first league title since 2015, the experienced midfielder insists the club will secure top honours if they are able to focus on their game.Katsande told Radio 702: "Obviously, we are very much aware of the teams that are coming for the same title we are in control of at the moment."You know when you sign for Kaizer Chiefs, you know that you are signing up to deal with the pressure and deal with situations like this one."So, it's up to us because at the moment we are in control. We can only control each game which is the game we are going to play as Kaizer Chiefs. We are not going to look at how our neighbours operate their house."We will be focusing on here and now - the game we are going to play at that particular time, that would be the most important game."We will be throwing everything (in the remaining games), we will be sharpening our swords, go for a fight, we become victors, go back to the drawing board and focus on the next game." -TeamTalk Media
