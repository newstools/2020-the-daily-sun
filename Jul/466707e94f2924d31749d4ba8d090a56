A
40-year-old man has been sentenced to 40 years imprisonment for killing a North
West teacher in 2019.  The
North West High Court sentenced Nkululelo Kraai  on  Tuesday after
the  Gontse Primary school teacher Isaac Oupa Tlhapi’s body was found at
the field with stab wounds last year April.  Tlhapi
(44) had been missing for a week when his body was discovered. He was last seen
going to a local pub and never returned.  At
that time his family believed that the people who killed him wanted to hijack
his new car which he bought two weeks before his death.  Tlhapi’s
brother  Joe Tlhapi  said the car was found abandoned in Soweto,
Gauteng.  North
West police said Tlhapi’s family ultimately reported him missing the following day
after he failed to come back home. He was last seen with three men at the local
tavern.  Consequently,
his silver Nissan Qashqai vehicle was found abandoned in Soweto, Gauteng
Province on Saturday, 27 April 2019 while one of the men who were last seen
with the victim, was arrested.  The
23-year-old man who later became a state witness, then led the police to
Nkululeko Kraai in Delareyville.  He further took the police to a place
along Wolmaransstad /Leedoringstad road where Tlhapi’s body was discovered with
multiple stab wounds.  North
West high court declared Kraai  unfit to possess a firearm.
