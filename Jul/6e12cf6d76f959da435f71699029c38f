    THE accused
in the murder case of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu appeared in the Verulam Magistrates
Court virtually on Wednesday. They
expected to hear whether the eThekwini court would be granting them bail or
not, but the matter was postponed to Friday. Mlungisi
Thabethe (27), Andile Nhleko (27), Mncedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27),
Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22) are accused of kidnapping and
murdering the teenager from Hambanathi. The accused
started their bail application at the beginning of last month, but it had to be
postponed after a cop involved in the case tested positive for coronavirus. The entire
court had to be shut down to be sterilised. The
suspects made a brief appearance over a TV screen and were told by Magistrate
Rajesh Parshotam the matter would be heard on Friday, when Magistrate Thiloshir
Badal was available. “The matter
is also postponed for arrangements to bring the suspects to court to be made,”
he said.
