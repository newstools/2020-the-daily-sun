THE Mocheko family was hoping to reunite with their missing loved one after he went missing on Mandela Day. But Mosoeu Mocheko (76) was found dead in his Toyota Quantum taxi near a farm in Free State on Sunday night. He had just dropped off passengers in Hoopstad before he went missing. The family said they didn’t suspect any foul play because there was no criminal element visible at the scene. His son Winston Mocheko told Daily Sun: “My father was found dead inside the taxi. At first we suspected possible criminal activities but after looking through the scene, nothing was stolen. The car was still there but it seems he died of natural causes. He was not found dumped in the field and all his bank cards were still with him. We think he might have been tired and he died peacefully. “He was parked on one of the farms nearby and we are still gathering more information. We are preparing for his burial at the moment.” The police said Mosoeu had called a family member complaining of a headache. When the relative tried to call him back, his phone was on voicemail. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “An inquest docket was registered after the body of an alleged missing taximan was found. A post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death. No injuries were found on the body.”
