GOGO Salome Chuenyane has been living in her parents’ house in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, since 1965. And as her three siblings have their own houses, her late mum appointed her as caretaker of the house. But her brother left his home last month and kicked gogo Salome out. He apparently told her she couldn’t inherit their parents’ property as she’s a woman. The 76-year-old gogo said: “My name is on the title deed and I’m entitled to live there. “I didn’t know that being a woman gave me less rights. I’m disappointed. He’s my brother and has his own house.” She said it didn’t help when she pleaded. “I asked him to postpone until after lockdown, but he wouldn’t listen,” she said. “He didn’t even care that it’s in the middle of winter.” The gogo has now sought shelter at a relative’s house. “My grandchildren are scattered all around Mamelodi in relatives’ houses,” she said. “I need to go back home. I hope someone will help. I’m desperate to get back home.” Daily Sun contacted gogo Salome’s brother, who asked to be called later. Contacted again, a man who claimed to be his cousin answered his phone and asked the People’s Paper to call in the evening. Daily Sun contacted him again, but a woman claiming to be his cousin said he had a crisis and had left his cellphone with her.
