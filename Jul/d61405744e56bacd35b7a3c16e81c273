SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is one of the excited coaches that are looking forward to the re-start of the Absa Premiership. But the modest Zimbabwean mentor is worried that training will be conducted differently from the way things were done before the COVID-19. Players will have to come to training in a small group as part of the safety regulations required by the government. “We have to start training gradually with five players. We have to break that down, if you have a squad of 25 players it will mean you will need five hours of training if you train for an hour and 30 minutes,” said Tembo. “You must break that when we start with individual training and group training before we move to full training. I think it is important that we must look after our players in terms of injuries. If you look at what’s happening in Europe, the first two or three games it was a little bit difficult and it was tough,” added Tembo. The 49-year-old ex-defender told South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA) yesterday that he is not thinking of beefing up his squad until the end of the season. Matsatsantsa a Pitori are third on the log table with 40 points from 26 matches. Tembo, who has been with the three-time league champions for over 20 years, has also been offered a new deal that he will sign at the end of the season. “Let’s get the league season out of the way and then, we can start talking about which players we want to add to our squad,” he said. The former Zimbabwe international also wished Thabo Mnyamane and Thabo Qalinge, who were released by last month well in their new endeavors. “We couldn’t keep the two Thabo’s in the team anymore as we look to bring through the young players that are determined to break into the starting line-up. They are good players and we have no doubt that they will do well wherever they decided to play next season,” said Tembo.
