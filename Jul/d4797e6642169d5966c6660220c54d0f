Happy belated birthday to the People’s Paper, Daily Sun. This is the paper I first knew as “Kuranta ya Ranta” newspaper back in 2002 when it was sold for R1. I was in primary school and couldn’t miss reading it as our teachers used to buy it and share it with us. Today that very same R1 paper has grown and has become part of our daily lives. The story of the paper serves as testimony that dreams do come true. A lot of people doubted its relevance until the day it helped them solve their problems, through powerful features such as Home Affairs Horrors and many others. The paper is easy to read and understand. On a personal level, Daily Sun has changed a lot in my life as it has given me a platform to air my views by writing opinion letters. No matter the issues I write about, my views and that of other writers are never undermined. Most regular writers have graduated from opinion writing to writing books, thanks to our favourite paper. Not even words can explain how much we appreciate it. The relationship most have with the paper isn’t only based on the fact that it’s cheap, but that it’s the voice of the voiceless. Credit should be given to our hard-working journalists and editors. ) Melato Mphahlele Zebediela
