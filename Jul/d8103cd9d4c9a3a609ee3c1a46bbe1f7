Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic is looking forward to returning to training after an unusual long break. The forward is itching to get back on the field ahead of the proposed restart of the Absa Premiership once the PSL has given the green light as to when matches will start again. Speaking to his club's website, Nurkovic said: “I am definitely looking forward to training. “It has been a while since I last trained with the ball. As a professional, you cannot wait to get back on the pitch and do what is relevant to your passion of playing the game.” Nurkovic, who has 11 league goals to his tally this season for table topping Chiefs, believes the return of football will cheer a lot of fans up. “We are in a difficult situation right now. I do feel that when we start again, we can bring joy to the fans once again and help the current situation somewhat," added the Serbian. "It will be strange to play in an empty stadium without the energy of our fans who have been tremendous this season. But we will continue to play with them in our hearts and hopefully we end the season in a positive way.”
