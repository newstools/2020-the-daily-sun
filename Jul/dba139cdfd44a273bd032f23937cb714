UNDOUBTEDLY Themba Zwane has proven to be one of the best midfielders to come out of South Africa. Like a fine wine, Zwane has been getting better with time since his arrival at Chloorkop in 2011. In his nine-year stint with the club he has won eight titles with the club, three Absa Premiership trophies, CAF Champions League and Super Cup title also Telkom Knockout twice and one Nedbank Cup. Mshishi, as he is affectionately known in the football circles, said he wanted to be the part of the history-making team when he joined Masandawana. “When I came to Sundowns in 2011, I told myself that I want to create history and make history to repeat itself,” the player told the club website. “To be honest I was ready for anything and I manage the pressure because I know what people want from me. I am expected to deliver at all times.” He remains to be one of the most consistent players in the PSL over the seasons with the likes of his captain Hlompho Kekana. “Remember that at Downs we have a lot of quality players so if you don’t do that they will take your place,” he said. This season he has played more than 30 matches and his contribution has not gone unnoticed as he banged in 13 goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Zwane, will be hoping to improve and continue with his impressive displays when the Premier Soccer League returns. Sundowns are second on the PSL table and four points behind Kaizer Chiefs. In their nine remaining fixtures, they will be looking at defending their title. Zwane said: “I am trying to improve the ‘Mshishi’ of last season of course. I only compete with myself, and give credit to my teammates because they make things to be easy for me.”
