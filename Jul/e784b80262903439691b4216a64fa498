MISS Universe Zozibini Tunzi will focus on women empowerment once her reign is over. Addressing the issue of gender-based violence during a G4G webinar on Friday evening, she said her first priority would be gender equality. “This is what I’m passionate about, and I’d like to see it included in the school syllabus,” she said. “This is my long-term goal, but for now I don’t know what steps to take in order to make it happen.” She called on men to start taking responsibility and educate young boys on how to treat women. “I guess young boys must be taught from a very young age to become the men we need in the future,” she said. “I recommend that in the meantime we do campaigns, workshops and seminars directed at young boys.” According to Zozibini, economic empowerment and gender equality can’t be achieved without looking at gender-based violence. “This is because these concepts are intertwined,” she said. “There are conflicting ideas that once you empower a woman, men become threatened and intimidated, leading to violence. “My belief is that if we still have such ideologies it means we’ll never have women leaders. “I call upon world leaders and governments to have another look at our policies and laws to see what they can do. “Women themselves should be part of making those laws and policies.” She said women mustn’t be scared to be labelled feminists. “It’s about equality.”
