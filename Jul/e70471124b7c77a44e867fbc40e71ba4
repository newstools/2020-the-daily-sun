Moses Nkoana, the player's uncle who was more involved in the player's football career, told SunSport that Nkoana's mother took the player to hospital where he unfortunately passed on. "His mother called me that the player was admitted to hospital," said his uncle. "But the next day they told me that he was out of danger and will no longer be needing operation. They thought he was ready to be discharge. But to my shock I was called urgently the next day that he has passed on. The whole family is devastated and we really wonder what could have gone gone wrong. He will sadly be remembered of his talents, which I have been a part of moulding."
