DRIVING around in a white Toyota Corolla, the suspects kidnapped a girl. They took the 17-year-old schoolgirl to an isolated spot near a river and raped her. After raping her, they ordered her to bath in the river to destroy the evidence. And the traumatised girl had to do what she was told. She then wore her uniform and they drove her back to her kasi in Kagiso, Mogale City. The traumatised girl opened a case of rape. Cops are now looking for the suspects. DIVORCE ON THE RISE DURING LOCKDOWN! Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso cop shop said the schoolgirl was on her way home on Friday when the car, which had no registration number, stopped in front of her. The grade 12 pupil was walking next to Chief Luthuli Hall in Kagiso. “One of the occupants came out and pointed a gun at her. “The girl was bundled into the back seat of the car and the suspect who pointed the gun at her forced her to give him a blow job,” said Sibiya. “The suspects then drove with her to an isolated spot where she was repeatedly raped.” The girl was too traumatised by the incident and could not speak to Daily Sun. Sibiya said the cops were still looking for the suspects. Brigadier Themba Maduna said: “We appeal to schoolkids not to walk alone and to always be in groups.” Anyone with information about the incident should call 08600 10111.
