COXWELL “Magic” Ratshivhadelo doubts his former team Black Leopards will survive relegation. Lidoda Duvha are currently bottom of the Absa Premiership with six league matches left to end the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended since March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Ratshivhadelo, the former Leopards striker and fans’ favourite, was speaking to SunSport after the Venda-based side released star players, midfielder Lesedi Kapinga and striker Joseph “Black Jesus” Mhlongo. “I’m also surprised by the decision the club management took because I thought they will hold on to all their important players until the end of the season,” said the former Bidvest Wits player who is now working as a prison warder. “Kapinga and Mhlongo are some of the best players in the team and will be needed during this tough time. “At least this (decision by the club) will benefit the players in terms of their future. In my opinion, it is a good move for them (Kapinga and Mhlongo) financially.” Added Ratshivhadelo: “But as for Leopards, it was not a good decision. “I am a big fan of Leopards as I enjoyed playing for them. But honestly, it will be very difficult for them without those two players to survive relegation. “I am looking at the depth of their squad and how they have been struggling throughout the season. I doubt Leopards will survive.” Kapinga is on his way to Mamelodi Sundowns and is due to join their camp in Rustenburg, but won’t play for them until next season. Mhlongo has been linked with Highlands Park. This season Leopards have hired four coaches – Lionel Soccoia, Morgan Shivambu and Cavin Johnson – and now they have put their trust in the inexperience Alan Clark to help the Venda-based side fight relegation. Leopards, who survived relegation by the skin of their teeth with now Baroka coach Dylan Kerr at the helm last season, are bottom with 20 points. But this time Ratshivhadelo does not see that miracle of last season happening again.
