THE family of a 20-year-old woman who dumped a foetus in a pit toilet were still in shock after she confessed to having an abortion. Speaking to Daily Sun, the uncle of the woman, Patrick Mokone (42), said they were shocked to see police coming to their home to search for the foetus in the toilet. Patrick said his niece complained about having pains and went to a local clinic, and she must have confessed to the health officials what she’d done. Said Patrick: “We were surprised when we saw a police van arriving at our house with my niece. “They told us they were from the clinic and the girl had something to inform us as family. “When she confessed she was pregnant and had decided to terminate it, we were shocked that she dumped the foetus right here in the pit toilet. “She was too scared to explain the horrific matter to us. She pointed to where she dumped the baby, and we had to search for it until we found it. “We have a lot of questions and we hope she’ll tell us because we don’t understand why she’d destroy a life. Children are a gift from God. “I was going to be a grandpa soon, but her actions put us in pain as a family. “We’re not going to chase her away. Instead, we’ll support her through this difficult time. “She must know that it’s not the end of her life. People will talk in the village, but she must remain strong.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that the woman was arrested and charged with concealment of birth. She will appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court soon.
