Kgomotso Christopher has scored herself a presenting gig. The former Scandal! actress will present SABC2 parenting show, Raising Babies 101. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “I was very excited when I was told I got the gig. “This is something I’ve been looking forward to since last year.” The 41-year-old actress will present the Tuesday edition, which focuses on toddlers. “It’s quite a well-rounded show,”  she said. “We’ve balanced the fun and learning. “Parents share their experiences and get advice from experts who have diverse experience in childhood development.” Kgomotso said the show came at a time when lot of people are home. “People are at home because we’re under lockdown. We need any tip we can get. “We’ll touch a lot on health, safety, emergency tips and keeping your house safe for your toddlers.” However, she said, this is not a show focused on Covid-19. “The show has general conversations. So the tips and the conversations can be used, whether it’s lockdown or not,” said Kgomotso. “We have a segment where we talk about issues of safety, sanitisers, masks and washing of hands, and we involve the health department.” She said this was the first audition she’d been to this year. “I haven’t done presenting in many years, and presenting this show has been a learning curve for me,” she said. “It’s been intense shooting because it’s a different style of working. “But I’m grateful that I’m growing in my various creative avenues as an artist.” ) Catch Kgomotso Christopher on Raising Babies 101 on Tuesdays on SABC2 at 9am
