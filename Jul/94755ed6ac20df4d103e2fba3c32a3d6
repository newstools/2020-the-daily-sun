GEORGE Maluleka has already hit the ground running with his new club Mamelodi Sundowns. Popularly known as Mido in football circles, the former Kaizer Chiefs star, has been in camp with his Sundowns teammates in Rustenburg and got an opportunity to reflect on his stay with the Brazilians since he started training. On Thursday he said he enjoys catching up with the PSL giants and got to understand what is required from him. "The camp is currently underway and the boys are getting back to shape to ensure that we fight until the end to retain our league title," Sundowns said in a statement. "The boys have been put through their paces by the technical team and it is with pleasure to announce that new recruit Maluleka has joined the side and is already feeling welcomed by the rest of the gang." The 31-year-old midfielder from Tembisa said he's enjoyed his first day training with Sundowns and "was good and great to be back on the field, a lot of physical training and I enjoyed myself”. “The guys have been good, I received a warm welcome, it was very good and I am happy," said Maluleka.  Coach Pitso Mosimane wasted no second as he engaged Mido on what will be required from him and what role he will play in the side. Maluleka left Chiefs under a cloud after declined their offer and went for offer the Chloorkop side put on the table. Mosimane shared his thought on his new signing: “He is a good boy, a good player, intelligent, intrinsic also and I have spoken to him about tactics and I have put him through the process of how our number six and eight plays.” Maluleka brings along a wealth of experience that Mosimane will utilise. "He joined The Brazilians to compete for silverware in the African continent and also locally," the club said. “He comes with a lot of set-piece delivery and he can score, can shoot from outside the box and is willing to learn which is good and we wish him all the best.”
