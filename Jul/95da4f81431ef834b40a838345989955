POET and Ukhozi FM presenter Bongani “Qhawe” Mavuso has spent a week in hospital fighting kidney failure. Being in hospital made him start a campaign to teach people about it. Bongani, who presents Ezangempelasonto, Ezisematheni and Back to My Roots on the station, was admitted to a Durban hospital last week. He’s now started a campaign aimed at helping people take care of their bodies and get help early if sick. Bongani said it hurt him to find out so late about his kidney problems. He told Daily Sun he didn’t want it to happen to others. “Knowing about your body is very important,’’ he said. “We should teach each other about our organs and their importance in our body. “We should learn to eat healthily and cut salty and fatty foods. “This illness is so dangerous because it silently destroys your organs. “I always felt exhausted and suspected something was wrong, but didn’t know it was serious. “I hope my campaign helps many people to not fall into the same trap.”
