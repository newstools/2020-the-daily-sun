IN their bid to remain stronger and survive relegation from the Absa Premiership, AmaZulu have confirmed that a number of key players have extended their stay with the club. Veteran defender Tsepo Masilela will compete the season while another defender Mario Booysen, plus goalkeeper and captain Siyabonga Mbatha renewed deals. The Durban-based outfit, who are lying second from bottom, are keeping the former Bafana Bafana defender, Masilela until the suspended season is completed and then they’ll discuss the way forward afterwards. The 35-year-old was signed as a free agent on a one-year deal set to lapse today. Since he joined the coastal club, he has featured in eight league matches, including the shock 1-0 victory over Kaizer Chiefs on 6 March at FNB Stadium before the campaign was temporarily halted. “Tsepo will stay until the end of this season, whenever that may be for now,” said club general manager Lunga Sokhela. “At the end of the season, the club will decide regarding his future.” Masilela’s signing by Usuthu ended his 15 months in the football wilderness without a club following his departure from Chiefs at the end of the 2017-18 season. Like Masilela, Mbatha’s contract was expiring today. However, Usuthu have jumped in to extend it. The 31-year-old joined AmaZulu from defunct Thanda Royal Zulu ahead of 2017-18 season. “We have extended Mbatha’s contract until end of next season,” confirmed Sokhela. Sokhela said Mbatha’s contract is likely to be re-looked at again as they aim to keep him beyond next season. “We are set to sit down with him and try and have a longer term contract,” said Sokhela. Meanwhile, Booysen who joined Usuthu at the start of the season, after he was dumped by Chiefs, will remain with the club until the end of next season.
