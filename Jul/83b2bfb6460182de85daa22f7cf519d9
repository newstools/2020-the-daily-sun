RESIDENTS have accused the municipality of taking them for granted. They claim they have no access to water because taps are dry, and that roads are in a bad condition. Residents of Thulamahashe apparently raised their concerns several times with the Bushbuckridge Municipality. Tintswalo Mathebula (57) told Daily Sun taps had been dry for years and he feared contracting the coronavirus. “We’ve never had a single drop of water here,” said Tintswalo. “Residents of the other section helped but stopped, saying they didn’t want to get infected. “The municipality has forgotten about us. “They want to see us dying from this virus. “Some people charge us a lot for water, which is unfair. “We’re told to wash our hands regularly.” Tintswalo said the municipality paved kasi streets two years ago but their section wasn’t paved. According to her, when it rains homes and wall fences are swept away by water. Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said the technical service team would visit the sites to investigate and provide solutions.
