THE family of a female teacher killed at her rented place in Rustenburg, North West, was deeply hurt by the cruel way she died. The body of Lesedi Mokgosi (25) was found by cops with her hands and feet tied up. Police suspected she was strangled. Family spokesman Aobakwe Mokgosi said they had high hopes about her future. “She was a breadwinner in our family. She left behind a younger brother who was expecting her to help him further his studies.”   Aobakwe said Lesedi had just started working in 2018. “Her parents died while she was still young. Our gogo had to take care of her and used her pension to send her to school.” North West Education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela was touched by Lesedi’s death because she rented a place at her aunt’s place. She said after hearing about the incident, she went all out and looked for Lesedi’s family on social media. Matsemela said men have turned into something else. “Whoever did this barbaric thing of killing, raping and stealing from Lesedi in the end, law enforcers will catch that kind of an animal and bring him to book,” she said. Lesedi will be buried in Makgobistad tomorrow.
