MORE and more truck drivers might down tools following a failed meeting. Yesterday, the drivers’ leaders met with deputy transport minister Dikeledi Magazi and labour stakeholders. The meeting followed protest action in the morning over the employment of foreigners. The drivers were angry that local truck companies overlooked them in favour of foreign nationals. The meeting didn’t have favourable results.The drivers rejected the task team suggested by the deputy minister. Mandla Mngomezulu, secretary of All Truck Drivers Foundation in Gauteng, said: “The drivers said there was previously a task team which didn’t yield results.” Driver Michael Chaphole told Daily Sun: “We undergo road tests when looking for employment, which we pass, but a foreign driver gets the job.” He said they wanted companies to employ 80% local and 20% foreign drivers. Another driver, Skhumbuzo Lukhele, said: “We don’t have a problem with our foreign brothers working here. “We don’t want them to drive South African trucks while we don’t have jobs.” Meanwhile, the KZN transport department placed its law enforcement agencies on high alert in preparation for truck drivers blocking highways. Provincial spokeswoman Gugu Sisilane told Daily Sun Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli instructed police and traffic cops to be on high alert. The foundation’s Sifiso Nyathi said they decided to go back on strike after government failed to stop local companies from employing foreign drivers. “We’ve been talking to government for more than three years about this.” He said they were aware that employers obtained a court order preventing strikes.
