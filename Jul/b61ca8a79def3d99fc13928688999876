 LEGENDARY gospel singer Cyril "Ibhubesi laKwaMashu" Mbongwa has died.Mbongwa (61) passed away on Saturday at his home in KwaMashu, north of Durban, after a short illness.He has 10 hit albums under his belt. After releasing his tenth album Ngibize last year, the Umusa hit maker vowed he'd sing until his death. His sister Ntombi Khuzwayo told Daily Sun that Mbongwa had flu for two weeks. “After the flu he was attacked by asthma. On Friday he went to local clinic in KwaMashu and then died the following day,” she said. Mbongwa was infected with polio when he was four years old. Despite living with a disability, he was not ashamed of his condition and his confidence shone whenever he was on stage. His manager Xolani Majozi said he started his music journey in 1980, singing Umgqashiyo music with various bands. “He recorded his debut solo album in 1992 titled Silizwile Izwi Lakho. Mbongwa was also featured on the We Can Arts Festival Live In Concert CD and DVD, a first of its kind collaborative work of various musicians with disabilities released in November last year," he told the People's Paper. In 1994 the talented singer released his second album titled uJesu Nothando with his popular track, Kholwa Yizwi, which received a lot of airplay. He then released his third album called Thula Moya Wami which featured his hit track Izulu Yindawo Yokuphumula, which earned him the nickname “Ibhubesi laKwaMashu” because people said his unique voice sounded like a roaring lion. Mbongwa took a break from the music scene in 2014 after he released his ninth album titled Ngiyekhaya and his fans thought he was retired from music because of his age. But he surprised them when he returned with his latest 10-track album last year.
