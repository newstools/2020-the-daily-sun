Two ATMs that were bombed at Badplaas.       TWO suspects were remanded in custody after they appeared in the Middelburg Magistrates Court. They are expected to be back in court on 5 August for a bail hearing. One of the suspects is a South African National Defence Force member stationed in Middelburg. The two were allegedly part of a group of six heavily armed men who stormed into a filling station in Badplaas, held a security guard at gunpoint, and threatened to set him alight. They then bombed two ATMs before fleeing the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash on Monday. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the suspects were found at their hideouts at Mhluzi near Middelburg and were found in possession of explosives as well as stained money. “Police launched an intelligence-driven operation which led them to Mhluzi, where the suspects were nabbed. Both were charged with possession of explosives. “They will appear in court for the bombing of the ATMs in Badplaas and charges related to other robbery aggravated incidents,” he said. Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma lauded the police for the arrest and ordered them to investigate these cases thoroughly. “We believe the arrest of the two men is a great achievement and that more arrests are imminent,” said Zuma. Hlathi further said in the meantime, the police have launched a manhunt for the other suspects. He requested anyone with information on the suspects to contact Detective Warrant Officer Nkosinathi Ndaba on 082 318 9530.
