PREMIER Sihle Zikalala says KZN is now in the eye of the storm, speaking at a media briefing with health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu in Durban today. He said the province has now arrived at the point where almost everyone knew somebody infected with Covid-19. He said it was no longer a disease from a distance. “There is a total of 60 532 cases and 614 deaths. It is now our friends, colleagues, neighbours, brothers, mothers and sisters that have confirmed to us they have tested positive.” Zikalala said the storm could be seen through the number of infections. “It requires us to be more vigilant, and to adhere to regulations. It is very painful to see people falling sick, and sometimes even dying.” He said they hoped that even those in denial could now see Covid-19 was here and was deadly. “This is the time to start doing the right things, such as wearing of masks, washing our hands with soap, and social distancing.” Zikalala pleaded with residents to keep sticking to funeral regulations of no more than 50 attending. “Current protocols also state there should be even a lesser number at the burial site. This practice is against our spirit of ubuntu but it’s to keep ourselves safe.” The premier appealed to traditional leaders, councillors, ward committees, church leaders and izindunato help to tighten up measures at funerals. “We have also heard people say if a person goes to hospital, they will die. That is not true. We appeal to people to visit hospitals when they are sick. We have enough facilities to accommodate everyone,” Simelane-Zulu said many died at home and they have put out a number people could call when they wanted to get tested for Covid-19. “Some die as a person under investigation because they stay at home waiting for results. The number to call when they want to be tested is 033 847 6000.”
