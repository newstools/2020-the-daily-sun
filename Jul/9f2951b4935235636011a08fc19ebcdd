SAFA CEO Tebogo Motlanthe understands that the PSL is facing pressure from its stakeholders, but the association had to prioritise that referees must be fully fit before they can allow the season to conclude. The clubs and match officials have had no competitive action for four months due to the suspension of football because of coronavirus. Motlanthe said it was important for referees to be given time to get fit because the PSL, when it resumes, will be reaching the business end with so much at stake. The two football organisations have been at each other’s throats about the resumption of the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship that were suspended in mid-March following the outbreak of Covid-19. There have been allegations from clubs that Safa has been trying to delay the restart of the league. Last week, the PSL, after a joint liaison committee (JLC) meeting, wrote to Safa to say the league will resume on 18 July. Safa stated that cannot happen because referees are not fit and need to do fitness plus Covid-19 tests before they can enter the bio bubble in Gauteng, where the season will conclude. Safa wrote to the PSL to inform them the league will resume in the first week of August, assuring referees will be fit. Motlanthe said the PSL could have resumed a few days ago but Jerome Damon, who is a Fifa and Safa refereeing instructor, asked on behalf of referees to be given time to meet the PSL’s standards. “We can’t take that risk. “In Germany, when they restarted in June, referees were getting injured because they were not fit,” Motlanthe added.
