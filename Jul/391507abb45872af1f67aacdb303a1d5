OUT of the 37 referees who will officiate during the 2019-20 PSL resumption matches, three have tested positive for Covid-19. But Safa doctor Thulani Ngwenya said the referees were A-Symptomatic and showed no signs of infection. But Ngwenya said it's all systems go after the PSL announced that matches will restart on 8 August with the Nedbank Cup. The referees are in Joburg undergoing fitness tests and readying themselves for what will be a hectic schedule with matches played almost daily, including the GladAfrica Championship. Ngwenya said the three refs are in isolation until after the allotted 10 days when they will be tested again next week.   https://t.co/OyrK2TftzY
