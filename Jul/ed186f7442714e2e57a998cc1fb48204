EVERY morning, this mum gets up early as if she’s going to work. But she is unemployed. Her job is to take care of her son. “I have to help flush the waste out of his body every morning,” said the mum from Pimville, Soweto. “If I don’t do it, he’ll mess himself because he doesn’t know when it’s going to happen, whether it’s a number one or number two.” He was born without an anus. Doctors at Red Cross War Memorial Hospital made an alternative bypass for him to be able to pass the stools. The boy can’t urinate through his penis and a hole was made just below his belly button. “The boy always pees on himself. He can’t control it.  “I do the washing every day because I don’t want him to run out of clothes. “I used nappies before, but now that he’s growing up he doesn’t want that anymore.” She last went to the Red Cross Hospital in February 2018. She was told she’d be called to bring her son back for a follow-up examination. This would determine if they could close him up, so he could pee through his penis. She’s not been called and her attempts to get hold of the hospital have been unsuccessful. Spokesman Dwayne Evans said the boy was last seen at the hospital in March 2018. “Appointments are given in case medically required,” said Evans. “But if parents suspect the patient requires care they should follow up. “Parents call the clinic or visit the facility to request, confirm or change dates. “The parent may contact the facility to arrange a follow-up at the urology clinic.”
