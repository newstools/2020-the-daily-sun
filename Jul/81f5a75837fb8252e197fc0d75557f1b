NEW Bloemfontein Celtic coach John Maduka says the signs were there that he would become head coach of the club one day. The 49-year-old was confirmed as Siwelele’s head coach earlier this month, replacing Lehlohonolo Seema, who resigned to join Chippa United. Maduka’s elevation has seen him serve the club as team manager, assistant coach to Veselin Jelusic, Steve Komphela andco-coach with Seema. He’ll be assisted by Abram “Wire” Nteo. “Having assisted Jelusic and Steve, all those were signs that sooner or later I’d be a coach,” Maduka said. “I’ve learnt a lot from Steve and Veselin. I also learned when I was given an opportunity to work as a co-coach with Seema, after Steve left in December 2018. “You could tell that the chairman (Max Tshabalala) had a vision because he wanted people who played for the club, and now we are all coaching. “I’m honoured that management believed in me. I’m excited and looking forward to the task ahead. This is a big challenge but that’s how human beings grow,” he said. Maduka has been with the club for 16 years. He joined Celtic from Bush Bucks ahead of the 2004/05 season, making his debut against Black Leopards at Dr Molemela Stadium before retiring in 2009. During his playing days, he featured in 118 games and scored six goals. He was part of the side that claimed the SAA Supa 8 in the 2005/06 season under Paul Dolezar when they defeated SuperSport United 1-0. After his playing days were over, Maduka equipped himself. He holds a Safa Level 1 and the Caf A Licence. “Before we walk, we crawl. Before we crawl, we can’t see,” revealed Maduka. Said the former Malawi international: “The response from the players has been amazing.” “The boys are working very hard, the attitude is okay. I think that is because it is not like I’m a new man that is there, it is someone the players know.”
