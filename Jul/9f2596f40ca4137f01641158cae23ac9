By KGOMOTSO MEDUPE THE pensioners were excited to collect their grant money on Monday and rushed to the post office, but their happiness was short-lived. Harry Masalese (77) and his friend Kolobe Marumo (76) from Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, were devastated when they learnt they had been given fake notes. Harry said he noticed the money was fake when he went to buy bread at a local spaza shop. He had earlier bought fruit, but the woman selling it didn’t notice anything strange about his R100 note. “I then bumped into my friend who had also come to get his grant money. We wanted to go home quickly before we were robbed, but we stopped at the shop so I could buy bread,” he said. Harry said he couldn’t believe it when the shopkeeper told him his money was fake. He said he then took out all his money and found that all the notes were fake. He immediately went back to the post office. “When I got there I showed them the money, but they told me I didn’t get the money from them, so they couldn’t help me. I even showed them the slip they gave me, but it didn’t help,” he said. Kolobe said he went home and showed his money to his grandson. “We noticed the money didn’t have the face of Mandela,” he said. The two madalas said they didn’t know what to do because the money was supposed to help them buy groceries and pay their debts. Gauteng police spokesman Mavela Masondo advised the madalas to go to the nearest police station. Daily Sun sent an enquiry to Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi, who had not responded at the time of going to print.
