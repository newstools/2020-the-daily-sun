PHUMLA Maduma lost her husband in December after they had just been evicted from their home. After his death, the 44-year-old mother of five bought a shack and piece of land in Skierlik squatter camp near Lethabong, Tshwane. But she realised she was scammed when the shack and piece of land never materialised. A Good Samaritan then offered the family a shack, but it was torched in February while they were asleep. She and her kids managed to escape, but they couldn’t save anything from the fire. A pastor in her kasi then donated a piece of land and a shack to the family. Phumla said she was relieved to have a place she could call home. “I’m poor and was still hurting as my husband had just died, but I was out in the streets with no home. The church came through for me when I had lost all hope.” She said having her own place gave her peace. She recently bought another shack. “The shack we live in is very small. I sleep with two of my kids on the bed, while two sleep on the floor. It has a bedroom, kitchen and bathroom,” she said. Phumla said social distancing was a dream for her family. “Two of my kids go to school while two go out to look for work. They might be exposed out there,” she said. She said although she bought a shack, finishing it was impossible. “I don’t have money to buy iron sheets for the roof, a window and door. It might take me a year to complete,” she said. Phumla pleaded with SunReaders for help. “Someone out there might have a door they no longer need. I would appreciate any kind of donation to help finish my shack,” she said.
