THE Department of Basic Education is preparing for the return of grades 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 11 pupils on 6 July. But parents at Thopodi Primary School in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said this won’t happen. They said their kids won’t return to cold classrooms and stopped grade 7 pupils from going to school. The school has no glass windows as some were destroyed by vandals during lockdown. “The classrooms are cold and kids aren’t maintaining social distancing as required by Covid-19 regulations,” said parent Thembalethu Mnyamane. What angered the parents most was that the school wanted them to donate money to replace the broken windows. They protested outside the school, saying their kids would not return. “It’s lockdown and we hear the virus gets worse in winter. With broken windows, we are sending our kids to get the virus because they’ll be learning in a cold environment,” said Magdeline Mtswene (36). Jocelyn Ntambo (45) said: “We hear on TV how far the virus is spreading. “We’re not going to allow our kids to return to school unless government promises to come up with measures to protect them.” Gauteng education officials, who were at the school to calm the situation, promised it would be resolved.
