RELEGATION threatened Polokwane City head coach Clinton Larsen is keeping his fingers crossed with the hope that his team’s Covid-19 test results will return negative today. Rise and Shine players and technical staff underwent Covid-19 tests on Monday and their results are expected this afternoon. “I am praying that all the boys will be negative,” said Larsen. Larsen needs all his players for City’s battle against relegation where they are now sitting at an uncomfortable 14th place on the log with 23 points – with six games remaining. They have acquired the same points as second from bottom AmaZulu. The Limpopo side are only three points ahead of bottom outfit Black Leopards, but Larsen made it clear that his team are not going down. “It would be a huge setback for us if some players or staff test positive,” stressed Larsen. “We are expected to return to training soon and you would love to have all your players back after three months of having been separated because of the lockdown. “As a coach you would love to work with all players to try to get them fit as fast as you can. If someone tests positive, then they will have go for quarantine for two weeks.” He added: “This virus is serious and you can see how many people have been infected and are dying on a daily basis. “So we are praying and we will see today when we get our results.” Other Premiership teams like Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates have had some of their players testing positive. Larsen said he is excited to start training with his boys and his technical team as they have been working alone from home since mid-March when the PSL suspended football. “We will follow the protocol we will be given by the PSL,” said Larsen. “I think we will be training as a group like how it has been done in the European leagues. Some might be training individually. “So it’s promising that football will be back and we will finish the season.
