A 14-year-old teenage boy has been arrested after he allegedly
raped a one-year-old and a five-year-old in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg. According to the police, the teen
was arrested after a rape case was opened at the Plessislaer Family Violence,
Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit. "It is alleged that two siblings aged one and five were raped by a
14-year-old boy at Imbali location," police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka
Mbele said on Wednesday. At first, the police did not
arrest the teenage boy, saying that he was a minor. However, Mbele confirmed he was later arrested. In an unrelated case, a
17-year-old was arrested last week following the rape of a 12-year-old Grade 7
pupil in Bulwer, KwaZulu-Natal. The young girl was reportedly
turned away from a screening point at a school in order to go back home and
fetch her face mask. Upon returning, she informed her teachers that she had
been raped. Basic Education Minister Angie
Motshekga demanded severe punishment for the 17-year-old accused.  https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/maritzburg-teen-arrested-for-rapes-of-1-year-old-5-year-old-20200715
