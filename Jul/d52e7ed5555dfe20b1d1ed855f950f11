AYANDA Patosi says coach Benni McCarthy played a crucial role to bring him down to earth. The 27-year-old midfielder revealed that he was big-headed when he joined Cape Town City in 2017 from Belgian side Lokeren. Patosi is currently playing for Iranian Pro League side Foolad on loan from The Citizens until the end of season. McCarthy was unveiled as City coach in June 2017 and he was shown the door in November last year, due to a string of poor results. “Benni is a great coach,” he told SunSport through the SA Football Journalists Association (Safja) via a Zoom call. “He helped young players like Seedat (Ebrahim) and me. I was not friendly. I didn’t work well with him. I knew him from Belgium as an assistant coach. “But on my side I thought in the PSL it will be easy. I didn’t work that much to give him confidence (to select me), and I did my own thing on the side because I was coming from Belgium.” Patosi said having bad influence off the pitch had a negative impact on his career. He went on: “I started not getting focused. I had new friends and I didn’t realise that Benni was trying to help me become a better player.” Patosi said City boss John Comitis also intervened when he noticed that his career was going down the drain. “At some point, I realised that I was wrong. I spoke to Benni and John. “I realised that I was not in Cape Town for a holiday, but I was there to work. I could not do what I wanted and expect to be fielded.” Patosi’s change of attitude also helped The Citizens lift the MTN8 Cup. “We worked well together, played two finals (MTN8 runners up 2017 and winners in 2018). Benni is a good coach and he doesn’t give a s**t if you are a star or a big player. If you get things wrong, he will tell you s**t. “Off the field, he is a very nice guy, but on it he is a different person. It doesn’t matter if you are Ayanda or Teko (Modise). If a player can’t perform, he doesn’t mind to put you on the bench. Everyone worked for him and we got the results.”
