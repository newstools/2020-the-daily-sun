A
41-year-old Anglican Church of Southern Africa pastor was shot and killed. Pastor
Sandiso Sithole who was based at Hambanathi township’s church mission in
Tongaat south of Durban was shot while entering his mission house last night. Church
spokesman Ndabezinhle Sibisi told Daily Sun today he received the call last
night informing him about the pastor’s murder. He
said it looks like the man had waited for him and the gate because he was shot
trying to open his house door. Sibisi
said the pastor’s death sent shock waves among the church members and left them
confused because two weeks back they buried his wife Nomthandazo Sithole (41)
who was found dead in her car at Eshowe northern KZN. She
was a teacher at Qinisweni Primary School in Inanda north of Durban at the time
of her death. “We
are still shocked at their killings. We are asking ourselves what is going on,”
said Sibisi. He
said the couple was originally from Melmoth northern KZN, but they were based
at Tongaat's mission for church’s work. Cops
spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder has been opened at
Tongaat police station. She
said the man was shot in the head around 8 pm last night at his mission house. Attempts
to get the pastor’s family failed. Sibisi said he was planning to visit the
mission tomorrow.
