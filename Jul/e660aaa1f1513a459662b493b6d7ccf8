Bafana Bafana international Lebogang Phiri has shed some light on the rumours linking him with a move to Turkish Super Lig side Trabzonspor. Currently on the books of Ligue 2 side EA Guingamp, the midfielder's exploits in the cancelled French season have not gone unnoticed, with French clubs Nimes Olympique, RC Strasbourg and Stade Brestois, as well as Trabzonspor reportedly interested in his services. As per a report by Fotospor, Phiri has been earmarked as a possible replacement for former Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel at Trabzonspor, who left the club earlier this year. "When I signed that four-year contract [with Guingamp], I told myself I'll be dedicated for the next four years to this team and make sure they get the best of me and doing so I can improve myself," Phiri told Carol Tshabalala on an Instagram Live interview. "I've had Strasbourg, Trabzonspor, I had Brest recently, Nimes were interested. But I'm not one to fight over club's coming to me because I've pushed and done so much for you but on the other hand I've received a lot too." With one year left on his contract at Guingamp, the former Bidvest Wits academy player hopes to have talks with the club's management over his future soon. "So, I'm going to respect you if you respect me but if that doesn't happen [anymore] that's when I will consider moving. Until then I feel Guimgamp have done an exceptional job grooming Lebogang Phiri to who he is today," he added. "I appreciate that and respect it, but with a year left I need to discuss my future in the board room [soon]." Phiri made 25 appearances in Ligue 2 this past season as was appointed as the club captain midway through the campaign. - TEAMtalk media
