Following the much talked about abuse claims between TV star Phelo Bala and Moshe Ndiki, Phelo has responded to the Sunday Sun article, saying Moshe lied about being with him when called for comment and that he's not his Phelo. "The first lie was that 'we are together when you got the call from the paper'. The second is that I am 'your Phelo'. I can’t afford a PR spin so I’ll leave it with this: The fact that the truth is complex is not an excuse to resort to comfortable lies. Lies can disguise themselves as truth but eventually, the truth comes to light," he tweeted in response to Moshe Ndiki's statement. READ MOSHE'S STATEMENT BELOW: STATEMENT: pic.twitter.com/fUkwtPAelc
