A 41-year-old woman has been applauded for her
"bravery" after she overpowered and caught her alleged rapist. According to Eastern Cape police, the woman was jogging at around 06:00 in
Ngqeleni on Sunday and, while making her way back home, the man grabbed her and
dragged her to nearby a "donga" (gully). It is alleged that he raped her
in Buntingville, Ngqeleni, andÂ threatened to kill her. "It is further alleged that after the suspect finished raping her, she
managed to overpower him and called her brothers to her rescue," police
spokesperson Captain Dineo Koena said in a statement. "The suspect was apprehended
and later handed over to police," said Koena. The 21-year-old man appeared in
the Ngqeleni Magistrate's Court on Monday for rape. District commissioner, Major
General David Kanuka, applauded the woman's bravery and said the man's release
on bail should be opposed.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/woman-overpowers-alleged-rapist-hands-him-over-to-eastern-cape-cops-20200714
