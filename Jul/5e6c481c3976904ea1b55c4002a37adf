ON Friday morning, gogo Mirriam Martin woke up before dawn to read her Bible as she normally did. But there was load shedding, so she used a candle. But the 84-year-old struggle stalwart apparently dozed off and left the candle unattended. The candle is suspected to have caused the fire that killed her in her home in Meadowlands, Soweto. Gogo Mirriam’s brother, Elijah Ngakane (80), told Daily Sun he was shocked by what he found at the scene. “I went in there and what I saw was worse than cremation. Only the steel was left, everything else was burnt down,” he said. Elijah said a grandson who lived with gogo smelled smoke from his room.  He tried to open his gogo’s bedroom door, but it was locked. “He banged on the door, but his granny had locked it and he couldn’t go in. “He went around looking for help from the neighbours. “The door only fell after it was damaged by the fire. “The fire department was called, but it was already too late when they got here,” he said. As if that was not enough pain for the family, gogo Mirriam’s other brother Bogatsu (67) also died on the same day. The family received news that he died from heart failure.  “His health deteriorated after the announcement of his sister’s passing. We are devastated beyond words,” said relative Moemisi Motsepe. On the part gogo Mirriam played during the struggle, Elijah said she used to help the ANC youth sneak out of the country to go into exile. “Our uncle lived in Zambia. My sister used to be in contact with him during the struggle to help ANC people who ran out of the country. That was the key role she played in the ANC,” he said. Elijah described his sister as polite, sociable and accommodating.
