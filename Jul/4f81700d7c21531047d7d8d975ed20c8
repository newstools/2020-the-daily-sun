Scientists have discovered that there is marriage between sex and music. According to them, the same chemical system in the brain that produces feelings of pleasure as a result of having sex, taking recreational drugs or eating tasty food is also stimulated by listening to a favorite tune. The researchers said the ability of music to affect our emotions so strongly suggested humans have evolved over a long period to like it. Since the coronavirus global outbreak, football and many other sporting codes have been forced to play behind closed doors as a precautionary measure. Many sportsmen and women have admitted to struggling to perform at their ultimate best without their fans, and that is the same effect music has during sex. So which songs do people have sex to?
