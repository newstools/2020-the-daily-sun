IT’S been seven years since former president Nelson Mandela died. And the world has always celebrated his birthday on 18 July, which has come to be known as Mandela Day. But the coronavirus outbreak has put a halt to all celebrations. It has also robbed South Africans of the opportunity to bid farewell to Madiba’s daughter Zindzi Mandela, who will be buried today. Every year, the Nelson Mandela Foundation holds a memorial lecture to honour his legacy. At these lectures, world leaders would be invited to share their thoughts and experiences of what Madiba meant to the world. One of the most recent world leaders to do so was former US president Barack Obama. In keeping with the new normal due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the foundation said United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres will deliver this year’s lecture virtually under the theme: “The inequality pandemic: The new social contract for a new era.” The foundation said the lecture will be streamed live from New York in the US. In a video clip, Guterres said he was honoured to deliver the lecture. He described Madiba as a moral giant of the 20th century. “His timeless legacy continues to guide us in the 21st century. “For me, he was also a profound personal inspiration of justice, dignity and inequality. “This year’s lecture takes place at a time when the world faces an unprecedented test as the Covid-19 pandemic threatens everyone everywhere,” said Guterres. “The world must unite to protect lives and ease suffering.” However, the ANC has not released any programmes to mark this year’s commemoration.
