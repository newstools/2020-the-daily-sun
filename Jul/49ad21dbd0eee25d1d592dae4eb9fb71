 A motorist was
hijacked on Sparks Road in Overport by three unknown armed men. Cops and a private
security company were alerted once the carjacking was reported, a chase ensued
towards Jan Smuts Avenue and there was a shoot-out between the suspects and
police. Police spokesperson
Captain Nqobile Gwala said during the shootout, the suspects lost control of
the car and crashed into cars parked on the side of the road. Gwala said they then
abandoned the car on Jan Smuts Avenue and Chapel Drive and fled on foot. “Initial
investigations conducted on the scene revealed that one of the suspects was
injured. A 23-year-old suspect was located at a local hospital where he was
being treated for gunshot wounds. “He was positively
identified and linked to the case. The suspect remains under police guard
whilst at the hospital. He will appear before the Durban Magistrate’s Court for
carjacking once he is discharged from the hospital. “Criminals should know
that police officers are stationed strategically to respond to reports of
criminality in our province. I am confident that the outstanding suspects who
managed to evade arrest will be caught soon as our investigations continue,”
KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula
said.
