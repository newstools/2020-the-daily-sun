"We have to thank the PSL and Safa for making this possible. Covid-19 has been wreaking havoc but at some point life has to continue." Mamelodi Sundowns supporter Bullie James said she is confident that the Brazilians will do what they do best and clinch their record tenth league title. "It is sad that we can't be in the stadium but that will not stop us from supporting our team. The boys will feel our presence and that will inspire them to make history." Mama Joy Chauke, who has been battling Covid-19, said it was for the best that fans are not allowed to attend matches for now. Said Mama Joy: "Just imagine if we were allowed in Stadium, how many fans would get infected? I think it's for our own safey because this virus is very dangerous."
