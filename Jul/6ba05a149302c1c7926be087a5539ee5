RESIDENTS of Mooiplaas near Centurion, Tshwane, claimed the contractor of Mamfaze K Carrim building construction has not paid them since lockdown started. The residents have been working for the contractor and developer. They took to the streets yesterday and marched to the house of one of the developers to demand their four-month salaries. The residents said they had been living off food parcels and donations from government, as they had no money to provide for themselves. They delivered a memorandum of their grievances to the developer, Zaeed Carrim, and demanded he pay them as soon as possible. One of the angry residents and employee said they waited outside the construction site every morning, with the hope they’d get paid. He said the community was happy when the project came to the kasi, as they knew it would help them. “Everything was going well before lockdown started. We were paid on time, but we don’t even remember when we last had money in our bank accounts,” he said. Community liaison officer Simon Sithole said all they were asking for was payment for work done. “We spent four full months without our money while we worked on your site,” he said. “We realise you can’t be trusted. “We also request our retention along with all our outstanding amounts.” They said they gave Carrim a week to respond. Carrim said they were not responsible for paying workers, because they were employed by their subcontractors. “The matter is currently in court. “We can’t say much about it.”
