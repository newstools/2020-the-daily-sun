 Prices of
the BMW e30 generation seem to be skyrocketing. Well, not
every Gusheshe out there is worth paying R4 million for, but this new owner did
– in South Africa never brought the E30 M3 here but to compensate for that it
gave us the legendary E30 325is. These cars
have become classic collectors’ items and their prices have also gone up north. The
American buyer spent 250 000 US Dollars for the 1988 BMW M3 that has just 13
000 KM and is finished in Zinnoberrot over tan. According
to BringaTrailer.com the car is said to have been sold new in California and
remained with the original owner until his passing in the mid-1990s. It was then
garaged and driven occasionally by the original owner’s family before being
acquired by the seller in 2010 and moved to Missouri.
