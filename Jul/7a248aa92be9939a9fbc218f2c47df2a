BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have moved swiftly to appoint John Maduka as head coach. Maduka takes over from Lehlohonolo Seema who has since joined Chippa United after resigning from the club on Monday. Seema has joined Chippa United on a three year contract. Celtic have also confirmed the promotion of Abram "Wire" Nteo as Maduka's assistant, with Simon Gopane remaining as goalkeeper coach. In a statement, the Celtic trio will work together for the remainder of the season. "They all got a good working relationship, as they played together at the club. Nteo was the MDC coach and they have previously promoted players from the MDC to the senior team," said the club in a statement. Celtic are currently under financial strain which has led club chairman, Max Tshabalala, putting up the "For Sale" boards in front of the club's offices. Players and staff have gone for months without salaries while on better days they will receive half of their pay. ????? Urgent Communication#LoveSiwelele????? pic.twitter.com/PUObumG11q
