Bishop Israel Makamu has tested positive for
COVID-19. He received his results this morning after a
few days of not feeling well. He told Daily Sun that he's been on
self-isolation and is feeling a bit better. "This thing hurts, my body was just
fatigued and had other symptoms. I'm feeling much better now and want people to
know that this is real, and they should really take this seriously," he
said. He also told Daily Sun that he's been taking
home remedies and some medication to help him get better. "My wife has been giving me that garlic,
lemon, and ginger mixture. I also steam a lot and it has really helped
me," said Makamu. He encouraged people to adhere to lockdown
rules and regulations. "Some people are walking around without
masks, this is very dangerous plus you never really know where you'll get
it," he said. "I have a funeral parlor and it hurts so
much to take a body straight to the graveyard. Please stay safe," said
Makamu.
