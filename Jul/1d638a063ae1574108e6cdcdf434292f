Star Springbok wing Cheslin Kolbe has signed with rapper and producer Jay-Z's prestigious Roc Nation Sports management company. Kolbe follows in the footsteps of Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, who signed with the company after South Africa won the 2019 Rugby World Cup."Cheslin's desire to prove wrong all those who told him that it would be impossible to succeed in rugby because of his size led him to the top," Roc Nation Sports boss Michael Yormark told French sports daily L'Equipe."It is an example of what you can achieve through desire and fits our spirit perfectly."Kolbe, who stands just 1.71m and 80kg, has played 14 Tests for the Springboks and scored eight tries, including one in the 32-12 Rugby World Cup final win over England in Yokohama. The 26-year-old, who plies his trade at French club Toulouse, said he learned about Jay-Z's vision and philosophy for Roc Nation Sports. "It's to improve the lives of people, especially those of athletes who often earn a lot of money at a very young age and then have no one, or not the right people, to guide them and help them invest in the future. Roc Nation is really there to create a context of success for the sportsman and his family,"Kolbe said. -SPORT24
