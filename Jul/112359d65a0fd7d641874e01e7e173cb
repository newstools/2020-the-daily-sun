ZIMBABWE-BORN Afro jazz artist Bothwell Nkomo has a spiritual connection with Mzansi music. The rhythm kept calling him until he took a bus to Mzansi 12 years ago. Bekezela, as he’s known in the music industry, came to Mzansi after graduating from art school. “It was the beginning of the economic meltdown after sanctions were imposed on Zimbabwe. “Inflation was rising by the hour. It was bad and the only thing I wanted to do was to tell stories musically and Mzansi was my only hope.” He looked up to Ringo Madlingozi and had always wanted to meet him. “It took me a year to meet him, and he advised me to be myself and learn my craft to become the best.” His music journey wasn’t as easy as he thought it would be. He worked as a cleaner in a hotel in Berea, Joburg. One day, as he was taking the bin out, he realised there was a recording studio at the hotel basement. “This is where I met my producer, Papy Nsenga, whom I still work with.” Bekezela quit his job to go and dig trenches. “One day at work, a melody came to me,” said the guitarist. “I stopped digging and recorded it on my phone and immediately called Papy, who called me to the studio and recorded my first single, Bekezela.” His new single Phumelela, released last month, features 18 artists from Africa. “I have Candy Tsa Mandebele from Mzansi, Lawi from Malawi, Aki Nwale from Nigeria and duo KhoiSan from Botswana.”
