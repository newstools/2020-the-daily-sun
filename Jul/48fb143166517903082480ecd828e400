By KGALALELO TLHOAELE HE was sad when he lost his wife last month. But he will now be reunited with her. France Thubagale from Makapanstad in the North West died on Monday. His family said he was never the same after his wife of 13 years, Mantsho Malimo (54), died. And as she was buried elsewhere, France (52) buried her clothes instead. The People’s Paper published his story on 8 June, headlined: “I buried my wife’s clothes.” When Daily Sun visited France’s family, they said they didn’t want to talk about their loss. “We are scared we might follow him because he was always following up on his wife’s burial,” said a relative. “France didn’t take his wife’s burial well. He was always stressed since the day of the funeral. “He didn’t take it well and it broke his heart. He always told us how much he didn’t deserve not to bury his wife.” France’s mum said she also lost her daughter. “I’m only left with one son. It’s sad and heartbreaking, but God borrowed and took them from me. All I can say is that it’s okay. I can’t throw myself on the floor because it’s okay,” she said. Before France died, he told Daily Sun he was going to erect a tombstone for his wife. “When my wife died, we were still in love. We never fought and I wouldn’t let anyone come between us. We always joked together and would never fight, even for a day,” he said.
