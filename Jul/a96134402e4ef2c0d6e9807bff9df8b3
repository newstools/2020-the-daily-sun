POWERFUL winger Kgaogelo Sekgota will leave Bidvest Wits at the end of this suspended season and return to Portuguese side Vitoria Setubal. Sekgota, who was born in Seshego in Polokwane, joined Wits during the January transfer window on loan from Setubal. When the deal between the two parties was struck, the Clever Boys were given an option to sign him permanently, provided that he impresses coach Gavin Hunt. The 23-year-old, who was part of Bafana Bafana’s Cosafa Cup squad in Durban last year, has lived up to the required demands of Hunt and the former Black Leopards mentor was keen to sign him at the end of the season. Sadly, that agreement has been revoked since Wits will be under new management next season. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila boss Masala Mulaudzi bought the Premiership status of Wits. This means Wits, one of the giants and oldest clubs in Mzansi who were set to celebrate their centenary next year, will cease to exist at the end of this suspended season. “He (Sekgota) will go back to Setubal in Portugal. He still has a two-year contract with one year option there,” said the player’s agent Bally Smart. Sekgota had featured in seven games in all competitions before the season was halted in mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Smart said, despite things looking easy for Sekgota to play in front of his home fans in Limpopo, TTM couldn’t meet his required package. “No, TTM can’t afford to buy him.”
