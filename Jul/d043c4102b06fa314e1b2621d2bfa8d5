AN EIGHT-month-old baby was amongst the four family members who tragically burnt to death in a house fire. Three children Enzokuhle Mabaso, Xolisile Mabaso (7) and Angel Mabaso (10) along with their gogo Philisile Hlubi (58) from Zakheni in Ladysmith, south of KZN, tragically died when their home was engulfed by flames yesterday. The children died at the scene and their gogo died in the evening in hospital.  Only one child, Sekwanele Mabaso (12), is fighting for his life in hospital as he sustained burn injuries. It's still not clear what triggered the raging flames that took the children's lives. Family member Mdu Mabaso (39) said the five were sleeping when the fire began. He said the fire came from one of the bedrooms and it's suspected that it was caused by an electrical fault. "The children stayed with our mother at the house. So all five of them were in the house when this happened," he said. He said these were his sister's children and she isn't taking this well. "My sister has been rushed to hospital as she is in great shock after this tragedy," he said. The KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka said: "We are shattered to lose children in this manner. A thorough investigation will be conducted by the disaster management teams around the circumstances of this tragedy." He said the department is also coordinating relief for the family as they deal with the tragedy. The KZN cops spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said four inquest dockets have been opened. Gwala said the cause of fire is still unknown.
