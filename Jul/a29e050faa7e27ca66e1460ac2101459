 TWO suspects are behind bars after a misleading
attempted car hijacking. The two suspects aged 35 and 36 told a story that
has now put them in jail after they were arrested for murder and perjury at
Johannesburg Central Police Station. Speaking to Daily Sun, the Johannesburg Central
SAPS spokesman, Captain Xoli Mbele said it's alleged that the suspect who was
driving a white VW Polo shot and killed a 25-year-old man at the corner of
Eloff and Sallisbury Street on the 11th of July at approximately 7 pm. Mbele said the suspect was with his friend when
they approached four males who were walking on the streets asking for
directions. "One of the pedestrians gave them directions
while his friends waited for him at the corner of the street. They saw a driver
coming out of the vehicle and fired one shot," said Mbele. "Their friend fell on the street and the
passenger inside the car jumped out and removed the rear registration of a
vehicle before they fled the scene," he added. Paramedics arrived and he was declared dead on the
scene. Mbele said the suspects decided to open an
attempted car hijacking case. "He told the police that some pedestrians
fired shots at him including the deceased," he said. An investigating officer went to view CCTV video
footage which indicated that none of what they said was true. "They've been arrested and will appear in
court soon," said Mbele.
