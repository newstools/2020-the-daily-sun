Cricket South Africa (CSA) have responded to the latest developments in the country regarding the Black Lives Matter campaign. Earlier this month, Proteas fast bowler Lungi Ngidi stated that he would educate and address the Black Lives Matter movement in Proteas the dressing room. This led to highly-criticised social media posts written by former South African cricketers Rudi Steyn, Pat Symcox and Boeta Dippenaar and, since then, 30 former Proteas - all players of colour - and five coaches signed and expressed their support for Ngidi and the Black Lives Matter movement.Last week, former Proteas fast bowler Makhaya Ntini appeared on SABC's Morning Live and revealed that he often felt lonely throughout his international career.On Friday evening, CSA stated in a press release that the "national outcry by cricket fans, the greater South African public and broad stakeholder groups could not be ignored".CSA confirmed that the Transformation Committee of the Board developed a sustainable response strategy.
