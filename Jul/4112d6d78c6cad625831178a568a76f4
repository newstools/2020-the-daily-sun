MARY Mtsweni is very worried after the suspect in the murder case of her two-month-old granddaughter was released on bail two weeks ago, saying the justice system compromised the safety of her daughter Pearl Mtsweni (22). The 43-year-old gogo from Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga was relieved when her daughter was admitted to a psychiatric centre because at least she was safe there. Mary said she was trying to find help to get the bail revoked and her daughter has been to hospital at least five times since her baby’s murder “The system has failed me and my family, but I will never rest until justice has been properly served. I am in severe pain after I lost my first grandchild. The court has given the suspect bail and that puts the life of my daughter at great risk. He’s now communicating with her through WhatsApp, saying he still loves her and wants them to meet and also misses her a lot. “He also tried to kill her after killing her baby. My daughter has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder since she witnessed her baby being killed. “Now she will suffer another relapse. “She has been in and out of hospital, and I am spending lots of money to get her help. Right now she is in the loony bin and I am not happy, but she is safe there. The killer is out there and who knows what he’s planning to do to my daughter, since she is the only state witness. He knows if my daughter is out of the way, the case will be closed.” Mary said Kwamhlanga Magistrates Court gave the 27-year-old suspect bail after he throttled his own two-month-old baby daughter and used a bottle to cut her throat at his rented house on 28 January. But she is even more worried that he also tried to kill her daughter Pearl.
