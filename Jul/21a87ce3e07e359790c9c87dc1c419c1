Lazarous Kambole is confident that Kaizer Chiefs will pick up where they left off and lift the 2019/20 Absa Premiership trophy. Amakhosi entered the enforced break, as a result of the coronavirus, on top of the league standings. Mamelodi Sundowns are hot on their heels, just four points adrift and with a game in hand, but Kambole says Chiefs "know how to handle the challenge". Speaking to the Chiefs' official website, the Zambian international, who joined the club at the start of the season from Zesco United, revealed his delight at returning to training. He said: "We are doing well as a team and personally, I feel good. Training has been fantastic this week and I am very much enjoying being back. "It's good to be back - we missed football. I missed my teammates, so it's good to be around them again. Itâ€™s fantastic to be doing what we enjoy and that is playing football." Kambole continued: "I am putting in a lot of hard work looking and forward to resuming play again. As a team, we are on right track and we are doing a lot to ensure that we will be ready when we play our first game. "We are professionals and we know how to handle the challenges that lie ahead."
