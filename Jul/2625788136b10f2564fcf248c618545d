ALL 16 members of the Free State School of Nursing management team have contracted Covid-19. The health department said they have sent all the staff for isolation and as from yesterday, all campuses in Bloemfontein have been put on recess for two weeks. One staff member wished the testing system could change. “I think the best way to beat the virus is to do testing. Screening is not helping because people tell lies. I know someone who wanted to test, but was told it was not necessary. The person ended up telling lies while screening and was taken for testing. The results came back positive.” Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said: “The entire 16- member nursing school management team has been affected by Covid-19. These members have been sent for self-isolation. The campus community was informed and contact tracing initiated.” The department is thinking of putting all nursing school campuses on recess for two weeks while all the affected personnel recovers. Mvambi said: “We are busy with risk assessment to determine who can be safely sent home if conditions are good, and who can be sent for isolation and quarantine. The Mangaung Metro health district manager is following up for final determination. It is unfortunate panicking students have already spoken to the media to portray a picture that they were evicted from the campus.” Mvambi said by Thursday, there were 986 new cases, 372 in the Mangaung Metro, 129 in Fezile Dabi, 155 in Thabo Mofutsanyana, 288 in Lejweleputswa, 35 in Xhariep and seven in unknown districts. “The total confirmed Covid-19 cases in the province is 12 332, with 1 821 (15%) recoveries,” he said.
