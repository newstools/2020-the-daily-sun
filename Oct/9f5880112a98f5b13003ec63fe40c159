DESPITE the fact that the KZN ANC deputy chairman is facing money laundering and corruption charges, he has been reinstated. The ANC deputy chairman Mike Mabuyakhulu was reinstated by the Provincial Integrity Committee (PIC) as they said he showed remorse over the damage to the ANC brand due to the matter hanging over him. Provincial ANC spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela told Daily Sun the PEC meeting last Friday received a report from the PIC which had sat during the previous two weeks. According to Ntombela, the PIC said comrade Mabuyakhulu was open and honest in his engagement with them in explaining his matter. “Secondly, that he did not avail himself for the election to the Legislature in 2019 because of the cloud still hanging over his head,” he said. He said that he also requested to recuse himself from structures till he appeared in front of the integrity committee. “He showed remorse over the damage to the ANC brand because of the matter hanging over him. So they resolved he be reinstated, but not on government responsibilities, while awaiting NEC guidelines on stepping aside,” said Ntombela. Mabuyakhulu and former eThekwini municipality mayor Zandile Gumede were ordered to step aside in August. Both are facing corruption charges and have appeared before the ANC’s PIC. Mabuyakhulu is facing charges of corruption over a R28 million North Sea Jazz Festival tender.
