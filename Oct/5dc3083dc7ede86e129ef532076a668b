TWO maskandi artists, Njoko and Mzukulu, were involved in a car accident on Sunday night. Njoko said they were coming back from Pretoria and on their way to perform at Endaweni Ultra Lounge in Vosloorus. “We were going to Endaweni Ultra Lounge in Vosloorus. The car was driven by Mzukulu’s brother, Ntobeko Zulu. I don’t now what happened but all I can remember is that we were hit by an ambulance. As I’m speaking with you, I’m in hospital with a fractured arm and shoulder. I’m not sure when I’ll be discharged, but the pain has gone down and I am grateful that I didn’t die in that accident,” said Njoko. He said the accident nearly dashed his plans of releasing an album. “My album is scheduled to be released by end of this month. Everything is done except the title. As soon I am out of hospital, I’ll continue with the album and release it as scheduled,” said Njoko. Mzukulu said he sustained minor injuries in the head. “We were driving a Golf 6. I don’t know how it happened but I remember seeing an ambulance coming in our direction. For a minute I was unconscious. I only gained my conscious after the accident. Fortunately my brother and I were not badly injured. My brother has minor bruises and I sustained minor injuries in the head. It could’ve been worse, but we survived. That’s all that matters right now,” said Mzukulu. He said the case was opened at Vosloorus Police Station. “Unfortunately, we haven’t received the case number for the accident. We hope to get it today,” said Mzukulu. The accident left the maskandi world shaken, as photos of the car started circulating on social media platforms. But on Monday morning, Mzukulu assured maskandi fans via his Facebook page that they are fine.
