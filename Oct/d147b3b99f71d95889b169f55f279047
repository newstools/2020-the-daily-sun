WHILE we know we have to wash our hands regularly to get rid of bacteria and germs, it turns out we have to clean our rings as often too. A new study has analysed the cleanliness of three jewellery pieces that were worn for a week and the results were shocking. The study revealed that collectively, the ring, watch and earrings gathered 428 times more germs than a toilet seat in seven days. The research was done by British pre-owned jewellery and watch specialists, Est1897. The experiment found that just over 21 000 growths of bacteria had manifested on the jewellery over a week. The study also found that the jewellery contained everything from the extremely dangerous Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) to Diptheria. Research found that after just one week of wearing it, the ring collected five of the nastiest bacterial species. A total of 504 bacterial colonies, one fungus colony and one black mould colony were found on the ring. Exposure to this can cause dry scaly skin, skin rashes and other issues.
