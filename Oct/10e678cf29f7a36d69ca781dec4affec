AFFORDABLE dupes have always been a way for regular people who can’t afford expensive brands to stay on trend and in style. In Mzansi, MRP is that one retailer that always comes through for the people. MRP always trends for being the go-to store for cheaper, on-trend fashion and beauty items. Let’s look at five times the retailer duped expensive brands: 1. Double strap slip-on mule – These mules retail for R1 299 on Superbalist and MRP has them for only R159.99.  2. Ankle boots with track heels – The track heels retail for R759 on a higher LSM market but MRP dupes go for R249.99.  3.
