FOUR Gauteng hospitals have had rape incidents in a matter of weeks. All the incidents involve male psychiatric patients. The latest incident occurred at Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital on Saturday. According to DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom, a 16-year-old psychiatric patient was raped by another patient at the hospital in Soweto. The victim was taken to Nthabiseng Rape Centre at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. “This is the 11th violent incident at Bheki Mlangeni since the beginning of the year. “Yet CEO Ruth Mabyana has been allowed to return to her post despite being initially put on precautionary suspension while investigations continued.” Bloom claimed staff were concerned that hospital management would cover up the incident. “In my view, Mabyana is the worst hospital CEO in Gauteng and should have been removed long ago after scandals that include a string of violent assaults on patients and staff, as well as a jobs-for-sale scandal.” He said new management was needed urgently to ensure patients and staff were in a safe environment. The incident follows recent rape allegations at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital, Tara Psychiatric Hospital and Stanza Bopape Clinic in Tshwane. Health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said acting health MEC Jacob Mamabolo has set up a team to investigate the rape incident. Police had been notified. “I want to reassure the public that the issue of safety at public facilities is a priority,’’she said. “We’ll continue to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure preventative and response measures.” The patient and family were provided with psychological support.
