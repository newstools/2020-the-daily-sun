SASSA, in partnership with the National Development Agency in Mpumalanga, is giving unemployed youth the chance to be part of a volunteer programme. Provincial spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni told Daily Sun the programme was an extension of an integrated community registration outreach programme. The aim was to promote access to social assistance as an essential provision to combat poverty. “The partnership brought about the recruitment of 220 volunteers across Mpumalanga through the assistance of civil society organisations to assist potential beneficiaries to apply for the R350 social relief grant. “This noble intervention is extended to those beneficiaries who don’t have access to computers, laptops and are unable to use technology to register their applications,” he said. Ngubeni said the volunteers would help with queue management at Sassa and post office pay points. “Volunteers will be empowered with the correct information to guide and advise clients about Sassa services. “They will also distribute educational and promotional materials as a reference source on how to access Sassa services. They will ensure compliance with Covid-19 precautionary health protocols and regulations,” said Ngubeni. For more information on the programme, call 0800 60 1011 or 013 754 9428.
