BOXING trainer Charity Mukondeleli is determined to establish his own identity and make a name for himself. Mukondeleli, who has been an assistant cornerman to Bernie Pailman over the years, will be the chief trainer, leading Prince “The Demon” Dlomo against Xolisani “Nomeva” Ndongeni on Saturday. The two local lightweight gladiators will face off in a non-title fight on the TLB Boxing Promotions event. This will be a big stage for the upcoming trainer, given the fact his charge is facing a former world champion who has not lost against a local opponent. Despite facing a well-established camp, the former boxer is confident his charge can pull off an upset against the favourite Ndongeni. He said the lessons he learnt from his mentor and experience he gathered over the years, as both a fighter and a trainer, will help him pull through. The young Limpopo-born boxing mentor believes in his capabilities as a trainer and said he is ready for the challenge. “We are 100% ready for the contest. We have been training in isolation during lockdown. “I have a plan in place to give Ndongeni his first defeat at home. Dlomo is going to war. I know one thing for sure is that we will rise on the occasion,” Mukondeleli said. “For me it will be another day in the office, and I’m looking forward to it. In the past, Bernie has trusted me with the responsibility to lead his boxers when he was away on other assignments. In all of those fights, I have represented the Westside Boxing Academy. “This is the beginning of a journey to establish my own identity and make a name for myself in South African boxing. “I will do my best to make sure that I leave a long lasting memory building my legacy,” he said.
