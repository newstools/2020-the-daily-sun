MESHACK Maphangule says he doesn’t have any regrets after his contract was mutually terminated by Orlando Pirates. The skilful midfielder was among eight players released by Bucs as he was not in coach Josef Zinnbauer’s plans for the coming season. The 29-year-old joined the Soweto giants in July 2018 from Black Leopards, but spent most of his time on loan at Chippa United. He revealed that Pirates management wanted to loan him out again, but he refused as he has had enough. Said Maphangule: “I’m enough of loans. I don’t have a problem that we parted ways. It’s football and these things do happen. They were keen to loan me again, but I didn’t want to move all the time. I also needed a chance to prove my worth.” Maphangule insists that he won’t be lost in the top flight as he claims to have already attracted interest from a few teams that are keen to bring him on board into their ensembles. But the Venda-born player is not in a rush to commit until he gets a good deal. “There are teams that are after my services, but I haven’t decided just yet where I will play next season,” he declared. “I am still processing offers because I need the one that is better for me. “I also want to continue playing instead of warming the bench. “I can’t reveal the names until I know where I will go.” Maphangule said joining a big team has its own challenges, but that doesn’t mean that other aspiring footballers won’t succeed in the Bucs jersey. “I enjoyed myself at Leopards and at Chippa last season. But the situation is not the same at Pirates. What happened to me (warming the bench) doesn’t mean it will happen to other players. “If they get the chance to play it might be different,” said Maphangule. The soft-spoken player said his fans will see a lot from him on the pitch in the DStv Premiership. “I thank everyone who has rallied behind me in good and bad times. They will see me in action soon because this is not the end of my career.”
