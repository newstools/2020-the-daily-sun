Covid-19 has claimed many lives. Loved ones died and we couldn’t bid them farewell. It’s so painful! Unfortunately, this is the reality of our time. People still die in their numbers. This pandemic is still out there, luring people into thinking it’s gone. In fact, it continues to kill us by the numbers. The president should cancel all festive season celebrations. This may sound crazy, but the festive season is another disaster that claims lives year in, year out. We should do everything we can to stop disaster in its tracks. Come December, all we’ll be hearing about the death toll on our roads and in our living spaces. Is this what we want? Folding our arms and doing nothing means we don’t value life. Do something now, Mr President, before it’s too late. We can’t allow more lives to be lost when that could’ve stopped or avoided. More deaths have been recorded in the past Easter period, and that should be a clear warning. The same could happen this festive season. No life is worth losing. Act decisively, be proactive and save lives. Letter by Vela Xanko, Mqanduli
