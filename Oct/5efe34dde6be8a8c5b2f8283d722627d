I welcome the arrest of ANC officials and company owners who benefited from state capture. Pity that South Africans are starting to think government is winning the war against corruption. The arrests are only so the party can win the 2021 local government elections. The Zondo Commission will run until the national election in 2024 and then fizzle out. The arrests are just to get people to calm down. The ruling party wants you to trust it again. Until all named at the commission are jailed, I wonâ€™t trust the ANC. - Letter by Wapapa Mokwepa, Meadowlands
