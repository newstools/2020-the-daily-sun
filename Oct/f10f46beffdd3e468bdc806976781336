When I checked, I found bullet holes.”  She said her boyfriend told her to take cover in case the shooting continued. “I refused and rushed outside to check on my child. I didn’t care about my life at that point,” she said. Ayeza found the bullets had gone straight through to her neighbour’s shack. Neighbour Phumeza Mpindi (40) said she wasn’t home when the incident happened. ALSO READ: KHAYA DLADLA GETS ENGEGED! “At least my kids and I were not home when the shooting happened.
