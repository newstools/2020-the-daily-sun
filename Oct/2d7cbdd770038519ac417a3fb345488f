THE City of Tshwane will elect a new mayor tomorrow. Speaker Katlego Mathebe said yesterday this would happen at a council meeting. Mathebe briefed the media on her immediate return to her job and preparations that had been made for the council sitting. This came after the DA won its Supreme Court appeal on Tuesday. The court dismissed the Gauteng executive council and the co-operative governance department’s appeal against the North Gauteng High Court judgment setting aside the decision to place Tshwane under administration. Mathebe said all party whips had agreed to hold the council sitting. “I instructed the chief financial officer to ensure all councillors are paid their salaries from May,” she said. MEC Lebogang Maile placed the Metro under administration in April. The municipality could neither hold council meetings to appoint a new mayor after the resignation of Stevens Mokgalapa, nor pass an adjusted budget following walkouts. The appeal court’s decision came before the delivery of a judgment on the same matter in the Constitutional Court. The Gauteng executive council, the EFF and others are contesting the North Gauteng High Court’s judgment in favour of the DA. The party has vowed to ensure Maile is held personally liable for legal costs. Gauteng DA leader Mike Moriarty said: “There was no justification in removing elected DA councillors from their posts.” The high court had ordered the dissolution of the Tshwane council be set aside. ANC and EFF councillors should attend meetings.DA leader John Steenhuisen said it was obvious that the ANC and Maile were engaging in politics at the cost of residents of Tshwane.
