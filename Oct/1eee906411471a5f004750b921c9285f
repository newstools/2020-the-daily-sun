Mosimane yesterday confirmed his resignation, after Motsepe arrived at the club offices with his lawyers for crunch talks with Mosimane’s management team. The two parties reached an agreement, which has resulted in the club accepting Mosimane’s resignation. The Downs’ generous boss also granted Mosimane permission to take his assistant, Rhulani Mokwena with him. Motsepe said Pitso and his agent, Moira Tlhagale who is also his wife, came to brief him on the discussions between him and a top Egyptian side. “Sundowns have been aware of the ongoing discussions with Egyptian clubs. I have over the past few years expressed my support for Pitso leaving Sundowns to coach in North Africa or Europe, or for Bafana Bafana. “Football coaches have uncertain and inconsistent futures and must pursue new opportunities. I am very proud of his achievement at Sundowns. He is the most successful coach in the club’s history,” said Motsepe.
