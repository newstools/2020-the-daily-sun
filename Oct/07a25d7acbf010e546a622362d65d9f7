Stripper Bubbly Sodela has left many of KwaZakhele residents and social media followers shocked. This is after she prepared the pots for the ancestors’ thanks giving ceremony on Saturday. The ceremony was held at her mother’s house and dozens of community members flocked to her home and asked to take selfies with her. But Bubbly wanted to be hands on and do what she does best. Speaking to Daily Sun, Bubbly said: "As early as 7am I was busy preparing four big pots outside on fire wood with the assistance of my mother. I should have come Friday night by my career is too demanding. "I’m not a star or a stripper at home but they celebrate me. I am a normal child." "This was an eye opener for me. It shows that I have grown up. To be in the kraal and hear my mum putting me in her prayers and don't see me as a prostitute like other people do it meant a lot for me." On Sunday morning Bubbly said was exhausted: “My legs are partly burnt because to prepare such big pots is not a child's play. I am lazy but I love cooking."I cooked four pots and my mother helped me with one. I cooked carrots, samp and chicken stew. Everyone was leaking his lips and fingers because I am the best in cooking chicken stew," she said. While her mother Nokuthula Sodela-Deliwe (52) said:"I had to put Bubbly in my prayers because I am very proud of her. She is always there for me. Her stripping career is making huge difference although in the past I was against it. "From her primary school days she used to wear high hills and miniskirts. Her dream was to be a TV star. Many people thought I was reach when they saw her on TV and that made me angry because I was not even receiving a cent." "But being a stripper has made her to even financially support me. Hence today I decided to ask God and my ancestors to protect, guide and help her to achieve her dreams."
