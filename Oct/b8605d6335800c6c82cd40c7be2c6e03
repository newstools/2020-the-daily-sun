THREE suspects linked to the murder of a teacher from Estcourt, KZN Midlands, appeared briefly in the Colenso Magistrates Court yesterday. Teacher Nokubonga Dubazane (37), Mqapheli Miya (46) and Nkosingiphile Ngubane (39) face murder and malicious damage to property charges. They were bust for the murder of Hlengiwe Ndaba (35), a grade 4 teacher at Phasiwe Primary School. Ngubane was appearing for the first time after being bust in Joburg on 26 September.  Magistrate Peter Dyson said the matter would be dealt with differently. Dubazane and Miya will appear together, while Ngubane will appear alone. Dubazane and Miya previously abandoned bail but yesterday said they wanted to apply for bail. Dyson postponed the matter to 29 October for a bail application. Hlengiwe’s uncle, Thembelani (52), said: “The family has hope justice will be served as a third suspect has been caught.” Thembelani wanted the suspects to get harsh sentences. SADTU regional gender convener, Nokwazi Phakathi, said: “The teacher involved in this was a temporary teacher. So it’s suspected she got involved in this because she wanted Hlengiwe’s position.” She said the Department of Education should perhaps review the employment process to avoid such incidents. ANCWL’s Thuli Hadebe said they wanted the suspects to get a harsh sentence
