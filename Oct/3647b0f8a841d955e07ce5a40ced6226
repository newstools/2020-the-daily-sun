BAFANA Bafana were held to a 1-1 draw by Namibia in their first encounter of the year at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Thursday night. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki handed debuts to three players, Portugal-based Thibang Phete, Siyethemba Sithebe of AmaZulu FC and Cape Ton City midfielder Thabo Nodada. It was South Africa's first outing in nearly a year as they last played in November 2019 against Sudan in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier. The national men's senior side were scheduled for a camp in late March during the FIFA international break, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought a halt to those plans. And now, over six months later, Bafana took to the field for the first time in 11 months as they prepare for two AFCON qualifiers against Sao Tome in November. Bafana started the match on edge with the players looking nervous as Namibia threatened early on. Luther Singh was the first to find the back of the net putting Bafana on the lead under 20 minutes of the encounter. The second half would see the Brave Warriors strike within the first ten minutes of the restart after Ntseki introduced Gladwin Shitolo and Lyle Forster for Mothibi Mvala and Erasmus. Bafana defence error saw Absalom Iimbondi chest the ball beyond his man and hit a low shot through the legs of Williams. Ntseki did not wait long after Namibia levelled matters as he introduced Motjeka Madisha, Teboho Mokoena, Sifiso Hlanti and Ricardo Goss for Musa Lebusa, Sithebe, Thibang and Williams. Goss would immediately be involved as he made a superb stop from a shot by Namibia's Joslin Kamatuka. Rusty Bafana struggled to threaten the Namibian goal again and the match ended in a draw. Bafana are now going to host Zambia at the same venue on Sunday at 3pm.
