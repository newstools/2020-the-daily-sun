AFTER Martin Makasi’s brother, Bongani, was killed on Sunday afternoon, he wants to know what led to his killing. The 31-year-old Bongani was drinking with his friends when thugs came into the shack, shot him seven times and then disappeared. Martin, who’s a CPF chairman in Zwelitsha, Cape Town, said they wanted to know why his brother was the one targeted out of all the people. “There were six people in the shack, but nobody else was hurt,” said Martin. He said his brother was not in politics and was a just a regular guy, who had worked for his money. “The murder came as a shock to the family.” Martin rushed to the scene after Bongani was shot, but he was already dead when he got there. He said the friends he was drinking with couldn’t explain why his brother was shot and none of them were injured. Cape Town police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. He told Daily Sun: “Nyanga police are investigating a case of murder after a 31-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded on Sunday afternoon in Mahobe Drive in Zwelitsha. “Anyone with any information about this fatal shooting incident should call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.” Bongani has left behind two children, aged between 11 years old and nine months.
