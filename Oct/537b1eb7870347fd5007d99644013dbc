TV personality Katlego Maboe’s partner and baby mama, Monique Muller, had a tell-all interview about her relationship with the presenter. In an upcoming interview with GoBinge on YouTube, Monique talked about how she met Katlego and the dynamic of their relationship. She also revealed that she opened a protection order against him after he allegedly beat her the first time. Monique also addressed the backlash she has been getting on social media, saying people will always talk. “People are always going to have their views and opinions, but this thing has been so misconstrued. I feel like everything that this man has already done to me, the world is allowing him to continue to do,” she said. Katlego and Monique have been the talk of the town since Friday when a video of Monique confronting Katlego about him cheating on her surfaced on social media. Monique claimed that as a result of his cheating, she contracted an STD that is messing with her womb. Since then, Katlego has been suspended from SABC3’s Expresso where he’s a host. He has also been removed as the face of Outsurance. According to Gobinge, the full interview will be out soon. After the ordeal, Katlego sent out an apology on Instagram, but refuted the abuse claims. “I was unfaithful to my partner during a very important time of our lives – an act I regret to this day. We are currently undergoing an unfortunate and painful separation, which is being resolved through legal proceedings. In light of the comments made against me, I would like to state that I have never abused my partner,” he wrote.
