VUSI Ntuli was caught stealing body lotion last Monday, apparently because he couldn’t afford it. But instead of calling the cops, the security guard kept him in the store’s holding room. The 47-year-old Vusi from Mpumalanga saidtwo angry mlungus tied him to a fence and began clapping and kicking him. Vusi said he was later taken to an unknown place where the beating continued. “While assaulting me I heard them speaking in Afrikaans about killing me and ensuring no one saw them,” he said. Vusi said they sat him down and pulled out a knife and firearm. “They then told me to choose between getting shot or losing a finger. “I kept quiet and couldn’t think for a moment. “It wasn’t easy to decide. “One of them kicked me in the mouth, swore at me and threatened to kill me.” He chose the knife. . . “They put my right hand on the table and chopped off my pinkie finger. I couldn’t believe it. I bled profusely. Vusi’s finger was fed to the dogs. He said: “I managed to escape. I’d have died if I didn’t get the chance to escape. “They were going to chop off all my fingers and possibly shoot me. “Their intention wasn’t to torture, but to kill me.” Vusi, who does piece jobs, said he was happy the people who assaulted him had been arrested. “I know they can’t bring my finger back, but I want them to pay for what they did,” he said. When Daily Sun visited the shop on Friday, the store manager wasn’t available for comment. Several attempts to phone the shop were made, but the phone rang unanswered. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said three people aged between 20 and 45 had been arrested and charged with assault and kidnapping. They were expected to appear in the Witbank Magistrates Court today for a formal bail application.
