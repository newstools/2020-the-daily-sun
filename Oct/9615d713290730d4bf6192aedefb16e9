LUTHER Singh says it is an honour to have been called up to represent South Africa as they prepare for next month's 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) back-to-back qualifiers against Sao Tome e Principe. Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki on Friday named an adventurous squad for the matches against Namibia and Zambia‚ both at Royal Bafokeng Stadium‚ on Thursday and Sunday. The Bafana coach is relying on certain players as he blended his squad with senior players and young blood which most of them represented Mzansi in the Brazil 2016 Olympic Games. Most of the players reported for camp on Sunday and Monday while Europe-based Percy Tau, Keagan Dolly and Singh landed in South Africa on Monday. The 23-year-old Singh says he is looking forward to the challenge where he will be playing with experienced Kermit Erasmus upfront."It is always an honour to represent my country regardless of age group it feels to be back in the national team for a long time, " he said. "We all went through a period where it was difficult for everyone I am glad things are slowly getting back to normal. We are happy that we back in the field doing what we love the most. "The quality we have in camp. I can learn a lot from them, I am looking forward to working with them and help where I can." Coach Ntseki has been forced to make a few changes, replacing Kurt Abrahams with AmaZulu sensation Sinethemba Sithebe while Sipho Mbule has been replaced by SA U23 Olympic forward Lyle Foster, who is scheduled to arrive in the country on Tuesday morning. Ntseki said the unexpected and continuous heavy showers meant that the scheduled training session meant for Monday was called off. "Unfortunately, due to persistent heavy rains and hailstorm this afternoon (on Monday afternoon) we did not get to have our first training session," Ntseki told SAFA's official website.
