MAMELODI Sundowns assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena has penned a 'Thank You' not for Pitso Mosimane. The five-time league winner joined North African giants Al Ahly. And there has been reports linking Mokwena with a move to join Mosimane at Al Ahly. However, the former Orlando Pirates mentor has come out to dismiss those rumours, stating he is "extremely happy at the club and loyal." "It would be truly insensitive of me if I didn’t take this moment to thank you (Mosimane)," Mokwena wrote. "Thank you for bringing me into your confidence. Thank you for presenting me with opportunities to grow and further my career. Thank you for being the giant on who’s shoulders I have stood on. Thank you for being the inspiration. Thank you for being you!! I wish you well."
