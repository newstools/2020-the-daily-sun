DESPITE being clubless for over 14 months, Siphiwe "Shabba" Tshabalala said calling it a quits has never crossed his mind. "Shabba", one of the loved sons of the South African football in the last 10 years, was confirmed as one new AmaZulu signings in Durban on Monday. He was signed as free agent having been without a club since leaving Turkish side BB Erzurumspor, who were relegated in May last year. Ever since then, Shabba has been linked with overseas clubs, but nothing has since materialised. To stay out for this long, it was also further added by Covid-19 that hit brakes on world sports. That hampered further hopes of Tshabalala getting a club, but his desire was always maintained - to play football. “Nope, it didn’t even slip my mind that I was thinking of calling it a quits,” said Shabba. “I have had quite a number of offers and mostly abroad, and for me it was just about making the right decision. I always say things happen for a reason. I’m happy with the decision that I took and I’m here because I want to be here, not that I have to be here. “It’s a challenge as I’m coming to a team that has been struggling, which have fought relegation for the past six or seven seasons. While it is a challenge, I’m up for it. I want to work and I want to do my very best and help the team at the same time. So I’m looking forward to this challenge.” In his glittering career, Shabba has won it all in the PSL. He won the league title twice, two MTN8, three Telkom Knockouts and one Nedbank Cup. These achievements all came while playing for Chiefs, whom he joined in January 2007 from Free State Stars.  Shabba played in 372 games for Chiefs, including 336 starts and 36 subs. He scored 58 goals for the Glamour Boys, with the last one a beautifully taken free-kick against Baroka FC in a one-all draw on 14 August 2018. “Now it is just to create new memories with my new teammates,” said Shabba.
