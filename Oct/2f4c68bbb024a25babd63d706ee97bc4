EXCITEMENT about the Cape Town Marathon is building as the countdown to the race begins. The Sanlam-sponsored annual race, which takes a virtual format this year because of Covid-19 outbreak, is set for Sunday. “When we say that we’re taking Cape Town to the world, we mean it. “From the start of ceremony and the city’s iconic landmarks, to the cheers and vibe… it’s all neatly packaged in what is undoubtedly the most advanced virtual event app on the running market right now,” said Barry van Blerk, the virtual marathon’s manager. Participants will feature in the marathon, half marathon and 10km/5km peace runs along three pre-designed marathon routes in Cape Town, Potchefstroom and Pretoria. The star-studded elite invitational athletes include Ann Ashworth, Charne Bosman, Stephen Mokoka and Bongmusa Mthembu. Sydney Mbhele, chief executive of Sanlam brand division, said: “Despite what the world is going through, the marathon is going ahead and is still able to make a positive impact on the lives of both the runners and the organisations that benefit from the proceeds of the race,” Mbhele said. The Cape Town race is lauded as Africa’s only World Athletics Gold Label Marathon. Last year, Kenya’s Edwin Koech won men’s marathon, with a time of 2 hours 9 minutes 20 seconds. Fellow Kenyan Celestine Chepchirchir, won the women’s marathon, clocking 2:26.44. Despite the absence of many runners along the traditional Cape Town Marathon and Peace Run routes next weekend, the City of Cape Town has offered its support. – CAJ News
