NEW Black Leopards coach, Patrick Aussems, is not a worried man as he assumes the Lidoda Duvha hot-seat. Lately Leopards have been trigger-happy firing coaches like their club depend on it, but the sharp-shooting 55-year-old Belgian coach has no doubts about his abilities to deliver the deliverables, according to his contract. Aussems guided Simba FC to the Tanzanian Premier League title in 2018-19, and also helped the club reach the African Champions League quarter-finals under Senzo Mazingisa as CEO of the league. He takes over from Mongezi Bobe and Morgan Shivambu, who recently helped the club retained their PSL status via the promotion-relegation play-offs. The coach joined the club on a three-year deal. “I should be the head coach for three years,” he said. “You know in football you can never say what will happen. The most important thing is to believe in what you are doing. “I have a lot of experience here in Africa, South Africa is my sixth of the seven country (I worked in). I know cultures are always different with each country. “But after Congo, Sudan Al Hilal, Tanzania with Simba, who are big clubs, top clubs in the league, here it is not one of those top four clubs. But the target in the next three years is to reach that level. He added: “I am a man of challenges. I love the challenge, I am excited. I think it will be an exciting season. In football, everything is going very fast and most important you need tools.” Aussems is set to be assisted by Shivambu and Bobe in the inaugural DStv Premiership season. The Belgian mentor said he has been in Mzansi before. He stated: “I know South Africa well. “When I was with Simba, we came here for pre-season and played friendlies with the likes of Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. “It’s the best league.”
