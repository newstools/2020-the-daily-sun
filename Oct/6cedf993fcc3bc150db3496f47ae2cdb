THE parents who couldn’t send their boys to winter initiation schools are now rejoicing. This after the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) announced over the weekend that initiation schools could resume in December. But they warned that the schools would be closely monitored to ensure Covid-19 regulations were followed. Last month, Contralesa said it was disappointed that initiation schools were still banned from operating under level one. Arnold Mahumani (43) from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said he was disappointed he couldn’t send his youngest son to an initiation school. He said back home in Bushbukridge, Mpumalanga, it was important for boys to be sent to initiation schools. “They are never regarded as men in society if they are not sent to initiation school. “They are taught the role that men should play in society, things that are not taught anywhere else. I’m definitely taking my son in December.” Ephraim Sebogodi (51) from Kempton Park said he didn’t believe in initiation schools, but his son wanted to go. “He was so disappointed when initiation schools closed as we had agreed we will send him there,” he said. Hector Talane (30) from Winnie Mandela in Tembisa said he preferred his boys to get circumcised in hospital and not at initiation schools. “Initiation schools were not safe before the coronavirus, how can we trust they will follow health and safety protocols when there are still bogus schools?” Meanwhile, Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders said the initiation season would go ahead, but under strict Covid-19 regulations. The season normally starts as soon as pupils finish writing exams. Acting chairman Chief Langa Mavuso told Daily Sun: “Only two initiates will be allowed in an ibhoma (hut). Iingcibi and amakhankatha (surgeons and traditional nurses) must wear gloves and masks.
