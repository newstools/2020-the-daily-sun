BAFANA BAFANA will play their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier next month against Sao Tome and Principe at Moses Mabhida Stadium. The game was scheduled to be played at FNB Stadium on 13 November when the 2021 Afcon qualifiers resume, according to the SA Football Association calendar that was released recently. Three days later, Bafana will visit Sao Tome at a venue to be announced. However, Safa, according to a SunSport source, has decided to take the game to Durban where the eThekwini Municipality will be paying the accommodation of the national team. Moses Mabhida Stadium manager, Vusi Mazibuko, previously told SunSport they were going to be aggressive in getting top content for the venue and said every year the venue will have to host 16 games, including Bafana matches and PSL cup finals. When approached for comment, Mazibuko told SunSport they are in the final stages of concluding the new arrangements with Safa. “Everything should be finalised this week,” said Mazibuko. The last time Bafana played an Afcon qualifier at the Moses Mabhida Stadium was in September 2018 when they drew 1-1 with Libya in a 2019 qualifier. Two months later, Bafana were back at the 2010 World Cup stadium. This time it was the annual Nelson Mandela Challenge in which they drew 1-1 with Paraguay. Bafana returned to the international fold earlier this month, where they played two friendly matches at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg. Bafana drew 1-1 against Namibia on 8 October and lost 2-1 to Zambia, three days later. Bafana are in Group C with Ghana and Sudan, making up the four-team group. The finals will be played in Cameroon between 9 January and 6 February next year. Molefi Ntseki’s boys opened the Afcon qualifiers with a 2-0 loss to Ghana in Cape Coast on 14 November last year before bouncing back three days later to beat Sudan 1-0 at Orlando Stadium.
