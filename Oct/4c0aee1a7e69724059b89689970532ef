CITY Press’ executive editor Dumisane Lubisi has passed away, Daily Sun’s sister newspaper announced in a statement. Lubisi died last night as a result of apparent heart failure, according to the statement. He was 44. Lubisi previously worked at African Eye news agency, This Day and the Sunday Times before joining City Press in June 2007 as an investigative reporter. During his time at City Press, Lubisi served as senior reporter, commissioning editor of opinion and analysis section Voices and also as the paper’s ombudsman. “Dumi” will be sorely missed by his City Press friends and colleagues, the statement read. City Press editor Mondli Makhanya said that the paper had lost a pillar. “I can’t even begin to describe the devastation we are feeling as the City Press family.” He described Lubisi as a “stickler for accuracy”. He struck fear into the hearts of reporters and managers alike with his unrelenting enforcement of the Press Code and media ethics. As a journalist, he could spot a news angle from afar and thus served as a pivotal voice as the City Press team put together content for the paper and the website, the statement read. “Above all, he was just a damn fine guy. He laughed, joked, talked nonsense and brought life to our newsroom. His only major flaw was his loyalty to that gold and black team from Phefeni. He even dared to wear that team’s jersey to the office,” said Makhanya. Funeral arrangements will be announced in due course. Lubisi leaves behind his parents and three sons, Thando, Siya and Wandile.
