RAPPER JUBA J Skillz has got his life together again. The artist, best known for having been the front man of 985, said he lost his focus years ago and was blinded by women and money. The rapper, whose real name is Collen Ndou, got lost in living a FANCY lifestyle. JUBA used to spend loads of cash on women, booze and fun. So high was the high life he even left his mum’s humble home in Diepkloof, Soweto, so he could stay in a fancy flat in Joburg and do as he pleased. The five-man group, 985, was known for songs such as Shapa and their smash hit Utlwa. They last released music in 2010. By 2016 he was down and out and no longer making any money. “This was after spending money recklessly by partying in clubs,” he said. He was involved in a car crash while driving his PT Cruiser Chrysler in 2016. “I watched as our empire came crashing down and went to clubs in the Free State,” he said. “We used to live in the best apartments in Joburg, but it’s all gone now.” Juba told the SunTeam he had to move back in with his mum in 2016. He’d spent more than R200 000 on jols! He said: “I drank a lot of alcohol to take away stress, and I’d smoke lots of zol to make myself strong enough to face the world. I used to go out with groupies.” Juba told the People’s Paper he was grateful that God protected and kept him from catching diseases. He said he’s planning a comeback and will release an eight-track EP called Bozza Network on Sunday.
