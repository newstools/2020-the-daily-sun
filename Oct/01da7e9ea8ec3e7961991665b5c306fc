CELEBRITY fashion designer Quiteria Kekana survived a near-death experience after he lost control of his BMW SUV. Quiteria, who is the creative director of Quiteria Aleliter, told Daily Sun the accident happened on the highway from Free State to Joburg, which left his tyres and exhaust pipe ruptured.  The accident happened on Monday morning. “I lost control of the car. I don’t know how it happened because we were cautious. “I hurt my back and neck, nothing too serious. I got checked out by the doctor,” he said. Quiteria added that two other passengers were in the car with him when the incident happened but no other injuries were sustained. “I called my psychologist immediately, who assisted me. He phoned the tow truck, paramedics and police. For now, we are fine and recovering,” he said. The designer said he was fixing his car at a local mechanic.
