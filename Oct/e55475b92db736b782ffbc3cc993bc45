There are so many things we as humans want to achieve in this lifetime. From building a successful career, achieving financial freedom and one day hopefully falling in love. Once these and many others are achieved, we can safely say we have lived. However, like the movie title, everyone in this lifetime is in the pursuit of happiness. A large part of that happiness, according to experts, lies in a three-letter word called sex. According to stats, couples who have sex once a week vs. those who have it once a month are happier. A recent study in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin attributes this to cuddles. According to Professor Anik Debrot from the University of Toronto, sex seems not only beneficial because of its physiological or hedonic effects, but it also promotes a stronger and more positive connection with your partner. Another diary-based experiment with 106 Swiss couples found that the more sex a couple had over a 10-day period, the higher their relationship satisfaction. Another follow-up found that when couples had sex, they were more likely to report experiences of affection not just in the immediate aftermath, but several hours later. Simply put, couples that have more sex with each other are more likely to be happier and if this evidence is anything to go by, the fights become less.
