The suspects told the court they do not mind the media presence because they want the nation to see what is happening to them. They flat-out refused to stand in the dock and instead stood outside of the dock. They told the court that they had nothing to do with the killing of Senzo Meyiwa and that they don't need any legal representation. They were all charged with murder, attempted, robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of illegal firearm and ammunition. The case was postponed to 27 November for further investigation and all the accused will be remanded in custody. Yesterday, Cele held a press conference announcing that five suspects had been arrested earlier in the morning in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. It was the day that marked six years since the Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana captain was gunned down at the home of his girlfriend, singer Kelly Khumalo, in the east of Joburg in 2014..
