THE Sibali family from Siyahlala squatter camp in Philippi
Browns Farm, Cape Town, wants the investigating officer to arrest suspects who
killed their brother. In June this year, Amahle Quku was raped and killed in
Siyahlala, and community leader Salathiso Sibali took the suspect to the cops.
But later that day, Salathiso was shot and killed. Speaking to Daily Sun,
Salathiso’s brother Velile said they are still waiting for cops to arrest the
suspects who killed his brother. “We feel that they are not taking this case seriously
because by now they should’ve arrested the people who shot my brother,” said
Velile. He said the investigating officer asked the family if they
haven’t heard anything about the killers. “Who is the investigating officer between us and them? It is
their job to arrest the suspects, especially that they are known by some of the
community members,” said Velile. He said while his brother was taking the rape suspect to the
cops, his shack was destroyed by some residents. “They took out their frustration on an innocent person.” Velile believes that his brother wants justice. “He will never rest in peace because the people who killed
him are roaming the streets. They are caring on with their lives as if they
didn’t do anything,” he said. He said the people who destroyed his brother’s shack also
stole his belongings. “When we got there, we only found dishes. They took almost
all his belongings,” Velile told the People’s Paper. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana
said the case is still under investigation. “There are no witnesses who want to come forward,” said
Rwexana. According to her, the investigating officer is constantly in
contact with the brother of the dead man and last spoke to him a week ago. “Community leaders were engaged to give statements, but are
not willing to,” added Rwexana.
