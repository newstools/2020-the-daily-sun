PUBLIC Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has cleared ANC secretary-general and former Free State premier, Ace Magashule, on allegations that he misled the legislature during his tenure as premier. Mkhwebane briefed the media at her offices in Tshwane yesterday on the investigations done in the second quarter of this year. She released 14 reports that her office investigated so far. She said she received a complaint from DA member of parliament Rob Jankielsohn against Magashule concerning the involvement of his office in the funeral arrangements of the late Health MEC, Fundiswa Ngubentombi.  Mkhwebane said Magashule did not blatantly mislead the legislature in his reply concerning the involvement of his office in the funeral arrangements, as well as the commitment by his office to ensure the provincial government refunded the municipality. She said the allegation was unsubstantiated. Mkhwebane also announced that the long-awaited report on the Vrede Dairy Farm project looking into politiciansâ€™ involvement has been concluded. However, she will not release it just yet. She said the reasons for not releasing the report on the Vrede Dairy Farm was because responses of some implicated people were not received yet, as they asked for extensions.
