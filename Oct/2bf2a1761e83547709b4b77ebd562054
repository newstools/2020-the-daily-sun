I carry with me the women that came before me so that tonight could be. May this year be one of purpose and change. My beloved South Africa, Ndo livhuwa," she wrote. During an interview with Daily Sun in June, Shudufhadzo said she wanted to inspire young girls from Limpopo to do big things  "I'm an example that where you come from doesn't mean anything. Young girls should know that nothing is impossible. No dream is off limits. They can dream as big as they want and as much as they can regardless of where they come from," she said. Miss SA 2020 walked away with prizes worth of R3 million rand.
