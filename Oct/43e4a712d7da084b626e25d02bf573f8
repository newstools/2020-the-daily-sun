MAMELODI SUNDOWNS will be the noticeable absentee in the MTN8 semi-finals after being kicked on the back side by a determined and sharp Bloemfontein Celtic in the quarter-finals on Sunday night. Celtic will face defending cup champions, SuperSport United, while Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs will meet in the other semi-final. Sundowns were playing for the first time since their long-time coach, Pitso Mosimane, moved to Al Ahly and the club now is manned by trio - Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela.  The boys will regroup and keep marching on, together.??Now we shift our focus to this weekends first #DStvPrem game against Amakhosi!?#Sundowns pic.twitter.com/3xxBTr82TK  We keep moving Masandawana??MTN8 ??Quarter Final ??#Sundowns #MTN8 pic.twitter.com/NCmH1dMcjn
