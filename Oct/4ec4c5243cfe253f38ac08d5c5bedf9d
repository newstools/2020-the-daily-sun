Marriage is an intimate union and an equal partnership between a man and a woman. I don’t understand why certain spouses won’t accept their partner’s children. Recently, I came across a woman’s post on social media who voiced her dissatisfaction with her husband. The married couple both have children of their own from previous marriages. The woman wrote: “I’ve discovered my hubby only put his biological kids in his will. “My children, with whom we live, weren’t included in that will.” That response to her unhappiness is shockingly bad. A lot of men are of the view that she should ask their biological fathers to put them in their wills. “Children who aren’t mine will get nothing from me,” one user remarked. If you love someone, you must be willing to accept everything about them. - Letter by Solam Yves Ludidi, Ennerdale
