Former president Jacob Zuma’s refusal to appear before the Zondo Commission is merely a delaying tactic. If he has nothing to hide, he must give his side of the story. If the former head of state won’t budge, a warrant for his arrest will have to be issued. We don’t want a situation where a former head of state is humiliated by cops. As a senior citizen and a former president, our respect for him must remain intact. The commission has all along been probing the Guptas. The nation can’t wait any longer to hear JZ’s side of the story. Should Deputy Justice Raymond Zondo recuse himself as demanded by Zuma, it will take a few more years before the former president can appear before the new commission. They say justice delayed is justice denied. In this case the nation is on the receiving end. We’re being held to ransom by Msholozi. I hope for his sake and that of the country, he doesn’t end up in handcuffs.
