EVERY transfer is essentially a gamble. You can never really predict how a player will settle into his new environment. Some, though, are tailor-made for their new club and seamlessly assimilate. One such individual is Bafana Bafana star Percy Tau, a supremely gifted player, who has established himself in Belgium. Tau is in his third season in Belgium on loan from English Premier League outfit Brighton & Hove Albion. He is currently on a season-long loan with Anderlecht. He turned out in the second-tier for Royal Union St Gilloise in 2018-19‚ winning the Belgian First Division B’s player of the season award. This past season Tau started on fire in the top tier for Brugge and maintained consistentcy throughout the season. The Bafana star is currently in Rustenburg with the team as they prepare for two friendly matches against Namibia on Thursday and Zambia on Sunday. The player says everything has been going well at the new club. Since his arrival at the club Tau has played six games and scored two goals, having scored on his debut against Sint-Truidense and against Oostende. “Life is okay we are getting some good results,” he said on Wednesday after joining his Bafana teammates in camp. “We just lost one game and drew a couple. “We still have to get more points. It is getting there, I am still new at the club I only played like seven games and it is a new coach. “Everything is still new. We will see with time how everything develops. Tau is hoping Bafana will not disappoint, will win their two friendly matches as they will be playing for the first time after a year-long break due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said: “I  came home to play and it is always an great opportunity for me to play for the national team it is good to see the other guys here. I am hoping we will get to win the games.
