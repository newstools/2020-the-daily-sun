THE Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has hinted
she will appeal a Western High Court ruling that dismissed her bid to suspend a
parliamentary process to impeach her. Judge Vincent Saldanha earlier ruled that Mkhwebane failed
to make a case for relief and found her bias allegations baseless. Mkhwebane, responding to the ruling, said even though her
legal team was still going to study the judgment,Â  early indications were that the judgment went
against everything that the Constitutional Court ruled in another similar case. The court had ruled that her office would not suffer
irreparable harm if the remedial actions were suspended and it would not hinder
her constitutional mandate or offend any of her constitutional powers and
functions. Mkhwebane in a statement said her legal team has argued in
the same vein in her application. She added that proceeding with the impeachment process while
she was still going to challenge the new rules was going to cause her
irreparable harm. On the other hand, the National Assembly would not suffer
any harm if the process was suspended. National Assembly speaker Thandi Modise welcomed the ruling
and revealed that the process of appointing a three-member panel is almost
complete. Modise said she would in due course release the names of the
panel. The independent panel is to decide whether there is a prima facie case
to remove Mkhwebane from office. Modise said at the time Mkhwebane brought her application
before court, the process of appointing the panel. "The process is almost complete, and the Speaker will
announce the names of panel members in due course," her office said.
