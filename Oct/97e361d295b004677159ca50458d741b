MURDER accused Vusi Sehlabela’s long awaited trial is set to begin in the Mpumalanga High Court for the hearing. The 37-year-old man from Marite Trust near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga appeared in the Mpumalanga High Court held in Graskop today. His is facing murder charges along with his co-accused Norman “Dalias” Mokoena (23), who is still waited to be added on this trial after he was re-arrested following his unlawful escape from the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court last year. But the Sehlabela case was moved in July at the same court without his co-accused to be held in Mpumalanga High Court at Graskop, starting from 2 until 6 November, while Mokoena is yet to plead on his escaping charges before he joins Sehlabela in the high court. The two are being accused of murdering Patrick Mhlanga (41), who was shot and killed during a road rage. This incident happened in April 2018 when accused Sehlabela was on out on bail for another murder charge after he shot and killed his brother-in-law Daniel Mokoena, who was 40. Daniel was gunned down in full view of drinkers at the local tavern in Marite in may 2017. The matter is on in the Nelspruit Regional Court. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa confirmed the trial has been postponed to 2 until 6 November in the Mpumalanga High Court, to be held at Graskop. “The matter will be on the roll five days for plea and trial, and the accused will remain in police custody until the finalisation of the cases,” she said
