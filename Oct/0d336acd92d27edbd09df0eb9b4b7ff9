The Soweto giants, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, have been scheduled for back-to-back weekend fixtures in the semi-finals of the MTN8. The first leg of the semi-finals will be played on Saturday and Sunday, with the second leg set for the weekend of 7 and 8 November. All will kick-off at 3pm Bloemfontein Celtic and SuperSport United will be involved in the other semi-final fixtures. The first Soweto derby of the season will be on Saturday when Pirates host Chiefs at Orlando Stadium, and the Amakhosi will host Bucs at the Dr. Petrus Molemela Stadium on 7 November. The last time these two sides met in the MTN8 was in the final in Durban back in 2015. In the quarter-finals, Orlando Pirates beat Cape Town City 1-0 while Kaizer Chiefs showed character by fighting from a goal down to defeat Maritzburg United. On Sunday afternoon, SuperSport and Celtic will trade blows at Lucas Moripe Stadium. SuperSport are the defending champions of the MTN8. Celtic will go to this game still oozing confidence after pulling off the results that surprised many in the MTN8 quarter-finals, beating Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 at home.
