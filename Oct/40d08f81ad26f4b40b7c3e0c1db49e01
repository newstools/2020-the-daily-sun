KHUTSI Malala and The Clean Up Squad will walk from Joburg to Soshanguve next week. The walk, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, is in partnership with the Heaven’s Defence Force, Katekani and Royal Funerals and aims to recruit 40 drug addicts to volunteer for rehabilitation. Khutsi, founder of Clean Up Squad, said activists would start in Joburg on Tuesday and end at the City of Tshwane offices, where they’ll deliver a memorandum demanding a halfway house be built in Soshanguve. “The following day we’ll continue to Soshanguve Royal Funerals in block AA, where we’ll host a candlelight ceremony and prayer session,” he said. “We want to take 40 users to a seven-week detox programme and help them with skills development and reintegration into their communities for six months.” Khutsi said it was his organisation’s fourth year walking. “We’ve learnt a lot from previous years: such as the fact that seven weeks of rehabilitation isn’t enough,” he said. “We need a halfway house and we believe the city has the resources to help us build it. “On the first day, we’re going straight to Tshwane House. We’ve also changed our recruitment process. “We only want users who volunteer to go to rehab, those who’re serious about getting clean and are not being forced by their parents.” Khutsi said volunteers were encouraged to sort out their medical certificates at local clinics and to open files with social workers. “We’ll give out forms to users and parents. Users are expected to get their forms filled at clinics and come to the centre,” he said.
