MUSICIAN Lungisa Xhamela recently went down memory lane and opened up about a dark time in his life. In a lengthy and emotional post Lungisa, whose career began five years ago when he was a contestant on Idols SA, reflected on a time he went from riches to rags, because he had no gigs to support himself. Because of having no financial support, Lungisa said he lost everything that he owned, including his apartment in Sandton as he had to move and go live in a backroom in Soweto. “Ndisuka uhlala koma Sandton, eating out almost everyday, with new friends every week, uThixo wathi, go back to being humble,” he said. The rising star, who won the best R&B / Soul album at this year’s Samas, also said at some point he had to sell his album from the boot of his car. “Ndithengisa iAlbum yam from the boot of my car fam. And every cent counted,” he said. But even though he had lost everything, Lungisa said he had all that he needed, because there was no day where he went to bed hungry or had no fuel in his car and that was because God sustained him because he said he never stopped praying and being faithful. “I kept on praying & worshipping Him. And yoh that sustained me yazi. Zange ndalala ndingatyanga, njemba abanye abantwana belala belambile. Zange ndangabukeki ndimhle, uThixo covered me.” Lungisa, who never stopped praying and being faithful, said after a while he was able to turn his life around, moved out of the backroom to a decent place and he’s now getting opportunities and being booked frequently. “Moved out to my new place Started getting gig opportunities. “More opportunities kept coming (international features coming up), Won a freaken SAMA the BIGGEST HIGHLIGHT of my career. The call from @IdolsSA came at the perfect time. I’m at such a good place. It’s been one of my dreams to make a return to the show, so tomorrow will be very special for me. I cannot wait to grace that stage again after 5 years. ????????????
