A COP has died after being stabbed in the line of duty. But he was not stabbed by a knife-wielding thug, he was stabbed by a rooster! The Independent UK reports that the cop died on Monday after he broke up an illegal cockfight. “A blade attached to a rooster’s leg sliced through his femoral artery. The sharp metal spur reportedly struck the officer’s leg as he tried to confiscate the bird as evidence of the illegal event on Monday in the central Philippine province of Northern Samar,” according to Filipino officials. Lieutenant Christian Bolok, who headed up the San Jose municipal police station, was rushed to the provincial hospital and declared dead on arrival, local media reported. Another top cop is quoted as telling French news wire Agence France-Presse (AFP): “It was an unfortunate accident and a piece of bad luck that I cannot explain. “I could not believe it when it was first reported to me. This is the first time in my 25 years as a policeman that I lost a man due to a fighting cock’s spur.” The Independent details that cockfighting is popular in the Philippines, with spectators betting on the result of an often deadly fight between two roosters who are often adorned with bladed spurs in place of naturally bony protrusions on their legs, which are removed. But the events have been banned during the coronavirus pandemic in a bid to limit potentially infectious gatherings, with reports of four attendees of a fight testing positive for Covid-19 in August. Three men were bust while many others fled the scene. Cops confiscated seven fighting cocks, two sets of blades and 550 Philippine pesos (R187).
