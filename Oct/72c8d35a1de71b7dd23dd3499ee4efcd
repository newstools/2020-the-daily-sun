OK, enough of the Kit Kat, let me cut to the chase. Since Bar One, I’ve always had this Crunchie feeling that love was this beautiful Aero experience. Whether dark or white, slab or bar, there seems to be something in chocolate that Twix a woman’s heart. P.S., here is the real reason why women love their chocolate. Statistically, women tend to desire chocolate much more than men. This craving may not come from a chocolate deficiency, but there are several components in chocolate that the body may become deficient in, especially magnesium and antioxidants. According to experts, chocolate cravings seem especially tied to hormonal changes (menstruation, pregnancy, etc.) and the magnesium in chocolate, as well as its ability to affect neurotransmitters, may be a large part of the reason. Another reason for women to love their chocolates, like Pharrell once sang, is the happiness that comes with consuming it. Chocolate tastes good and women enjoy eating it, meaning that the body releases dopamine during chocolate consumption. Simply put, chocolate makes women feel happy and frisky. If a way to man’s heart is through food, then the way to her heart is through chocolates, right?
