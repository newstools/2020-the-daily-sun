CHIPPA United Football Club boss Chippa Mpengesi lambasted Mzansi’s millionaires who turn a blind to the poor while bragging about their riches. Mpengesi was speaking at a house handover to gogo Zanyiwe Toli in Mdantsane NU 1 Eastern Cape. Gogo Zanyiwe (73) has three children and 10 grandchildren. They lived in a small shack since her house was burnt down by a mysterious fire last year. Mpengesi stepped in and helped the poor family. He told Daily Sun: “I know the pain and suffering of living in a shack. I could not fold my arms and not help.  “This is the 15th house I’ve donated to the poor. “My target is to donate 100 houses countrywide.” He said the government alone couldn’t build houses for the poor. “This government has produced many millionaires. But some of those millionaires are not ploughing back. Instead, they buy expensive Ferrari’s and do not help the poor,” he said.  Gogo Zanyiwe said: “I was sick because I had sleepless nights. But today I’m healed and feel happy.” Buffalo City Mayor Xola Pakati said: “We saw the plight of this family on social media. We then approached Mpengesi who helped us. He built the house and also bought furniture and food for the family. He’s very generous and this was the second time he helped us.”
