AS the Hawks in Limpopo continue to whip hard, a luxury vehicle worth more than a million registered in the name of the wife of a senior official in the Mogalakwena Municipality in Mokopane has been seized. The Mercedes-Benz GLE 350d Coupe was attached by the Hawks this morning at Ga-Pila Village outside Mokopane in Limpopo. Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, the spokeswoman for the NPA in Limpopo, said the high court in Limpopo had on 30 September ordered the seizure of the car registered in the name of the wife of the implicated deputy manager of technical services in the municipality, David Malepa. Malabi-Dzhangi said in the papers submitted before court, it was revealed that during 2017 a number of service providers of Mogalakwena Local Municipality were coerced into paying money to Mercurius Motors in Polokwane for the purchase of the luxury vehicle. “Malepa had threatened the service providers to pay money into the account numbers he had provided to the said service providers, failing which he would not authorise payments for the services they rendered to the municipality,” said Malabi-Dzhangi. “The service providers paid the total amount of R1 400 000 to Mercurius Motors for the purchase of the Mercedes-Benz motor vehicle. David Malepa registered the Mercedes-Benz motor vehicle in the name of his wife, Paulinah Malepa, who is a teacher,” she said. This follows an application by the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the NPA in Polokwane for a preservation of property order. The Mercedes-Benz is believed to be the proceeds of unlawful activities, namely extortion and money laundering. The preservation of property order was obtained as a result of co-operation between the NPA and the Hawks. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said they seized the car as part of their investigation in the Mogalakwena Municipality.
