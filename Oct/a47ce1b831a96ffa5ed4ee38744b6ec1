SUPPORTERS of embattled Pastor Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, have gathered in numbers outside since the early morning outside the Pretoria Magistrates Court. The controversial couple is expected to appear after being swooped on by the Hawks yesterday. Members of their Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) had organised themselves last night to show up for their 'papa' Bushiri. They sang and marched in front of the court with placards and boards with pictures of the couple. The Bushiris are appearing on fraud charges of an amount of R104 million. The People's Paper reported yesterday that the Hawks went to their house in Tshwane and arrested Mary and Shepherd handed himself over later. According to Hawks' Colonel Katlego Mogale, the couple was arrested after trying to evade the team. This is the second time the couple is being arrested. They were first arrested at a hotel in Rustenburg, North West, last year on charges of fraud, money laundering, and contravening the provision of organised crimes act for offenses they allegedly committed from 2015. One of the charges related to a contravention of exchange control regulations to the tune of about R15 million at the time. Bushiri and his wife are both on bail of R100 000 each and the case was adjourned to 2021.
