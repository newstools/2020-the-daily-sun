THE John Vuli Gate hitmakers have been overwhelmed by all the love from across Mzansi. The Mapara A Jazz crew from Atteridgeville, Tshwane, told Daily Sun they’d been waiting for their big break for 13 long years. Producer and artist Maano Nephawe (29) said they had no idea the song would be this big. He said the idea for the song started at a party in Olievenhoutbosch, when a friend Ntosh Gazi started shouting “John, Vuli gate” while welcoming ladies to the party. “We had no idea it would be this big and we’re still shocked at how much Mzansi loves this tune.” Tshepiso Malatji (31), also a producer, told Daily Sun he met Maano 13 years ago and they recently added a woman to the crew. He said they got very excited when a video of a group of ladies in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, dancing to the song started trending, sparking a new dance challenge. They were working on a video featuring the ladies. Kgolagano Tshepe (22) told Daily Sun working with the crew was a thrill. She first met them at her brother’s birthday last year. “They saw my talent and didn’t hesitate to let me join.” She said they were working on an album to be released soon. “We’ve seen Mzansi loves our song and we can’t wait to give them more hits,” she said. Maano encouraged up-and-coming artists to not give up. “We’ve been in this game for long and we’ve had our challenges.” He said at times they’d even perform at events without payment just to get ahead.
