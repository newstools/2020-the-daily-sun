LULAMA Mvabantu (54)
from Kanana squatter camp in Cape Town doesn’t want to die in a shack. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she has been
waiting to be relocated to her RDP house but that has not happened. “The councillor
has been promising to move us to another place, a better place than this one,
but that is not happening,” said Lulama. She said just before
the lockdown their councillor told them they will be relocated but Covid-19
came and they had to wait. “While we were on
level 3 we asked if we are still going to move to another area. Our councillor
said we are still going to be relocated but now that we are on level 1 he is
quiet,” said Lulama. She is afraid because
there are many fire incidents in shacks. “Staying in a shack is
stressful because when it is raining you get affected and also when there is a
fire we lose everything.” Lulama said she cannot
sleep peacefully because she knows that if anything happens she will not make
it. “There was a time when
other shacks caught fire, I struggled to run outside because of the weight.
That is why I am hoping to get my RDP house,” she said. Ward 40 ANC councillor
Bongani Ngcombolo said the Housing Department is busy with the approvals. “We have submitted all
the needed documents to the department and the committee members have been
updating them, as soon as it is done they will get a report back,” said
Ngcombolo. He said the process
takes a bit longer because the disability category is different as it needs
doctors to be involved. “I am urging them to
wait. As soon as the department comes back to us then we will update them, it
is our wish to see them owning RDP houses,” said Ngcombolo.
