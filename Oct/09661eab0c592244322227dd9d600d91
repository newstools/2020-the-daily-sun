THE National Council of Churches undertook a peace mission to Prophet Paseko “Mboro” Motsoeneng’s Incredible Happenings Ministry Church yesterday. But the mission was less than successful. Leader of the NCC, Dr Monokoane Hlobo, said he arranged a meeting for Mboro and Prophet Shepherd Bushiri to make peace. READ: 'BLESSER'S SNAKE RUINED MY PUNANI!' Mboro had invited people to take part in the meeting. Bushiri's lawyer, Terrance Baloyi, told Daily Sun the council had told them they were going to meet with Mboro first. “They didn’t invite Prophet Bushiri to be there,” he said. Baloyi told Daily Sun on Sunday Bushiri wasn’t at war and blamed Mboro.

Bushiri, in a video said, he believed people are out to hurt him because of his success and called it put-down syndrome. When council representatives realised there were other people and media at the church, they wanted to leave. Outside church, Mboro asked them why they were leaving. “You said you wanted a meeting and I’m here,” said Mboro. “You said you’re talking peace. The people who were scammed are here and they brought proof. ALSO READ: WHY IS LEMON JUICE GOOD FOR THE 4-5? “You don’t want to meet them. You want a private meeting.” Hlobo said they wanted to meet with Mboro first, hear his side of the story, and call people and the media afterwards. “I don’t want people to think I was bought,” said Mboro. “I want everything to happen in front of them.” They agreed to go into the tent. Afterwards, Hlobo said they were satisfied and won’t take sides.
