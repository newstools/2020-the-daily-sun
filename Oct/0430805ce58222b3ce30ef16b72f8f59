KAIZER Chiefs forward Bernard Parker has made peace with the fact that he is not one of the fan favorites at the club. The 34-year-old has gotten used to getting a lot of criticism when the team underperforms. As one of the more experienced players, Parker has often been a target for supporters when things haven't gone well for Amakhosi. Nevertheless, the coaches that he has played under have always had faith him and given him plenty of gametime. Much to the displeasure of some of the club's supporters. Parker has revealed what has kept him in the team consistently for the past ten years he's been at the club. "Its by no Muthi or anything like that," said Parker. "I have heard before that my Muthi is strong. It's not anything like that. It’s because I put my heart and soul into this club. "Since I joined this club 10 years ago I have been adding my value. "I have never been a favorite but I add my value with my versatility and intelligence. "Most people don’t see that but those that know football see it, coaches that coach at the highest level can identify the quality and the value that I add to the team. "I'm a seasoned campaigner, I take my work serious. I focus on positives than negatives. I don’t read the social media stuff."
