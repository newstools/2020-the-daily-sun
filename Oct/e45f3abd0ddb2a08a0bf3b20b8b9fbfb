THE rubble in the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) jungle is very far from being cleared. Just when sports federations across the country thought the storm is finally over now after Barry Hendricks was cleared of all the charges and reinstated to his old position as acting president, then a tornado hits. Hendricks was cleared by the Sascoc council and a decision was taken that the planned DC against him be cancelled and his suspension be reversed. SunSport understands that there is a dispute that has been lodged on Tuesday against Hendricks assuming his old position, as they believe proper processes and channels were not followed during their last special general meeting. According to our informant, Hendricks was already setting up to return to office, but indications are that was too soon for him to count his chickens before they hatched. “There is a communication among those disgruntled members in the board who believe the resolution to reinstate Barry were flawed. They believe it was unlawful and should be nullified, as they are in contravention of the Sascoc constitution.” Another source said a full quorum of board members agree that the decision has to be re-looked to ensure that all loop ends were tightened. Hendricks is on a neck and neck race for the position with Athletics SA’s Aleck Skhosana who took over the position as acting president in Hendricks’ suspension. But now that the date has been issued on 7 November when the new board bearers will be elected, Sascoc still remains in shambles and backroom meeting will certainly decide who assumes the top position. Hendricks is now waiting in the wings as his reinstatement decision hangs in the balance.
