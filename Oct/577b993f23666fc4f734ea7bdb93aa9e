A man believed to be in his 30s was struck and killed by lightning
on a farm in Elandsfontein on Monday evening. ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring said paramedics responded to the
scene at 16h55 and found the man lying motionless. “He was surrounded by a number of his colleagues. “Medics assessed the man and found that he had shown no signs of
life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for him, and he was declared dead,”
Meiring said in a statement. This comes after the South African Weather Services issued a
warning and predicted that there would be thunderstorms associated with severe
lightning and flash floods. Meanwhile, Joburg Disaster Management Centre said it would stay on
high alert as floods continue to wreak havoc in Gauteng. EMS spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun that they were ready
to deal with emergency calls and urged motorists to be extra careful on the
roads. “It’s raining in most parts of the City of Joburg and most roads
are wet and slippery. “Motorists are urged to exercise caution and avoid crossing
flooded roads and bridges,” he said. Mulaudzi advised motorists to use less flooded routes such as the
M1 South Maraisburg.
