I’ve come to notice that people act irresponsibly since the introduction of level 1. There’s no social distancing in many places. They behave as if there never was a coronavirus. Some don’t even want to be sanitised when they enter public places. Failure to wear masks is a big concern, especially ekasi. A second wave will be the worst, thanks to ignorance. I hope a vaccine is found before a second wave hits us. It’s so sad to see people partying and having fun as if there’s no tomorrow. The world is coming to an end. Let’s pray for Africa to prosper.
