FORMER AmaZulu chairman Dr Patrick Sokhela said he had no choice but to sell the club after surviving two strokes. On Friday, AmaZulu confirmed that the club has been sold to the uMlazi businessman Sandile Zungu, who completed the full purchase of the club through his Zungu Investment Company (ZICO) which he owns. These strokes, according to Sokhela, led to him struggling to walk, speak and understand. “I had a stroke. The first one, I was okay and the second one, I was lucky. The man who was helping me was Dr Irvin Khoza (PSL chairman) and he said to me, ‘Patrick, hold on.’” said Sokhela who owned 49 percent shares of the club since 2004. “And I said to him, ‘I can’t take this anymore’. If you get a stroke at the back of your head, it’s over for you. I had to go and talk to Dr Khoza and I said ‘you helped me especially, and sister Mato (Madlala, the PSL acting CEO). All the people when I had a stroke, I couldn’t talk sometimes and I had to use Lunga (Sokhela who was Usuthu GM).” Since AmaZulu bought the PSL status of Thanda Royal Zulu in 2017, controversies has embroiled the club on and off field issues. One of them was the six points docked by the PSL following the directives from Fifa in November 2018. AmaZulu were found guilty of unlawfully terminating the contract of Phineas Nambandi. The Namibian player still had a three-year remaining on his professional contract with Usuthu when the club decided to let him go in 2014. Another stress that Sokhela alluded to was this past season which Usuthu struggled almost the whole term but they survived the relegation axe by finishing 13th on the table. “AmaZulu is a big team. I want you (Mr Zungu) to go over again and I, myself, will support AmaZulu until I die,” added Sokhela. “I also want to thank Isilo (King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu who is the king of Zulus in KZN, and whose family is the founding member of the club in 1932). I told the King ‘I’m tired now’.”
