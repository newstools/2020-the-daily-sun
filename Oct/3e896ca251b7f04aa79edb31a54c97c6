NICHOLAS Nkuna will soon be back on Mzansi’s second most watched soapie, Skeem Saam. The Mpumalanga-born actor will return as Sakhile, a university lecturer. Nicholas, who also plays a doctor on long-running SABC2 soapie 7de Laan, told Daily Sun he was thrilled to return to Skeem Saam as the show was his home. He said: “I’ve been asked to return as the writers have written a new storyline for me. I couldn’t turn them down because the show gave me exposure when I started my career.” The 30-year-old said he will still be appearing on 7de Laan, which wasn’t much of a challenge as both shows were shot at the same location. “I have already started shooting with Skeem Saam and my character will start appearing next month,” he told the People’s Paper. Nicholas said he hoped viewers would embrace his character again. “I hope the viewers will show Sakhile the same love they did years ago. “I know I’ve been away for a while, but I hope they will still remember the dark and handsome man they fell in love with,” he said.
