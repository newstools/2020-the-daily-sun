HIP hop heads Zakwe and Bandile “Dr Bone” Maphalala have honoured late mbaqanga legends Simon “Mahlathini” Nkabinde and the Mahotella Queens in song. They’ve released a single titled KaZet. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zakwe said: “We’re telling a story about KZN. The song also pays tribute to pioneers of the music industry, Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens. “We understand that hip hop is dominant worldwide, but as artists we shouldn’t forget our roots.” The song was released last Friday and the video will be out next week.

The French version is done by French artist Lizzy Mercier Descloux.” Zakwe said they’d been in contact with the Mahotella Queens. “They gave us their blessings. The song has been trending,” he said. Hilda Tloubatla of the Mahotella Queens said: “We feel honoured by Zakwe and Dr Bone. They approached us and we’ve heard the song. We’re very happy they honoured us.” Mahlathini was called the groaner.
