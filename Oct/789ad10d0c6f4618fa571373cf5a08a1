Here are five ways to take care of your virgin hair wig: 1. Give your wig a break – Make sure that you give your wig a break by either having more than just one wig or alternating it with other protective hairstyles so that your wig does not fade fast. 2. Wash it regularly but not too often – Just like your own hair, washing your wig too much might shorten its lifespan. So, the proper hair care that you give to your own hair also applies to your wigs. 3. Detangle it – It is important not to use a brush when your wig is tangled because it can be too harsh. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb so that knots can be detangled first. 4. Avoid overheating it – Put away the flat iron sometimes. If you have washed your wig, let it air dry rather than using a hairdryer. 5.Proper storage – If you are using your wig regularly, you might want to invest in a wig stand to avoid having to iron it every day. When storing it, make sure it is in a cool and dry place.
