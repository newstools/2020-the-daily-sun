Police should crack down on nightclubs that violate lockdown regulations. People forget that Covid-19 spreads quickly in groups. It’s not surprising that Covid-19 cases have started to rise again. Alcohol drinkers forget to wear face masks and to keep their distance. Club owners only think about making profit and don’t care about the well-being and safety of their customers. People are aware that under lockdown regulations, no one is allowed to be out and about after midnight without a permit. Instead of worrying about a possible second wave of Covid-19, people drink all night in places where they’re likely to be infected. The midnight curfew must be adhered to, period. Pretoria North
