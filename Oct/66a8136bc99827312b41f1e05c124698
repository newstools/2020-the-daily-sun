“I, ___, take thee, ___, to be my wedded husband/wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.” There was a time that these words were something every boy and girl would look forward to reciting at some stage of their lives. From our nursery days, playing mum and dad was indication that the idea of having a family and marriage was a benchmark. Has that changed? In other words, do people still want to get married? According to the latest official figures from the Office of National Statistics (2012), there is a significant decrease in the number of marriages over the last two generations. The number of men getting married between 1971 and 2011 has decreased by 63%, while the number of women tying the knot has more than halved. Furthermore, not only are fewer people getting married, they are waiting longer to say I do. Couples who walked down the aisle in their early 20s now nearly have to wait a decade or two to tie the knot. In addition, more and more people are filing for divorce. So the question is: do you still want to say I do?
