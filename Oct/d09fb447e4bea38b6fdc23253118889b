THE case against former minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife, Norma Mngoma, has been postponed to 12 February 2021. Norma appeared at the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria for allegedly damaging a luxury vehicle belonging to her husband’s friend. The matter was pending the outcome of the motion Mngoma had launched in the Gauteng High Court, Tshwane, challenging the validity of her arrest and the warrant for her arrest. During her court appearance yesterday, the court heard that Mngoma was in contact with state witnesses.  The state indicated they had a sworn affidavit of the attempts made by Mngoma. Magistrate Thandi Theledi warned Mngoma to steer clear of interfering with state witnesses or she will risk losing her bail. She told her that if she does it again, she would be in contempt of the court order. Her lawyer, Victor Nkhwashu, said he had also warned his client, since being made aware by the state, not to speak to any of the state witnesses while the matter was ongoing. He said he has informed his client that she is not to speak to any of the state’s witnesses and if any contact is to be made, it should be done only through him.
