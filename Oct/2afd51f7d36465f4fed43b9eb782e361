FORMER Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is fighting for his life in
ICU at an undisclosed private hospital in Joburg. His lawyer Daniel Witz told Daily Sun today, that there has
been no improvement since he was in ICU from Monday. "There has been no change, he's still in a serious
condition in that serious condition." Agrizzi was moved from a public hospital to a private
hospital early this week. Witz said the only reason he was moved was because the
public hospital that Agrizzi was admitted at from week did not have the ICU
high care beds available. "The doctors, together with the department of
Correctional Services recommend that he goes to a private hospital because they
couldn't care for him at the public hospital because the beds were full and it
doesn't matter who you are you don't get special treatment," he said. The whistle-blowing Agrizzi had medical complications after
spending one night in prison after he was denied bail by the specialised
commercial crimes court sitting in Palm Ridge. During his bail application, Agrizzi appeared in court
carrying an oxygen mobile unit and medics deployed to court. Due to his hospitalisation, Agrizzi couldn't appear for
another matter at Specialised Commercial Crimes court in Pretoria, where he was
released on bail earlier this year.
