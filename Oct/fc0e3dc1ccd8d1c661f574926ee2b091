Clean hands prevent the spread of diseases and save lives. That’s why we must regularly wash our hands with soap and water to keep them clean at all times. Washing hands with soap and water is an easy, effective and affordable way to prevent diseases. Hands are the most common highways for the transmission and spread of bacteria and viruses that cause diseases, resulting in people being hospitalised or dying. The regular and proper washing of hands is so important in saving lives that in 2008 the United Nations proclaimed 15 October a Global Handwashing Day. This year the day was celebrated under the theme “Hand Hygiene for All”, a call to make hand hygiene a reality for all. It’s a call to create a culture of regular handwashing as hand hygiene is everybody’s business. Global Handwashing Day is a reminder to all the world’s citizens to wash hands regularly with soap – especially after using the toilet – changing baby’s nappies, touching waste before and after preparing food, and after touching any surfaces. The day is now more important than ever before, as we’re faced with the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. One of the ways to prevent the spread of this killer virus is to regularly wash our hands with soap and water, or sanitise with alcohol-based sanitisers. Government has made noticeable provisions as part of the Covid-19 interventions by providing water tanks to ensure easy access to water for communities in rural and informal areas. This is commendable and government must reliably supply water to communities to entrench the culture of hand-washing and make hand hygiene a norm. Clean hands mean healthy communities. So let’s all adopt hand hygiene as our healthy habit. Letter by Themba Khoza
