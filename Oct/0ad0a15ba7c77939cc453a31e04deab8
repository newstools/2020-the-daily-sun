Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has revealed what the club’s plan could be for the new players that have been training with his team. Chiefs had roped in three free agents to train with the team with the hope of officially signing them this season had the club been successful in their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. This week, however, CAS revealed that they had dismissed Chiefs’ request to have the FIFA ban overturned meaning they can’t register any new players for two transfer windows. The players, goalkeeper Brandon Petersen, defender Sifiso Hlanti and midfielder Phathutshedzo Nange, can now not be able to feature for Chiefs until 1 July 2021. But speaking at the MTN8 press conference on Thursday, Hunt said the club would discuss the plan for these players going forward as they can’t go that long without any action. "Right now, I'm going to have a meeting with the chairman, as we finish here, about those players and we're going to see what's going to happen," said Hunt. "Possibly we'll have to loan them out to get some playing time, we can't leave a player not playing for so long, but I mean that's one of the options. I'm not sure what he thinks, but we'll discuss that."
