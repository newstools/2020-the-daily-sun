The goal came after Khune mistimed his attempted clearance from a corner-kick and the Namibian star forward beat Daniel Cardoso to the ball to head the Brazilians into the lead. Khune complained to the referee as he felt he was impeded by Themba Zwane, but the goal stood as Sundowns managed the rest of the half well enough to for a 1-0 lead at the break. Erasmus, who recently joined Sundowns from Cape Town City made it 2-0 scoring on his debut in the 54th minute of the match.
