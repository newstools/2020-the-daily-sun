WITH the final exams around the corner, pupils focus is on their studies and not supporting an arrested fellow pupil. The 19-year-old pupil was bust after he splashed his teacher with kak on Tuesday. The incident happened at Mophate Secondary School in Kgotsong near Bothaville, Free State. The story was published in Daily Sun yesterday. After the pupil’s arrest, other pupils held a march demanding his release. But they threw in the towel when they realised they weren’t going to win. So they decided to rather focus on their studies. A grade 12 pupil told Daily Sun: “This was not a good year. We’re behind and the exams are around the corner. A schoolmate has caused problems and some pupils thought we should support him. “That’ll be more wasted time. He committed a crime and should man up.” Another pupil said: “Mob justice doesn’t work.We sometimes think what is done by the majority is a cool thing. I was there because of the majority, but I came to my senses when I saw the cops.” The arrested pupil was also suspended from school for five days. Free State education spokesman Howard Ndaba said: “We managed to talk to the pupils and they understood our concerns. “They wanted to know what happened to the pupil. Everything is back to normal.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele told Daily Sun: “Grade 12 pupils in support of the arrested pupil marched to Bothavillle Magistrates Court. It was a peaceful march and POP members monitored the situation. The arrested pupil was released on R500 bail after he was charged with common assault and common assault with threats.
