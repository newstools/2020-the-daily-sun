NEW GladAfrica Championship side Royal AM chief executive, Sinky Mnisi, has confirmed that PSL chairman Dr Irvin Khoza convinced him to finally agree to sell Highlands Park. Mnisi, speaking from Royal AM’s club house in Pietermaritzburg, a club bought by businesswoman Shawn Mkhize buying Real Kings’ status, was against Highlands being sold, but Khoza made him understand the sense behind the selling of the brand. He revealed that he had to succumb to pressure and signed for the sale to take place with Tim Sukazi’s TS Galaxy. “Let me put this clear, Dr Khoza phoned me for the transfer to go through because it had huge repercussions,” said Mnisi. “Highlands Park wouldn’t have been sold without me, but I had to agree after I spoke to the chairman of the PSL. “They (Larry Brookstone and Brad Kaftel) gave me an offer which I won’t reveal how much it was. But I was quite happy,” added Mnisi with a smile. After the Mpumalanga-born Mnisi was unattached, he said there were plenty of clubs who wanted him to be part of their administration but he refused. One of the offers came from Galaxy but he knew things won’t work with Sukazi after how the whole purchase of his beloved club went about. However, the structure of Royal AM caught Mnisi’s attention. AM’s structure is headed by Andile Mpisane (19) as a chairman and the president is Shauwn Mkhize, who was previously known as Mpisane. But she retained her surname after a bitter split with her ex-husband Sbu Mpisane. “This club’s got everything,” said Mnisi. “I think what was lacking before was someone like me who is streetwise and who understands football.”
