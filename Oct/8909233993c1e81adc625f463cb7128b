BIZARRE male fashion trends have been in the spotlight, from lace underwear to cute rompers. There is a revolution in the men’s fashion and beauty industry as we are seeing men getting their own makeup lines and certain wardrobe choices that might be questioned by many people. But that isn’t stopping them from living their best fashion lives. READ: MEN LACE UNDERWEAR NOW A TREND! A streetwear brand, RompHim, introduced a line of pastel, see-through lace shorts and button-downs just for men for about $100 (about R1 600) a set.   This outfit trended on social media as people had a lot to say about it. The outfit, created by Hoza Rodriguez under the Hologram City brand, comes in pistachio, pink, baby blue, violet, and yellow. The collar and white belt are the least see-through part of the ensemble, with tightie-whities peeking through the lace.
