QUEEN was taught good principles as a child. “I’m not a thief,” said Queen Khumalo (38) from Umlazi, KZN. She learnt as a little girl at the feet of her gogo, Nonono, that stealing harms the person you take from and also yourself. Queen, a domestic worker, said she was heartbroken when her employer accused her of stealing R10 000. “I did no such thing. Maybe it was his excuse to fire me,” she said. “Neighbours warned me from the first day I started working there. “They told me workers don’t last a month there, but I didn’t listen.” Queen said the signs were there, but she ignored them. “I was shouted at for using a feather duster to clean his computer and for using the vacuum cleaner in the garage. “Just like the neighbours warned me, my job lasted only two months and I was fired.” Queen then joined a family that didn’t pay on time. “They bought food for the pets, but when it came to paying me there were always excuses. When I asked for payment they pretended as if they’d forgotten.” Queen said she became a domestic worker after she lost four of her family members in one year. “It was after matric. My mother, gogo and younger sisters all died. “My dreams of becoming a social worker were shattered.” Queen is a member of Sheila’s domestic workers organisation, which found her a new job. She speaks highly of her new employer. “They’re younger than me but they respect me. I love their humility.”
