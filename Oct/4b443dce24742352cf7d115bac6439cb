BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic are getting their act together as they build their squad for the coming season, which will be the busiest in the club’s history. The Free State outfit have retained the services of Justice Chabalala on loan from Orlando Pirates. The club also extended the deals of Given Mashikinya and Lucky Baloyi, with the players’ contracts having expired last month. Siwelele completed a successful season, finishing eighth in the Premiership and reaching the Nedbank Cup final. Andile Fikizolo also had his contract extended for another year after his impressive showing last season. The 26-year-old Fikizolo joined the club at the beginning of last term on a short-term deal after leaving Royal Eagles. The Mangaung club have also flexed their muscles in this transfer window by snapping former AmaZulu and Uthongathi FC striker, Menzi Ndwandwe. Celtic CEO, Khumbulani Konco, confirmed they signed Ndwandwe. “We also have some trialists (training with us), but I cannot say more at this stage.” Celtic need extra players as they will feature in four local competitions and the Caf Confederation Cup next season. Siwelele booked their place in the preliminary round of the Caf Confederation Cup for the first time in the club’s history after finishing runners up to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup final. The winners of all national cup competitions qualify for the Confederations Cup but as Downs qualified for the more prestigious Caf Champions League by virtue of winning the Premiership, Celtic qualified as runners up for the continental competition. The club is said to be assessing their former winger Danny Venter, who was recently released by Golden Arrows. Venter was with Celtic when they won the Telkom Knockout trophy in 2012 before leaving to join Celtic’s provincial rivals Free State Stars. “The signing and the retention of players form part of making sure that we beef up the squad because we know the challenges that lie ahead,” added Konco.
