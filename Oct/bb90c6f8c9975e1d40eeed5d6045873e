MURDER accused Sekwetje Isaiah Mahlamba maintained he would plead not guilty to the murder and robbery charges. Mahlamba was testifying during his bail application at the Senekal Magistrates Court in Free State earlier where he and his co-accused Sekola Piet Matlaletsa appeared in connection with the murder of Brendin Horner. Bloody clothes were confiscated by the police for DNA testing. Mahlamba said the blood stains on the clothes was of a sheep he slaughtered at a traditional ceremony that he attended in the area on the last Saturday of last month. When he was asked if he had been at the deceased’s house, he said he had never been to Horner’s residence. Mahlamba said: “No, I don’t even know where he stays.” The state said a witness gave a statement that they had seen the two accused coming from the direction of the farm with bloodied clothes. Mahlamba maintained he was not there and that he only knows his co-accused as someone who lives in the neighbourhood. The state asked where he was on the night of 1 October, through to the morning of the next day.  He said he was with his girlfriend. But according to the statement his girlfriend gave, she wasn’t with him the whole night. Again claims that he was at a traditional ceremony, where he slaughtered a sheep, were contradicted by the statement that a witness, only named as Pinky, gave. Pinky denied that Mahlamba was at the traditional ceremony or that he slaughtered a sheep.  He, however, insisted he was there. Mahlamba is out on bail for another matter. He had been arrested for stock theft and will return to court next year. He said: “I am asking for bail because I don’t know anything about the incident and I am ready to face the public.” The court case was attended by Police Minister Bheki Cele, State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo, EFF leader Julius Malema and EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu.
