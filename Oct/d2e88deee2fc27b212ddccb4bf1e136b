NEW Al Ahly fitness coach, Kabelo ”KB” Rangoaga, has paid
tribute to his head coach, Pitso Mosimane, and expressed gratitude to his long-time ally. Rangoaga has joined Mosimane at the Egyptian giants, as part
of his technical team, which also includes assistant Cavin Johnson and
performance analyst Musi Matlaba. The two achieved unparalleled success at Mamelodi Sundowns,
including winning the 2016 Caf Champions League. ”I feel happy and ready to face the challenge together with
the technical team led by Coach Pitso. It’s a huge responsibility bestowed on
us and a great honour to contribute to Al Ahly’s already illustrious history of
success, ” said Rangoaga, as he opened for the first time since Egyptian move.  The new technical team has hit the ground running in Cairo,
winning their first match as the Red Devils edged Al Mokawloon 1-0 in their
league fixture on Sunday. ”Coach Pitso took me to Bafana Bafana as an observer to
learn, ahead of the 2009 Fifa Confederation Cup, ” continued Rangoaga. ”He then asked me to come and work with him at Sundowns in
2014 and now we’re here together at Al Ahly. I’d like to express my sincerest
gratitude to him. ”He took a boy from a rural area and believed in him and
allowed him to shine under his guidance & leadership.” #TalentCaché : Lui, c'est Kabelo Rangoaga, préparateur physique de formation.
