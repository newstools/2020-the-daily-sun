CRICKET South Africa (CSA) national women’s squad has gathered for the second national training camp at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom. Physical conditioning and a lot of cricket are on the cards for the Momentum Proteas at their second national training camp, which started yesterday. The 21-player squad, which comprises of Proteas, high performance and national academy players, will be put through their paces as they work their way back to fitness and match sharpness after the long layoff due to the coronavirus pandemic. Head coach, Hilton Moreeng, has expressed his desire to see the progress of some of the young players who are coming into this camp to rub shoulders with some of the senior players. “The camp is always a great opportunity to take stock of where everyone is at following the lengthy break due to the pandemic, and to plot our development for an important international season ahead. “We’ll be looking to test out the players’ physical readiness, mentally and set a standard ahead of what will be expected of them at international level and also to assist the younger players by integrating them with the more experienced players. “We have assembled a strong backroom staff in the form of a new assistant coach, Dillon du Preez with the dedicated skill of looking after the bowlers. “We are also excited to have Zane Webster as the strength conditioning coach. “The support around the team has never been better, and we are determined to make the most of it.” Missing from the camp are players competing in the Women’s Big Bash League, Dane van Niekerk, Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp, Laura Wolvaardt, Nadine de Klerk, Lizelle Lee, Mignon du Preez and Chloe Tryon, who will all be departing for Australia tomorrow. The squad will be in camp until Friday.
