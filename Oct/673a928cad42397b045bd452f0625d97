POPULAR DJ and producer, De Mogul wants to teach Shaun 101, Soulful G and Soa Mattrix a lesson. He claims their hit uThando is the same as his track Ungowam, featuring Ami Faku. His track was released last year. De Mogul said he asked his lawyers to deal with the three as there were rules to follow when using someone’s music.  Ever listened to a beautiful new single, only to feel like you've heard it somewhere before? Is it my brain playing trick on me? Or luchuku?... but the "Uthando" song by Soa Mattrix & Soulful G, the melody is fundamentally identical to that of Ami Faku and De Mogul SA... pic.twitter.com/gfXVx6R6mM  “I felt disrespected. No one ever contacted either me or Ami, or our labels to ask for permission,” he said. “Someone just sent me a clip of the song on WhatsApp asking if I did a remix of Ungowam, and that was the first time I heard it. I contacted my manager to follow it up and no one knew anything about it.” De Mogul said he approached Shaun 101 and asked him not to release the song, but he did it anyway. “He told me he didn’t hear any similarities between our songs. I decided to go the legal route. My lawyers are dealing with the matter. I can’t say more.” De Mogul said he didn’t want them to credit him or retract the song, he only wanted to teach them a lesson. “Amapiano producers and vocalists need to understand that as music makers, we don’t just decide to do things. “Copyright infringement is a serious matter and they need to know such,” he said. Shaun 101’s manager, Mduduzi Tshabalala, said they didn’t want to comment.“Our distributor, Electromode, is currently handling this matter. That’s all I can say about this,” he said. Other groups members could not be reached for comment at the time of going to print.
