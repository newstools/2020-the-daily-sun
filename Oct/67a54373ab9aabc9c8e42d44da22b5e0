TONGUE twisters can really test oneâ€™s tongue ability. Depending on the tongue twister, your ability to use your tongue is tested, and much like oral sex, your ability to communicate with your tongue can drive a woman to a sexual craze. But women also like to give. According to recent stats, women prefer to go down south on a man more than any other sexual activity. A recent survey shows that the act is fast becoming common, as oral sex is now extremely popular among teenagers and young adults. The study further revealed that women between the ages of 18-25 preferred to have oral sex because of the strong sexual esteem that comes with it. 70% of women can only orgasm if their clitoris is stimulated directly with lips, tongue, fingers or items such as vibrators, while the other 30% of women can climax through vaginal intercourse. If you are a betting person, you can certainly place your bets on oral sex when it comes to pleasing her in the bedroom.
