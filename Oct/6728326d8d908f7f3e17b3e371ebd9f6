IN just a few days, Mzansi will get to celebrate the crowning of Miss South Africa 2020. The main event will take place at the Table Bay Hotel in Cape Town ahead of the Miss South Africa 2020 pageant on Saturday. Many fans are looking forward to seeing the reigning Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi meet her successor Miss South Africa 2019 Sasha-Lee Olivier for the first time in person since the Covid-19 lockdown. Sasha-Lee said: “If you didn’t bake or make banana bread then you weren’t in lockdown! Seriously, it has been a different reign for both of us and has been difficult at times as being Miss South Africa is a very hands-on role. However, we had to learn to carry on and our voices were amplified in the virtual space. I felt defeated at first but soon learnt the importance of being resilient.” Zozi said travel was a huge part of the Miss Universe job and she missed human interaction. However, as the lockdown continued, she realised her message didn’t die and travel doesn’t make you a good Miss Universe ambassador. She ended up going to so many countries “virtually”. “It was challenging being cut off from what was happening in South Africa and the African continent. Despite the corruption and the negativity, humanity is still alive. People showed up for each other.” Both women said they were impressed with this year’s candidates, saying they all have different voices and stand for different things. “Whoever wins is going to be a great ambassador for this country. We wish her well.” The Top 10 Miss SA finalists who come from around the country are Aphelele Mbiyo, Busisiwe Mmotla, Chantelle Pretorius, Jordan van der Vyver, Karishma Ramdev, Lebogang Mahlangu, Melissa Nayimuli, Natasha Joubert, Shudufhadzo Musida and Thato Mosehle. The show will be televised live – across the continent – on M-Net DStv channel 101 and Mzansi Magic DStv channel 161 at 5pm. A live online stream with exclusive behind the scenes content is also available.
