THE medical condition of former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi seems to be getting worse each day. Yesterday he suffered a heart attack but was quickly resuscitated by doctors. That was the update by his lawyer, Daniel Witz, who spoke to Daily Sun today. “He suffered a heart attack, the doctors managed to resuscitate him quickly and thereafter they stabilised him. Obviously he’s still in a critical condition. He’s currently on dialysis and a ventilator.” Witz said due to his hospitalisation, Agrizzi cannot attend to any of the criminal cases that he should be attending. Last Friday, he was supposed to appear at the Commercial Crimes Court in Tshwane but he was in hospital. “He was supposed to appear, it was postponed due to medical reasons. He won’t be able to appear at any court nor can he assist with testimony at the state capture at the moment,” Witz said. Agrizzi was admitted to a public hospital last Wednesday, after spending one night in jail after he was denied bail at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in Palm Ridge. Due to the shortage of ICU beds, the Bosasa whistle-blower was then moved to a private hospital earlier this week.
