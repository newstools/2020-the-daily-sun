SINGER and songwriter Niniola has dropped her highly anticipated album, Colours and Sounds. This is a new high for the Nigerian-born songstress, who gained prominence and international recognition when she released her hit song Maradona. Over the years, Niniola has worked hard and she has claimed her throne as she is considered the Queen of Afro house music and has been endorsed by international giants such as Beyonce and Drake. In her new album, which is produced by American musician Timbaland, she incorporates influences from South Africa’s hypnotic amapiano sound to Jamaican dancehall and elements of vintage Afrobeat.

Even though her main genre is Afro house, she is diverse, and Niniola said she can do other genres. It’s evident in her recent album. “Even though my root genre is Afro house, I can do it all: R&B, pop, folk. So I am basically a girl of many colours and sounds,” she said. Her 13-track album is available on all digital platforms. COLOURS and SOUNDS !!! ALBUM OUT NOW!!! Pls BUY , STREAM and SHARE !!!
