Trevor
Noah’s Born a Crime has been announced as the winner of this year’s SA Book
Awards. This was
revealed at a virtual ceremony hosted by the South African Booksellers
Association (SABA). A record
number of booksellers voted for a shortlist of bestselling titles published in
2019 in South Africa and written by South African authors in each category. Born a
Crime was also announced as the winner of the Children’s award. On
accepting his award Trevor said: “Writing a book was a very scary experience
but turning the book into a book specifically for kids was even scarier because
children have a very short attention span if your book is boring!.” He went on
to thank all the kids who read the book, the parents who read the book with
their children, the booksellers who sold the book, and the teachers who
recommended the book to their students. Nielsen
stated that the book received the highest number of votes and Trevor Noah was
the clear favourite among booksellers. On
receiving the news Trevor said: “This book was my blood, sweat, and tears. It
was my family’s story and my country’s story”. He went on
to praise South African authors, saying they have the most amazing and
inspirational stories to tell, encouraging them to continue writing them down
so they can be shared with the rest of the world.
