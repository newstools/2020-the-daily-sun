A NEW reality show, Ingane Yam, is coming to Mzansi Magic this month. The show, hosted by Real Housewives of Johannesburg star Lethabo Lejoy Mathatho, will make its debut on 20 October. The show will narrate the stories of parents who will introduce their illegitimate children to their spouses and families after years of hiding them. Mzansi Magic released a statement about the show. “The reality show will take viewers on a journey of self-exploration as it delves into the everyday life of ordinary characters and their stories. It zooms in on the big question why parents hide children from their past and how their families react to the big reveal of the child, who until this point has been an outsider. It is also set to evoke the emotions of the viewers as it shows how children suffer by being denied their true identity, and how they deal with rejection from people who should be taking care of them,” read the statement. The Director of Local Entertainment Channels at M-Net, Nomsa Philiso said: “Mzansi Magic continues to be a beacon of African storytelling and this new show fits the bill. From emotions of neglect, curiosity, a search for a sense of belonging to closure, this show mirrors the real struggles that so called ‘illegitimate’ children are faced with as they navigate their daily lives and viewers would not want to miss what we have in store for them.” Catch Ingane Yam on Mzansi Magic channel 161 on Tuesdays at 8pm.
