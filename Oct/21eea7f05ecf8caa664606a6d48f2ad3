THE City of Cape Town is implementing recovery plans to attend to potholes following the hard lockdown and winter rains. Portfolio chairman for transport, Councillor Angus Mckenzie, said motorists in areas such as Marikana, Samora, Browns Farm and Khayelitsha had complained that potholes were putting their lives at risk. Motorist Luzuko Pewula told Daily Sun he was almost robbed because the potholes forced him to drive very slowly. “Criminals use these potholes to rob us because when you slow your car, they come and take everything,” he said. Yanga Dyani said: “We had hijackings before, but we were able to drive away fast. Now you can’t do that because your car tyres will burst.” She said she was hopeful after hearing the city was planning to fix the potholes. “I believe hijackings and robberies will decrease as soon as the city fixes all the potholes.” Mckenzie said between July last year and March, the city attended to more than 17 415 potholes at a cost of R43 million. He said when level five lockdown started, roads and stormwater services were not considered essential according to national regulations. “Lockdown has resulted in the roads and stormwater depots reducing their workforce to only a small number attending to emergencies.” Mckenzie said lockdown meant the municipality couldn’t conclude its winter readiness programme, which was vital to preparing for the rainy season. “Water ingress is one of the key contributors to the formation of potholes and the winter readiness programme focuses on cleaning blockages or potential blockages in time for the winter rains.” He said the transport department was focusing on dealing with backlogs and looking at new and better ways of delivering services. “The city understands the frustration felt by residents and asks for their continued patience while we tackle the backlog,” he said.
