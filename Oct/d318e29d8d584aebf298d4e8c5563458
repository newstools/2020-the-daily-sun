 Northern Cape police have offered a R50 000 reward for information about the four suspects who shot a man in his hospital bed in Kimberley. The four suspects were dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE) when they entered Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Hospital and shot and killed a patient. The gang also stole the cellphones of other patients in the ward and unplugged the telephone at the nurses' station before making their getaway, according to provincial police spokesperson Colonel Mashay Gamieldien. "The police in the Northern Cape have offered a R50 000 reward for any information that could lead to the apprehension, arrest and conviction of the four suspects who were involved in the fatal shooting of Deon Mkwanazi, 38, at the Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Hospital on 25 September," said Gamieldien.
