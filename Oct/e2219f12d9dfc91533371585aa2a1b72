THE Ntshongas and Gwintas from Khayelitsha BM section, Cape Town, are having sleepless nights. Their kids went missing on Thursday! Seven-year-old Linathi Ntshonga’s dad, Lungisani, (39) said he started to panic at about 7pm.  “At first I thought he was playing outside and would come back before the news started. “We always watch the news together. I started to panic at 7.30pm and went looking for him, but didn’t find him.” He said a resident told him he saw his son on the back of a truck relocating people from the area to Bosasa. Linathi’s aunt, Noluthando Xhego, said: “We need prayers. Bad things have been happening to kids. We can’t sleep or eat since the kid’s disappearance.” Mum Thembakazi Gwinta (30) said they’d been searching around Khayelitsha for Miyolo (7) with no luck. “We urge South Africans to help us find our kids. We ask anyone who might see unknown kids in their area to contact the police.” Thembakazi said this wasn’t the first time her son had gone missing.  She said: “The last time he was able to show people where he lived and told them his name. “What stops him from doing that now? But I trust they’ll come home alive.” Linathi was wearing green tracksuit trousers and a striped polo neck and maroon tekkies when he disappeared. Miyolo was wearing black tracksuit trousers with a navy top and flip flops. Captain Colonel Andre Traut said: “The kids were reported missing by their parents. “Anyone with information may contact the Khayelitsha family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit on 082 301 8910 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
