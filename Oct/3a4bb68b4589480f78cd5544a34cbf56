THE case against one of the three cops implicated in the murder of Nateniel Julies was postponed. Nateniel (16), who had Down Syndrome, was killed not far from his home in Eldorado Park in August. Yesterday, Sergeant Foster Netshiongolo (37) was expected to appear in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto for his bail application, but only his newly-appointed lawyer Onke Maseti arrived. The case was therefore postponed to 29 October to give the new lawyer the opportunity to familiarise himself with the records of the previous bail proceedings, and present new evidence. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said: “Unfortunately, the previous legal representative was not before court to state reasons as to why he will no longer proceed in this case. We will wait for him to state his reasons as law requires.” Mjonondwane also said a request was sent for Netshiongolo to be brought before court from Joburg Correctional Services. Netshiongolo faces charges of murder as an accessory after the fact, unlawful possession of ammunition and defeating the ends of justice. He, along with his co-accused Sergeant Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvane and Constable Caylene Whiteboy (23), were denied bail last month and their case was postponed to 6 November. However, last week the state was informed Netshiongolo would bring new evidence for his bail application. The court heard on the night of Nateniel’s murder, Netshiongolo was booked off sick, but he went to the crime scene as instructed by Ndyalvane and tampered with evidence. He planted ammunition to make it seem as if there was a shoot-out between the cops and an unknown person. He also covered Nateniel’s blood with soil. Magistrate David Mhango said Netshiongolo knew very well he was tampering with the scene of crime.
