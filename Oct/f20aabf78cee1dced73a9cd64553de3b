MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia has confirmed that his captain Richard Ofori is on his way to join Orlando Pirates. What is missing now is Pirates to agree personal terms with the Ghanaian number one to move before he moves to the Soweto giants. Ofori has been with the Team of Choice since the beginning of the 2017-18 season. SunSport reported a few days ago that the Ghanaian goalie, who was recently named as his country’s vice captain, is joining Pirates. Pirates are looking at shoring up their goalkeeper department since they will compete in the Caf Confederation Cup next season. The move, according to SunSport sources, is just a formality now as both clubs have agreed on the fee and the deal will be completed before the end of the week. “We have allowed Orlando Pirates to open talks with the player,” said Kadodia at the club’s player and coach unveiling on Tuesday. “Currently, that is where the negotiations are. Once that is complete, the club will make an announcement.” Ofori’s move will end speculations about the player that Pirates have been tracking throughout the window. Ofori is set to join quite a growing list of players who have boarded the Bucs ship in recent times. Pirates signed Fortune Makaringe and Siphesihle Ndlovu from Maritzburg at the beginning last season. Maritzburg have identified Brandon Petersen as Ofori's replacement. Petersen is a free agent after leaving the now defunct Bidvest Wits and he’s one of players that were not kept by the new Limpopo side after buying the DStv Premiership status of Wits.
