ACTOR and musician, Young Prince, has scored himself a role on e.tv’s soapie Rhythm City. The talented young man will be playing the role of Tefo. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said: “I was really happy when I was called for the role and it showed me that God exists “The callback came after I was told that I didn’t get casted because I look young. But they later changed their mind and told me I got the role.” The talented actor said brining Tefo to life has not been easy. “Stepping out of my shoes and bringing Tefo to life has not been easy. But it’s a challenge that I am willing to take. “He’s a very chilled and outspoken guy and the viewers are going to love him and will find him very relatable,” he said.

Young Prince also has a new single out O Dese, featuring DJ Harrycane, which he has dedicated to Kea Jan. “Kea is always looking good and when I saw her I immediately went like ‘Meddy o Dese maan’ and that’s where the inspiration of the song came from. “It didn’t take a lot of time recording. I went for a studio session and I did my thing,” he said. The young artist, who draws musical inspiration from rapper Boity and DJ Maphorisa, said he hopes his song goes global.
