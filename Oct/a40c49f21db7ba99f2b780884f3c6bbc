IT’S redemption time for erstwhile International Boxing Organisation (IBO) welterweight champion Thulani ‘‘Evolution’’ Mbenge. He will break 15 months of inactivity when he trades leather with Mardochee Kuvesa Katembo from the Democratic Republic of Congo at the Klipspruit Sports Centre in Soweto on Saturday. The slugfest between the two gladiators is going to headline a TLB Boxing Promotions fight extravaganza dubbed ‘‘Still Alive And Punching’’, which is bankrolled by the Gauteng Department of Sport. The vacant African Boxing Union (ABU) welterweight title is going to be at stake during Mbenge’s fight against Katembo. ‘‘I’m excited and happy to be one of the guys featured now that boxing is back. I don’t feel like I have something to prove,’’ said Mbenge, the current South African Boxer of the Year. ‘‘Obviously, there is pressure because people want to see me back. I have to really perform in this fight. People are going to see more boxing in this fight as I’m more of a boxer than a fighter. I will definitely box this guy and I don’t see him going the full distance. I have seen him fight and I know what to expect. Fans must expect boxing, sweet science 101. I’m confident about winning this fight.’’ Initially, the fight between Mbenge and Katembo was set to take place at the Riviera on Vaal (City of Sedibeng) in March this year, however the duel had to be postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ‘‘Some of us are not only doing boxing, we are also personal trainers and Covid-19 affected us in a big way,” said the former South African welterweight king said. “I’m happy that we are back. We also have to remember that Covid-19 is still around and people continue to test positive.’’ Mbenge’s fight against Katembo is going to give the East London-born boxer a chance to redeem himself after he suffered his first defeat to German boxer Sebastian Formella in an IBO welterweight contest in Germany last in July.
