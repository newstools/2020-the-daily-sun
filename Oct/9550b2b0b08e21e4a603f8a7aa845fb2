PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has wished Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize and his wife well as the couple battle the killer virus after testing positive. Mkhize on Sunday night revealed that he and his wife Dr May Mkhize had tested positive on Saturday. He had revealed that they had decided to test after experiencing mild symptoms and the results had confirmed their status. Mkhize assured the nation that he and the wife were positive and would triumph over the virus, and said they were in isolation at home. The Presidency in a statement on Monday morning said Ramaphosa wished them a speedy recovery. “The President wishes the Mkhizes a safe and restful recovery and joins the minister in calling on all South Africans to remain careful and do all we need to do to keep safe and help the country avoid a second wave of the pandemic,” it said. Zweli’s infection comes amid rising fears that the country could be headed for a second wave as the infections continue to sour, recording about 2000 new cases per day. When Ramaphosa downgraded the country to alert level 1 since 20 September, new cases being recorded at the time were below a thousand. But new cases have picked up, raising fears that a second wave was on the way. As of last night, 1662 were recorded and the number of those who died was sitting at 18 471.
