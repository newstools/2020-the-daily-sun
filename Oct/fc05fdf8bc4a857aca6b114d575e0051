A MAN who was accused of killing his girlfriend and stabbing his 18-month-old baby girl has been sentenced. The accused, Vincent Chabalala (40), pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder charges. He appeared before Judge Thando Mankge at the Mpumalanga High Court in Delmas yesterday. The court heard that the deceased Sonto Tivana, and her child, were on their way home and were in the company of a male cousin when the accused came running towards them. He took out a knife and stabbed his lover as well as her child before he threatened to stab the cousin, who was pleading with the accused not to stab them. But the accused in his plea told the court that he was carrying a knife from a ceremony where they had slaughtered a cow and he saw Sonto hugging another man. He became jealous and stabbed her and the baby girl with the knife that he had allegedly used to slaughter a cow. State prosecutor Lawrence Motheogane led the evidence when he handed in a post mortem report which showed that the deceased died of multiple stab wounds to the chest and upper limbs. “The accused’s explanation demonstrates his uncaring character and we plead for a harsh sentence to be imposed,” he said. Judge Mankge said the deceased suffered the most horrific death at the hands of her ex-lover and that she had a bright future ahead. “The accused interfered with the deceased’s most precious gift of life.” She sentenced the accused to 20 years’ imprisonment for murder and 10 years for the attempted murder of their child.
