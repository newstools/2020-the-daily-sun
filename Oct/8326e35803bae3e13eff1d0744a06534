THE former Mpumalanga MEC and ANC PEC member refused to take blood samples as he appeared with his stepson at Nelspruit Magistrates Court today. The 48-year-old, who was wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and white sneakers and his 26-year-old stepson, wearing guava trackpants and a black jacket at their court appearance were bust on Monday and charged with rape and sexual assault. His wife, family and friends attended the bail hearing. State prosecutor Cathy Mnisi told the court the 48-year-old who allegedly forced himself on to his eight-year-old daughters refused to take blood samples before the formal bail application. “We cannot say blood samples can be taken after bail application because we have to use it at evidence,” she said. But his legal representative Advocate Mduduzi Nkosi said there was a misunderstanding and the suspect would take the blood samples first thing tomorrow before he appears in court. The court heard both suspects forcefully penetrated the two girls several times. Earlier on, chaos broke out outside court when different political parties were picketing. Members of the community where the suspects are from chased out the ANC Women’s League and EFF members. Mpumalanga Women’s League chairwoman Busisiwe Shiba said what happened outside court was uncalled for. “As the ANC Women’s League, we took a decision that on issues of gender based violence we will stand with the victim until the law takes its course. We are angry about what happened in the morning, where members were pushed aside by these people. We will report this to the ANC, because we are here to support the victims.” Magistrate Susan Monaledi postponed the matter to tomorrow for the bail application.
