THE husband of one of the two businesswomen who were killed execution style in Polokwane earlier this month has been arrested. A 56-year-old man was arrested together with four other suspects early today at different locations in Ekhuruleni, Gauteng. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the husband of one of the deceased arrested is in hospital where he was admitted after he allegedly attempted to commit suicide. “The Limpopo Provincial Investigating Team, the Tracking Team and the Magama Investigators conducted a well-co-ordinated intelligence-driven operation and succeeded in arresting the suspects at different addresses in Ekhuruleni, Elseburg, Katlegong and Germiston. “The red Hyundai Accent, which is believed to have been used in the commission of the murders, two firearms, two magazines and 13 live rounds of ammunition were seized during the early raids,” Mojapelo said. The deceased, Makoena Mabusela-Leshabane (46) and Tebogo Mphuti (35), were shot and killed execution style at Magnavia, Polokwane over two weeks ago. The businesswomen were inside a black luxury Mercedes- Benz Coupe when armed men allegedly approached, opened the doors of the car and shot them at close range. It’s believed that both deceased arrived in Polokwane on Friday and booked themselves in at a lodge for the night. In the morning they drove to the industrial side of town and had a meeting, and soon afterwards they were killed. The suspects are charged with two counts of murder, possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. They will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court next Monday.
