Public trust in the police force has been low for quite some time. Cops in Mzansi need proper training, despite budget cuts.  Some rush to become cops and behave dishonestly after completing their training. Inadequate training also results in police brutality. This places a stain on the reputation of many good cops, who’re undermined by the behaviour of their unethical, incompetent colleagues. Many people argue that police officers aren’t properly trained on how to handle various dangerous, life-threatening situations. Unless police areofficers at the country’s police stations should be more trained in crowd control and public order policing, similar scenes will continue playing out. Mzansi deserves well-trained officers. Letter by Norman Maake                                          Tembisa
