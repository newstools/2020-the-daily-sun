SELF-PROCLAIMED Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, his wife Mary, and three other people are expected to find out if they will be released on bail or not. The five will be appearing at the Pretoria Magistrates Court this morning after spending almost two weeks in jail. Bushiri, his wife, and Landiwe Ntlokwana were arrested last week Tuesday while the other two were arrested last Saturday. Their attempts to get bail kept being postponed, first with the state not being ready then with the magistrate, Thandi Theledi, having her hands full with other cases. But on Monday, the magistrate promised the state and the defence team of the accused that the matter will receive the necessary attention today. Bushiriâ€™s followers are expected to come in large numbers as they have been since last week. Bushiri and his co-accused are facing charges of fraud and money laundering. They all have not pleaded guilty to charges brought against them. The prophet, well-known as Major One, told the court in his bail application affidavit that he knows he will be acquitted on all his charges.
