THE KSD Mtiza Must Fall concerned residents in Mthatha, Eastern Cape have called on the council to ensure that all 36 wards under King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality use one supply of electricity – Eskom. This is in order for all citizens to exercise their right to buy electricity where they choose. The concerned residents further called on the KSD Municipality to reverse the decision to trade electricity, give that responsibility back to Eskom and rescind their licensing rights to sell electricity. Yesterday, the residents marched to Mthatha CBD to submit their petition to the KSD offices.  The petition was received by chief whip administrator Monde Ndimangele. The residents accused the municipality of selling expensive electricity, called Mtiza, and now they demand to buy electricity directly from Eskom. Speaking during the march, the KSD Mtiza Must Fall chairperson Phikolomzi Adonisi said they have a number of issues in the municipality, including the electricity, called Mtiza. “The injustice posed on us by KSD Local Municipality is unbearable, detestable and unwarranted to us as citizens. Comparing the tariffs with other local municipalities, we pay far too much. “A case study has been done by us in proving this point. To mention a few, Nelson Mandela Bay Metro is charging R100 for 53 units plus a subsidy of solar panel/system. Makana Municipality is charging R100 for 63 units, and other municipalities’ residents are charged R100 for 72 units while King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality charges R100 for 48 units and up to 43 units for R100,” said Adonisi. Meanwhile, KSD Municipality spokesperson Sonwabo Mampoza told the media that the municipality is busy working on a plan to reduce the expensive electricity prices. “We will come back to the residents to tell them that here is the alternative energy to be used and to check if it is better or not,” said Mampoza.
