ORANGE Farm residents sang in celebration after murder accused Pontsho Mohlanka (29) abandoned her bail application yesterday. Mohlanka appeared briefly in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court where she was expected to apply for bail. But her lawyer Advocate Viwe Skepu told the magistrate they would like to abandon the bail application. Mohlanka was charged with the murder of Mpho Makondo (8) and Simphiwe Mgcina (6). Simphiwe’s uncle, Jabulani, said: “The family is not okay. The last time we were here, she wanted to apply for bail. “Today she suddenly abandons bail. It means she doesn’t want to say who she’s working with.” He said the people Pontsho could possibly be working with were probably eyeing more kids to snatch. “It pains me that my nephew is no longer here. When I see other kids in the streets I wish he was playing with them,” he said. The motive for the kids’ killings is still unknown, but Jabulani said people speculated it could have been muthi killings. Gloria Molelekwa, Mpho’s relative, said: “At least things are going the way the’re supposed to.” She said it seemed there might be direction with the case. “Maybe she feels she might not make it out there as the community is fuming. She killed young children who had a bright future,”
