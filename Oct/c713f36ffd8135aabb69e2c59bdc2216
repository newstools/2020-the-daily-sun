BRIGID Kosgei has AGAIN taken home the women's 2020 Virgin Money London Marathon on Sunday morning! The Kenyan runner showed her competitors a clear pair of heels on a wet and quiet course around a bio-secure racing bubble inside St. James Park to breast the tape in a magnificent 2:18:58. Sara Hall kept picking off runners until the very end, chasing down Ruth Chepngetich in the final stretch of Sundayâ€™s race to finish second in 2:22:01. The 26-year-old Kosgei, who was defending her title, has turned out to become a force in women's long distance marathons and is really dominating the charts. She last year won the 2019 London Marathon and Chicago Marathon in the same year, won the 2018 Chicago Marathon and now the this year's London Marathon under the extra-ordinary conditions. South African Gerda Steyn crossed the line seventh within a quality field of top international runners in 2:26:51.
