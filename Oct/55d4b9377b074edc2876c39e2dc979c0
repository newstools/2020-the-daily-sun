COPS need help to find a man who may have information about the rape of a 15-year-old girl. Captain Musa Shihambe told Daily Sun the incident happened at a flat in Berea, Joburg, where the victim and suspect lived. “The incident happend in August while the victim was home alone,” he said. “She said she was in the kitchen when the suspect dragged her into his room.” Shihambe said the victim was still a virgin. “The victim said she was afraid to report the matter because the suspect threatened to kill her and her family. “She told her sister after they moved to a new place recently.” Shihambe said the man is believed to be living in Hillbrow or Berea. He pleaded with the public to help police trace the man in the picture as he may have info and police would like to talk to him. “If anyone has information that can help us to track him down, they can contact Sergeant Shai on 082 622 312,” or 10111,” said Shihambe.
