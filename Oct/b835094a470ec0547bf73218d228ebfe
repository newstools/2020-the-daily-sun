Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki will tonight announce the squad to play Sao Tome in the Cameroon AFCON qualifiers on 13 November at Moses Mabhida Stadium and for the return game three days later on 16 November. Ntseki will make the announcement live during the SABC 1 Soccerzone show at 22h00 tonight. The change in the early squad announcement has been precipitated by the continental football controlling body, CAF who requested over the weekend that they needed all squads submitted to them by close of business today, 26 October 2020. The first leg will be played at 19h00 while the match in Sao Tome will kick off at 15h00 local time (17h00 SA time). SAFA
