POLOKWANE Mayor Thembi Nkadimeng was angry after realising construction on a project was not going according to plan. She stormed out of a site visit recently after she found out the agreement that 30% of the project would prioritise community empowerment was being ignored. Nkadimeng said she was disappointed the contractors building Moletjie Central Sports Complex in Leokama Village were not paying villagers the correct rates. “I am angry that people are being undermined and are not being taken seriously, particularly because they are in rural areas. “I am angry the contractor is not uplifting locals,” she said. The R4 million project is 65% complete and 24% of the money has been used. Said the mayor: “I will come periodically to nurse the project to make sure the locals benefit. “I am going to demand a report of what the contractor has spent and check on that 30%. “I will identify a school or public facility the contractor must adopt, as the money was supposed to be for local development.” The mayor said her project management unit let her down and would have to account for what went wrong. “They allowed the contractor to continue, even though it didn’t comply with our rules and regulations. I am going to demand a detailed report on every cent that has been paid,” she said. Joey Magang Projects’ manager, Sydney Boweni, said the 30% allocation didn’t work on projects of less than R30 million. “We advertised work for local contractors, but no one came forward. I think the mayor didn’t receive all the information because we worked according to the book,” said Boweni.
