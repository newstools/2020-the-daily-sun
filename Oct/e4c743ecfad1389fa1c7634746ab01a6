HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and his wife have tested positive for the coronavirus. The minister revealed this on Sunday night, saying the couple were in isolation after testing positive for the deadly virus. Mkhize said he and his wife decided to go for testing on Saturday after experiencing mild symptoms. "I was feeling abnormally exhausted and as the day progressed, I started loosing appetite. " My wife had a cough, was dizzy and extremely exhausted. Given her symptoms, the doctors advised that she must be admitted for observation and rehydration, " he revealed in a statement. He said their close contacts which included few family members and some of his ministry team have been informed and advised to isolate and test. " I am now in quarantine at home and both my wife and I remain optimistic that we will fully recover from this virus," said the minister. He added that he would use the opportunity in isolation to recharge his batteries. Mkhize urged South Africans to continue adhering to health protocols such as wearing masks, social distancing as well as washing and sanitizing hands. He said the country had made significant strides in fighting the killer virus and repeated his warning that a second wave could hit if people behaved recklessly. " Let us not dare regress. Whatever we do and wherever we go, we have to keep in mind that there remains a risk of a second wave." This virus only spreads through movement and contact of people. Therefore we must all play our part. We must protect ourselves and those we love," he appealed.
