thugs who pretended to be coming from the department of transport entered the
post office at the Avenues Mall in Springs this morning at around 10:30am. "They produced cards and told the employees that they
were coming to test license disc machine. "While inside, they were produced guns and took R100
000 Sassa grant which was already in two tills." Captain Ramphora said the two suspects, who were later
joined by two others, further took about R280 000 cash which was in the safe. "They tied the four female employees with cable tiers
and locked them inside the room." Ramphora said the four thugs 
thereafter ordered the manager to open the back door and all ran out of
the back door into the street. No shots were fired. Captain Ramphora said no arrests have been made yet and
