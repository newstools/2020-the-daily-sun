THE Mrobongwanes don’t know where they’ll sleep next. This after a street light fell onto their house, damaging their kitchen, garage and neighbour’s wall. Anne (61) from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni was happy to see the street light getting fixed on Tuesday morning after six months of darkness. She was with her 27-year-old son when a loud sound hit their roof. “I saw a part of my house collapse right in front of my eyes. I’ve never been so scared and devastated in my life,” said Anne. She said the street light missed her by inches. “I’m grateful my boy and I managed to escape without any injuries,” she said. Anne told Daily Sun the councillor helped them with a place to sleep. “She can’t keep paying B&Bs for us. At some point we need to go back home. We don’t have any plan as we speak,” said Anne.  Neighbour Lindiwe Hlanjwa (37) said she was grateful she wasn’t injured. “Only a part of my wall and window were broken. I hope the municipality will fix the damage,” she said. City of Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said the municipality was aware of the incident. “As far as we know, it was a high-mast structure. We’re not sure what really caused it to fall.” Gadebe said the family could claim for the damages and get the claim form at the insurance section on the ground floor of the Sanburn Building in Benoni, or by contacting 011 999 6550 or 011 999 6547. “It’s however important to note that there’s an onus of proof with the claimant,” he said.
