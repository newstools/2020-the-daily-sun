A BUS driver was shot and killed and his vehicle set alight at the Lawley railway station in Lenasia today. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said preliminary investigations reveal that the bus had stopped to pick up commuters when three armed, unknown suspects started firing shots at the bus. “An unconfirmed number of commuters were injured while attempting to alight from the bus. “It is alleged the suspects then hurled a petrol bomb at the bus which caught fire, and the suspects fled the scene,” Brigadier Peters said. She said emergency services were summoned to the scene to extinguish the fire. “The driver of the bus was fatally wounded. The injured commuters were ferried to hospital for medical attention. “The motive for the shooting is yet to be determined while police have opened a case of murder and malicious damage to property for investigation,” Peters said.
