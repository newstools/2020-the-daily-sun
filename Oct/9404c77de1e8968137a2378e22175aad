KELEBOGILE Pienaar has praised God for giving her a second chance after she survived Covid-19. The 53-year-old from Port Elizabeth works as a cleaner for Missionvale and Kleinskool Cleansing Co-operative. She told Daily Sun: “Covid-19 almost killed me in July. “My neighbours found me sitting on a chair, half-naked. “I’d just taken a bath and was preparing to go to work. But I couldn’t move or talk.” Kelebogile’s neighbours realised something was wrong. “They phoned my son and daughter, who rushed me to Dora Nginza Provincial Hospital,” she said. She said she couldn’t taste or smell anything, and her diabetes shot up. “I was put on a drip for three days,” she said. She was traumatised! “The people in the wards, crying out from severe headaches and body pains, still haunt me. “Some even cried at night from the cold, and I’d cover them with blankets. “But sadly they’d be found dead in the morning. I saw eight bodies being removed. “I prayed and asked the doctor to discharge me because the deaths were traumatic.” She said her faith helped her defeat Covid-19. “I thank God for giving me a second chance,” she said. “I’m blessed to help raise my grandson. “I hope his presence will help me forget about the trauma of Covid-19.”
