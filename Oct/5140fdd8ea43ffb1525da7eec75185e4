TOW truck drivers and bikers shut down the R80 (Mabopane Highway) today following a spate of deadly attacks by gangs. They were chanting struggle songs and picketing while holding posters.   Chairman of National Towing Association of South Africa Donald Ndinisa said they were there because of the crime that happens in the area every day. “There are people robbing our people here. They put spikes on the road and when you get a double puncture, they take you to the bush and kill you. They only want money. If you don’t have, they kill you,” he said.
