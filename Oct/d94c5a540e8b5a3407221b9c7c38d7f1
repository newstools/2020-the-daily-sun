COPS held a memorial service for late detective Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear, who was killed outside his home two weeks ago. The wreath-laying ceremony was held at 35 Squadron in Belhar, Cape Town, yesterday. It was led by police commissioner General Yolisa Matakata and attended by Safety and Security MEC Albert Fritz. Major-General Andre Lincoln, head of the anti-gang unit Kinnear worked under, said the assassination had left a huge void. “It’s been trying times since that Friday afternoon of 18 September,” said Lincoln. “I imagine the pain is more intense for the Kinnear family.”  The memorial service was also attended by Kinnear’s widow, Nicolette, and their two sons. Former rugby player, Zane Killian, appeared in court last week in connection with Kinnear’s murder and was expected to appear again on 5 October. Police Minister Bheki Cele said the Western Cape detective was ranked third in Mzansi. Due to the type of investigations Kinnear conducted, his life was constantly in danger. Cele said they’d investigate why Kinnear’s 24-hour security had been withdrawn. Kinnear was involved in probing high-profile cases relating to the criminal underworld.  Screenshots of CCTV footage outside Kinnear’s house emerged online showing a man in a red hoodie and black track pants loitering outside before attacking him. The funeral service will be held on Saturday in Cape Town.
