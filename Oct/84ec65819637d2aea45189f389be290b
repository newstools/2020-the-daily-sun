Former president Thabo Mbeki was correct when he characterised Mzansi as a country of two nations. What happened at the Senekal Magistrates Court is an indication that not all are equal before the law. It showed that the laws of this country depend on the colour of your skin. There was nothing wrong with white farmers protesting for what they stand for. But their behaviour during the protest shows they don’t respect the laws of this country. How do you pull out a firearm inside the court and worse, burn a police car? To everyone’s surprised, the police did nothing to stop what was unfolding. Not a single tear gas cannister was fired, at least from the video footage and pictures that did the rounds in the news and social media. This shows police are bias. If indeed no action is taken against the perpetrators of the violence today, then we can expect anarchy to rule in this country. Police Minister Bheki Cele needs to act fast before things get out of hand. Letter by Tom Mhlanga Braamfontein
