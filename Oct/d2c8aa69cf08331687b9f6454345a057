NOTORIOUS murder accused Norman “Dallas” Mokoena, who was an outstanding suspect in a murder case, is expected to appear in Mpumalanga High Court where he will join Vusi Sehlabela on trial. The 23-year-old accused from Marite Trust near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga appeared before Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court today. He was charged with murder along with Sehlabela (37) but he couldn’t be added to this matter because he was reportedly on the run after he escaped police custody. He will be standing in the same dock next month in Graskop after his case was transferred to the Mpumalanga High Court.  The two notorious men are accused of killing Patrick Mhlanga (41) during a road rage incident which reportedly happened in April 2018. Mokoena handed himself over after angry residents wanted to burn his parental home. He was denied bail before he escaped custody and a manhunt was launched, and he was rearrested this year. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa confirmed that the state has added the accused to the trial which is set for 2 November to 6 November at the Mpumalanga High Court. “Both accused will remain in police custody because they had other pending cases at Nelspruit Regional Court,” said Nyuswa.
