TAVERNS, shebeens and bars have come under the spotlight since the country downgraded to level 1. Some outlets were exposed for disregarding Covid-19 safety protocols. The Association for Alcohol Responsibility and Education (Aware.org) has intensified its programmes to ensure compliance and responsible drinking. CEO Ingrid Louw said the South African alcohol industry had gone through a serious period of reflection with regards to responsible trade during Covid-19. “The sector is forced to relook and reinforce continued and consistent responsible trading. “The industry is faced with challenges that compel it to strengthen its trading regulations in the fight against alcohol abuse. “In addition, the organisation’s Responsible Trade Facilitation programme was introduced two years ago and has benefitted 1 445 outlets and mostly taverns by creating a balance between compliance and safe environment for patrons, the organisation in response to Covid-19 regulations invented a mobi-site. “It offers useful information on responsible trading under Covid-19 regulations, which include how to keep customers and staff safe during this time, as well as laws related to liquor trading and Covid-19 helpline for traders. “Outlet owners are urged to disinfect all work surfaces before, during and after work, teaching employees about the correct way of wearing a mask, washing hands regularly, and practising social distancing. “Aware.org has also put together rules for non-consumption outlets. These encourage traders to follow safety protocols to help keep the economy open, continue going to places that we love and keeping communities safe.”
