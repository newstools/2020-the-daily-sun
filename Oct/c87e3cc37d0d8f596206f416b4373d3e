SCAMMERS are at it again. This time around they scammed both SABC1’s Live AM presenter Lamiez Holworthy and a KZN-based establishment, Lebolesi lifestyle. The news was initially announced by Lebolesi lifestyle on their Facebook page. According to their Facebook page, Lamiez was scheduled to perform at Lebolesi lifestyle on Saturday. This establishment had been advertising Lamiez as one of their acts from 24 September until 28 September. They even captioned their posters: “DJ Lamiez, it can only be happening at Lebolesi lifestyle centre.” Other lined up DJs included Mbito De Deep, DJ Tuka, Sbudda and Caffe Latte.

As a consequence, on Saturday morning Lebolesi lifestyle centre issued a formal statement apologising to their fans. The statement reads: “Lebolesi has unfortunately been scammed. Lebolesi will take legal steps to address this matter. We apologise for this inconvenience. Lebolesi is a professional establishment and we took all necessary measures to secure the booking. However, it looks like our effort fell right into the hands of fraudulent people.” Two hours later, DJ Lamiez also issued a video clip, warning people about the scam. “So, this morning I was alerted of a very alarming trend, of someone pretending to be me. This person scammed an establishment in Harrismith called Lebolesi lifestyle. These people were under the impression I’m playing there, obviously I’m not. This person went as far as signing a contract and being extremely rude, his texts were sent as if they were coming from me. One, I have one manager who happens to be my mom. Everyone knows that my mom has managed me for the past 10 years, from the time that I started deejaying until this date. So please guys, do not fall for this scam. A criminal case has been opened and this person will be found,” she said.
