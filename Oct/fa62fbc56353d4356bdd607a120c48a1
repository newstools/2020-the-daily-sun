PEOPLE with albinism live in fear of being targeted for their body parts. But these friends, Lucky Morris (27) and Job Moeketsi (24), want to send a message that people with albinism are humans and shouldn’t be targeted for their body parts. With the help of auxiliary nurse Adelaide Motete, these friends are campaigning for the rights of people with albinism in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni. Job said they wanted to show people that their condition didn’t mean they were animals. “It’s only the pigmentation that sets us apart. We live in fear because of people who believe that our body parts will make them rich. This is just a myth,” he said. “We need to eradicate and teach people the true facts about albinism. We are always discriminated against even when it comes to job opportunities.” Lucky said they were lucky they’ve not been targeted by muthi killers.  “We wish people would stopped treating us like we’re animals,” said Lucky. Lucky said they also wanted government to support their job creation initiative. “We don’t get hired because employers look at us as a liability.” He said they were told they could not be hired as drivers because of their short-sightedness. “We won’t be a burden to anyone if government helps us with funds to create our own jobs,” he said. Job said he did a marketing course, but hasn’t been so lucky when it came to finding work.  Adelaide said her granddaughter has albinism. “She was raped in 2018 and it hurt me so much. “I’m grateful the suspect who raped her was arrested and is currently in jail.” Adelaide’s granddaughter was 5 years old when the 55-year-old suspect raped her. He is still on trial and the next court date is 23 October. “I decided to work with Lucky and Job to protect all people with albinism,” she said.
