A BLAST from the past! Former YFM radio presenter Rofhiwa “Tholi B” Bologo is back in the entertainment mix making his own music. This is all thanks to the late legendary radio maestro Bob Mabena. Speaking to Daily Sun this week, Tholi B said: “Two weeks before he passed on, Mabena said to me on my radio show on POWER 98.7, ‘one of the biggest mistakes I made in life was to sometimes do what people expected me to do, and not what I wanted to do’. “Those words are stuck with me. So, I’m making a decision to listen to me and do what I want to do, which is maximising on the gifts I have the way I want to, and not the way people expect me to,” he said. Mabena died in June after suffering from cardiac arrest. Tholi B felt he would be wasting his talent if he just remained stagnant. “I was actually a songwriter, producer and DJ before I was a radio presenter. So, it’s a bit like going back to a familiar place. “Some people would also know that I used to rap. So, music is a natural thing for me and everyone is about to find out. “At some point I felt that I’m throwing a gift away, and now I want to appreciate and honour this gift. “I also have a group of young talent that I’d like to walk this journey with so they can get the inspiration to lead successful careers,” he said. As many people may know, after YFM, Tholi B went to 947, then tried his hand at radio management, which brought about his journey as station manager of Capricorn FM in Limpopo for almost four years. He recently came back to Joburg to head up creative services at MSG Group Sales for both POWER 98.7 and Capricorn FM. “It’s been a great journey with lots of learning and growth. I now have my own integrated radio agency business, and I am ready to work on my brand again,” he said. “I plan to release new music as a songwriter, producer-DJ sometime this month, starting with a single that will be followed by a full album or EP in the first quarter of 2021,” he said.
