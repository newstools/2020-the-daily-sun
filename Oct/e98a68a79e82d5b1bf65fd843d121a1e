WHILE some may know their way around the glass cabinet, for some, selecting the correct glass for a specific beverage is still a problem. There are different types of wine glasses for different types of wines and the roles they play for your enjoyment of the beverage goes beyond just taste. A wine glass has a lot to do with mitigating the bitterness of tannins or spicy flavours to deliver a smoother tasting wine. For example, red wines tend to taste smoother from a glass with a wide opening and that will also affect what you smell. Here are five types of wine glasses: 1. “Standard” red wine glass – This glass is good for medium- to full-bodied red wines with spicy notes and/or high alcohol content. Enjoy Zinfandel, Malbec, Syrah (Shiraz), and Petite Sirah with this glass. 2. Aroma collector “Bourgogne” glass – This glass is for lighter, more delicate red wines with subtle aromas. The large round bowl helps collect all the aromas. Enjoy pinot noir, Gamay, Zweigelt, St. Laurent, Schiava, Freisa, Valpolicella blends, and even Nebbiolo with this glass!  3. Large bordeaux – This glass is thinner and splashes the wine to the back of the mouth, and it’s intended for full-bodied, heavy red wines like sirahs and malbecs. 4. Flute – The flute is perfect for bubbly wines like sparkling wine, champagne, Asti wine and more. 5. Chardonnay – This is the glass for spicier, nuttier white wines that need more surface area to bloom. The straighter glass sends the wine to the sides of the tongue. Enjoy chardonnay in this glass.
