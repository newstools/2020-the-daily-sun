MZANSI has had mixed reactions to news that new Covid-19 infections are on the rise. While taverns and bars continue to break lockdown rules, illegal cigarette traders are preparing to get back to business. Over the weekend, the Backdoor Lounge in Sandton, Joburg, was raided. The venue was shut down after the Okae Molao operation led by Police Minister Bheki Cele and Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko found it operating after midnight. In a video circulating on social media, patrons can be seen ignoring social distancing regulations while walking around without wearing masks. Lesetja Mogotlane (28) from Winnie Mandela in Ekurhuleni said she feared another strict lockdown. “The first one was hard and my family suffered. If we go back, everything will stop for me. “I will not be working and I have to buy clothes for my children and pay school fees in January.” Sinenkosi Biyela (27) from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said it would be better to move to level five for everyone’s safety. “We can’t continue losing lives,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said two nightclubs were shutdown in Sandton and Midrand on Sunday. Masondo said the Backdoor club had an estimation of 300 patrons. “The owner was subsequently arrested, liquor confiscated and the outlet shut down for contravention of the Level 1 Regulations,” said Masondo. In a statement, Cele added:” The total disregard of the law will not be tolerated, whether it is happening in townships or in the most-affluent corners of the country.”
