FARES Hachi is back in the PSL! Maritzburg United boss Farook Kadodia has confirmed Hachi agreed a three-year deal with the Blue Army. The deal means the former Mamelodi Sundowns defender returns to South Africa where he once had a two-year fruitless spell, joining from French third tier side AS Lyon where he had spent a year. Kadodia said they were not done in the market and several more could join new recruits – Ali Meza, Zambian goalkeeper Sebastien Mwange, Phumlani Ntshangase, Riyaaz Ismail and Sibusiso Hlubi – to the team. The recent result could have prompted the Blue Army to decide on Hachi, who had been training with the KwaZulu-Natal side for days. Many might not remember the Algerian from his days with the Brazilians, mainly for his lack of impact in the all-conquering Pitso Mosimane team. Arriving from ES Setif, Hachi made only seven appearances before he was shipped off to Chippa United on loan and later joined home team MC Algier before returning to France where he’d spent the better part of his career. Eric Tinkler’s side didn’t have the best of starts in the Premiership as they went down 2-1 to Baroka FC at the weekend. They crashed out of the MTN8 Cup, losing 2-1 to Kaizer Chiefs in their season-opening match. But Kadodia is not overly concerned. “Look, it is early in the season. Yes, it hasn’t been a good start for us. But I’m confident of a quick turnaround.” Tinkler is equally optimistic of a quick turnaround. “We kept going, kept trying. The combinations still need to work for us,” Tinkler said. “We need to find our feet and our balance, but I saw a lot of positive things today in comparison to last week.” Maritzburg, who parted ways with their assistant coach Vincent Kobola yesterday, will tonight host Cape Town City at the Harry Gwala Stadium (7.30pm).
