Banyana Banyana star Thembi Kgatlana announced herself in style in the Spanish Primera Iberdrola. Kgatlana provided an assist and scored her first league goal for her new side Eibar as they played out to a 2-2 draw against Levante on this past weekend. Kgatlana joined the Spanish outfit from Portuguese side SL Benfica this summer and has wasted little time settling into life in Spain. She was a second half substitute for Eibar in their last match but made a huge impact as she won a penalty and netted another to earn her side a point.
