GOVERNMENT is planning a huge infrastructure rollout to create jobs and economic growth. There will also be a focus on increasing exports and fast-tracking reforms to make the economy more competitive and inclusive. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the interventions would create more than 800 000 jobs and unlock over R1 trillion in infrastructure investment in the next four years. This comes after Stats SA’s recent announcement that 2,2 million jobs were lost during the coronavirus lockdown. Ramaphosa said yesterday small businesses would be targeted for support to allow them to participate in the manufacturing sector. He also promised a new model of energy generation to have reliable power within two years. The move will see Eskom being unbundled into three power producers to accommodate independent producers. “Our recovery will be propelled by swift reforms to unleash the potential of the economy and supported by an efficient state committed to clean governance. It will be transformative. It will be inclusive,” he said. “We developed a robust pipeline of projects that will transform the landscape of our cities, towns and rural areas. To place our economy on a new trajectory, we’re going to support massive growth in local production and make exports much more competitive.” He said 300 000 job opportunities would be created by using young people as school assistants throughout the country. Over 60 000 jobs would focus on maintenance and construction in municipalities and on rural roads, and an extra 6 000 community health workers would be deployed. Ramaphosa also announced the R350 unemployment relief grant would be extended by three months as government worked on a permanent unemployment fund. He said business, labour and government would soon announce goods that companies would have to buy from local producers.
