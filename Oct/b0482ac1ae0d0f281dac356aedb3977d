RESIDENTS are furious after conmen stole their fridges. The crooks took clients’ fridges from Bosplaas and Phomolong sections in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, saying they’d refill the gas and return them later, but disappeared. Residents told Daily Sun the men drove a bakkie around the area two weeks ago looking for people who needed their fridges fixed. Victim Judith Thobejane (48) said the conmen were evil and left them suffering. She said they looked like real business people and she didn’t suspect anything. Francinah Mphela (70) said the men seemed very sweet so she believed they’d return her fridge. “I blame myself for trusting strangers with my fridge. 'WE DIDN'T KILL SENZO' “I’m hurt and struggling to sleep. I’m disappointed because the police are not helping us,” she said. Francinah said she bought her fridge in 2014 and couldn’t afford a new one as she was a pensioner. Kelebone Makgefu (33) said the men looked reliable and honest. “I don’t know where I will get the money to buy another fridge because I’m not working,” she said. The residents said the men targeted women and took advantage of them. They said the police told them they couldn’t do anything as they handed over the fridges willingly. MASKANDI ARTIST PORN SHOCK! Daily Sun contacted one of the men accused of stealing the fridges. “I don’t know anything about fridges. I do painting and I don’t know Hammanskraal,” he said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said: “The residents should go and report the matter to the police station and if they are not helped, they should ask to see the station commander.”
