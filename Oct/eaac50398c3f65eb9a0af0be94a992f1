LOCAL boxing trainer, Pius Dipheko, has been suspended by Boxing South Africa (BSA) for failing to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. It is alleged that the West Rand-based boxing mentor has broken the amended Sports and Recreation South Africa Disaster Management Act, which was gazetted on 28 August this year. Two of Dipheko’s fighters – Thato Bonokoane and Kabelo Bikitsha – were billed for TLB Boxing Promotions event on Saturday at the Klipspruit Multi-purpose Centre. As part of Covid-19 protocols, his team, including him as a chief trainer, were supposed to be admitted to a bio-buble seven days before tournament. All the participants were expected to leave the bubble after the event. News coming from the bio-buble camp revealed that Dipheko dropped his fighters on Sunday and went back home and came back after two days. However, Annexure C1 (D) stipulates that all professional players and support staff must, for purpose of the resumption of sporting activities to be admitted to a biologically safe environment, or must alternately be subjected to weekly Covid-19 testing based on the submitted plan. Acting BSA Gauteng provincial manager, Lehlohonolo Ramagole, confirmed to SunSport that Dipheko has been suspended for his actions. “Yes, we have suspended Mr Dipheko. So he is no longer part of TLB Boxing Promotions event. “I acted in the best interest of the sports, also making sure the event goes ahead without any hiccups,” said Ramagole. When asked if the former boxer will face disciplinary action from the boxing regulatory body, Ramagole said that is his bosses’ decision. Dipheko will not able to usher his charges to the ring. It is understood that John Tshabalala will help him. Attempts to get comment from Dipheko were unsuccessful.
