THE family of a Mpumalanga woman who is mentally ill is traumatised after she was raped and badly burnt with acid, allegedly by her neighbour. The 37-year-old from Boschfontein in Nkomazi was allegedly taken from her home by the neighbour last Saturday night. According to her 46-year-old sister, the victim, who lives with a 17-year-old girl, heard a knock on the door and the perpetrator told her to follow him. He allegedly took her to his home. “The young girl was asleep and did not hear the knock on the door. When they got to the house, he raped her and poured acid on her lower body, injuring her thighs and stomach. Her clothes were damaged,” said the sister. She said the suspect gave the victim a sheet to cover herself and a jacket to wear. He then ordered her to go home and not to tell anyone about the incident, threatening to kill her if she did. The sister said later in the day, she saw the victim struggling to walk. “I asked her what was wrong and she told me she was burnt and was in pain. “I asked her to show me where she felt the pain and I was shocked to see her injuries. I asked her what happened and she told me our neighbour burnt her,” she said. The victim was taken to hospital, where she is recovering. The sister said the victim revealed this was not the first time the suspect allegedly raped her. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said a 28-year-old man was arrested on Thursday and appeared in court on Friday. “He was charged with rape and assault. He will appear in court again on 29 October for a formal bail application,” he said.
