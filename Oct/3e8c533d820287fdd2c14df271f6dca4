AFTER spending just one night in jail, former BOSASA COO
Angelo Agrizzi has reportedly collapsed and was rushed to an undisclosed Joburg
hospital. Agrizzi was denied bail yesterday (Wednesday) by the
specialised commercial crimes court sitting in Palm Ridge, after the state
convinced the court that he was a flight risk. The Department of Correctional Services spokesman,
Singabakho Nxumalo confirmed that Remand Detainee, Agrizzi, has been
transferred to an external public hospital in order to receive further medical
attention . "All inmates are entitled to Healthcare Services in
line with correctional provisions.Â  His
condition will continue to be monitored." Yesterday Agrizzi arrived in court, carrying an oxygen unit
which had a pipe attached through to his nose. His lawyer yesterday used his medical condition to argue for
bail, but that was not enough to convince Magistrate Phillip Venter. Agrizzi was seen to be taking strain when he stood for long
in the court room. The Magistrate asked him to remain seated, even when the
bail judgement was handed down. Outside the courtroom there was a paramedic (Er24) stationed
there in case Agrizzi's condition complicated during court proceedings. Agrizzi appeared alongside Co-accused former ANC MP Vincent
Smith facing corruption charges.
