 KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has confirmed that they will be without two key players when he leads Amakhosi for the first time on Sunday. Chiefs host Maritzburg United in the quarterfinals of the MTN8 at FNB Stadium at 3pm.Hunt who was appointed last month replacing Ernst Middendorp revealed that he will be without strikers Leonardo Castro and Samir Nurkovic.Castro suffered an injury while in the bio-bubble and was released in the camp with four games remaining, while Nurkovic got injured during the current pre-season preparations.“I came here and a lot of these players have been injured. Samir, the top goalscorer, has been injured and he won’t play,” Hunt told the media on Thursday."Samir, the top goalscorer, has been injured and he won’t play. He’s had an operation, hasn’t trained a single day and I think he will be out for some time."Castro was also injured before the end of the season. He also hasn’t trained much. I think those are the two major injuries."He added: “They were the cornerstone of the team last year and had done very well."That is a problem going forward – but we will have to realign ourselves and reshape to play to the strengths of the players that we’ve got, that’s important and I will try and do that."
