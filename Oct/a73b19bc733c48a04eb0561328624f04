ALTHOUGH they managed to pull a few wires, it was a bit too late because the cops were onto them. The residents of Princess squatter camp in Roodepoort were not pleased to see law enforcement and City Power officials in their kasi. This is because they knew there would be no watching of Isibaya or Generations at night. Residents watched from a distance as their illegally connected electricity was being cut off. Speaking to Daily Sun, Keneilwe Ramatlo said this was frustrating and a setback because they will have to contribute towards buying new wires. “It’s not the first time that they’ve come here to disconnect. After they leave we just have to gather money to buy new wires and the skilled guys will reconnect,” she said. She added that government officials live comfortably in their homes and they are forced to make means for themselves. “Our government makes empty promises and we can’t wait for them in order to live our lives. If we have the means we will definitely make a plan to survive,” she said. Thabang Mokoena said it’s too hot for them not to have ice cold water. “We have groceries that need to be refrigerated, if you were in our position what would you do?” asked Thabang. Although one of the trees that supported some of the connections caught fire, the residents did not seem to be alarmed. They just asked to be handed back the wires.
