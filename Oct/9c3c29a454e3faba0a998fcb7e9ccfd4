THE double murder case against Pontsho Mohlanka has been postponed once again. The 29-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, was supposed to apply for bail today. But her newly appointed Legal Aid lawyer asked for a postponement, as she needs to consult with her client. Pontsho appeared briefly in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court, before her case was postponed to 20 October. Residents came in numbers to support the families of Mpho Makondo (8) and Simphiwe Mgcina (6), who were killed and their bodies dumped in Orange Farm extension 4 last month. The postponements have angered family members and residents, who said they’re spending a lot of money on taxi fare coming to court. Residents said the postponements are an attempt to get them to subsequently lose interest in the case and stop coming court. Community leader Linda Ndebele said: “We are tired of coming here. We want Pontsho to go down. If the court is failing us, they must just give her bail and we will deal with her. “It is not fair. We can’t come here all the time just to see one person. Pontsho is not a model. She must go to jail!” He said that Pontsho must expose her accomplices so they can be arrested too.
