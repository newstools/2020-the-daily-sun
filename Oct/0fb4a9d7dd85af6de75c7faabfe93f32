SPORTS minister, Nathi Mthethwa, has opened up all sporting codes to resume activities "with no spectators at the venue or precinct of the venue". However, he said this is subject to testing in case of professional sport and screening in terms of nonprofessional sport. He said the department will deploy officials to monitor compliance with the directions and such officials shall be given special identity documen. "The sport body must ensure that all measures must be in place before any resumption of sporting activities," said Mthethwa. He added that every person in the travelling team must provide a negative Covid-19 test result that has been obtained no more than 72 hours prior to the date of travel. "If a person in the travelling team is unable to produce a negative Covid-19 test result, that person is quarantined at his or her own cost," said Mthethwa in a statement. "They must comply with the provisions of the National Sport and Recreation. "When declaring Covid-19 a pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) implored the countries of the world to seek to 'strike a balance between protecting health, minimising economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights'.‚Äù "At Level 1 there is no need for submission of plans for the consideration and approval of the Minister of Sport Arts and Culture. The sports bodies must ensure that their plans to mitigate the risks are in place and amongst other, they comply with all the matters indicated above," said the minister.
