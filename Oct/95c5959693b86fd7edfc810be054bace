IF something or someone is likened to a chameleon, it often means you change a lot. You are inconsistent with the norm, and based on your environment. Like a chameleon, you adapt to any situation you currently find yourself in, and the same thing can be said about the punani. So, does the punani change colour? According to experts, they do. They don’t stay the same colour regardless of what shade they started off being. When aroused, blood rushes down there and that can make your vulva look darker in colour. According to gynaecologist Susan Loeb-Zeitlin, when someone’s labia changes colour, hormones usually have something to do with it. This change in pigment can likely be traced back to puberty, when the labia develops, grows larger, and in turn gets darker. This change in colour normally takes place during a woman’s 30s, when they experience hormone shifts that come with pregnancy or ageing. Experts warn that this change is completely normal and no alarm bells should be rung.
