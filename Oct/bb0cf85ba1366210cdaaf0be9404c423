MAMELODI Sundowns are in talks with European giants Bayern Munich and Paris Saint Germain (PSG) over high-profile friendly matches. The reigning PSL giants are looking to bring the Germans, as well as the French Ligue 1 champions to these shores as part of their 50th-anniversary celebrations in December. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the club have been making efforts to celebrate the milestone, and with the easing of lockdown travel regulations, they will be bringing two more European powerhouses in as many years. They rolled out the red carpet to some of the world’s superstars when they invited Barcelona for the Nelson Mandela centenary match. The 50th anniversary is an occasion befitting friendlies with the 2020 Uefa Champions League champions finalists.  “The team has been engaging with three top European teams with an idea to come (sic) down and have a celebratory game of the 50th anniversary, with PSG and Bayern,” read minutes of a meeting between club boss Patrice Motsepe and the national executive committee over the weekend. “The team will also like to inform the yellow nation that when the regulations allow that to happen then the announcement will also be made.” Meanwhile, as many as 10 officials have been implicated in the Tebogo Langerman saga. Langerman nearly cost the Brazilians the Nedbank Cup title after he almost featured in the final against Bloemfontein Celtic, despite being suspended. Celtic lodged a protest with the PSL, but the Safa arbitrator ruled in favour of Sundowns, who then secured their treble. But the situation has hugely embarrassed the club, prompting Motsepe to issue a public apology last month. The club will make an announcement as soon as the matter is concluded.
