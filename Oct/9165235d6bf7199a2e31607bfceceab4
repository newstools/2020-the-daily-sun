AFTER co-operating with the kidnappers’ demands, they thought the worst was over. But the family from Richmond in the KZN Midlands is devastated. . . They found their son, Mlulamisi Phungula (21), dead on Monday! Mlulamisi and Nkanyiso Mkhize (23) were allegedly kidnapped by unknown people on Saturday. Mlulamisi’s sister, Nokubonga Ngcobo, (43) told Daily Sun her brother and Nkanyiso left home on Saturday morning but didn’t say where they were going. “Our dad received a phone call in the evening,” she said. “Mlulamisi sounded scared when he called my dad, saying he needed R5 000 because he’d been kidnapped. He told him to send the money through eWallet.” I SAID SORRY TO MY RAPIST! She and their dad went to the police station to report the matter. “When we got back Mlulamisi called again and told us we must pay the money soon because Nkanyiso’s family had paid. “He told us the kidnappers had threatened to kill him if the money wasn’t paid. We then sent it.” Mlulamisi’s cellphone was off when they called to tell him the money had been sent. “They were found dead by police near the Richmond CBD on Monday,” she said. “We believe they were killed because we didn’t pay the money on time.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of kidnapping was opened at Richmond cop shop for investigation. “The two victims were found dead next to Beta Crate, Alexandra Road, with gunshot wounds to the head,” said Gwala. Cases of murder were opened at Alexandra Road cop shop for investigation. A suspect (22), bust yesterday for kidnapping and murder, was expected to appear in the Richmond Magistrates Court soon.
