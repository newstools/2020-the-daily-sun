Contrary to
popular belief, the summer heat is tougher on your car battery than the winter
chill. This is
largely due to the corrosion processes that take place. Batteries are damaged
by the summer heat, which causes failure to start in winter, which is when higher
starting currents are required. While
various factors contribute to this damage, South Africa’s trusted battery
specialists have narrowed it down to the following two major factors. Overcharging Hot weather
could contribute to a common problem in car batteries – overcharging. The heat
causes the internal voltage regulator and alternator to allow overcharging of
the battery, which causes a slow death of your car battery. Corrosion The heat
can cause the positive grids of your battery to corrode and deteriorate slowly.
This results in a gradual reduction of cranking power, finally reaching the
point where your car does not start. It is
tempting to think that while your car starts, nothing could possibly be wrong,
but a faulty battery can strike at any time. In addition
to the unexpected failure of your battery, a faulty battery could possibly
cause further damage to your car by impacting components such as the onboard
computer systems and possibly the Engine Control Unit (ECU). Preventing
damage to your car battery You may not
be able to avoid the heat, but good maintenance will go a long way to help
minimise potential damage. Be sure to
have your battery, alternator and starter assessed at least twice a year. This
is proactive and is done for free at any Battery Centre countrywide. Keep the
terminals clean, by keeping the terminals clean, you prolong the life of your
battery. Do so at least once a month if necessary, by using a mixture of baking
soda, water and an old toothbrush to scrub the grime off the terminals.
