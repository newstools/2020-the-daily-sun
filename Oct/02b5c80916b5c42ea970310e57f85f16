FRIENDLY matches do not generally attract much attention. But for Abbubaker Mobara there are no friendly matches in the Bafana Bafana jersey. The Cape Town City defender is back in the national team in three years. Interestingly, his last appearance for Bafana came in a friendly against Zambia back in June 2017, in Rustenburg. He could well make his return against the very same Chipolopolo, who they have lined-up for an international friendly on Sunday. ”No game we play should be friendly. Every game has a reason and purpose to it, ” Mobara reasoned. ”It’s preparation. We start here and now to prepare for the qualifiers with these upcoming matches. ”South Africa first tackle Namibia in the first of two friendlies at Royal Bafokeng Stadium tomorrow, and Zambia on Sunday. It will be their first match since November when they beat Sudan 1-0 in their Afcon qualifier. Mobara, 26, has worked hard at the Citizens to be in be a national reckoning and appreciates has a return to the fold. ”It’s a great feeling to be back. It shows all the hard work has paid off. I'm happy to be back. I'm surrounded by beautiful souls in the camp. But it's a pleasure to serve the country and serve it well, ” Mobara said. ”The first time in the bubble was a struggle. But now it's normal. We have a national duty to perform. Could Mobara and Bafana earn their revenge against Zambia, though? The likes of Luther Singh certainly believes so, being back in the field after a long time. Singh is among the unfamiliar faces in camp, having earned his only cap to date three years ago. He has earned tons of experience with the national junior sides, but this is another level altogether.
