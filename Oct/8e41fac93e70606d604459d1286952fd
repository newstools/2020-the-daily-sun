KHAYELITSHA Development Forum chairman Ndithini Tyhido is unfazed after being attacked on Sunday on the N2 near the Cape Town kasi. It happened after a prayer meeting, where he spoke against gangs asking landlords and vendors for protection fees. The meeting he’d organised was addressed by deputy state security minister Zizi Kodwa. Ndithini said he didn’t know who was behind the attack, but if gang-related, he was happy his message hit home. “If this was because of the meeting we had earlier, it’s a good thing the message reached the targeted recipients.” A bullet hit his car’s windscreen, but luckily, he was not injured and was determined to keep standing up for residents.

Ndithini said his organisation would mobilise residents to use new strategies to deal with the situation. He did not open a case. Sunday’s meeting at Khayelitsha Stadium was attended by community leaders, where Kodwa warned gangs to stop intimidating people.
