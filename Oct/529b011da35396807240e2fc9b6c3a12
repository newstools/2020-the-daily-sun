MALUSI Gigaba’s former advisor, Siyabonga Mahlangu, has denied that his principal and former president Jacob Zuma instructed him to put pressure on anyone to finalise the reinstatement of Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama. Testifying at the Zondo Commission today, he said all he did was advise Gigaba, who was the Public Enterprises minister at the time, to inform Zuma about Gama’s intended reinstatement. “At no point did the minister advise me that the president wished to have Gama reinstated expeditiously,” said Mahlangu. Former Transnet lawyer Siyabulela Mapoma told the inquiry that Mahlangu put pressure on him to finalise Gama’s reinstatement. He claimed that Mahlangu told him that number one, which he understood to refer to Zuma, wanted Gama back at Transnet. Gama was suspended for gross misconduct in 2009. The following year he was found guilty at a disciplinary hearing and fired. He was reinstated in 2011 with full back pay. Mahlangu said he had no motive or reason to call or pressure Mapoma about Gama’s reinstatement. He denied he ever referred to Zuma as number one. “Mapoma’s allegation is without basis. I have not referred to Zuma as number one in my ordinary use of language,” he said. He said he could not recall the reasons why he advised Gigaba to discuss the reinstatement with Zuma except that it may be because of the public interest the matter received at the time. Mahlangu told the commission that he was new in his job and could not have been involved in the matter substantively. He said he saw the settlement agreement for the first time when it was provided to him by the commission. He said he could not recall Gigaba telling him about his concerns that Gama was dismissed unfairly and that he wanted it to be reviewed.
