THE transport department has pleaded with drivers to drive carefully. Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli made the plea after a horrific accident on the R34 between Melmoth and Ulundi in northern KZN killed 16 people, including an unborn baby. On Wednesday, a minibus taxi crashed into a truck. The taxi caught fire, killing 13 people instantly. More victims died from injuries later. Three passengers were burnt beyond recognition. Ntuli yesterday visited the accident scene, where a pregnant woman delivered a stillborn baby. “It pains me that families had to lose their loved ones, especially during Transport Month. We are currently busy conducting service delivery projects to unlock economic opportunities,” he said. Ntuli said road safety across all modes of transport was a top priority for the department, which was working with local and national government to implement interventions across the province. “This is intended to end the carnage on our roads. ”“It’s crucial for road users to be aware of factors that contribute to road carnage. “These include speeding and driving under the influence. The MEC said investigations into the cause of the accident would focus on the roadworthiness of both vehicles, weather conditions at the time of the accident and other factors that could have contributed to the tragedy. “We’re committed to ending road carnage and will continue to ensure road safety in the province through strategic traffic enforcement, education and robust community engagement.” Government would work hard to process the DNA testing of the three people burnt beyond recognition.
