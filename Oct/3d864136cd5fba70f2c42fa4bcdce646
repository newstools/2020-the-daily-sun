THE late Oliver Tambo’s birthday month celebrations will mostly focus on cleaning up the allegations of corruption facing OR Tambo District Municipality and combating the escalating crime in the Eastern Cape. OR Tambo District Municipality will soon launch the “Wanya Tsotsi” programme to fight the escalating crime in Mthatha CBD. Addressing the media while launching Oliver Reginald Tambo month, mayor Thokozile Sokanyile said the municipality will work in conjunction with SAPS and the Department of Defence to curb crime in all areas under the district in the “Wanya Tsotsi” programme. She said having a corrupt municipality would not impress the late stalwart. “So that is why we are saying we are going to root out the allegations of corruption that are facing the municipality. Oliver Reginald Tambo would never be impressed by these corruption allegations facing the district named after him.” Sokanyile said: “The OR Tambo liberation route includes Mbizana Local Municipality under Alfred Nzo District Municipality, the City of Ekurhuleni and City of Lusaka in Zambia. We are strengthening our intergovernmental relationships with these areas so that our unique relationship can create a conducive environment for shared objectives on economic growth and human development. “And we are going to publish names of people and companies who are found guilty by the ongoing SIU and Hawks investigations,” said Sokanyile. Sokanyile further confirmed that Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma will visit the OR Tambo District Municipality next Tuesday. Sokanyile was addressing the media today in the OR Tambo District Municipality offices in Myezo, Mthatha, Eastern Cape. Oliver Tambo died on 23 April 1993 after suffering from a stroke.
