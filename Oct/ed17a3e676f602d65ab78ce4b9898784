“DON’T leave me, take me with you.” These were the chilling words of TV personality Samora Mangesi as his best friend Teddy Sibiya’s body lay next to him on Saturday evening. Teddy, a radio and TV presenter, died in a car accident on Saturday. Since his death, friends, including entertainment commentator Phil Mphela, have found it hard to come to terms with his passing. Phil tweeted: “We were chilling with T izolo. They leave. 15min later, we get a call he is gone. Just like that.” Samora, who presents Real Goboza on SABC1, said Teddy was meant to report for work on Monday, but he decided to go in for him.

Definitely my most difficult three hours on air,” he wrote on Twitter. In another emotional tweet, Samora said he tried everything to save his best friend’s life, but he was powerless. “Friend, I tried. Yoh, I tried. I’ve never given myself to anything as much as I did trying to bring you back. I love you brother,” he wrote. Teddy was known for hosting a show on Soweto TV and presenting various awards shows, including the Mpumalanga Gospel Awards. Details of his funeral have not yet been revealed. Simphiwe Majola of Soweto TV told Daily Sun: “He was a gem of Soweto TV, uncovered in the province of Mpumalanga. We’re saddened by his passing. “It seems true that the talented ones die young.”
