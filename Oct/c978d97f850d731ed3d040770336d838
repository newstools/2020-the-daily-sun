THE cheque book has not been closed by AmaZulu chairman Sandile Zungu. The Usuthu boss says fans can expect more players to join the club. The ambitious chairman unveiled 10 new players on Monday including former Orlando Pirates duo Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga and former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana superstar Siphiwe “Shaba” Tshabalala. Zungu wants to turn Usuthu into one of the top teams in the PSL this season. He said coach Ayanda Dlamini’s mandate is to ensure the club finish in the top four this season. Usuthu open the new DStv Premiership season when they host Orlando Pirates at Kings Park Stadium on Saturday and Zungu wants maximum points to usher in the new area. Zungu is in the market for among other players a new goalkeeper. “The closing of the current transfer window is weeks away and the first games will give us a chance to assess the strength and the balance of our team and then we’ll decide,” said Zungu. “The Goalkeeping department is an area that we set ourselves as a priority. There’s clearly a vacancy we want to fill.” However, Zungu was tight-lipped on how he managed to sign the Mzansi legend Tshabalala. Zungu said the negotiations with the 2010 World Cup star were the same as that of other players. “None of this group of players were easy to get,” he stated. The 36-year-old, Tshabalala who will wear jersey number 36, has been without a club since leaving Turkish side BB Erzurumspor, who were demoted to the Second Division in May last year is set to make his debut against Bucs.
