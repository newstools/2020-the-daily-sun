“It’s not my title that gives me power. It’s my purpose to serve that gives me power,” said Dr Pashy Ntshani at the Power Woman fund-raising dinner on Saturday. The event, held at the Houghton Hotel in Joburg, was attended by businesswoman Basetsana Kumalo, TV star Terry Pheto, and Malaika’s Tshedi Mholo, who entertained the guests. It was held in collaboration with Pashy’s friend, Dr Nandipha Magudumana. Proceedings will go towards the Dr Pashy Foundation, which uplifts African women and the youth. Pashy said of the foundation: “It was inspired by Hebrews 13-16, which says: ‘Don’t forget to do good and share with others’. “We recently went on a five-day tour to give 700 people 10 clothing items each, 358 pairs of shoes, stationery, sanitary towels and to feed 200 people for a month.” ALSO READ: UKHOZI FM PRODUCER AYANDA MAKES LISTENERS SEE RED! The foundation has turned to social change and development, focusing on education and empowerment. “We’ll fulfil this by giving bursaries to underprivileged kids and empowerment programmes such as motivation through my journal My Caption, social media and mentorship programmes.” Nandipha said Power Woman is aimed at breaking the myth that women should be limited in professional development. “We want to arm women and young people with knowledge on how they can turn their passion into profit to leave a lasting legacy. “Empowering women can help reduce poverty and develop the country.” Guest speaker Terry said girl kids must be masters of their faith and captains of their souls. “Step into power, know yourself and what you want, set goals and be surrounded by people who’ll help and need the best out of you.”
