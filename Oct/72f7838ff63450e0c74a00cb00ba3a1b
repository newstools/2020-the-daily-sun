FENNY Phehle believes her children are cursed. This comes after two of her kids died, one in 2004 and the other in 2009, and one of her surviving sons was sentenced to life in prison last week. He was sentenced in the Moretele Magistrates Court in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, after being found guilty of rape, robbery and attempted murder. The 62-year-old from Kanana extension 2 in Hammanskraal, said her son Antipas (25) was murdered in 2004 and the suspects were released after his burial. She said that he was beaten with bottles, bricks and iron bars after being stripped naked. “My children are cursed. Nothing is going well with them. Two of them died and another is serving a long sentence in prison,” she said. Her other son Samuel (27) committed suicide in 2009. She said a prophet told her that her sons were cursed. She said she was told someone put muthi in her home, causing the two deaths and the jailing of her 28-year-old son Hendrick.  Sangoma Majoko Hlongwane said: “This woman needed to be cleansed with her children in the river by a powerful sangoma. If Fenny was cleansed, her life would go back to normal.” Prophet Kenneth Hlatywayo said: “The woman needs a powerful prayer to remove the curse from her home and family. She must have faith in God so she can be helped.” Gauteng social development spokesman Thamsanqa Kenke said a social worker would be sent to Fenny for counselling. “According to the police, the suspect in her son’s case was arrested in 2004 and was on trial between 2005 and 2008. It went to the regional court until 2013 when the docket was closed and filed.”
