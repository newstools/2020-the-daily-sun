DESPITE the criticism he received while appearing on 1Magic’s The River, Lunga Shabalala is already working on his next TV project. The TV presenter, who surprised many people when he made his debut as an actor playing Lindani on The River, said his journey with the show has ended. “The River was an amazing experience and I’m grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an amazing team. I’ve definitely made friends and family for life there,” he said. Although he didn’t want to reveal his next move, the 31-year-old from Pietermaritzburg, KZN, recently posted a picture of himself on social media on the set of his new gig. “I can’t reveal much at this stage. But I have another project coming up, which will be revealed soon. I look forward to what God has in store for me,” said Lunga. He said he wasn’t moved by the criticism about his acting he received recently as people talked all the time. “You can’t stop your life because of the fear of what people will say because they always have something to say,” he said. The former Selimathunzi host said he was grateful to those who showed him love on the show. “There were people who showed me love, especially with the cheating storyline. “I received a lot of compliments from people who saw my improvement,” said Lunga.
