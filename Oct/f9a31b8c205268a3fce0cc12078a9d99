IT’S still supposed to be spring in Mzansi, the season of new beginnings and bright colours but if you step outside you’d think we’re in the middle of summer, judging by the scorching heat. We have to now also contend with having sex in the heat. To keep things steamy, how can we cool it down in the bedroom, while still having hot and spicy sex? 1.Shower sex Take the action to the bathroom while the shower is gushing cold water. It’s guaranteed to keep you cool. 2.Change sex positions From doggy-style to standing up, try different positions that will limit your skin or body heat. You will indeed be fully behind your partner! 3.Skate on ice If you haven’t already played around with ice during sex, now is the time. 4.Sex on the ground To cool things down while keeping things hot, try and make out on the floor – it’s normally the coolest place in the house.
