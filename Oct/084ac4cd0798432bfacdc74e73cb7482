MOGAKOLODI Ngele will be the main target for Mamelodi Sundowns joint coaches on Wednesday night when his club Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) visit Loftus Versfeld Stadium. The Botswana international scored a brace in TTM’s 3-2 defeat against SuperSport United in the MTN8 quarter-finals two weeks ago. Ngele continued with his scoring form when he helped TTM earn a point in their 1-1 draw against TS Galaxy in their opening league clash at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. With this kind of form, joint coaches – Manqoba Mngqithi, Steve Komphela and Rhulani Mokwena – would be naive not to warn their defence to guard carefully against the slippery forward. And sending warning shots to Sundowns, TTM coach Joel Masutha believes the best is yet to come from his 30-year-old new signing. The former Sundowns midfielder started the new season on fire with the new DStv Premiership side and indications are that he might come to bursts his former club’s bubble after a 3-0 win against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. But Tshakhuma head coach Joel Masutha says the best is still yet to come . “Ngele is a very intelligent player and that is why we signed him as we believe in his talent,” said Masutha. “He is so talented. I am happy for him as he started this season in good form. I spoke with him at training that he needs to be free and play his normal clever game. “I can see that he is free and his confidence is coming back. But one thing I can say is that he has not yet shown his best as he is not yet 100% fit. You will see the best of him when he is fully fit. I see him scoring many important goals for us. “Ngele is good on header, good at free kicks, passing and scoring from long range. And with the player of that calibre, you should be happy as a coach. We are happy to have him.”
