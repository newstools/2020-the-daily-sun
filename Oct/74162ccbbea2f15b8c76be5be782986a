The excitement that came with easing lockdown rules has seen many young people crowding taverns. My fear is that when they’re drunk, they engage in unprotected sex. Some of the girls brag that they use contraceptives and can’t fall pregnant. They forget that failure to use condoms exposes them to HIV/Aids. Although the coronavirus is considered one of the deadliest viruses in the world, HIV/Aids is still alive, and its prevention is still relevant. It’s safe for youth to use contraceptives and condoms to prevent pregnancy and the spread of HIV/Aids. You may trust your partner, but you still need to use condoms, especially if you don’t know their HIV/Aids status and don’t plan to have babies. Be careful not to allow a few minutes of pleasure to ruin the rest of your life. One sexual encounter gone wrong can haunt you forever. Protect yourself in every way possible. - Percy Moffat Mamelodi East
