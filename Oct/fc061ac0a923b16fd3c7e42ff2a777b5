World Cup winning prop Trevor Nyakane will anchor the scrum in the only change to the starting team when the Vodacom Bulls host the DHL Stormers at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday, 31 October 2020. There are few rivalries as intense as the North-South derby, and the Vodacom Bulls will be looking to make amends for their 13-0 loss against the same opponents earlier this year before the pandemic put paid to the regular Vodacom Super Rugby season. The starting team will look towards the abrasive yet dynamic style of play that Junior Springbok lock forward Ruan Nortje brings to the table. Nortje has made 20 carries and 21 tackles thus far and finds himself one of only two players to do so after three rounds of Vodacom Super Rugby Unlocked. There is a further change amongst the finishers with Springbok loose forward Nizaam Carr replacing fellow Springbok Arno Botha. "The Stormers tend to be our measuring stick and beating them is non-negotiable amongst the players. We've come off a comfortable win, while our opposition for Saturday had to scratch and claw their way past the Pumas, so the stage is set for a hard and bruising affair," said Vodacom Bulls Director of Rugby, Jake White.
