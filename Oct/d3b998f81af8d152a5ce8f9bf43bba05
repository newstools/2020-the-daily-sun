Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, will have to wait a bit longer before their fraud case can go to trial. This was announced today at the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane when they made a brief virtual court appearance. The couple were arrested last year February, and this would be the fourth time their case is being postponed. They are facing charges of fraud, money laundering and the contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (Poca). The case has been postponed to 31 May to 18 June 2021 for trial. In a statement the leader of the Enlighten Christian Gatherings Church said he was surprised when the judge did not conduct the pre-trial as he ordered the State on 27 July. He said the pre-trial was meant for the State to address him on the current status of each witness with regard to their fears to attend court due to Covid-19 and produce medical certificates where necessary. “Instead, the judge simply requested the State to give a new trial date. “It is also worth mentioning that the State sent our lawyers a revised indictment, 45 minutes before the court appearance,” he said. He said as a law-abiding citizen, he still believes in the integrity of the South African justice system and he will still cooperate with the courts until justice is served and prevailed. “We remain grateful and thankful for your prayers and support,” he said.
