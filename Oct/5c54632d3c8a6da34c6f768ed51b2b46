BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have dumped Mamelodi Sundowns out of the MTN 8. Phunya Sele Sele beat the Tshwane giants 1-0 at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday. Victor Letsoalo scored the solitary goal of the match as Celtic shocked the star studded Brazilians. Celtic were determined to avenge their defeat to Sundowns in the final of the Nedbank Cup. Sundowns gave debuts to a few of their star signings including the likes of Peter Shalulile, Haashim Domingo, Kermit Erasmus and Aubrey Modiba. However, they could not inspire the team to victory against a spirited Celtic side. Celtic will now face SuperSport United in the semi finals of the competition. The headline fixture, though, will undoubtedly be the Soweto derby where Orlando Pirates host Kaizer Chiefs.
