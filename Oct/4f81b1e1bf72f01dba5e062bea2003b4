 The Transport Month campaign was launched to encourage people to
use public transport, so as to avoid traffic congestion. However, the campaign has not yielded positive results. There are still frustrating traffic jams during rush hour in our
cities. This becomes worse during month-end when everyone has money for petrol. This shows the campaign is a temporary measure to manage traffic
congestion. A long-term solution would be to build more roads and expand
existing ones. This could also open up job opportunities for unemployed people. Motorists need to be patient in slow-moving traffic to avoid
accidents. They shouldn’t drive over the yellow line, which is reserved for
emergency vehicles. Many pedestrians are knocked down by vehicles on the yellow line.
Motorists need to learn to start their journey earlier to avoid frustrations
during traffic jams. I hope more car owners heed government’s call to use public
transport. The move will indeed help reduce the number of vehicles on our
roads. I urge all road users to work together in making our roads safer. (Abigail Ledubuko – Bochum)
