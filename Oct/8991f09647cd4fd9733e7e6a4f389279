Nkele Mphahlele is a perfect crowd-pleaser. She’s been providing sing-along wedding songs for over two decades. The 44-year-old singer from Tooseng Village in Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, said her popular songs – Makoti Wa Rena, Ngwana O Tsamaya Ka Kekeke and Pala Monwana – have been well-received all over Mzansi and enjoy airplay. Her latest album Magadi ka Venda, released earlier this year, is set to follow the same trend. “It’s offers advice on how to keep growing together as couples and how to live with your in-laws in peace,” Nkele said. It’s no surprise that the singer is a presenter at Naka online radio, owned by former Sunday Sun sports writer Nakampe Lekwadu. Nkele hosts the Tsa Manyalo show on Saturdays from 10am to 11am. “I play wedding songs, announce wedding invitations, and interview wedding singers. I also offer advice,” she said. The radio host is in the running for Best Manyalo Radio Presenter in the Manyalo Music Awards. She hopes to be nominated and win.

She said her 2018 gospel album, Wa Mpona, signifies growth from wedding songs to ministry. “Gospel brings healing through messages we read in the Bible and deliver in the form of songs,” she said. Nkele also runs the Nkele Mphahlele Cultural Group, whose aim is to develop youth in her village. “I teach them traditional dance, food, attire and customs of other ethnical groups. This way, they’ll value their heritage and embrace it.”
