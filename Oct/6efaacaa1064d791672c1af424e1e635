I recently overheard girls talking about how a friend had said she was lucky to date men who drive luxury cars. I wondered if many girls shared this kind of dream. It’s detrimental for girls to feel as if their boyfriends’ cars are theirs. Whoever dreams of owning fancy cars must be prepared to work hard to achieve that goal. It’s sad to see beautiful young women being used by sugar daddies for sex and dumped like hot potatoes afterwards. Women who took things in their stride and became successful in previously male-dominated fields are proof that women have potential. Young women need to stop selling themselves cheap to these perverts. Arcadia
