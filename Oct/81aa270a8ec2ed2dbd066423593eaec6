THE Communication Workers Union wants Minister Blade Nzimande to intervene in its battle to make a supposedly filthy-rich company pay workers affiliated to it more money. Union members marched yesterday to the Department of Higher Education and Training offices in Tshwane. They said the company contracted by the department to supply laptops to students in higher education institutions was exploiting them. When no official stepped out to accept the memorandum of demands, the workers said they’d be back on Friday. Chairman of the union in Gauteng, Frans Ledwaba, said the company was unwilling to go beyond a 3% increase. He said the company, based in Midrand, made a lot of money this year because many students were studying from home.

We even went to the CCMA, where we had a clearance to protest.” He said their national office had written a letter to Nzimande in September, but didn’t get a response. “We tried to stop the tender. We want to convince him to intervene as a communist and minister. “We think he’d have workers’ interests at heart. We’re willing to negotiate, but won’t settle for 3%.” Workers wanted a 20% wage hike and would keep coming back until Nzimande listened to them. Daily Sun contacted the minister’s spokesman, Ishmael Mnisi, who said they were not aware of the protest. “A memorandum was not delivered to our office. But we were told by our security that there were protesters outside the building,” he said.
