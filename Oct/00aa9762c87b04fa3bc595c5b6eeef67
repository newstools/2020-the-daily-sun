I’VE often asked myself this odd question: Can a drummer function with one stick instead of two? I mean, drummers are known for using two drum sticks to musically guide them through their drum kit. So, will they still be called drummers with one stick? Similarly, a lot has been said about men who are born with two 4-5s, and should they indeed be dually gifted, will we still refer to them as men? Diphallia is a genetic condition present at birth in which a person has two penises, AKA 4-5s. Diphallia only affects about one out of every 5–6 million baby boys. This condition of having two 4-5s is not dangerous, however diphallia is associated with many other conditions that do cause medical problems. People with diphallia often experience other congenital defects, including digestive and urinary tract problems. Despite its rarity, in 2015, a 25-year-old man referred to as “Triple D” from the east coast of America was found to have two 4-5s. According to a Newsbeat article, Triple D claimed to have thousands of sexual partners. In the article, he described himself as “very much bisexual”. So, indeed double trouble can be double the fun, right?
