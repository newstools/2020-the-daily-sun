The tweets by Fikile Mbalula about MK military veterans and Carl Niehaus are direct, interesting and so truthful. Niehaus faked his own family memberâ€™s death for personal financial gain. He was relieved from his ANC duties as a result. Now, years later, he holds a prominent position in the ANC. As for the MK military veterans, they marched proudly in the streets of Durban and Joburg in their ragtag uniforms, as if they brought us liberation. We, the people of South Africa, liberated ourselves by negotiating our democracy. Military veterans fled to other African countries for greener pastures, leaving us behind and writhing under the heavy boot of the then SA Defence Force. Otherwise, why did our liberation take so long if we had a liberation army? They failed to march through the streets of the apartheid Pretoria in their uniforms, just like the liberation movements from Mozambique and Zimbabwe did in their respective countries. If the veterans had really been members of a liberation army, why would they march for RDPs and sympathy? Their ultimate reward would have been the democracy they claim to have brought to Mzansi. South Africa owes them nothing.
