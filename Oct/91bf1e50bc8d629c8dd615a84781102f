A GROUP of firefighters across Mzansi united to help rebuild their late colleague’s house, which burnt down in December. Daily Sun published a story on 2 July about a group of firefighters from the BrotherHood Club, who promised to rebuild Samuel Sambo’s house. The late Samuel worked as a firefighter at the City of Joburg’s Emergency Management Services. It was all smiles on Friday when the firefighters officially handed over the new house to the Sambos in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. Sylvia Nkabinde (36) praised the firemen for honouring her late husband.  “I’m happy about what they’ve done for us and hope this initiative won’t start and end with me,” she said. Sylvia said she would be involved in any project undertaken by the BrotherHood Club to show her appreciation. Family spokesman Steven Nkabinde thanked the firefighters for keeping their word. “They kept their promise and it’s great to see my sister move into the house that was once reduced to ashes. We also thank the companies that made sure the project was realised,” he said. Macrocomm Financial Services, headed by Kevin Chetty, pledged R160 000 towards the project. Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said: “The firefighters came together and contributed money to build the house for their late colleague who dedicated his life to saving people’s lives.” “It was just a dream when we started a crowd funding campaign on 1 July for the house. Now the house is standing and there’s the furniture inside. “The wife of our late brother is excited and BrotherHood Club is also happy because we made sure the family had shelter once again,” he said.
