The first time they managed to take his personal car but it was recovered. On the second time he was attacked at his home but they did not take anything. Despite this we believe these are separate and unrelated incidents,” he said. He said a case was opened but he could not provide the case number as it is with Govozile. “Unfortunately his phone has been off since yesterday and the case number is with him,” said Dlamini.
