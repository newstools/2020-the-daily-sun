STHANDILE Nkosi is heading towards her destiny! She got her big break with her role as Teaspoon on Mzansi Magic’s Vula Vala, which started two weeks ago. “I’m the chosen one. Teaspoon was created for me and I enjoy playing her,” said the 27-year-old from Soshanguve, Tshwane. Teaspoon is a girl from KwaThema in Springs, Ekurhuleni, who speaks isiPitori. She said Teaspoon is trustworthy, and that’s why she’s the right-hand woman of supermarket owner Bro Bheki, played by Sello Ramolahloane. “The role found me ready to showcase my talent,” said Sthandile, who makes isiPitori sound clear and believable. “During auditions I used isiPitori as my anchor to deliver the monologue. I felt comfortable with the language style.” Her love of acting started in Valhalla Primary School in Centurion.
