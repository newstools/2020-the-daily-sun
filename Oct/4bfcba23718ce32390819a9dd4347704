The South African Football Association (SAFA) has appointed Elizabeth de Koker as the new SAFA NEC member. De Koker takes over the position left vacant by Mzwandile Maforvane who has taken up full time employment with the Association. De Koker became only the second female President in SAFA’s 52 Regions when she was elected the President of Thabo Mofutsanyana Region in the Free State in 2018. She, along with Emma Hendriks the President of Siyanda in the Northern Cape, were at the time the two female Presidents to break the long standing barrier in the previously male-dominated sport. "Ms Elizabeth de Koker has been appointed as the new SAFA NEC member," SAFA revealed on social media. "She takes over the position left vacant by Mr Mzwandile Maforvane who has taken up full time employment with the Association."
