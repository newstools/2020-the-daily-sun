DANIEL Khumano was left homeless on Tuesday afternoon. He and other men claiming to be MK military veterans had their belongings thrown out of their houses at Rama City in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, by a private security company claiming they were illegal occupants. Daniel told Daily Sun he had lived at Rama City for more than six months and had never encountered problems before. “I don’t know where to go. This was supposed to be my home and now I’m chased out like a dog,” he said. Another resident, Ephraim Poo, said the people who issued the eviction order were taking advantage of the poor. He said Mpo Nthipe, known as the chairman of Rama City, has been trying to remove rightful owners from their homes for years to move his friends in.

He sent bouncers to beat us and now he uses the courts to make people homeless,” he said. Nthipe denied the claims, saying the evictions were done legally. He said the men who were evicted occupied houses illegally. “The houses are meant for military veterans, but they are not. We told them to supply us with documents as proof they’re veterans, but they couldn’t,” he said. Nthipe said they spoke to the men before getting an eviction order, but they refused to move.He said there were enough houses for everyone as long as they had papers proving they were who they said they were. “There are many houses and we’d love to have the rightful owners occupy them,” he said.
