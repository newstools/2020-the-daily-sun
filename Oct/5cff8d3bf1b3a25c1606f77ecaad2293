“WHEN I’m angry I don’t talk. I act,” said domestic worker, Buhle Tshawe (59). Buhle, who once gave her employer a hot klap, said: “It was on a Sunday morning. “She complained that the collar of her husband’s shirt hadn’t been properly ironed, but it was. “She just wanted to prove she was the madam. Her children also screamed at me. “I gave her a taste of her own medicine.” The domestic worker from Rooikoppen in Standerton, Mpumalanga, said her employer later apologised and became the sweetest boss ever. “I worked for her for six years after that.” Buhle said being a domestic is frustrating. “When your employer misplaces something you’re the first suspect. That’s why most of us don’t like what we do.” Buhle started working as a domestic worker when she was 17 after she ran away from a forced marriage. “A family member insisted I get married, and all I needed was to be able to read and write,” said Buhle, whose dream was to become an accountant. “She had power over my parents and they were afraid of her. “I hated her till she died. She denied me the opportunity and right to learn.” Buhle said she’s a member of Shiella’s Domestic Workers’ Organisation in Gauteng, led by Jabu Mangena. “Jabu understands our struggles. I forget about my problems when I’m with my fellow comrades. They make me feel happy.” She warned her colleagues about bad employers. “Some don’t love you at all. That’s why they’ll treat you like a doormat,” said Buhle.
