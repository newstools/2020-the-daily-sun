AMAZULU are set to unveil Orlando Pirates midfielders - Linda Mntambo, Luvuyo Memela and defender Limbikani Mzava - on Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala will join Usuthu after his agent Jazzman Mahlakgane was also seen in Durba before the club unveiled their new signings. Shabba, 36, has been clubless after leaving Turkish side BB Erzurumspor in June last year. Mntambo and Memela’s move will come as a huge surprised having been on the bench when Pirates beat Cape Town City in the MTN8 quarter-final at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Memela’s future was up in the air after his number 11 shirt was taken by new signing Deon Hotto, who played for Pirates also on Saturday. At this stage is not clear whether Mntambo and Memela will join Usuthu from Pirates on loan or permanent. Also set to be unveiled is Xola Mlambo and Augustine Mulenga, with the latter alleged to have declined to join Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. AmaZulu will also confirm that signing of Siphelele Mthembu and Makhehleni Makhaula. The duo have been training with the club for sometime. Makhaula will be reunited with coach Allan Freese, who was recently appointed as Usuthu assistant coach. The trio worked together last season at now defunct Highlands Park. The Durban-based side will confirm the permanent signing of Thembela Sikhakhane, who was also released by Pirates. Sikhakhane spent three seasons on loan at AmaZulu from Pirates. Another new signings are Sicelo Mkhize and Sphamandla Nene.
