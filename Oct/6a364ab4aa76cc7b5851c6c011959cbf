Formalise the taxi industry to reduce the killings of taxi bosses and drivers. Government must regulate the sector to control the industry. There are many concerns and regulations will make things easier for taxi bosses, drivers and passengers. Public transport remains a key driver of economic activity, while compliance remains a serious challenge in the taxi industry. Unroadworthy taxis, reckless driving, overloading and speeding are of some of the problems. Mzansi must have safe and reliable public transport and urgent attention must be given to the taxi industry to address all the problems it’s facing. Let us hope the taxi lekgotla will provide solutions to fix our ailing transport system. Government and taxi associations must find ways to make the industry work peacefully. People are tired of seeing violence in the industry. It’s time it is regulated and modernised like in other countries.
