THE financial incentives that have been dangled in front of the fighters billed for the BRD Boxing Promotions tournament has motivated them to unleash their best performances. The tournament that features two Gauteng provincial titles will take place tonight at Turffontein Racecourse. The boxing extravaganza, which is themed “Double Trouble”, is sponsored Heiders. The best bout of the night will share R50 000, with R40 000 going to the winner and the loser taking home R10 000 on top of their fight purses. The first provincial belt will be contested by Joshua Studdard and Tumelo Matsane in the bantamweight division, while the second Gauteng championship fight will be between Matshidiso Mokebisi and Ndobayini Kholosa. Studdard, who has 11 fights with two defeats, goes into this fight as favourite against his inexperienced opponent. Matsane has only fought on five occasions, winning three and losing the other two. The fighters are in great condition and are in a positive frame of mind. “We have put in a lot of sparring rounds in the gym and I am confident that this time it is coming our way,” said Studdard. “I would like to thank the sponsors and BRD for the opportunity to fight. “And Heider’s for the R50 000 cash prize as an incentive for the boxers. Come Friday night, I will be out there doing my best,” said Studdard. Matsane said: “I am ready for the fight on Friday. I want to thank the sponsors for the R50 000 they put up to win. I am going into the ring to take the win.” Mokebisi from the Free State has already stepped into the ring 20 times and has 11 wins to her credit including, four KOs, eight losses and one draw. Ndabayini from Soweto has a credible record of 13 wins including seven KOs
