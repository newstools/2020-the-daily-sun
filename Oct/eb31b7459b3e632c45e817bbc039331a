South African wheelchair tennis ace Kgothatso Montjane lost to Japanese world number 10 Momoko Ohtani in the women’s singles opening round at Roland Garros on Wednesday. The South African number 1, who is seventh in the world rankings, showed some fighting spirt and looked poised to earn a win over the 10th-ranked Ohtani in Paris after she fought back from 5-2 down in the first set to 5-4 before losing the set 6-4. In the second set, the advantages swung back and forth, but the Japanese dominated the set when Montjane ran out of steam to eventually lose the match 6-4, 6-1 in 71 minutes. It was Montjane’s first competitive match after a seven-month layoff due to Covid-19. She last played in a competitive match in January, when she reached the Australian Open semifinal round in Melbourne. It is a third consecutive first-round loss in the singles event at Roland Garros for Montjane, who reached the semifinal round at the clay court championships in 2013. The 34-year-old Limpopo-born star will join forces with Ohtani in the double’s competition. The South African-Japanese duo will open their campaign against Dutch top seeds Diede de Groot and Aniek van Koot on Friday. -supersport.com
