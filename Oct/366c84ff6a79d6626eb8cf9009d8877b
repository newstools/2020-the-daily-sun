Economically, socially and politically, South Africa is not where it needs to be – thanks to unwise actions taken by its citizens. Yes, Covid-19 has affected all nations, but what has the ruling party done differently in the past 26 years? Never mind the RDPs and grants which, admittedly, have helped people a lot. What changes did presidents Kgalema Motlanthe, Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa bring about? We’ve been lied to for far too long and need to remove the ANC from power just for one term and give another political party an opportunity to govern and see how they perform. We vote for the ANC because it helped liberate this country. But are we truly happy with the ANC now, and what are we going to do about it? Voting for it year in and year out, even though we see exactly what’s happening, suggests we’re literally shooting ourselves in the foot and blaming the wrong people. It’s neither the political party nor the president that brings change to the country. It’s the people and taxpayers who build and make a country great. South Africans, wake up and smell the coffee.
