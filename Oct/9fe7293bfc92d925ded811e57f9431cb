A FATHER and his daughter feel let down by the law. They want to know why the daughter’s alleged rapist only spent a year in prison. The 39-year-old man from Diepkloof in Soweto told Daily Sun his nephew raped his daughter in 2018 when she was only 13 years old. He said even though his daughter was sent for counselling after the rapist was arrested in December 2018, she was never the same again. The father said while he was still trying to help his daughter heal, the 22-year-old nephew was released from prison in January. He didn’t know why or how this happened. The father said the nephew raped his daughter again after his release, leaving her pregnant. The nephew then fled to KZN and, according to the father, police made no effort to find him. When he asked the investigating officer what had happened, he said he didn’t know anything as he was no longer handling the case. “It hurts watching my daughter being failed by the law. It’s the second time and, if he was still in jail, he wouldn’t have done this to my daughter again,” he said. The man said to make matters worse, family members had turned against him and his daughter. “Some said the two might have had an agreement, and that’s why she’s having the baby. “I don’t think my daughter needs to explain herself.” The dad said the law had failed them. Captain Mavela Masondo said a warrant of arrest was issued for the suspect. He was released due to a pending investigation. “Police are looking for him,” he said.
