WHILE the nation waits for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s economic recovery plan, activist Mmusi Maimane has unveiled his own. Launching the plan in Joburg yesterday, Maimane said interventions suggested could build a stronger Mzansi. The plan contains 20 interventions intended to put the country on the right track. Maimane now leads One South Africa, which promotes independent candidates contesting elections. The plan puts an emphasis on rooting out corruption and increasing transparency in the tender process by introducing an online procurement process. It also suggests SAA be sold and alternative electricity sources such as biogas, wind and solar projects be incentivised. Maimane proposed the creation of a jobs fund to replace BEE and distribute funds from businesses to real empowerment initiatives like bursaries, mentorship programmes and apprenticeships. He also wants to introduce a voluntary post-matric public service year to allow matrics entry into work-based training and gain experience while earning a small salary. “Debates as to whether government’s hardline approach to lockdown was correct or not are now academic. Political mudslinging over such matters solves nothing. “Rather, we must adopt a mode of pragmatism that objectively assesses the current situation and offers the most practical ways to remedy it.” He said when the coronavirus hit, the economy was already in recession and the impact of the pandemic just made it worse. “Two out of every three people of working age in South Africa are now unemployed. This is a ticking time bomb requiring urgent and deliberate action.” Maimane said South Africans were tired of vague plans.
