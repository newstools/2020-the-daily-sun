SIBONGILE’s night of terror started on Monday when she was woken up by a loud bang on her door. She got dressed and answered the door. When Sibongile Jele (52) from Tokologo in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, opened the door four men dressed in civilian clothes and claiming to be cops came in. They told her they were looking for guns and demanded to see her husband. Sibongile didn’t think she’d experience such brutality from cops. She told Daily Sun one of the men slapped her twice, and when she ran to the bathroom he followed her and kicked and choked her. “The cop hit me on the head with the butt of a gun,” she said.  “I told him that my husband wasn’t home, but he continued kicking me.” “The other policemen were trashing the house. “My eldest child ran outside and jumped over the fence while the younger one cried hysterically. Blood gushed out from my head.” She said the fence is high and the gate was locked. “I don’t know how they got in. When they left the house a cop took my four-year-old child and ran outside with her. “I screamed and asked where he was taking her, and he put her down.” She drove to the police station and then to the clinic.  Sibongile wants justice. Colonel Donald Mdluli said a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was opened. The cops spokesman said the docket had been forwarded to Ipid for investigation.
