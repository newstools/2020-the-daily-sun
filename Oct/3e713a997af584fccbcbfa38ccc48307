Former president Jacob Zuma has asked Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to recuse himself when he appears before the State Capture Commission next month. I reckon Zuma has a right to be treated fairly. If the former president feels Zondo has a personal vendetta against him, he has the right to ask him to recuse himself. Zuma’s argument is that Zondo has presented him to the public as someone who is not cooperative. It’s not like Zuma does not want to appear before the commission. All he wants is fairness. However, let’s hope he is not trying to buy time with his request. Frankly speaking, this commission was established to prove that Zuma was not involved in selling our country to the Guptas. He might be the one who started it, but he started this commission to prove them wrong. Nonetheless, the commission has so far shown that Zuma was not necessarily the only “culprit” in the state capture saga, just like some people would like to believe. It also appears that Zondo is targeting Zuma and nobody else. Why did Zondo give a date that is non-negotiable to Zuma and failed to do the same with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan? Remember the minister in question once asked for a postponement, but when it come to Zuma, it’s totally a different story. What does this mean regarding Zondo’s fairness and impartiality? These exceptional treatments say a lot about Zondo’s behaviour and his fairness, especially to those who are still to appear before the commission. ) Letter by Sam Difoe Magana, from Dennilton
