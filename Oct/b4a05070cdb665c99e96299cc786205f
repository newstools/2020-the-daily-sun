A FORMER cop has been arrested for impersonating a police officer. Metro police spokesman, Xolani Fihla, said the JMPD undercover unit was patrolling this morning along Eloff Street in the Joburg CBD when they stopped a white VW Jetta fitted with a dashboard and rear windscreen police lights. “While inspecting the vehicle, officers noticed that the driver was wearing SAPS uniform and they requested to search the vehicle,” said Fihla. He said that a police badge, name tag, bullet proof vest and a face mask were found inside the vehicle. “The driver handed over his SAPS pocket book and told the officers that he is an SAPS employee and holds a rank of a captain,” said Fihla. He also said the SAPS control room dispatcher informed officers that the persal number belongs to a Captain that has resigned as a police official in 2015. “The suspect was arrested and will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrates Court soon,” said Fihla.
