ANC Youth League members marched to Babelegi Industrial Park in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, on Friday to complain about unemployment. A number of locals also joined the march. Tlandi Mogale of the league’s task team said thousands of young people were unemployed despite the industrial park getting a R42 million cash injection from government. They were demanding that the North West Development Corporation create an investment portal.  The local economic development department had to provide youth with skills and capital to start small businesses. “The City of Tshwane must provide loans and grants to informal traders,” she said. “And vacant spaces must be turned into enterprise hubs where local informal traders can store their goods in a protected environment.” She said phase one of the business park, which had a budget of R46,9 million, would create 1 800 temporary jobs for locals. “We demand that government and the National Youth Development Agency help them start small businesses during the period of temporary employment,” said Mogale. Kotiti Aphane, the league’s executive member in Tshwane, said the organisation wanted Babelegi to be transferred to Gauteng. Aphane told Daily Sun that young people were becoming restless as the unemployment rate was too high. North West Development Corporation regional manager, Lucas Mafora, received the protesters’ memorandum of demands and promised to respond.
