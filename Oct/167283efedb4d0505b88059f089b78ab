TS GALAXY have parted ways with striker Rodney Ramagalela and goalkeeper Ludwe Mpakumpaku. Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi says they decided to release Ramagalela since they could not agree on contract, while Mpakumpaku was given a green light to seek greener pastures elsewhere. Ramagalela has now joined an exodus of players who left the now defunct Highlands Park after Sukazi bought the club’s PSL status and renamed it Galaxy. Said Sukazi on the club's website: “Rodney met with his management team in the past week. Looking at his own situation and personal circumstances, we came to an amicable solution to part ways. These things do happen. When people are unable to find each other in certain areas, they agree to part ways. It is not only Rodney, it happened with others like Wayde Jooste, Thela Ngobeni and Ryan Rae.” Sukazi added that his side has enough ammunition upfront having signed Chitiya Mususu from Zenaco in Zambia and Myer Bevan from Auckland City in New Zealand. He went on: “Mususu comes with great abilities that will assist this club. He must blend with the rest of players and hopefully that will give us goals. Young, Myer Bevan is 23 years old. He is a senior international for New Zealand. He played 17 games and managed to score 19 goals. He also scored 12 goals in five outings for their Under-23 which took them to the Olympic Games in Japan. Here is a young man who can potentially make a huge difference. We couldn’t let such talent go.” Sukazi revealed they released Mpakumpaku  who played a key role to help Rockets win the Nedbank Cup in 2019 as he will struggle to get the not in the starting line up ahead of Marlon Heugh, Wensten Van Der Linde and Melusi Buthelezi. “Ludwe started with the team. He went into camp with the club for our preparations for the upcoming season, but then he realized that he will be a third or fourth choice. He wants to play as a number one. From the goalkeepers that we have, that is not possible,” concluded Sukazi.
