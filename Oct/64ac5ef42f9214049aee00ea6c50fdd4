The death of Lindokuhle Makwelo (7) of Munsieville in Krugersdorp has sparked anger in the community. Today, the residents took to the street to show their anger. They blocked the entrance to the kasi with burning tyres and stones. The residents said human trafficking and child abductions were becoming a problem in the area and they wanted them to stop. They want the police to play their role.   “They must keep our children safe and take missing child cases seriously. They should act swiftly when such cases are reported,” said Sandile Dlamini. He said they were tired of police telling them to wait for 24 hours before a case could be registered. Lindokuhle went missing last Saturday. He was found dead in the nearby mountain the next day after a long search. The residents claimed that a blue Volkswagen Polo without number plates had been seen driving around the area and it targeted children. They claim that three teenage girls were taken from school. The residents said that another kid was abducted from her mum a few weeks ago. “This has to stop,” said the residents. Mothers in the area said they feared for their kids now. “We will end up jailing them in the yards if this continues and that is not right,” said Nonzuzo Mbatha (30). Lindokuhle’s devastated family told Daily Sun that it was hard for them to digest the passing of their son. “It still feels like a dream,” said Lindokuhle’s mum Nontembiso Makwelo. She said they were preparing for the funeral but were struggling. “We do not have money as no one is working. We need help,” cried Nontembiso. When found in the mountain, Lindokuhle had bruises. It looked as if he was strangled. His hands had tie wounds and he had blood in his mouth. Cops are investigating a case of murder.
