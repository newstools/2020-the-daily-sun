ORLANDO Pirates have released eight players to pave the way for new recruits. Bucs confirmed on the club's website that they have terminated the contract of Augustine Mulenga, Alfred Ndengane, Diamond Thopola, Xola Mlambo, Meshack Maphangule, Brian Hlongwa, Thembela Sikhakhane and Tercious Malepe. Read the statement: “The club would like to thank all the players for their service and wish them the best in their future endevours.” Mulenga will free up a foreign spot since he has been struggling to cement his place in coach Josef Zinnbauer's starting line-up. He has struggled to get the nod upfront ahead of the league's joint top goalscorer  Gabadinho Mhango and Tshegofatso Mabasa. On the other hand, Ndengane has failed to live up to expectations since he joined Pirates from Bloemfontein Celtic in October 2018. The arrival of  Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo from Bidvest Wits recently ended his hopes of convincing Zinnbauer that he deserves another chance to impress. Mlambo also struggled to get some game time since coach Rhulani Mokwena left the club. Meanwhile, the likes of Thopola, Maphangule, Sikhakhane and Malepe were released following loan spells with Chippa United and AmaZulu.
