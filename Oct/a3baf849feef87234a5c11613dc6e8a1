ACTRESS Letoya Makhene is engaged to businesswoman Lebohang Keswa. Lebohang popped the question on Saturday morning in a hot air balloon in Magaliesburg, Gauteng. While landing, a banner with “Letoya Will You Marry Me” written on it was dropped down to the ground. Later, they gathered with their friends and families at the Houghton Hotel in Joburg to celebrate. Letoya told guests she was madly in love with Lenohang. “She is everything I need!” she gushed. She said they’d been together for eight months and their love grew stronger every day. “What I live is that love conquers all. When we started this relationship we got a lot of criticism, but we have learnt to live with it,” she said. ALSO READ: BRILLIANT KHUZWAYO STABBED! She said she had her father Blondie Makhene’s blessing and that was all that mattered. “Lebo makes me happy. She taught me to see value in my life. I’ve been through a lot that broke me, but being with her made me whole again.” Lebohang said Letoya was everything she had ever dreamt of. Letoya said: “We flew up and when we were landing, there was writing on the ground. While I was surprised, Lebo was on one knee, asking for my hand in marriage.” Dad Blondie thanked everyone for their support and wished the couple the best. Letoya is a sangoma and her ancestral colleagues and gobela were also present, singing and dancing. SHE SAID YES?????????????????? @letoyamakhene?????? pic.twitter.com/b01JTxfAE2
