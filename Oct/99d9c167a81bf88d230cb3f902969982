Neo-soul vocalist Langa Mavuso has revealed his departure from record label Soulistic Music. He will release his self-titled debut album Langa independently. Soulistic Music is owned by award-winning DJ Black Coffee and it signed Langa in 2017. In an exclusive interview with Daily Sun after his album launch at the Aurum in Sandton, Langa confirmed that his contract with the label was temporary, which meant he needed to find something that would work for his personal goals as an artist. “Towards the end of my contract, Soulistic was already transitioning from being a music label into a talent agency. They basically do management and that’s not what I wanted from our partnership. So it made sense for me to move on and do things my way,” he said. He said his album was in collaboration with record label Platoon, which has worked with artists such as Samthing Soweto, Zoe Modiga, Ami Faku, Msaki, Azana and Manana. “Working with Platoon felt right,” he said. He emphasised that he is not signed to the company but it offered many options for artists to own their work. “The fact that I keep my masters means so much to me,” he said. Wearing a black sequin blazer and black trousers, Langa performed all the songs in his album live on Instagram. According to the Love Lost singer, the album comes after three years of an extensive creative process. Attempts to get comment from Soulistic drew blank as emails and texts were not responded to at the time of publication.
