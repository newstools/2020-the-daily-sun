I wanted my album to be a compilation of a playlist that I could listen to as well as the next person and so the process to curate the songs was meticulous and diligent,” she said. Her album’s lead single is Stop, which she said is about understanding one’s purpose. “I’m tired of being a power source and I’m left empty and seeing how it affects me. It’s a feel-good song. “You have to understand your self-worth and act on it. You’re your own biggest resource. The universe will return the frequencies you send out,” she said. Her album is available for pre-order on all digital music streaming platforms.
