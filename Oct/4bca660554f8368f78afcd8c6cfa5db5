“I didn’t go to prison for people to steal from the poor.” These were the profound words of the late Andrew Mlangeni in response to rampant corruption in government. Even before this great son of the soil was laid to rest, reports emerged of people stealing from Sassa and UIF relief funds. Some stole food parcels meant to alleviate poverty among the poor, as the coronavirus hit. Mlangeni and his comrades, who gallantly fought for the liberation of this country, surely didn’t go to prison for this. Now we long and miss the calibre of such leaders. It is never too late for men and women in the ANC and government to rise up and emulate Mlangeni and his comrades.
