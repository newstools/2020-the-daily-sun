An unemployed teacher from Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, is inviting accounting and business studies matric pupils to contact her if they are having any difficulties. Wendy Matandabuzo (24) told Daily Sun that she has decided to help grade 12s because she wants to see the province’s matric results improve. “Even though I am doing this for my province, I am also doing it for my home town, Lusikisiki. She studied teaching at Walter Sisulu University. “I am unemployed so I am dedicating this time to doing what I am good at. I am doing this for free because people are not working, like me. So if I charge them, where will they get money to pay me. I know grade 12s need help as they couldn’t do a lot of school work because of the lockdown,” said Wendy. All those who are interested can send her a message on Facebook. Wendy is also looking for a job. “I am very passionate about teaching that is why I am doing this. When I got into teaching, I told myself that I want to bring change and I am starting now.” Nontlahla Khayeni (45) said the pupils needed all the support they could get. “The lockdown has made things very difficult for our kids, we are grateful when people like Wendy offer to help them because even teachers are under pressure,” said Nontlahla.
