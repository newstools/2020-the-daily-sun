  This as her supporters told News24 the commission's process was unfair and biased. Speaking to News24 on Friday, ANC member and spokesperson for Gumede's supporters, Mzomuhle Dube, said the party's national executive committee (NEC) needed to have clear guidelines on its resolution.   Boycott When asked by News24 if she intended boycotting her scheduled appearance, she referred the media to provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli, adding she had no intention of going against her party. Gumede is among 17 people who are facing charges ofÂ corruption involving R430 million linked to the Durban Solid Waste tender corruption case.    Ntombela said the provincial integrity commission had been given a month to conclude its process with all party members facing court cases. "At this time, we are not sure is she will appear before the commission," Ntombela said. Dube said the ANC needed to be clear on what it expected from its leaders. "The wish is that we want to get rid of the rot in the ANC. From us as branches, we advise her that she should not go as yet. "There are glaring inconsistencies in decisions that are taken by provinces on the same matter and the process is not clear. That is where her legal team will clarify. She needs to wait until the ANC consolidates a position around this issue," he added.
