Leading the men in blue, Tshwane district police commissioner Major-General Hilda Mohajane said the operations every Thursday had forced people to adhere to the law. She said: “We’re stopping all vehicles to ensure drivers adhere to the rules. “We want to ensure passengers wear masks, adhere to social distancing, and that hands are sanitised. Covid-19 is still with us.” They also searched for wanted suspects and looked for bottle store owners who broke Covid-19 regulations. Said Mohajane: “We want to make sure that tavern owners have the necessary documents and comply with rules and regulations of the Liquor Act. “We also look at illegal liquor outlets. When we find someone operating illegally, we close the outlet and confiscate the alcohol.” He said 33 people were bust for domestic violence-related crimes. Foreigners travelling from Joburg to Tshwane who couldn’t produce proper papers and were taken to the immigration office. “We also served traffic fines to motorists who didn’t adhere to road rules,” said Mohajane.
