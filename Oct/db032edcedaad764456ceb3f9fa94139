Arson attacks on schools shouldn’t be tolerated. Pupils preparing for final exams don’t need disruptions. We are setting our children up for failure, and I’m disappointed to still be talking about the burning of schools in the country. I was touched to read about burnt schools in North West. This is a serious problem for our children. It was depressing to learn that during lockdown, some schools were burnt. It is mind-boggling how thugs don’t respect state property, especially our schools. When people are unhappy because they don’t have tar roads or protest over lack of electricity, what do they do? Burn down a school. When thugs are looking for a quick buck, where do they go? They break into a school. This bad behaviour can no longer go unpunished. Jail thugs who burn and vandalise schools!
