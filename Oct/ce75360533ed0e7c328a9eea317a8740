American rapper Cardi B will still be the international headliner for the Castle Lite Unlocks experience next year. This after Africa’s biggest premium beer brand placed the 2020 experience on ice due to the global Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year. According to the beer brand, the postponement of the event to next year is an effort to ensure the health and safety of fans is prioritised and that fans get the full experience. Speaking to Daily Sun, Castle Lite brand director, Silke Buckner, said: “Under the current event rules, we are unable to bring Castle Lite Unlocks to life at the scale consumers expect. We also know that despite being on level 1, Covid-19 is still a reality and the health and safety of our consumer will always be our number one priority. We can confirm that Cardi B will still be coming to South Africa to give her Bardigang a performance they’ll never forget.” The rapper will be joined on stage by some of the biggest names in the local and African hip hop scene. Consumers who already bought tickets for the cancelled event should not worry. The tickets will still be valid for the new performance date. They will be contacted regarding the ticket exchange. However, those who no longer wish to attend they are entitled to a refund through TicketPro. Refund procedures will also be communicated to valid ticket holders. For those who wish to buy the tickets for the 2021 experience, they’ll have to wait for the new date to be announced.
