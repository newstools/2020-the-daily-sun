WESTERN Cape EFF regional secretary Banzi Dambuza is angry with the City of Cape Town for opening beaches without lifeguards. This after a man drowned. He accused the DA-led provincial government of fighting to open beaches to the public yet knew they weren’t prepared to ensure people’s safety. He said the city issued a notification more swimming pools were to be opened, but people’s safety wasn’t guaranteed. “Nothing is indicating that there will be proper safety for our people. There are no strong measures here to protect our people,” said Dambuza. He was approached by the family of Thabo Qoza (25), who died at Mnandi Beach on 11 September. They complained that their son would have been saved if there were lifeguards on the beach. Cameron Benn (34) from Mitchells Plain, who saw the drowning, said: “He cried for help while trying to swim, but no one could help. “There were no lifeguards, but only law enforcement officials. I was hurt that a person died just like that.” Community service and health MMC, Zahid Badroodien, said beaches were officially opened under level 2 but hadn’t deployed lifeguards. “The City plans lifeguard deployment for the coastline annually, in line with school holidays. “The city is in the process of recruiting, vetting and training lifeguards who will be deployed from 23 October at certain beaches.”and tidal pools around the city, based on the Drowning Prevention Plan,” he said. Badroodien urged visitors to the beach to only swim where and when lifeguards were on duty.
