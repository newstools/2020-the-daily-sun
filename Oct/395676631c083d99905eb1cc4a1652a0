TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi has confirmed that they are interested in Xola Mlambo. Mlambo is currently a free agent after he was deemed surplus to Orlando Pirates’ requirements a few days ago, despite having spent two seasons with the Soweto giants. Interestingly, Mlambo is under Sukazi’s former player agent company, QT Sports. The company negotiated the deal when he joined Pirates from Bidvest Wits in the second half of the 2017-18 season. Galaxy are putting a team together for the DStv Championship this coming season after they bought Highlands Park’s PSL status. “We are very much interested,” said Sukazi. “Mlambo is such a talent and we would be foolish not to be interested in him,” said Sukazi in Durban yesterday during their marketing and PR quest in search for dancers and models, who will be used by the club for their home games this coming season at Mbombela Stadium in Mpumalanga. “I’m aware other clubs also want him. Whether we’ll manage to have him, it’s a competition that we will try to win.” The 29-year Soweto-born Mlambo needs no introduction to Galaxy coach Dan Malesela, as they know each other very well having previously worked together at Mamelodi Sundowns’ development structures. Malesela also coached Mlambo at Cape Town All Stars and also at Chippa United, before he joined Wits ahead of 2016-17 season. On top of that, Sukazi said that the style of play Mlambo possess suits that of Galaxy, which is known under Malesela of playing carpet football. “Xola can easily fit in our team and our coach comes a long way with him,” added Sukazi. Galaxy’s first game of the season, according to the 2020-21 PSL fixture draft, will be against another newbies Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), who also bought Wits’ PSL status, at the Thohoyandou Stadium on 25 October.
