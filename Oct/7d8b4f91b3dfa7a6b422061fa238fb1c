A FATHER who is accused of raping his daughter has been remanded in custody, where he will appear again before Mhala Magistrates Court on Tuesday. The 42-year-old man from Baghdadi in Hluvukani Village near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga appeared at Mhala Magistrates Court in Thulamahashe on Friday. He was not asked to plead to charges of rape. His wife discovered that he allegedly impregnated their daughter, aged 14, and the mum did not waste time reporting the matter to police. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said it is alleged that around September this year, the suspect used to wake up in the middle of the night and go to the victim’s room, where he allegedly raped her and threatened her not to tell anyone. “But the mum noticed some changes in her daughter’s body and she took her to the clinic, where the nurse confirmed that she was pregnant. The daughter confessed she was raped by her biological father. “The matter was reported to police and he was arrested and appeared at Mhala Magistrates Court on Friday. The matter was postponed to 3 November for a formal bail application and he remains in police custody,” said Mdhluli. Gender-based violence project leader Thulamahashe Hlayiseka Ngomane (33) told Daily Sun that they want to raise concerns about abuse in society. “Our message must be heard that men must stay away from abusing women and children. It’s painful to see uncles and fathers raping their daughters. If we check the statistics, it’s growing every day in the country,” said Ngomane.
