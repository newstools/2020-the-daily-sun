CAPE Town City have confirmed the return of their star player ahead of the 2020-21 campaign. On Tuesday morning City announced the return of winger Aubrey Ngoma from Mamelodi Sundowns. The 30-year-old was part of the Citizens first squad that took SA by a storm on their first season. His incredible display saw him earn a lucrative switch to Sundowns, however, his spell there did not go as planned. His stay with Sundowns was unsuccessful under former coach Pitso Mosimane with just three starts across all competitions afforded over the past season and a half. ?? | Cape Town City is delighted to announce the signing of Aubrey Ngoma.
