Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the man has been arrested and charged with attempted murder. “His gun had been confiscated as he is yet to appear before Mokopane Magistrates Court today for a bail application,” Mojapelo said. In the video, a man who appears to be the husband is kneeling next to the victim’s head, accusing him of wrecking his marriage. He can clearly be heard when he says, “You are messing up my family,” while the victim is lying on the ground bleeding and asking for forgiveness. “This man is monied, driving expensive cars and wrecking my marriage,” the man said. In another video, the paramedics arrive at the scene and the shooter shows them where he shot the victim.
