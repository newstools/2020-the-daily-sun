JOHN might not be the only one who gets to open the gate for Stoko! Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo might also find himself opening the gate and at the Zondo Commission. And this Stoko will come in the form of EFF leader Julius Malema. This after yesterday, when Malema tweeted: “Nasi Stoko, Zondo vuli igate.” That was in response to reports that the Zondo Commission allegedly summoned the banks and requested Malema’s bank statements and that of his deputy, Floyd Shivambu. The tweet was accompanied by two photos of Malema wearing grey suits. Shivambu said the commission was being used for political battles. In a tweet he said: “Now that Zondo and the handled administrators of the State Capture commission are failing to pin down the Guptas, they’re using the commission to fight political battles of Jamnandas (Pravin Gordhan) and the white capitalist establishment. We will expose their misguided political agenda. Disgusting!” On Thursday, Malema told Newzroom Afrika they fought for the commission to be established. He said he supported the commission’s work and would gladly go to the commission if he was needed to testify. He said he’d even go there without a lawyer. Malema said in all the corruption scandals in Mzansi, there wasn’t even one involving EFF leaders. Daily Sun tried to get further comment from the EFF leadership, but couldn’t at the time of going to print. Last week, the commission indicated they also wanted to get into the financials of former president Jacob Zuma, his children and their family trust.
