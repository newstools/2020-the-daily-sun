IT will matter to Richard Mbulu that he has now scored one of the fastest goals in PSL history. But most importantly, his wonder goal has contributed to Baroka FC’s perfect start to the season as they thumped Black Leopards 3-1 in Venda last night. Mbulu, the man of the match last night, hadn’t been prolific in front of goal. He could score a single goal in 25 league appearances last season. But this time around, he hardly looks a shadow of his former self, already leading the scoring charts with three goals. Yes, it is early days and Bakgaga might take more than two matches to pick up six points. They are not a high-scoring team, having last netted three goals in a league match three years ago. But Mbulu has reason to celebrate. His opening goal may well find some place in the history books after he nearly broke a 10-year record, set by Aleni Lebyane when he scored for Free State Stars against Santos. Fed a high ball by Cheslin Jampies, Mbulu headed in the opener in the very first minute. Evidence Makgopa connected a perfect delivery from a corner-kick to increase the lead midway through the opening half, before Mbulu grabbed his second, a low header from Thamsanqa Masiya’s cross on the stroke of halftime. So driven was Mbulu that he could have his first career hat-trick in the PSL in the second half with a much finish. But it was Phelelani Shozi who scored in the wrong end, guiding into his own net to give Leopards what turned out to be a consolation goal, on the hour mark. But interim coach Thoka Matsimela’s side are top of log this morning, unbeaten in two games. It has been a rare good start for them, having chalked up points against Maritzburg United. On the other hand, it doesn’t look good for Leopards coach Patrick Aussem.
