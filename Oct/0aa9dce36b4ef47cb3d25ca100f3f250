Waist high slits are now a thing, especially on the red carpet and it seems there is a new trend on the rise called vagina cleavage from the dramatic slits. This trend comes from the high slits that leave nothing to the imagination and flash the vagina. Italian models Giulia Salemi and Dayane Mell once trended at the Venice Film Festival, while wearing brightly coloured, crotch-flashing dresses.  Most A-listers who pull this look rarely have undies underneath and their vagina at some point become visible.Â Some of these ladies though do wear the C-string underneath that covers the vagina and lets you have your slit as high as you want.
