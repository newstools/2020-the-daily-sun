I AM no mixologist, but allow me today to mix together a perfect cocktail that will not only taste good but will get you feeling frisky. My concoction is based on drinks that not only makes you feel good, but are also proven to enhance your sexual experience. While we all know that it is vital to drink responsibly, this drink can be mixed at the bar of your own home. This is what “The Perfect Sex” cocktail entails, but be warned, it can be a bit stiff: 1. Red wine base Studies show that red wine may be the only type of alcohol that can improve sex. It can increase testosterone levels and lower the chances of an instance of sexual dysfunction. But the key is to drink it in moderation. 2. Rum in the middle If you are the nervous type and need to keep the anxiety and nerves in check, rum levels the playing field quite nicely. 3. Tequila on top Like Beyonce, the likelihood of you being drunk in love or sex can leave you hungover. According to mixologists, the alcohol type with the least hangover effect is tequila. Cheers, enjoy responsibly.
