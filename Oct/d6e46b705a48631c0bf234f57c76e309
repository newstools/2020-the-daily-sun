ACTRESS Nomcebo Gumede is making a comeback on SABC1’s Uzalo. This after a year since the talented actress, who plays Mumsy, left the show. Speaking to Daily Sun, Nomcebo said she was surprised when the casting director called her to ask if she was available. “This is the third time Mumsy is making a comeback on the show. I never thought she’d come back. “I only believed it when I had to sign the contract,” she said. Nomcebo said viewers should expect the unexpected when Mumsy returns. “People shouldn’t expect Mumsy to be crazy. “They shouldn’t expect her to be the same person she was when she left for Swaziland.” The talented actress said Mumsy is hiding a big secret. “Although people are going to see a soft side to her, she is still going to bring drama and excitement to the show as she’s hiding a big secret,” she said. Nomcebo told the People’s Paper that stepping back into Mumsy’s shoes after a year has not been easy. “I left the show in 2018 and have had the opportunity to play different characters, which were totally different to Mumsy. “I was concerned about whether I’m doing justice to the character as I didn’t want to disappoint. “But the casting director and some cast members assured me I’m doing great,” she said.
