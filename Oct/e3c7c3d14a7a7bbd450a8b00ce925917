FORMER Bidvest Wits defender Keagan Ritchie is back at Swallows FC. However, this time the former Kaizer Chiefs left-back is being assessed by the Soweto club after he departed the now defunct Wits at the end of last season. According to SunSport sources, the club is interested in signing Ritchie because of his PSL experience and his versatility has caught the team’s attention. Ritchie’s left the club after Wits ceased to exist after selling their DStv PSL status to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Swallows chairman David Mogashoa confirmed Ritchie is training with the club. “Yes, I’m aware Keagan Ritchie is training with the club but he hasn’t been signed,” said Mogashoa. “And there’ll be lot more players joining Swallows for training or assessment.” The talented 30-year-old left-footed defender previously played for Swallows in the 2010-11 season before joining Chiefs the following season. Ritchie has won the league, two Nedbank Cups and MTN8 trophy. SunSport understands that the club have also set their sight on signing Thabo Matlaba, who is also a free agent after terminating his contract with Black Leopards. The former Orlando Pirates defender has also made his intention clear that he wants to return to Joburg to be closer to his family. “He (Matlaba) is a good player and we are always interested in good players,” revealed Mogashoa. “If he’s available and we can afford him, then why not.” Meanwhile, the club is keen to bolster their technical team with an experienced PSL coach to assist head coach Brandon Truter, who steered the Dube Birds back to the Premiership last season. “We are still looking for an assistant coach for Truter. While he still has two assistants, we will be playing in the Reserve League (MultiChoice Diski Challenge this season) and opportunities are going to open up. “One of those assistants will have to go to the MDC,” added Mogashoa.
