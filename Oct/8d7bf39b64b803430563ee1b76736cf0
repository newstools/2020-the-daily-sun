FORMER president Jacob Zuma allegedly instructed Transnet to reinstate CEO Siyabonga Gama. Gama was fired from the state-owned entity in June 2010 after being found guilty of misconduct. Yesterday, Transnet’s former group legal manager Siyabulela Mapoma told the Zondo Commission the company’s board chairman at the time, Mafika Mkhwanazi, told him Number One wanted Gama back at Transnet. He said he understood from a number of interactions with Mkhwanazi that Number One referred to Zuma. “He did say he was under instruction to reinstate Gama. I never asked him who instructed him. “But in our interactions at various times I’d be made to understand the instruction came from the former president, and that the board had given him a mandate.” SOUTH AFRICANS BEHAVE AS IF THERE NEVER WAS CORONAVIRUS! NE He said Mkhwanazi asked for his help in bringing Gama back and would tell him how he wanted this to be done. “His words were that he wanted to do the reinstatement ‘cleanly’. I did not personally meet Gama,” said Mapoma. He said he wasn’t surprised when Zuma’s name came up. He had intereferred in Transnet’s internal affairs before. Mapoma said Gama took the matter to the Transnet Bargaining Council when he was dismissed, and when this failed he approached the high court. But he lost and was ordered to pay both attorney costs. Mapoma said Gama eventually came back in February 2011 after a settlement was reached. “However, the settlement agreement now said something different. It asked Transnet to contribute 75% of Gama’s taxed legal costs. It was to be done within 14 days,” he said. Mapoma said he later received a 55-page bill of costs from Gama’s lawyer, Themba Langa, to pay R12 million. “I told Langa I refuse to pay it outright. It just didn’t make sense to me,” he said. He said despite his advice, the board decided to pay Langa R1,7 million in legal fees.
