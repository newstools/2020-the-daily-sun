BAROKA’s days of fighting relegation are history. This is the message from their interim coach, Matsimela Thoka, after Bakgaga started their 2020-21 DStv Premiership season with an impressive 2-1 win against Maritzburg United at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Baroka have been fighting relegation for the past three seasons. However, Thoka, who is currently in charge of the Limpopo-based club as head coach Dylan Kerr is still on suspension, said football fans will see a totally different Baroka team this season. “This is a dream start for the team and me as a coach this season,” said Thoka.” “To be honest, it was not an easy game but we played according to our plans. I am pleased with the performance of the boys and I cannot ask more from them. This win will motivate them and bring confidence to the team this season. We have a strong team and I see us playing good football. “We are not going to be fighting relegation this season. We have been in the top flight for five seasons and it’s time now we start being counted among the best.” Asked if he is ready to lead the team on a permanent basis if Kerr should be fired, Thoka said: “I don’t want to talk about issues that have nothing to do with me. “All I know is that Kerr is still our coach and he has been suspended. “All I can say is that I have been with this team for years and I am always going to be ready when I am needed. “The good thing for me is that I am still young and I am learning. “I am happy with the way the boys have been responding at training and at the game. I am sure people saw it on Saturday. For now, I am just enjoying my time with the boys, taking one game at a time.” Baroka’s goals against The Team of Choice were scored by Nhlanhla Mgaga and Richard Mbulu while Ali Meza netted for United five minutes from time.
