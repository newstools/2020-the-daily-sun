FIVE-YEAR-OLD amapiano singer ND Boy is going international. ND Boy, whose real name is Ndalo Yunus Buthelezi, was approached by American production company Picture Creation, who want to use his song, Hero Land in a movie. The song features Jayclaude and Don Trozo, and was released last month. The young singer’s mum, Lwazi “Lwazzy” Buthelezi (28), said the movie is called Super Kids and Picture Creation is in California. Lwazzy from Kensington, Joburg, said she was excited when she got the email. “I was overwhelmed with joy. They said they were working on an animated movie and they’d like to use his song. As a singer myself, I realise that this is huge. Anyone would be happy to get this opportunity and I’m glad that it was my son who got it,” said Lwazzy. Lwazzy said her son’s singing career started last year. “I used to take him to the recording studio with me and I soon realised that he loved singing. When he told me he wanted to become a singer, I started helping him and we recorded his first song in October last year. He has three songs so far and we’re working on more.” She said they will meet the producer of the production company today. ND Boy told Daily Sun he loves singing. “I love singing for my friends and playing as Spiderman. I’m happy my song is going to play in a movie in America,” he said.
