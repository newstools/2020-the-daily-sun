BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki says he will ring the changes, bring more experienced players when they face Zambia on Sunday (3pm). Bafana and Chipolopolo will lock horns at Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace, the same venue where they were held to a 1-1 draw by Namibia on Thursday. Ntseki revealed after their draw against Namibia that players such as Percy Tau who did not play against The Brave Warriors will play on Sunday. Tau, and the likes of Andile Jali, Themba Zwane and Thulani Hlatshwayo are other players who could feauture on Sunday as they were rested against Namibia. “Percy Tau was rested and rest of the guys who were rested for today’s match will feature on Sunday‚” Ntseki said. The match against Namibia was Bafana’s first match in 11 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bafana are using these two friendly matches to prepare for next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe. Ntseki believe Bafana could have won the match, they just lacked concentration and became more anxious. He said: “There were moments of the game where we did well. We are not happy with the results we wanted to win this one and give us confidence going forward but the you do not win game by not scoring goals you win the game by scoring goals and good defending. “There was no threat in the first half. I think it was one ball that was played behind the defence and I think (Peter) Shalulile tried to put it in at the far post and it went out. “That was the only opportunity they had in the first half. But when you look at the second half they were playing more of the long balls and we dealt very well in the first half with the long balls. “We wanted to win this one and get confidence going forward.”
