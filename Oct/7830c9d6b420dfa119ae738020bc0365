A NEW study by Japanese researchers warns that plastic face shields don’t work as they allow Covid-19 droplets to escape. We’ve seen many professionals use faceshields at work, but this new study from Riken Centre found almost 100% of airborne droplets of less than 5 micrometres escaped through a plastic visor, while 50% of larger droplets found their way into the air. Team leader Makoto Tsubokura said: “Judging from the results of the simulation, unfortunately the effectiveness of face guards in preventing droplets from spreading from an infected person’s mouth is limited, compared with masks. This is especially true for small droplets of less than 20 micrometres. At the same time, it somehow works for the droplets larger than 50 micrometres.”
