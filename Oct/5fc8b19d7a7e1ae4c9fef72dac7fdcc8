SUPERSPORT United’s lethal striker Bradley Grobler says they have a strong team this season capable of defending their MTN8 title. Grobler was speaking following United’s 3-2 victory against new DStv Premiership side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in their Wafa Wafa quarter-final showdown at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. The Bafana Bafana star was impressed by United’s new signing Iqraam Rayners and their young striker, Lungu Ghampani. United coach Kaitano Tembo signed Rayners from Stellenbosch FC while their 22-year-old Zambian international, Ghampani renewed his contract with the three times PSL champions in March. Ghampani joined the Tshwane side in 2018 at the age of 20, but this season it looks like Tembo will use him more often alongside Grobler and Rayners. “I think we have a strong team this season if you look at the players we have signed,” said the Joburg-born star who scored 14 league goals for United last season. “I am impressed by the performance of the duo upfront on Saturday. We had a good understanding upfront. But it is what we have been practising at training. I think we will make a good striking team this season. I am also happy for Rayners, who has adapted fast.” He added: “It is going to be tough to defend this title, but I am positive that we can do well and go all the way. Our aim is to take one game at a time. We are in the semi-finals and we will give our best to defend this title.” United goals were scored by Ghampani, Rayners and Grobler. “It is good for a striker to score a goal as it gives you confidence looking ahead to the new season,” said United’s Player of the Season. “It is also a dream for any striker to score in your first game in a new team. The thing is as a striker, you are signed to score goals and you can imagine the feeling of scoring on your debut. “I am happy for both players and I hope they can continue to score more goals for us this season.”
