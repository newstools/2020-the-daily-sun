WHEN it comes to health, these senior citizens are at the top of their game. Over 30 elderly men and women meet at Power Child Centre in Mfuleni, Cape Town, three times a week to do various physical activities. Centre programmes manager Nomabelo Mgweba (46), told Daily Sun: “We start from age 55. Some of them suffer from chronic illnesses such as high-blood pressure and arthritis, among others. And some of these illnesses require exercise.” Wearing blue soccer jerseys, the elderly recently showed off their physical strength to the SunTeam. Besides doing exercises, they also use their hands to make things like doilies and beadwork. Nomabelo said the activities kept the gogos and mkhulus’ minds busy. They sell their work to the public. “We’re not getting support from anywhere, but members contribute R50 monthly from their pension money. “We used to have a German sponsor, but they stopped in 2018. “We then decided as staff and members that we shouldn’t stop this programme.” Gogo Beatrice Ntshangase (70) said she’s been taking part in the programme for the past 12 years. She enjoys the activities and spending time with her friends. Nomabelo said if they had a sponsor, they’d extend the programme to five days a week. “The elders want us to meet daily, but we can’t. They need to eat when they’re here,” she said. “The contributions they make each month aren’t enough for us to do it every day.” Nomabelo said they worked with the local hospital and social workers. “When the clinics see an elderly person that needs to exercise, they send them to us.”
