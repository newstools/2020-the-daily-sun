THE busy Slotjhile Pub & Shisanyama resembled a ghost town over the weekend. It’s understood the pub has been operating on municipal land since it opened its doors three years ago. The pub, known for its African food and view of the lake, is situated in Esselen Park in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. General manager Valentine Mabaso said the pub has been closed since last Wednesday. She said: “We’re engaging with the municipality to reach an amicable agreement.” She declined to disclose reasons behind the closure. The pub later released a statement assuring the public the matter was being attended to. “We understand the closure came as a shock to our patrons and led to frustration. “We sincerely thank you for the support you’ve shown us and humbly appeal that we don’t participate in marches that may jeopardise possibilities of reaching an amicable decision with parties involved.” Valentine was confident Slotjhile Pub would be back in business this weekend. Meanwhile, a Facebook post screenshot accusing the municipality of jealousy, corruption and bribery has been making rounds on social media. The post said the pub’s closure affected families who relied on the establishment for income. The City of Ekurhuleni said a number of compliance issues were raised with the pub owners. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe told Daily Sun: “These relate to operating a business in a residentially-zoned area, as well as encroachment onto municipal-owned land. “The city welcomes the employment opportunities created by the lifestyle lounge. “And it would be incorrect to suggest that by enforcing by-laws, the city is undermining economic activities brought by the lounge. “The owners, like any other business, are expected to comply.”
