MANDLA Ncikazi has been appointed as a Golden Arrows head coach. This post became vacant after Steve Komphela stepped down as Arrows mentor on Sunday night after 20 months in charge of Abafana Bes’Thende. The former Kaizer Chiefs coach has since joined Mamelodi Sundowns as a “senior coach”. Ncikazi, who arrived at Arrows in December 2015 at the same time with then coach Clinton Larsen, knows the club inside out. He was the assistant coach of Manqoba Mngqithi when Arrows won the MTN8 trophy in 2009 when the Durban-based side annihilated Ajax Cape Town 6-0 at Orlando Stadium. Ncikazi will be assisted by Mabhuti Khenyeza, who is a legend of the club, as he has returned after his departed TS Galaxy. Khenyeza, who was demoted to coach Galaxy’s MDC team after the club appointed Dan Malesela, initially planned were that to take over Arrows’ MDC post. However, with Komphela now gone, the club needed a new assistant to work with Ncikazi. Khenyeza played a key role when Arrows returned to the top flight football after joining them in the second half of 2014-15 season. That strengthened Arrows' springs to go on and win the now GladAfrica Championship title under Shaun Bartlett.
