So, I have always had a thing for bubbles. Whether it’s a sticky situation with bubble gum, messing around in a bubble bath or following artists who are bubbling under with amazing talent. There is something intrinsic about bubbles, and champagne seems to tick all the boxes when it comes to bubbles. Whether you’re a Moet or Krug type of person, we can all admit that champagne has a certain class and prestige to it. When people pop amabhodlela, pop some champagne. There is an element of celebration and toasting to success and happiness. However, who knew that this beverage, which is often described as an acquired taste would have some health benefits? Here are the benefits of drinking champagne: 1.	Prevents memory loss A study at the University of Reading determined that drinking one to three glasses of champagne each week can boost brain health. “Honey, have you seen my keys?” will be thing of the past. 2.	Good for the heart In fact, it's just as good for your heart as red wine. 3.	Great for skin "Champagne detoxifies the skin with antioxidants, and its lightening tartaric acid helps even out the skin tone," says dermatologist Marina Peredo.
