HAVING spent time in the army, Richard Mbulu knows all about endurance type of military training and tactics. The lessons learnt in the armed forces are now coming handy for the in-form Baroka FC striker, who is enjoying a great start to DStv Premiership season. The Malawian international scored one of the fastest goals in the PSL history, netting on the very first minute as Bakgaga sunk Black Leopards 3-1 on Tuesday. “Sometimes I use my military tactics to help with endurance and power,” Mbulu said. “We have started very well in the league and we can only build on the good start. “It’s a team effort and all of us must maintain the form. There are many games ahead.” The 26-year-old Mbulu is now on three goals from two matches. This is a marked improvement from someone who couldn’t score a single league goal in 25 appearances. But his coach Thoka Matsimela is not surprised. As assistant coach, Matsimela has worked with most of the players, and now that he has been put in the hot seat temporarily, he is relying on his knowledge and understanding of his players. “Last season things didn’t look good for him (Mbulu). But this time he is doing well,” said Matsimela as he raved about Mbulu. “He’s a good striker. He is aggressive, has the speed and power. I’m very happy for him. He could be sitting on four goals now, had he scored the third against Leopards. But he must keep going.” Bakgaga went top of the DStv Premiership, before last night’s matches. But as they say, getting to the top is not the hard, the hardest part is staying there. “We can’t win two games and say we’ve done well. No. Now it’s 28 games to go. We must play each game as it comes and ensure we collect something from those games and maintain consistency,” said Matsimela. “The next game is against Golden Arrows at home on the 4th of November. We are ready to face everybody.”
