The Hawks have arrested one person and seized drugs worth more than R60 000 in a raid in Jouberton in North West. On Friday, the Hawks' Serious Organised Crime Investigation team executed a search warrant at a house in Jouberton and found a 41-year-old suspect in possession of crystal meth and Mandrax tablets, said police spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso. Officers then moved to a second property, where they discovered more drugs. "A second house on the same street was searched where Khat and Mandrax tablets worth approximately R57 000 were found hidden in a sports bag. The drugs were seized and the tenant of the room is being traced," Rikhotso said. The arrested suspect will appear in the Klerksdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday.
