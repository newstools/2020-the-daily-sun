I belong to the school of thought that says education is a key to success. True education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It helps us build opinions and have points of view and, most importantly, helps us make proper decisions about matters affecting human existence. Most of our political leaders lack education. That is why they always make ill-informed decisions that are driven by greed and corruption. The majority of our ward councillors arenâ€™t educated. The only thing they know is call themselves chiefs and members. Next time people elect their leaders, they need to take academic credentials into consideration. - Letter by Freddy Molatlhegi
