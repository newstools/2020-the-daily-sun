MINISTER of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has extended the national state of disaster by another month. The current national state of disaster was set to expire tomorrow but Dlamini-Zuma has gazetted the extension, which means it will run again until 15 November as the country continues to reel from the pandemic which paralysed many sectors. Dlamini-Zuma said she is extending the current state of disaster “taking into account the need to continue augmenting the existing legislation and contingency arrangements undertaken by organs of state to address the impact of the disaster”. The country has been on alert level 1 since September after President Cyril Ramaphosa downgraded it, saying the levels of infection have been low. Since then the country has been recording new cases, hovering at around 2 000 cases daily, but Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has warned that a second wave is possible if people did not behave. By the last count, the country had around 50 000 active cases with a 90% recovery rate. The number of those who died passed the 18 000 mark on Tuesday night.
