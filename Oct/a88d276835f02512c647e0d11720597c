A 47-YEAR-OLD director of a drop-in centre in Malamulele, Limpopo has been arrested today for allegedly defrauding the Covid-19 UIF social relief fund of over R3 million. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said between April and August 2020, the suspect, who is a director of Mtititi drop-in centre allegedly claimed R3.2 million in Covid-19 social relief funds from the UIF on behalf of her 242 former Malamulele-based Extended Public Works Program workers. “It was established during the investigation that the workers’ contracts were terminated before the country’s lockdown was declared by the president. It is further alleged that the claimed money never reached the pockets of the former workers,” Maluleke said. Her arrest by the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit comes hardly three weeks after receiving a complaint of fraud from Mtititi community drop-in centre. The suspect will appear in the Malamulele Magistrates Court on Monday to face fraud charges.
