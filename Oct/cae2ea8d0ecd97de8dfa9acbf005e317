Former Cape Town City striker Kermit Erasmus is excited to be back with the national team after long time because of the Coronavirus. Erasmus, who will join his new team Mamelodi Sundowns after the international break, is eager to impress in Bafana Bafana colours. Bafana will play two international matches as preparation for their Afcon qualifying campaign which is set to get back underway later this year. They face Namibia and Zambia in back-to-back international friendly matches this week. "Its been exciting, seeing that we have a challenge with the virus and stuff," said Erasmus. "The testing has been going good and most of the guys are in camp. Its been good to see everyone again and we're looking forward to the games that are coming." Erasmus is coming off one of his best seasons in the PSL last term and he is hoping to replicate that form for Bafana. "Hopefully I can continue scoring goals for the national team as well and it can rub off from the club to the national team," added Erasmus. "Hopefully I can contribute positively so im excited to be part of the team after a long time because of the virus. But these are things e have to adapt to, hopefully we can display a good performance and get a good result."
