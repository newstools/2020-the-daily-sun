MASKANDI ARTIST PORN SHOCK! “My fanbase has been growing enormously in the UK and I’ve been having interviews that side. I’ve also done interviews with BBC Radio because people love my music that side, so we have a relationship. They approached me and asked me to send them podcasts.” Moonchild said the podcasts were about South African music, especially gqom and amapiano. “I’ve recorded and sent four podcasts so far. “The first one went up last weekend and the others will be uploaded soon,” she said.

We worked on a quick song we were going to perform together, but my lyrics disappeared before we could get on stage. “I had to improvise and spontaneously make up a song on stage. We’ve had a nice relationship since then,” she said.
