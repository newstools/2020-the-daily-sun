FORMER SuperSport United striker Thabo Mnyamane has revealed the reasons he opted to join DStv Premiership newcomers Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) instead of moving overseas. Mnyamane was released by United after his contract ended in June. Mnyamane will be eager to reignite his career and get back to his old form, which, in the past, attracted interest from some of the bigger clubs in South Africa and abroad. The player revealed there were other offers, but he opted to join TTM. “I had few offers, then the lockdown and extension of the league affected certain deals, including offers from India,” said Mnyamane. “TTM were not the only team that approached me. It’s just that myself and people involved in my career felt that this will be a good step for me to get my form back (by joining TTM) because the future is still bright. “Now I have a newborn child. It was going to be a bit tough for me to leave my family and play in India. I opted to stay home because I want to spend a lot of time with my newborn and my wife.” Mnyamane spent four years on the books of SuperSport, playing a role in at least two of their domestic cup wins –the Nedbank Cup and MTN8 trophy. However, during the 2019-20 season, he managed just three appearances in all competitions for Matsatsantsa, falling down the pecking order, with injuries also playing a big role in his lack of game time. The player said it was the right time to move: “I had a fantastic stay at SuperSport – four years with three trophies – it was great. I think it was time (to go). In football, you get to a stage where it is time to move on… I am not bitter about it, I am not angry, I thank them for everything.” Now with a new club, he is looking at finding his feet and be at his best again: “Personally what is important is to understand the dynamics of the team and start playing more games.”
