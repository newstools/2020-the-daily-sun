A DRINKING spree among friends ended in tears. This after one of the friends Leonard Shivambu (45) was killed in Mooiset Trust in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. The motive for the shooting is not yet known. The 64-year-old suspect was arrested and is expected to appear in the Acornhoek Magistrates Court today. One of the friends told Daily Sun they were drinking beer with the suspect, who wanted to prove a point with his firearm. “He fetched it and the dead man tried to stop him. “We don’t know what happened in the house. We only heard shots being fired and ran for cover,” said the friend. “We’re shocked. We were having fun and don’t know the motive behind the shooting. We took the suspect as our friend, but he killed our close friend.” Mpumalanga police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdhluli, said cops were notified about the shooting and found a man’s body with gunshot wounds. “The man was certified dead on the scene and police opened a case of murder. A team of Acornhoek police detectives worked tirelessly, which led to the arrest of the 64-year-old suspect,” he said.
