But the 75-year-old madala from Bakerton in Springs, Ekurhuleni, was not going to let the thugs take his TV. “I wrestled with them and they promised to kill me,” said madala. The thugs fled and made off with the madala’s 50-inch TV. Madala’s wife, June, (73) was sleeping when she heard the arguing. “I realised thugs had broken into our house. I was worried about mkhulu’s safety more than anything else.” She found him standing in the passage and he told her thugs had just stolen their TV. “I was shocked. We never experienced something like this in the 30 years we’ve been here,” she said. June suspected the people who broke into their house had inside information. “The thugs seemed to know which entrance to use,” said the gogo. “We borrowed a TV from one of our kids just to watch the news.” Gogo said her husband lost his eyesight due to old age and diabetes over the past 10 years ago. Captain Johannes Ramphora confirmed a case of house robbery was opened. “The complainant is blind and only heard the suspect’s voice telling him he’d kill him. “The suspects gained entrance by cutting the razor wire, and the back door was forced open with a crowbar,” said Ramphora. “A 50-inch plasma TV to the value of R10 000 was stolen and no shots were fired. No one was injured.”
