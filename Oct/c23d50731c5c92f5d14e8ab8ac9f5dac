AWARD-WINNING gospel artist Thinah Zungu is fuming following rumours his success comes from dark powers, also known as ukuthwala. He took to Facebook on Monday, saying he started seeing negative posts after he posted his double-storey house. Read part of his post: “People understood I was joking and congratulated me. But there are those who believe ngithwele. “Their reasoning is based on the fact that I’ve been getting platforms on places that are not approved by them. “My success isn’t backed by black magic or anything of the sort. I worked hard. I’m a Christian. I neither use enema (ukuchatha) nor do I do incisions (ukugcaba).” BABY CELE & SIYABONGA SHIBE LEAVE UZALO! Speaking to Daily Sun, Thinah said he was booked by Dr Khehlelezi to perform in his church during lockdown. “It’s not a secret that he’s a traditional healer and a pastor. He’s been booking gospel artists since lockdown and I believe he did this out of the goodness of his heart. “This obviously didn’t sit well with some people, and they started these ugly rumours.” Thinah said the rumour was probably started by fellow gospel artists. “The gospel industry isn’t as pure as it looks. People pretend to be Christians, but in reality they’re full of evil in their hearts. “I’ve also been told some radio stations have threatened to stop playing my music, but I’m not sure how true this is.” Dr Khehlelezi said: “I can confirm that Thinah has never asked me for muthi and I’ve never given him any dark powers to get rich.”
