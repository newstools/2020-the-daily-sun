MASKANDI duo Abasokhalweni broke many hearts when they stopped releasing music. One of them apparently had beef with a Takk Studio sound engineer. The duo, made up of concertina player Mgojeli Ncube and guitarist Mdumazi Mhlongo from Mtubatuba in KZN, are preparing to release their three-track EP titled Sebebuyile next week. They had no choice, but to use the Emashingeni record studios. They recorded their first and second albums at Takk. Mgojeli and Mdumazi want to test the waters with their EP before releasing a full album. Mdumazi told SunBuzz Takk barred them after he had a fight with the sound engineer, who was spreading annoying rumours that he was poking his baby mama. “At the time we’d already recorded our third album, which was going to be released in 2016. But we were barred from entering the place. “After that we decided to focus on our solo projects,” he said. Mdumazi has six albums alone while Mgojeli released three. Mdumazi said people had been asking when they’d be releasing an album as a duo again. “And now we’re back with what they’ve asked for,” he said. Mgojeli told SunBuzz: “We’re hoping our fans will be happy with our new work. “We took time to listen to it, and I can assure our fans they’ll enjoy it. “We’ll see their response to the new sound and drop the full album.” They released their debut album Ezemingcwabo in 2014 and the second one, Nidlala Muphi Ushuni, in 2015.
