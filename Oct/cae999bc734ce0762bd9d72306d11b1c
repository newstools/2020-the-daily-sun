“THEY pushed me so hard that I lost my balance.” Magistrate Lieland Poonsamy heard this at the Randburg Magistrates Court as Lieutenant Colonel Johannes Jacobus Venter detailed how he was pushed by EFF leader Julius Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi as they forced their way into the Fourways Memorial Park at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018.   Earlier, Malema and Ndlozi pleaded not guilty to the assault charges brought to them. Venter told the court that before the altercation with the accused, he, with the help of Ms Erasmus (person in charge at the cemetery) told two people who had come to visit their loved ones at the cemetery that it was not accessible at the time due to the burial. But when the EFF leader came, it suddenly went left when he allegedly told Venter that he will not walk in, but drive instead. When Malema’s Mercedes-Benz Vito arrived, Venter said he went to the driver’s side and greeted him. “The driver informed me that the leader of the EFF Malema was inside. I looked inside and he was there, I greeted him.” He added: “I informed him that the vehicle cannot enter and that they were welcome to walk inside, along with other families who came with a bus. “Malema said he was not going to walk, he was going to drive in.” He added that Malema uttered the words, “No white man can stop me.” He said after he told them they could not drive in, he stood in front of the vehicle. “While still standing, after I was pushed by Mr Malema and Ndlozi, I saw them coming to me for the second time. They pushed me hard. “They pushed me so hard that I lost my balance. I was pushed so hard towards the guard house.” He said the reason for refusing entry to Malema’s vehicle was because it had no accreditation.
