MPUMALANGA Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Gabisile Shabalala has sent a strong warning to residents who allegedly host illegal drag racing and spinning of their cars on the public roads. This come after an incident that reportedly happened at the Orpen roads in Timbavati outside Acornhoek on Sunday, where a video showing a group of residents and motorists gathered and participated in the so-called drag race. “As a department, we condemn the residents’ activities for hosting drag racing on the public roads in the strongest possible terms, especially on the open roads in Acornhoek were tourist used the same roads into private game reserves in the area.” “It is not only illegal, it also put other roads users lives in great danger, so individuals who have scant regard for the rules must be ruthlessly dealt with by the law enforcement. “We want communities on the other hand must report drag racing and spinning or any illegal activities on the roads to the police so that steps are taken to ensure law and order at the times,” said Shabalala. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said police strongly condemned the alleged unruly behaviour displayed by the residents. “We called on the community to continue adhering to lockdown regulations as this country is governed by law. We cannot allow a state of lawlessness to prevail or go unpunished. Our public roads aren’t mean for racing and spanning of vehicle,” said Zuma.
