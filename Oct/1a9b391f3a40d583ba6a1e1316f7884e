EVEN social workers are subjected to gender-based violence. Gatvol social workers, with Nehawu’s backing, marched to the Vosloorus Magistrates Court yesterday to support colleagues who’d been harassed by a client. The client was apparently angry he was losing custody of his child. A source close to the situation said the client allegedly abused his wife, who’d since left him. “That’s when the custody battle ensued. “The man is bitter because his own actions messed up his life. Heand wants the case to favour him and claims he has connections,” said the source. The source said the client threatened to kill the social worker handling his case, as well as the supervisor. “A male social worker was then assigned to take over the case,” said the source.  “But that didn’t go down well with the client, who claimed the social worker pointed a gun at him.” Nehawu regional social development co-ordinator, Sipho Busenga, said his profession was at risk. “We’re not safe as social workers and, as you can see, the majority are women. “We need stricter security in our workspaces.” “Clients walk in and out as they please. “Some threaten us when they don’t get their way.”  He said a colleague was arrested on Tuesday after a client claimed he had a gun pointed at him. “Today is his first appearance. We’re here to show support and stand by him. That client is troublesome.” Provincial Cop spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the man appeared in court on a charge of pointing of a firearm. The matter was postponed to a later date.
