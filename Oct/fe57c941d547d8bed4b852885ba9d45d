KAIZER Chiefs got their hunt for silverware this season off to a good start. Amakhosi came from behind to beat Maritzburg United in their MTN 8 clash at the FNB Stadium on Sunday. They found an unlikely hero in defender Yagan Sasman who popped up with a brace to send Chiefs into the semi-finals of the competition. Thabiso Kutumela had given the Team of Choice a good start when he put them ahead in the first half. But Chiefs came back from the break with renewed vigor and looked like a different team altogether. Sasman scored both his goals from set-pieces in a space of two minutes. The Glamour Boys now march on to the semi-finals where they will join defending champions SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates. "I think its a great way to start the season after the setback we had last season," Sasman told SuperSport TV "We didn't start well but we showed character to come back."
