TWO security guards died after a cash-in-transit heist at Southernwood Spar in the Eastern Cape. The East London police have launched a manhunt for armed suspects after three people, including two guards, were shot following a cash-in-transit heist on Monday. Provincial police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said: “It is alleged that at about 8am three male suspects entered the complex while security guards were collecting money from a shop at Southernwood complex. “One guard was standing by the entrance at Spar, while the second guard was collecting money from the safe inside the shop. While the guard who fetched the money from the safe was walking to the exit of the shop, he was confronted by the thugs and shot in the upper body. The second guard was also shot in the upper body,” he said Tonjeni said both guards, aged 49 and 48, died on the scene and a 58-year-old woman was hit by a stray bullet while she was shopping. She was taken to Frere hospital where she is reported to be in a stable condition. “The suspects fled in a grey Ford with undisclosed amount of money as well as two firearms belonging to the guards,” said Tonjeni Hawks detectives are investigating the case of cash-in-transit, attempted murder and double murder.
