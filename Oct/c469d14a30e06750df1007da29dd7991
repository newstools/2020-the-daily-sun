ACTOR and producer, Tumisho Masha, has taken another international role and will be starring in American horror film, Spell. Tumisho, who will be playing Sheriff Tom Pine, a North Carolina state trooper, starred alongside American superstars, Omari Hardwick and Loretta Devine. Spell, which was filmed in Cape Town, is about a man (Omar Hadwick) who crashes his plane while going home to a funeral. He wakes up in an attic of a traditional Hoodoo practitioner. He desperately tries to break free from her dark magic and save his family from a sinister ritual before the rise of the blood moon. Tumisho said this was his first horror movie and the cast and crew made it easy for him. “The team I worked with was amazing. The director, Mark Tonderai is from Zimbabwe, but he grew up in the UK. I related to him a lot, which made our work relationship good. Omari is a loving guy who always wanted to make sure everyone is okay. With Loretta, we were reminiscing about some of my favourite movies with her. It was an amazing time,” he said. “Also, horror movies are barely done in Mzansi. That’s why working on a horror was exciting. Americans have been making horror films, so there was a lot to learn,” continued Tumisho. He said the movie, which will be out on 30 October, was shot last year. Tumisho said he is working on his own movie now.
