ORLANDO Pirates’ new signing, Terrence Dzvukamanja, is hoping to take his already impressive game to another level in the colours of Orlando Pirates in the new season. The 26-year-old Zimbabwean recently joined the Soweto giants from Bidvest Wits, where he built a reputation as a player for the big occasions. He and his former captain at Wits, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Namibian international Deon Hotto, have switched the Wits colours for the famous black and white. Dzvukamanja netted eight goals across all competitions for the Clever Boys, including one in the Caf Confederation Cup this past season. He is targeting more goals for Bucs. “This is what drives all players to better themselves day by day,” Dzvukamanja told the club’s website. “For me it’s two-fold. It’s about scoring goals, hopefully, double digits, and also about increasing my number of assists for the season. “I think as an attacking player, these are two areas that a player is judged.” Dzvukamanja has no intentions of resting on his laurels at Pirates and is hoping to continue enhancing his growing reputation. Just like many players, the former Ngezi Platinum player is hoping that excelling at the Soweto giants will help him secure a move to a European club. “I don’t want to see myself as somebody who came to Orlando Pirates just to add numbers. I have come here to work, and this is what I hope shows in my performances,” added Dzvukamanja. “I want to make a difference here and if all goes well, hopefully, I can achieve another goal of mine, which is to one day play in Europe.” Dzvukamanja is well aware of the competition he will face at Pirates, but he believes his versatility will stand him in good stead. “I like the number 10 position but as an attacker, you can’t say this is my favourite position and that’s it,” added Dzvukamanja. “I must be able to play anywhere and everywhere the coaches want me to play but if I had to choose, then it would be that old school number 10 position behind the striker.”
