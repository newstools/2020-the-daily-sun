TS GALAXY coach Dan Malesela says that Xola Mlambo will need to be mentally strong to fit into his charges style of play. Malesela made this statement via the South African Football Journalist Association (SAFJA) Zoom conference. This was after Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi had shown interest in signing Mlambo who was released by Orlando Pirates to pave the way for new recruits like Thabang Monare. The 29-year-old Mlambo has also attracted interest from Supersport United and Cape Town City. Said Malesela: “The fact that Xola moved from two different clubs tells that people don’t understand him. I understand him better, but it’s not about our history. I am selective of whom I take. I need mental strength than what you can give us tactically. I want someone who can build a house.” Meanwhile, Malesela revealed that they brought veteran midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane on board to motivate youngsters. The 38-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs star was retained by Sukazi after he bought the PSL status of Highlands Park. Explained Malesela: “We signed Letsholonyane for his leadership and for being a role model. He lives an outstanding life, just a good example when a youngster is not running, I say ‘look at him (Letsholonyane) and where he is now'. It’s not that God did him a favour, he brings leadership to the club.”
