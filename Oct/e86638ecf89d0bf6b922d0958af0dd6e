KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and Rangers midfielder Bongani Zungu are back in the Bafana Bafana picture. This after the duo were named in coach Molefi Ntseki's 25-man squad to face Sao Tome e Principe in their Cameroon 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The matches will take place on the 13 and 16th of November. There are some changes to the squad that was picked to face Namibia and Zambia in the last International break. The notable inclusions are that of Zungu, who had voiced his frustration at missing out in the previous squads. Khune also returns after he started the season in Chiefs' goal in the absence of Nigerian Daniel Akpeyi. Maritzburg United defender Rushine De Reuck also got his long awaited call up to the national team after he was crowned the defender of the season in the PSL. Ntseki also called up a few of his trusted overseas-based players such as Percy Tau, Darren Keet Keagan Dolly and Dean Furman, who returns for the first time since moving to England.
