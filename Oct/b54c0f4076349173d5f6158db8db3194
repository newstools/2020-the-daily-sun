The Premier Soccer League (PSL), together with MTN launched the 2020 MTN8 Wafa Wafa tournament on Monday. This year’s MTN8 campaign promises to enhance fans experience by encouraging them to remake 2020 with the spirit of Wafa Wafa by participating in the tournament engagement activities to stand a chance to win a share of the R8 Million worth of prizes. The kick-off of the tournament is set to take place on  Saturday when the defending champions, SuperSport United will go head on with the latest addition to the DStv Premiership, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), to secure a spot in the running for the grand prize and to defend their title. The MTN8 is highly contested by teams that were in the top eight during the 2019/20 season, all competing for the grand prize and the MTN8 title in this knockout competition that has become well known as Wafa Wafa, the winner takes all! From the teams that will be competing in this year’s tournament, Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United have won the title more than once; Cape Town City won it once; while Mamelodi Sundowns, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), Bloemfontein Celtics and Maritzburg United have never lifted the prized cup. It is without a doubt that all these teams will bring their “A” game and demonstrate that fighting spirit in the tournament, in the true Wafa Wafa style.
