I’m concerned that young people drink alcohol instead of focusing on their education. Communities must get involved by ensuring youngsters go to school and don’t visit taverns and shebeens. Their future is important. Regulations governing South African schools clearly state that no learner, teacher, parent or any other person should possess or use alcohol during any school activity. Liquor traders, the Department of Basic Education, communities and parents must work together. The youth have to be told in no uncertain terms: drinking alcohol will ruin or cut short their lives! Try to show interest in and be involved in your child’s life. Have a sense of what they’re thinking, care about, where they are and what they’re doing – and discuss with them the drug and alcohol issue. They must stay away from booze, period! Liquor traders must comply and not sell alcohol to underage customers. - Letter by Norman Maake, from Tembisa
