INVESTIGATING officer Sergeant Joseph Mnisi in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court yesterday said 19-year-old Mpumalanga teenager Kgaugelo Sibiya showed the behaviour of a serial killer. Sibiya was bust last Monday after the gruesome discovery of his 14-year-old cousin’s body, who was kidnapped two weeks ago. Zinhle Sekgoapa’s body was found dumped in a pit toilet by her mum, some days after she received SMSes and phone calls from an unknown person who was demanding a ransom of R86 000 for Zinhle’s release. Her head was wrapped in a plastic bag. Mnisi told the court the suspect indicated in a statement that he drugged the dead girl with crystal meth, so that his friends could take her to Tekwane South. Mnisi said the suspect could not show the investigating team the house. He said that when they started interviewing Sibiya, he showed no remorse. He was one of the people assisting them to look for her.  Mnisi said Sibiya simply moved from the house where he was staying with the victim and went to his mother’s house. “He had nothing at all to prove to us that he didn’t commit the murder himself,” said the cop. “Why would his friends take the child to Tekwane South, seeing that she is dead, then bring her back to dump her in the pit toilet at the house where she was staying?”  Sibiya’s legal representative, Advocate Sipho Mashele, said the evidence didn’t substantiate reasons why bail was opposed. He said the confession obtained was not constitutional. “He was assaulted and made false promises,” he said. Magistrate Thabo Maphophe postponed the matter to 5 October for continuation of a bail application.
