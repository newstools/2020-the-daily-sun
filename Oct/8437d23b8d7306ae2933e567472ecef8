THE family of this missing teenager needs help to find her. Queen Mokone (16) from Snake Park, Soweto, disappeared from her home last weekend. She left home last Sunday and her family became worried when she didn’t return. They now fear that she might have been kidnapped. Queen’s mum, Mammsy, (60) told Daily Sun: “We heard she could have gone with her boyfriend and we went to him, but he said he last saw her on Friday. “This does not sit well with me. It has been a few days since she went missing and it is painful. “We see in the news that women are being killed.” We don’t know whether she’s alive or not.” Mammsy pleaded with anyone who might know about her daughter’s whereabouts to help the family find her. Queen also left behind her one-year-old baby boy, who according to the family, has started to notice his mother’s absence.  Queen’s sister, Mapula (39), said they were worried sick about her and didn’t know what led to her being gone for so long. “We don’t know if she’s alive or not. She even left a child here. She’s supposed to go to school,” said Mapula. A missing persons case was opened at the Doornkop Police Station.
