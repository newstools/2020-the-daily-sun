ORLANDO Pirates advanced to the semi-finals of the MTN8 with a 1-0 win over a 10-man Cape Town City side thanks to a goal by debutant Terrence Dzuvukamanja at the Orlando Stadium, on Saturday. Two debutants combined to give the Buccaneers a valuable lead in the 23rd minute as Wayde Jooste hit an in-swinging cross that Dzuvukamanja glanced past a stranded Peter Leeuwenburgh. City were then reduced to 10 men after striker Fagrie Lakay was shown a straight red card by referee Jelly Chavani for a nasty studs up challenge of Jooste in the 32nd minute. The two sides went into the break with Pirates holding a one goal advantage. City made a change at the break by bringing on a recognised striker in Tashreeq Morris to occupy the attacking void left by Lakay's early exit. Pirates looked to have double their lead through another debutant in Thulani Hlatshwayo in the 49th minute but his goal was disallowed for a foul on a City defender. Leeuwenburgh kept the visitors in the game with some important saves and denied Zakhele Lepasa in the 84th minute in a one-on-one situation. Dzuvukamanja's strike proved to be the decisive goal as the Buccaneers held on to their narrow lead to advance to the semi-finals. -Sport24
