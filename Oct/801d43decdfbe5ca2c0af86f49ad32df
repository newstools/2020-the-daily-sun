SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo urged his players to be cautious and not allow the unpleasant drama unfolding at Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila distract them ahead of their season opener. The two teams will meet in the MTN8 quarter-final on Saturday (3pm) at Thohoyandou Stadium. Tshakhuma will be making their debut in the Wafa Wafa competition having been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons lately. On Monday, Norman Mapeza, who was set to be unveiled as coach, left in a huff. Hot on the heels of his departure is Oupa Manyisa, the high-profile signing who joined on a two-and-half year deal from Mamelodi Sundowns, who is uncertain about his future with the club. SuperSport are defending champions of the MTN8 after winning it last season by defeating Highlands Park in the final. “We need to try and focus on our ourselves and make sure that we prepare very well for this game,” Tembo said on Tuesday. “We have tried by all means not to be sidetracked by what is going on in their camp because that has got nothing to do with us.“ He continued: “We must focus on ourselves and go there with the right mentality and frame of mind because this game is very key for us. “Their situation makes it even more dangerous for us because a lot of players who have gone there will want to prove themselves.” Tshakhuma will be a different side from the team that participated in the promotion relegation play-offs last month. From that squad they only have five players, two from Bidvest Wits and the rest are new at the club. Tembo admitted that they really do not have an idea of who they will bde facing. He said: “We are playing against a new team and we don’t have an idea of what kind of a team we are going to face. It is quite a difficult but at the same time our preparation will be very key.
