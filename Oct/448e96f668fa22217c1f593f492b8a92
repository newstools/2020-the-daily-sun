 TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila coach Joel Masutha has apologised on behalf of his club after they were only able to put three substitutes on the bench for their opening game of the season. TTM, who bought the status of Bidvest Wits, were knocked out of the MTN 8 after a 3-2 defeat at the hands of defending champions SuperSport United. The Limpopo side signed a number of players as they look to build a competitive side for their debut season in the top flight, however, they could not register some of them in time. They only had goalkeeper Washington Arubi, midfielder Edward Manaka and attacking midfielder Thabo Mnyamane as substitutes for the game against Matsatsantsa. “I would like to apologise to the football fraternity and everyone who loves the game,” said Masutha after the match. “We never try to shift the blame of point fingers at other people but I just feel that had we sorted our admin on time then maybe we would have won the match. “But apologies to the football fraternity for that but for us its water under the bridge and a big lesson for everyone involved in the running of the club.”
