FORMER two-time world champion Xolisani Ndongeni is considering hanging up his gloves! This comes after his surprise sixth round knockout defeat at the hands of unheralded boxer Prince Dlomo at the Klipspruit Multi-purpose Centre in Soweto on Saturday night. “I’m OK now. I went to heaven and came back,” said Ngongeni. “I saw myself down...trying to stand up. I don’t know how it happened. This is my first loss in South Africa. It was the first time being knocked out like that and first time losing against a local opponent. Losing to Prince will really take me time to digest, I did not expect it to happen. I’m considering quitting boxing. I’m going home to think about it, but I don’t see myself coming back.” Their 10-round non-title contest was the main supporting bout to the African Boxing Union welterweight clash between Katembo Kuvesa and Thulani Mbenge. Mbenge beat Kuvesa on points to be crowned ABU welterweight champion.
