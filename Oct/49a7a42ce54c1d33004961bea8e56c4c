MEDIA personality and producer DJ Speedsta says the lockdown helped him gain confidence. The Live AMP presenter, who is about to release a single titled The Chosen One featuring Yanga Chief and Teejay Mokoena tomorrow, said the song is about how he got his mojo back. Speedsta, whose real name is Lesego Nkaiseng, said he realised that he is the chosen one. “The song is dedicated to me, because I am the chosen one. During the lockdown, I did some self retrospection because I had self-doubt and I wasn’t feeling confident. But that changed, I started reading positive books and watching documentaries. I made sure to read stuff that would lift me up. That helped me and that’s how I came up with this single,” he said. Speedsta said he is happy that he’ll be introducing new talent through his song. “Teejay has been asking to work with me for a while now and I thought I should give him a chance since we’re both from the Vaal. I’m excited about opening up the game and introducing new guys,” said Speedsta. The DJ and rapper Cassper Nyovest had an argument on Twitter this week, but Speedsta said they are on good terms now. Speedsta said Costa Titch had the best album of 2020 on Twitter and the confusion began when Cassper also sent out a tweet. Cassper tweeted: “Hahaha. This is pure comedy!!!!!! There’s opinions, there’s a preference and then, there is go bua marete nje. Pick a struggle!!!!” Speedsta apologised to him on Twitter and he told Daily Sun that they also spoke on the phone. He said: “Cassper and I have spoken and we are cool now. His tweet was addressed to Nota, not me. We’re friends in real life so I didn’t want to sort that out on Twitter. That’s why I called him. We also play soccer together on Mondays, so I saw him and we’re cool.” He recently opened his own indoor skate park, Skate Hub, two weeks back. “The Skate Hub is officially opened, it’s in Wynberg and people can bring their kids so they learn how to skate,” said Speedsta.
