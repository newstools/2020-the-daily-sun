HE was a bright thwasa, but according to the gobela he’s also a thief! Gobela Sarah Mahasha (67) of Stinkwater, near Hammanskraal in Tshwane, said the thwasa stole her sangoma notes, muthi and owes her R11 000. She said he was with her for two weeks, but went home because of lockdown. He never came back, but then Sarah saw him on Facebook advertising that he’s a qualified sangoma. “When he was here he always took pictures of the notes on how we heal and mix herbs. “We thought he was making things easy for himself, but he knew he was up to no good.”  The gobela said because he hasn’t graduated, he could harm people. “He took my beads with him. Taking the beads and wearing them means he owes me. “The muthi inside the beads is there for a reason. He must finish his payment.” Sarah said she’s initiated many people in her 30 years of being a gobela, and this has never happened before. Thwasa Thabo Mhlongo told Daily Sun he doesn’t owe the gobela anything.  “I left the notebook there. Yes, I have the beads with me,” he said. “But I stayed there for two weeks and paid R4 000. Many people leave before time and that’s normal.” Thabo said he won’t pay the money. Dr Fanyana Hlongwane of Tshwane Ra Tshwana Traditional Association told Daily Sun the gobela came to them to complain because they gave the thwasa a certificate. “The thwasa was qualified because he was knowledgeable,” said Fanyane.
