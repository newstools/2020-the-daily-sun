NETFLIX’S teenage series, Blood and Water, is already cooking up its second season. Actor Thabang Molaba, who plays KB on the series, shared pictures and videos of the cast and crew on his Instagram yesterday and captioned them: “Season 2 is gon be lit.” He also shared a short video of himself reading the script, showing that they are already working on season two. Natasha Thahane, who plays Wendy, also shared a picture of herself with Thabang and Arno Greeff. The series that was a success not just in Mzansi, but internationally too, was renewed for a second season in June. The director, Nosipho Dumisa, called the cast members and broke the news to them in a video that was posted on social media. Blood and Water is about a teenager, Puleng Khumalo, played by Ama Qamata, who is on a mission to find her long-lost sister, whom she thinks is Fikile (Khosi Ngema). In the last episode, Puleng told Fikile that she thinks they are sisters and that’s where it ended. Blood and Water topped the Netflix charts and ranked number one in the first week of its release in South Africa, Kenya, Jamaica, France, Libya and in the USA. It also reached the Top 10 in the UK.
