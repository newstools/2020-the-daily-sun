HER killers have been ducking the cops but her family is sure they can make them surrender. On Tuesday, they went to the place where the body of Nthabiseng Lebitso (29) was found to perform rituals and later burnt her bra while calling her name. Her mum Maditaba Lebitso said this was to make sure Nthabiseng’s powers were unleashed to bring her killers to book. “By doing this we’re cursing the killers to come and confess,” she said. Nthabiseng from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg, was kidnapped and killed by thugs last week. Her body and that of her friend’s were found lying next to the Spooktown cemetery, not far from each other. Nthabiseng was killed by thugs over her pair of new takkies. Maditaba said her family decided not to bury her at Spooktown cemetery. “That cemetery is cursed. I can’t bury my daughter there,” said the mother. “Her soul won’t rest in peace if we were going to bury her there.” She said her daughter’s body was taken to the Free State for burial. She described Nthabiseng as a happy person who was loved by everyone. “When Nthabiseng was around, she used to light up the room,” she said. Her friend, Busisiwe Nkabinde, urged residents to work with the police to bring Nthabiseng’s killers to book. “We pray for the perpetrators to be found. Those thugs have deprived us of a great friend and we’ll always miss her.” Councillor Thabane Mngomezulu urged residents to work with the police to find the killers.
