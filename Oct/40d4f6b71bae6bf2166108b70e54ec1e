THE suspect accused of a series of attempted murder and armed robbery cases will remain in custody after his formal bail was postponed. Shane Ngutjane (26) from Marite Trust outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga appeared in the Nelspruit Regional Court earlier today. The court heard the suspect was allegedly involved in a shooting with cops during his arrest after he’d hijacked a tourist’s vehicle in the Calcutta area and was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in July. He was also wanted for a series of cases in Bushbuckridge after evading arrest in Kabokweni, where he stole a vehicle in April 2014 and continued his criminal activities when he attempted to hijack a vehicle. In December last year, he also robbed victims of their belongings. Hawks Spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said the cases were transferred to Mpumalanga Serious Organised Crime Investigation, when the team bust the accused together with his accomplice Norman Mokoena (23), who was re-arrested for a series of armed robberies and escaping lawful custody at Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court last year. “Both have been linked to 12 other cases, which will be presented before court on the next court date.” Mpumalanga NPA Spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the case against Ngutjane was postponed to 13 October for formal bail application.
