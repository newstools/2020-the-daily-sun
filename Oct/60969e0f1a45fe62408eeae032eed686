BISHOP Lucky Baloyi is an angry man. “What police did to my mother-in-law is evil,” said the angry bishop after she was bust for holding a small quantity of zol. What’s even worse is that the dagga is for his wife, not his mother-in-law. “My wife smokes zol. It helps her and it heals her terrible headaches and people should respect that,” said the bishop of Christ the Redeemer Church in Mabopane, Tshwane. His wife, Rose Masemene (48), said her 83-year-old mum who was bust by cops on Monday morning in Mabopane, is innocent. Rose claimed that R1 000 and gold earrings went missing after cops searched the house. “I need my zol back from the police to heal my pain. I also want my R1 000 and gold ear rings which I bought in 2014. Rose said her mum was alone when the cops pounced on her. WOMEN WHO HAVE TWO PUNANIS! “Yes, I’m a Christian and I smoke zol,” said Rose. “The zol is for my calling and it stops my painful headache.” Rose told Daily Sun she bought the zol about two weeks ago for R750 in the Pretoria CBD. “Once or twice a week I buy it just enough to smoke. I am not a dealer,” she said. She said her late dad, a traditional healer who died in 1999, also told her to smoke zol and said she had a calling to be a healer. Rose said she started smoking zol in 2013. “Prophets have told me to smoke zol. I don’t become high, but I feel good when I smoke. “My mum was released late on Monday afternoon and is still traumatised. It’s evil what police did to her,” she said. She added even at the church they didn’t have a problem with her smoking zol. She also claimed that the police broke her ashtray which her dad bought her before he died. “I know my father is angry where he is sleeping,” she said. Rose’s mum refused to comment, saying she was too traumatised and the daughter said she didn’t want to see her mother in the papers. According to police, a case of possession of dagga was opened at Loate Police Station.
