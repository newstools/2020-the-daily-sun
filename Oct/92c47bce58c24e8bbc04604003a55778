It is heart breaking to watch as our country is torn apart by mindless violence. The massacre of 10 people near Mariannhill and other areas in KZN graphically illustrates that our rainbow nation has become a killing zone as respect and fear for the law is non-existent. While we remain a democracy envied the world over, we seem intent on striking out at the democratic values that have enabled us to survive against the odds. The brutal violence has been overwhelming. But the spirit of ubuntu has never been more alive than now. No democracy can allow such violence. No civilised society can tolerate such disregard for human lives, and no state can accept such mindless discord. The hymn Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika, composed for the founding conference of the ANC in 1912, became the hymn of freedom for many nations in Southern Africa. We have betrayed the spirit of that hymn by displaying all forms of prejudice that is an insult and an affront to humanity. It is shocking that heart-breaking tragedies no longer have the power to devastate us. As a society, we have acquired an immunity to painful tragedies. Letter by  Farouk Araie, Benoni
