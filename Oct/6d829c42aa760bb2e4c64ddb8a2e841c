THABANG Litsaone is desperately trying to get in touch with Lady Zamar after she allegedly failed to pay him. He has accused the singer of ghosting him after she failed to pay him R52 542 as per a court judgment. Thabang from Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane, said he was Lady Zamar’s driver from November 2018 to April last year. He said things were fine until the singer, whose real name is Yamikani Banda, was supposed to pay him. “Trouble started when she asked to use my car together with her manager. She told me they’d pay me for renting it. When they brought it back, the windscreen had cracks and the back seat was damaged,” he said. Thabang said a white VW Transporter T6.1 2017 was also damaged. But he continued driving her around because he thought she’d pay him for the damages. “When I called her to ask for my money, she told me she needed to pay other people and would pay me once she was done,” he said. “This went on for months until my wife decided to contact her, but Lady Zamar ended up blocking her and said she won’t pay me.” Thabang said he approached the sheriff of the court and Lady Zamar was ordered to pay him R31 400 with 10% interest. “She has moved house and no longer takes my calls. I want my money. I need to pay people who helped me fix my car.” Lady Zamar’s manager, Micheal Lebuse, said they’d not comment on the matter because it was still in court.
