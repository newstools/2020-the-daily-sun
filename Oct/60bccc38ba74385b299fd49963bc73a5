HE is not there just to add the numbers... that is the common believe of Mamelodi Sundowns fans who have made peace with fact that Pitso Mosimane has dumped them for Egyptian giants Al Ahly. Mosimane has been trending for the entire weekend since he landed at the land of the Pharaohs on Friday, with his pictures of arrival, meeting club bosses, signing of documents and training pictures splashed all over social media. But Mosimane has confessed that he is bracing himself for a torrid period driving Africa’s most successful club, who have won the crown of Africa’s Club of the Century. In his first squad since he took over yesterday, Mosimane showed that he meant business and was looking ahead to proving himself that his successful stint with Downs was no fluke, but pure football intelligence. But he is aware sceptics in South Africa waiting for his failure, judging from his reply to President Cyril Ramaphosa who congratulated him for his record move. “Thank you very much President. But somebody says I am DISLOYAL to have gone over there! It is so unfortunate, but God has taught me to forgive, as I keep marching on,” said Mosimane in what could be classified as a powerful statement that leaves a lot of questions unanswered.
