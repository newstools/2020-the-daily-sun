SHOPPING for jeans isn’t always as easy as we think it will be, especially if you love going for different looks and fashion. We have seen mom jeans make a major comeback and being styled so well by influencers, but many people always wonder if they would look good in them. If you do get a chance to go to a physical shop to buy jeans, it helps to try them on before you buy them because you might buy something that is not meant for your body type. 1. Skinny crop jeans – These jeans are similar to skinny jeans, just cropped. They look great paired with any type of shoe. You can dress them up or down. ...the glow is different this side?♥?

Distressed jeans – The older generation still doesn’t get why the younger generation will buy worn out jeans but these jeans can take you from hobo to stylish in a minute. Pair these jeans with a flowy blouse and heels. Or, add a blazer and some booties to your ripped jeans look. A faux leather jacket and sneakers is also a fun way to style your ripped jeans.
