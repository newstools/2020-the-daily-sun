SWALLOWS FC striker Ruzaigh Gamildien is targeting double figures to help his new side cement their place in the PSL. The former Chippa United goal poacher said that being surrounded by quality players such as Musa Nyatama, Thabo Matlaba, Wandisile Letlabika and Thabo Mosadi, who also joined the club recently, will make his goal realistic. The 31-year-old scored two goals for Chippa in 13 games last season, having caught their interest after he found the back of net 11 times for GladAfrica Championship side Steenberg United. Said Gamildien: “I am excited to finally play for a team in Joburg. Swallows have a rich history and strong background, with a huge fanbase. My aim is to help them retain their PSL status because I know it’s difficult for a new team. I want to contribute to the team and everything will fall into place.” He added: “I have my own personal target and the team’s target. “I know 10 goals will guarantee big things. But this is now regarded as a barometer in South Africa.” However, Gamildien is aware that having a strong team won’t guarantee them success. “If you are surrounded by best players you are bound to do well. “The signings we have (eight) show that we can put together a competitive team capable of reaching the top eight. But on the same breath we don’t need to get ahead of ourselves as we still need to gel and find a correct formula” Gamildien hopes flying high with The Birds will increase his chances of getting a Bafana Bafana call-up. “Everybody has ambitions to play for the national team and I should focus on finding a way to get there by scoring goals and winning matches with my team.” At 31, Gamildien believes he still has a lot to offer in the top flight. “To be honest, I have been doing well for the past two seasons. I still have what it takes to contribute positively in the PSL. I want to win trophies and hopefully I will achieve that with Swallows.”
