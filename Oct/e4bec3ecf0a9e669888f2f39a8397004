COPS are looking for two women who allegedly raped a man! “The two women forced me into the bushes,” the man told Daily Sun. He said one of them undressed herself. “One woman gave me a blow job and forced me to penetrate her at gunpont.” After raping him one of the women told the 37-year-old man she was HIV- positive. The traumatised man from a squatter camp in Boksburg North ran to a clinic and was given emergency pills. He said the incident happened at about 11am on Friday in an open field on Main Street next to Comet in Boksburg North, Ekurhuleni, on his way from a friend’s place. WOMEN WITH TWO PUNANIS! He said as he was being raped by the one woman, the other one stood guard to make sure he was doing a proper job. His wife told Daily Sun she hoped the women could be found. “I’m giving my husband all the support I can,” she said. The victim said one woman wore a short black skirt and maroon top, while the other one wore black trousers with a white top. Constable Justice Ramaube said: “The victim said he was walking down Main Street when he was allegedly approached by two ladies who pulled him to a nearby open field at gunpoint.” Ramaube said one of the women undressed herself before forcing the man to penetrate her while her accomplice stood guard and watched. “After raping him the woman said she was HIV-positive, and he fled the scene on foot. The victim doesn’t know the suspects.” Ramaube said a rape case was opened at Boksburg North Police Station. “Police are looking for the two females for questioning,” he said.
