PASTOR Themba Nhlapo believes the devil is attacking him. This is because thugs have stolen from his church, Calvary Christ Mission Church in Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, since 2016. He’s now appealing to Police Minister Bheki Cele to visit his church as he can’t stand the crime anymore. He said last Tuesday morning, thugs stole from the church for the sixth time. He said they even tied up his younger brother, who lives on the church premises, and left with his cellphone. “The thugs broke into a woman’s room in the church and stole a cellphone and R900. I believe all this thuggery is done by local people who are jealous of the congregation.” The pastor said last month, thugs stole groceries, sanitisers and blankets. In 2016, they stole church instruments worth R30 000 and two generators worth R28 000. “In 2017, the thugs stole a sound system worth R26 000 and sound cables and 60 chairs in 2018,” he said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “A case of house robbery was opened.”
