GOGO Lenah Mnguni’s helper was arrested last Thursday for allegedly abusing her! The gogo had apparently been mistreated since March. Limpopo police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, said the helper would soon appear in court on a case of assault.

The 94-year-old from Makometsana Village in Mpumalanga told the SunTeam every day was hell. “She’d call me a dog, swear at me and beat me. I did nothing wrong. She’d just beat me for no reason,” she said. The gogo said her helper treated her like an animal, but a neighbour eventually realised what was going on and phoned her relatives. Lenah’s niece, Elizabeth Khati-Saphula (55), said that she received a call from the neighbour last Monday. “We were confused because we always communicated with her helper, and I was the one who hired her,” she said. Elizabeth said when they picked up the gogo they found cuts, wounds and bruises on her body and her arm was broken. “She was in pain and started telling us she was being abused by the helper,” she said. “We then went to open a case with the police.” A neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, often saw the gogo being beaten.
