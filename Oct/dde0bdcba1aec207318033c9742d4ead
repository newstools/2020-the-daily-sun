A MAN who was accused of selling fake tertiary certificates was sentenced to six years in jail. Edmond Okechuku (45) was charged with fraud, forgery and linked to manufacturing false tertiary qualification certificates when he appeared before Piet Retief Magistrates Court today. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, Okechuku, a self-employed salon and internet cafe operator based in Piet Retief, was approached by a police agent who needed an N6 Human Resources certificate for which he charged R1 500, after an intelligence-driven operation was put in place to intercept his criminal activities. “He was arrested by the investigating team on 16 October 2019 and released on R2 000 bail. During the trial he pleaded guilty on all charges. “The court sentenced him to six years’ direct imprisonment. Furthermore, he was denied leave to appeal the sentence and declared unfit to possess a firearm,” said Sekgotodi. Provincial Hawks head in Mpumalanga Major General Zodwa Mokoena said she applauds the team for the outstanding investigation and for ensuring a formidable fight in the protection of the education system.
