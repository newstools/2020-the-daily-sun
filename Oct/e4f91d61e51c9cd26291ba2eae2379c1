 A ROBBERY at a hair salon left one customer injured. And cops, working with Joburg Metro police, arrested four suspects aged between 25 and 39. This happened at an abandoned building in the Joburg CBD on Wednesday. Police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said two suspects stormed a hair salon at the corner of Kerk and Goud streets in Joburg and pointed firearms at the staff and customers. He said they were immediately joined by five accomplices. Mbele said: “They ordered all eight of them to lie down before taking their cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash. “One shot was fired before they fled the scene, injuring a 30-year-old customer on the lower body. She was rushed to hospital. The community alerted the police. “Four suspects were found inside a room. Police recovered two unlicensed firearms with no serial numbers and live ammunition. “The victims’ cellphones were recovered. “The confiscated firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in other serious and violent crimes. “Three suspects are still at large and police are investigating,” Mbele said. Joburg Central cop shop commander Brigadier Irvin Perumal praised the cops for their swift response. He also thanked the community for being the police’s eyes and ears in the fight against crime. The suspects face business robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition charges.
