AN UNKNOWN man was seen walking up and down the road in an area yesterday. But nobody knew who he was, and none of the residents from Waterloo in Durban asked him what was wrong. Later on in the day, a passerby found the man hanging by a rope from a tree. A large crowd of residents went out to see the lifeless body. The residents expressed shock when they saw the man dead. Resident Nhlanhla Mdlalose (33) said the man was seen walking around the area earlier in the day. He said none of the residents recognised him. “And then after several hours he was found hanging. We don’t know where he came from. Maybe he was walking around looking for a tree where he could hang himself,” he said. Another resident who asked not to be named said it’s clear that he had something bothering him and he wanted to end his life in an area where nobody knows him. “I wish he could have spoken to someone before hanging himself. Someone might have helped him with whatever was bothering him. This is very sad indeed,” said the resident. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a body of a man was found hanging from a tree in the bushes near Jabu Ngcobo Road in Waterloo. “Verulam police are investigating an inquest and circumstances around the incident,” said Mbele.
