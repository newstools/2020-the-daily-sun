PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoaneng is gatvol. He is not happy with a statement made by the Nehawu Western Cape secretary, Eric Kweleta on eNCA during an interview. Eric was addressing financial matters relating to Nsfas on eNCA when he included Mboro’s name. During the interview, he compared the institutions running and maladministration to Prophet Mboro’s Church. Mboro told Daily Sun that Eric’s comparison is alarming to say the least. He said he finds it very unfortunate and demands an apology both from Eric and eNCA. “It’s shocking that eNCA found it fit to air such without calling me or at least editing the comparison out of the interview, which had nothing to do with me.” Mboro, who is the president of the Church Mandate Turn Around Movement, said he was shocked. He said he will take steps against both parties if no apology is issued after he had engaged with them. He and the members of the church Mandate will go to the Nehawu offices as well as eNCA to hand in a letter of demand to retract and apologise. Video of Eric speaking is available.
