Many South Africans, myself included, didn’t know about the role of the public protector prior to Thuli Madonsela’s shocking corruption and state capture revelations. Her tenure in office brought to light many shady dealings that had crippled the country. I’d like to thank her for the important role she played. When the Zondo Commission ends, we hope to find the truth about state capture. Big-name politicians and captains of business are implicated in dodgy businesses, in which government was milked dry. As taxpayers, we have every right to know where our money goes. I’m delighted that law enforcement agencies are now coming to the party. Courts as well must do something. We want our money back. We’d like to see culprits being punished and facing the full might of the law. It’s long overdue. No one is above the law in Mzansi, or anywhere else in the world for that matter.
