MEN in Soweto are over the moon! This because the kasi’s one and only strip club is back. The club is owned by Papa Dee, whose real name is Thabo Nkosi. He told Daily Sun strip shows happen every Saturday between 9pm and 12pm. “We used to have the strip shows before lockdown, but had to stop,” he said. Papa Dee said men begged that the strip show be brought back. He said no one was allowed to take pictures and videos during shows, so he couldn’t provide Daily Sun with pictures. “We all switch off our cellphones and put them away. Our guards ensure no one has a phone,” he said.  Papa Dee said the reason was that most of the performers were kasi girls and were known. “Girls are only trying to make extra cash. So we don’t want to expose them. “Some of their parents are pastors and parents won’t like what they’re doing.” This is no brothel! “We’re strict when it comes to our girls. We don’t want men to poke them.” He said going to strip shows is good for men, especially those with partners. “When people have been married for a long time, they tend to bore each other and some, especially men, end up cheating. “But we don’t promote prostitution and cheating.”  Men said they liked what was happening at Papa Dee’s. “I’m one of those who complained why the show wasn’t back. It’s entertaining,” said Joseph Mampinga (47) from Mofolo. Mthoko Sibisi (40) from Jabulani said: “I like that they don’t allow men to sleep with the girls. I don’t miss the sessions.” Vuyi Mtshali (30) from Mofolo said at first she hated the strip club.  But she eventually allowed her man go after she heard they didn’t make the girls sleep with the men. “He gives me game I never forget when he’s been visiting the place,” she said.
