Lulama Mvabantu from Kanana squatter camp in Gugulethu, Cape Town loves her cats. She told Daily Sun the cats are her babies. “Most people don’t like cats, some believe they are used for witchcraft but I do not believe that,” said the 54-year-old. She shares what she eats with the cats. “I do not treat them like animals but human beings. That’s why I make sure I cook enough food for me and my cats,” she said. The cats are not only her family but they help chase rats away from her shack. “Everyone staying in a shack knows we have a problem of rats, and for me, my shack is near a canal where people dump rubbish,” said Lulama. “When I first had them, the idea was not to use them to chase rats away. I wanted honest friends.” One of her two cats gave birth to three kitties last week. She said she’s happy her family is growing. Lulama said her neighbours don’t like cats and luckily for them, her cats don’t like to go to other people’s houses. One of her neighbours, who didn’t want to be named, said: “I am glad she keeps her cats in her shack, otherwise we were going to have a lot of problems We have different beliefs when it comes to cats,” said the neighbour.
