SHE is angry, heartbroken and unwilling to forgive! Her daughter (13) was raped repeatedly overnight. The 29-year-old from Mamelodi in Tshwane wants justice and nothing less. She said: “The family of that man must stop coming to me to ask for forgiveness. They make my blood pressure rise. “I don’t want to see that family in my house again. “Those people must know that even if they paid me R2 million, it won’t bring back my little girl’s virginity.” The woman told Daily Sun the man raped her daughter in a tool room not far from where they live. This apparently happened on the night of 20 September. The mum was home during the incident. The innocent little girl had gone to the shops when she bumbed into the suspect, who allegedly bought her mayo and sphatlho. On her way back home, he dragged the girl to the tool room and raped her. When the child didn’t come home from the shops, the family apparently looked for her throughout the night with the help of community members but didn’t find her. The next morning, the suspect released the girl to go home. She said the suspect’s family visited her on 21, 22 and 23 September and tried to make peace. She told them to bring the suspect. “I wanted to see him. But they didn’t bring him,” she said. “He bought her a R7 mayo and a spatlho and then he destroyed her life.” She said her kid was physically and emotionally hurt. “She’s isolating herself from other children,” she said. “My daughter is no longer the same.”  Sarah Baloyi, spokeswoman for Young Women for Life, said: “We support this family.We want to see justice being served,” she said. When a child is raped the entire community should be up in arms.” She said they don’t want the suspect to get bail. The suspect applied for bail in the Mamelodi Magistrates Court on 25 September and was granted R1 000 bail on Thursday. The case was postponed to 19 November. “We’re heartbroken and disappointed,” said Baloyi. “We expected that the suspect would be denied bail.”
