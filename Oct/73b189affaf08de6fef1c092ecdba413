A YEAR after opening the doors to his restaurant Buns Out, Maps Maponyane has opened another branch of his popular burger joint. The media personality took to social media to celebrate his restaurant turning a year older and announced he’s opening a new store in Rosebank soon. Maps, who’s been open about the hardship of running a business during a pandemic and said it’s been devastating for him, also said it felt like his business wouldn’t make it. “At one point it didn’t feel like we’d make it through the pandemic, but I’m excited to share that our new & SECOND Buns Out location is in Rosebank (2 Bolton Road). “We can’t wait to host you! Come through for great quality burgers! We’re open every day,” he wrote. Maps continues to do well for himself, just under a year after his burger joint was declared one of the best in the world.
