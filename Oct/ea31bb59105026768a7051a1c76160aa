A MASKANDI musician is caught in the crossfire after posting a sexy promotional video on Facebook. Khawulani “Unjoko” Mbambo posted a video on Monday of himself and a woman in red lingerie looking as if they’re about to poke. But maskandi fans weren’t impressed and accused him of using porn to promote his album. Unjoko later apologised and said he posted the sexy video to prove a point to those who undermined him and said he isn’t a real man. READ: CHUBBY MEN LAST LONGER IN BED! The Sengiqomile hitmaker said: “I don’t like to be called names. People say I’m gay because of my hairstyle. I’m a real man and capable of doing what men do, as seen in the video. Asked if he had issues with homosexual people, he said he didn’t. “I don’t have any problem with gay people, but I don’t like it when people accuse me of being gay because I’m not,” he said. Fans took to social media to express their thoughts on the video. Founder of the Feather Awards and activist Thami Kotlolo said: “Who he sleeps with has nothing to do with the LGBTQI community. Is sex with a woman proof that he is not gay? He must not use us to prove that he is not gay.”
