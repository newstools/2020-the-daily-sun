MAMELODI Suundowns have announced the appointment of Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena as joint head coaches. The pair have been promoted to fill the void left by former head coach Pitso Mosimane who left for greener pastures. Mosimane joined the African club of the century, Al Ahly. Mngqithi and Mokwena have worked with the current group of Downs players and will be expected to hit the ground running. Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe is confident that the pair will prove to be competent replacements for Mosimane. "Manqoba and Rhulani have been with Mamelodi Sundowns for many years and were part of the Technical Team that were crowned Champions of Africa in 2016 and have also won the Premier Soccer League and other titles in South Africa," said Motsepe in a statement. "The board of Mamelodi Sundowns was particularly keen to appoint South African coaches and express its commitment and confidence in the talent and ability of our local coaches. Manqoba, Rhulani and the Technical Team at Sundowns will focus on defending the PSL and the other titles that we won during our historic50-year anniversary. "They will also advance and continue with the objective that we stated in 2004, which is to make Mamelodi Sundowns one of the best clubs on the African Continent.‚Äù
