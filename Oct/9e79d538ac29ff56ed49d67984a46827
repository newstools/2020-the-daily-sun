ORLANDO Pirates have an injury crisis ahead of their DStv Premiership clash against Stellenbosch FC at Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm). According to the Pirates website, the medical team are racing against time to get key defender Wayde Jooste ready for the match. Jooste, who recently joined Bucs from the now defunct Highlands Park, is expected to undergo a late fitness test after he had a minor discomfort in his legs during Pirates’1-1 draw with AmaZulu in Durban at the weekend. Although the medical team revealed that the 29-year old’s injury is not serious, he will still undergo the necessary tests to determine whether he is fit to play or not. But the tough-as-teak defender is not the only one in the Pirates casualty room as another latest recruit, Collins Makgaka, has a swelling on his left eye after an accidental clash with his teammate at training. “He has swelling on his left eye which has been treated over the last three days,” read the statement. Meanwhile, Bucs will play without striker Tshegofatso Mabasa who is going through a rehabilitation program for the next couple of weeks after he sustained a foot injury, while left-back Bongani Sam is expected to start training with the team next week as he is recovering from a hamstring injury. Despite the setback, Pirates aim to register their first win of the season at the expense of Stellies, who are also desperate for three points having drawn their opening match 1-1 against Swallows FC. The Soweto giants will rely heavily on the scoring prowess of last season’s joint top scorer Gabadinho Mhango, who also found the back of net via a penalty against Usuthu. However, the Pirates defence led by Thulani Hlatshwayo will need to keep a close eye on Stellies’ midfielder Leletu Skelem who has a knack for goals.
