IT is quite common to see GladAfrica Championship teams struggle to compete in their first season in the elite league. Lack of quality players, poor preparation as well as poor technical are among some of the factors behind the mediocre performance in the Premiership. Soon, promoted sides find themselves in the relegation zone and later return whence they come... in the first division trenches. However, one of the PSL rookies, TS Galaxy, have assured their fans that they are not in the Premiership to add numbers. The Rockets will make their much-anticipated debut in the elite league on Sunday against another new team, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, who bought the status of now-defunct Wits. The clash between the two former NFD side will take place at Thohoyandou Stadium at 3pm. Ahead of their first-ever game in the Premiership, Galaxy chairman has Tim Sukazi made a bold statement. ”We are not here but to add the numbers, ” Sukazi declared. “We have already set the bar high,” he said, referencing to their 2018-19 Nedbank Cup triumph when they defeated Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 to lift their maiden trophy. “We are coming to add a very exciting dimension. We are coming to play the kind of football that resonates with the South African football fans, talent at it's best. ”I think that that has been a missing link or a missing puzzle in our game. He continued: “We have already set our bar, I think it has already been set a long time ago when we brought to earth Chiefs” “For us now is to either meet that standard or better those standards, and certainly that’s what we want to do.” Galaxy, Swallows FC and Tshakhuma are the three new teams in the Premiership this season. Swallows won automatic promotion, bouncing back after they were relegated five seasons ago.
