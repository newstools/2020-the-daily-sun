FROM his hospital bed, Angelo Agrizzi will be heading straight home after he was granted bail by the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg earlier today. Agrizzi’s bail has been set to over R16 million, which is the amount of the property he owns in Italy. The high court set aside the decision of the Specialised Commercial Crime Court sitting in Palm Ridge where Agrizzi was denied bail after the state convinced the magistrate that Agrizzi was a flight risk. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng in his order said: “It is ordered that pending the outcome of the trial, the appellant is granted bail equal to the value of the appellant’s property at the time which the property was purchased, which property is located at Castel de Piano in Italy.” He added: “It is ordered the appellant be released from custody on 30 October upon presentation of this order to the prison authorities.” The court also ordered the former Bosasa COO hand over the original title deed of the Italy property to the investigating officer in the case. Once he is out of hospital, Agrizzi will have to report to the Douglasdale police station once every week. Since he was denied bail over two weeks ago, Agrizzi has spent only one night at the Joburg correctional facility. He was rushed to public hospital after he had complications. According to his defence team, he was then transferred to a private hospital due to the shortage of ICU beds at the public hospital. His lawyers said his condition got worse after he was denied bail. Agrizzi will appear again at the Specialised Commercial Crime Court sitting in Palm Ridge on 3 December, along with co-accused ANC former MP Vincent Smith.
