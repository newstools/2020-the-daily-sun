ACTRESS Millicent Makhado is still hurting after her car was broken into last month. The former Scandal and Muvhango actress told Daily Sun thugs stole her ID, driver’s licence, laptop and even her daughter’s backpack from her car parked at her mum’s house in Atteridgeville, Tshwane. She said she had visited her mum, who wasn’t well. “I had to take my child to school in Joburg the next morning and we were supposed to leave at 5.30am,” she told Daily Sun. “I woke up, had a bath and put my belongings in the car before going back inside to prepare my child for the day.” ALSO READ:PHAT JOE SCORES PRESENTING GIG! Millicent said 15 minutes later, she came back to find her car had been broken into. “I wasn’t in the house for a long time. It happened so quickly. I’m disappointed,” she said. Millicent said she lost some work that was stored on her hard drive. “I’m an artist and writer, and I do a lot of work on the side. “My work was on the hard drive and am scared some of it won’t be recovered,” she said. “I have to now run around offices applying for my lost documents. It’s a lot of work, considering we’re still under lockdown.” Millicent said she wanted all her belongings back. “Those thugs should bring my things back. I’ll take action to make sure I get what’s mine. “I worked hard for those things and someone took them in less than an hour,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that a case was opened. “It’s under investigation but no one has been arrested yet,” he said.
