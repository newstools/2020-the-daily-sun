  Owens says that employees’ expectations of management during this time also warrants a change in thinking.  He advises employees to be tough on their leaders.  “Seek clarity, ask for guidance and help, and articulate your expectations.  It is only when you are tough on them that they can be tough on you – there is a reciprocity in the leader / employee relationship.”  Employees need to make their contribution felt and make sure that their organisation can’t do without them.  In conclusion Owens says, “Irrespective of level, respect the individual and the value and sanctity of work – it is both a right and a privilege.”  - Supplied
