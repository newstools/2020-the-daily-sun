SKEEM Saam actress and singer
Candy “Tsa Mandebele” Mokwena is determined to make people understand the
realities of living with diabetes. As November, National Diabetes
Month, draws near, Mokwena revealed that she takes it upon herself to educate
people on the importance of healthy living. “I did not really see a need to
hide it. Also, I wanted the general public to understand the realities of this
deadly disease,” she said. She did not confirm her plans
for the awareness month but assured it would include some educational
plans. “More awareness nears to be at
the forefront. I feel like diabetes is not talked about much as compared to
other diseases. As such, every year around the month November, I take it
upon myself to share as much as possible with as many people as possible about
the ins and outs of this disease starting with taking care of yourself after
being diagnosed,” she said. August 2011 was the year when
things all changed for the former Kalawa Jazmee musician. “It was one of the most trying
days of my life when I lost my son in a car accident. Then later in November, I
was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I was running some errands at the local
mall, minding my own business, when all of a sudden I just collapsed. They
rushed me to a nearby hospital, and that’s when I was diagnosed,” she
said. She explained that there
can never be enough awareness campaigns on diabetes as it requires a holistic
lifestyle change. “They have to at least try and
educate themselves. The more clued up you are, the better the outcome, or
should I say your approach to the disease,” she said.
