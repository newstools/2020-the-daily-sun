ACTRESS and filmmaker Thishiwe Ziqubu dropped a bombshell last night announcing that she and long-time girlfriend, fellow actress Mandisa Nduna, had broken up. She tweeted last night, “Beautiful people. Because you loved and supported us, we must let you know. Mandisa and I broke up a while back. It is a Love I will always treasure and honour, and all is good.“  Beautiful people. Because you loved and supported us, we must let you know. Mandisa and I broke up a while back. It is a Love I will always treasure and honor, and all is good. ??  Mandisa responded, “Thankful for it all. Sisonke nja yam.”  It’s time?? Thishiwe and I have been broken up for a while now. I feel incredibly grateful for the past (almost) 4 years.   The proudly gay couple gained many fans and admirers but also some haters when they went public with their relationship almost four years ago. They had even won the Cutest Couple at the Feather Awards in 2017. But it seems the fairy-tale romance has come to end amicably as the two only had good things to say about each other. Neither Thishiwe nor Mandisa revealed the reasons for their split. Last year Sowetan had reported that Thishiwe had disappeared from the limelight for about seven months to complete her ancestral calling. Speaking from the red carpet of an event alongside Mandisa she had told the publication: "Oh child! Romance is going well. I have been chosen and gifted. Mandisa Nduna is absolutely an amazing partner. I love her to death, and she loves me to death," she gushed. "We are in a beautiful place and she supported me throughout this wonderful spiritual journey."
