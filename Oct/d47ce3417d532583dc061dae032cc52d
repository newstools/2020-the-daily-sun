RUTH Mabyana, the CEO of Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital in Soweto, has been suspended. This was announced by the Department of Health shortly after an alleged rape incident at the hospital. Department spokeswoman Kwara Kekana confirmed that Mabyana has been removed from the hospital. “This precautionary transfer involves an alleged case of misconduct, which is yet to be investigated and dealt with accordingly,” Kekana said. She said Gauteng acting health MEC Jacob Mamabolo elected Makabedi Makhetha to fill the position. “There’s an urgent need to resolve broader issues at the hospital. We also need to recover the community’s lost confidence in the facility,” she said. The MEC is said to have elected a team of investigators to deal specifically with the recent rape incident of a psychiatric patient at the facility. This comes after DA shadow MEC Jack Bloom dismissed Mabyana as an incompetent hospital CEO. After the alleged rape, Bloom said Mabyana should have been removed long ago after scandals that included a string of violent assaults on patients and staff and a jobs-for-sale matter.
