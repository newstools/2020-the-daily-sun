ORLANDO Pirates have secured the signature of free agent Thabang Monare, the club have confirmed. The former Bidvest Wits and Jomo Cosmos midfielder joins the Soweto giants on a 2-year deal. Monare, who was released by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila after they bought Wits' status, will add some steel in Bucs' midfield this season. The 31-year-old had been rumored to be heading to Bucs rivals Kaizer Chiefs but their transfer ban has made things difficult. Monare is delighted to board the Bucs ship. "I am happy to have signed with the Club,” said Monare on his club's website. “I hope, like I have done in my entire career, I can make a meaningful contribution during my time here. I think this is a team that suits my style of play and that can only benefit me and the team for the season ahead.”
