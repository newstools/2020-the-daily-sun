THEY say a picture paints a thousand words, and show me your friend and I’ll show you your future. These popular sayings articulate how things/gestures tend to say a lot rather than words. The same thing could be said about kissing, especially if you’re doing it for the first time with someone. According to some studies, the average woman kisses about 15 men, has two long-term relationships, and experiences heartbreak at least twice before she meets “the one” and gets married. Simply put, your first kiss provides a lot of insight. Here are some insights it can give you: 1. Chemistry When your lips touch your partner’s lips, do you wish the moment would last forever or do you want it to end as soon as possible? 2. Bedroom performance The technique used during a first kiss is applied later in the bedroom, so you can easily decide if sleeping with your partner would actually be worth it. 3. Hygiene Does their breath taste like peppermint gum? Do they wear perfume? Have they taken a shower beforehand? If so, you’re lucky because your partner cares about your opinion.
