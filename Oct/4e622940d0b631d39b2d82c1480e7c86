SOCIAL media giant Facebook has launched its long awaited dating app which has a Secret Crush feature that lets you choose which friends you secretly fancy. The app was tested two years ago in the US via an opt-in option and lets you create a separate profile for dating. It has now launched in Europe. The dating site aims to provide an alternative to the usual dating app line-up of Tinder and others, giving what they describe as a space to “help more people find meaningful relationships through things they have in common, like interests, events, and groups”.  Facebook has seen many relationships that ended in marriage and happy couples mainly because the relationships become more meaningful than those from other dating apps. The dating app is currently not available in Mzansi but it is rolling out in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Secret Crush feature lets you select up to nine of your Facebook friends or Instagram followers who you secretly fancy, and if they choose you for their Secret Crush list, you get matched, but even if they don’t choose you, they will know that you have a crush on them.
