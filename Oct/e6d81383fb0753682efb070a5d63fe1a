THE investigating officer in the rape and sexual assault case against the former Mpumalanga MEC and his stepson gave chilling evidence when he took the stand yesterday afternoon. The 48-year-old and his 26-year-old stepson were bust at their home on Monday over allegations of raping eight-year-old twin girls. Sergeant Solomon Mbokodo told Nelspruit Magistrates Court one of girls told the investigation team before the matter was reported to her school teacher, she saw her father enter their bedroom, and go to where her sister was sleeping. He allegedly took something that looked like a cloth, covered her sister’s mouth, undressed her and slept on top of her and later stood up and left the room.  Mbokodo said the victim also told them her father would sometimes call her and tell her to sit on his lap, kissed her on the lips and would put his hand inside her underwear. Earlier on, the former MEC’s wife took the stand and described how loving her husband is. She said he wasn’t capable of such an act and loved their kids dearly. She said she believed if something had happened to the kids, they would have reported it to her and their helper. In terms of the court order, the two young victims have been removed from the custody and care of the accused to an unknown place of safety. Magistrate Susan Monaledi postponed the matter to Tuesday for continuation of the bail hearing.
