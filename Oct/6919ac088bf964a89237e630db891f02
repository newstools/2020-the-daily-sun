Lamontville Golden Arrows have confirmed they have parted ways with four players at the end of the 2019-20 Premier Soccer League season, including defender Gladwin Shitolo, who has returned to Orlando Pirates. Shitolo was on loan for the campaign, but his stay has not been extended and his loss will be keenly felt by Abafana Bes’thende. Also exiting is experienced forward Lerato Lamola, who did not have his contract extended when it expired at the end of last season. “Lerato played a huge role at the club since joining us in 2016. We wish him nothing but the best for his future,” Golden Arrows said in a statement. Long-time servant Sibusiso Sibeko has also ended his seven-year stay at the club after a mutual parting of ways. “Sibusiso’s contribution to the club, from development through to his first team commitments, will not be forgotten,” the statement continued. Finally, forward Nkosingiphile Phewa has also departed the club after only one substitute appearance since he joined at the start of the campaign from Royal Kings. Golden Arrows will start the new DSTV Premiership season on 24 October. -SuperSport
