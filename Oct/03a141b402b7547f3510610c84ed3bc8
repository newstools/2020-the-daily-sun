LIMPOPO Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba has condemned the attack on a paramedic. Sidwell Maluleke (41) was allegedly moered and pepper sprayed by a man while transporting patients from Musina to Tshilidzini and Elim hospitals. The incident happened at the Baobab Tollgate between Makhado and Musina today. Ramathuba said the department was disappointed by the level of disrespect shown to officials and patients. “Attacking government officials on duty is equal to attacking the state. We therefore call upon anyone who might have witnessed the incident to come forward as this might help bring the culprit to book,” she said. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, said a case of assault was opened by Musina police. “The paramedic was trying to warn a motorist who was trying to overtake him about an oncoming vehicle, but the driver allegedly ignored the signals and overtook. “When both vehicles reached a local filling station, the driver of the other vehicle allegedly insulted the paramedic,” said Mojapelo. He said the suspect suddenly stopped in the middle of the road when they approached the tollgate and reportedly continued to insult the victim. “He eventually alighted from the vehicle and went straight to the ambulance, where an argument ensued. The suspect went to his vehicle and came back with pepper spray and sprayed it in the victim’s eyes. He then drove away,” he said. Mojapelo added that the police were tracking the suspect, who was driving a Toyota Hilux with the registration number DWD 113 L.
