THE Baloyi family couldn’t believe it when Gauteng Social Development officials donated groceries to them. The donation was made at their home in Bridgeview in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. This after Daily Sun published their story on Monday headlined: “Wild morogo is our seshebo.” William (42) told Daily Sun he was very happy. “The groceries rescued us because we will have a decent meal,” he said.

We were touched by their situation and they will cook good food. We’ll continue to help them.” Tagane said two mentally-ill family members would be taken to the nearest health facility to be monitored. He said they also donated four mattresses and four blankets. Sanco’s ward 74 chairman, Jeffrey Nyathikazi, said they appreciated what the department did for the family and that the groceries would make a huge difference. “We’re still pleading for more help for them. We will not rest until they are helped and live like other people,” he said. Nyathikazi appealed for more donors to help with the house as it’s in a bad state.
