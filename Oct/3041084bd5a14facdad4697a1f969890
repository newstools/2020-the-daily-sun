BRILLIANT Khuzwayo's assault case has been postponed to next Tuesday, 27 October. Khuzwayo appeared at the Umlazi Magistrate’s court on Monday on counter assault charges after being stabbed with an empty beer bottle allegedly by a student at the Mangosuthu University of Technology on Saturday. The 30-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper was badly hurt with a visible open wound on his hand, and broke the news via his Twitter handle. On his attacked, apparently while taking pictures with university students who asked for his time before the sports event started, enraged the lanky goalie and a scuffle ensured where the 22-year-old student is believed to have been attacked too. Khuzwayo was there on invitation by university as guest speaker for the sport event. While Khuzwayo laid an assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm charges with the police against the unidentified student, the university scholar also did the same to counter the former goalie's charges. Now the student and Khuzwayo will return to court next week. KZN SAPS captain Nqobile Gwala said both individuals appeared in court on Monday "and however, the matter has been postponed and will be heard on 27 October". KZN NPA's Natasha Ramkisson, who postponed the matter, is expected to read through the charges, and Khuzwayo’s retaliation action has apparently been abhorred by the police. Khuzwayo was left badly hurt on his left hand side compared to the student's injury. Sport president at the university Sihle Hlabisa said Khuzwayo had no choice but to fight back. “You won’t stop when someone is fighting you and just look at him,” said Hlabisa. “The student pressed the charges because he was at fault, not because he was duty bound to press them."
