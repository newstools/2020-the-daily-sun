TOP detective Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear was laid to rest in Cape Town today. The funeral at His People Church at N1 City Mall in Goodwood was attended by Minister Bheki Cele, as well as national and provincial police leadership. Kinnear, who was part of the anti-gang unit, was shot and killed outside his house in Bishop Lavis on 18 September. Unit leader Major-General Andre Lincoln said the gap left by Kinnear’s murder cannot be filled. “I want to say to you, nobody will be able to fill Kinnear’s shoes. They were his and his alone, so we are facing a daunting task ahead of us.” Kinnear’s son Casleigh (19) said his father would work at home at night and was dedicated to his job. “My dad would sometimes come home at 2.30 in the morning and at 4.30, he was prepared to leave. That is the type of dedication and commitment my dad had. He believed in good morals which he was taught by my grandfather and has also instilled in me and my brother. We will miss him dearly.” Lincoln said when it came to his job, Kinnear was from a different crop. “He was dedicated and tough. I can say to you since that very trying time on 18 September, the pain we felt as a unit has been great, but I cannot imagine how the family felt. To Nicolette and the boys, we say thank you for borrowing him to us.” Close friend Captain Frederick Van Wyk said they were friends, attending police college and taking part in singing together. Van Wyk said his friend loved soccer and was a family man who always was protective of his loved ones. Cele said Kinnear was one of a kind and ranked the number one detective in the province and third nationally. At the time of his death, he was working on high-profile cases including underworld and gang-related crimes. Former rugby player Zane Killian was bust in connection with his murder and has since appeared in Bishop Lavis Magistrates Court.
