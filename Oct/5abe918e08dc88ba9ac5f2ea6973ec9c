NEW Al Ahly head coach, Pitso Mosimane, on Sunday morning announced his first team since he joined Africa's Cup of the Century on Friday to enter a closed camp bubble, in preparation for their clash against the Al Makowloon in the 31st edition of the Egypt Premier League. Mosimane divided all the players at the end of the team's collective training on Saturday, which was held at the Touch Stadium on the island. "Mosimane was keen to stop playing more than once and to direct the players with some technical instructions for each of them," table-toppers Al Ahly posted on their official website. Mosimane's first team to face the Arab Contractors comprise stars like Mohamed El-Shennawy, Amr Al-Soulia, Aliou Badji, Mohamed Magdy Afsha, Ahmed Fathy Geraldo, Mohamed Hani and Mohamed Shoukry. Next up for Mosimane is a clash against CNPPI on Wednesday. Our team is getting prepared for Mosimane's first game ???? https://t.co/5WvraznA5H
