IT’S been almost a month since Mojalefa Moleme disappeared. Now his family is having a difficult time dealing with the matter. According to his brother Tau (52), the last time they heard or saw Mojalefa was on 27 September. They realised the 38-year-old from Swartdam near Makapanstaad, North West, was missing three days later when he didn’t show up for work. Tau said he received a call on 29 September from his mum asking about Mojalefa’s whereabouts. “I asked around, but no one knew where he was. I asked a friend to check at his house and he found the door opened. Mojalefa’s phone was on his bed,” he told Daily Sun. Tau said it seemed like an abduction in his own car as it was nowhere to be seen. He said they’ve been searching all over hoping to find clues. “It’s been difficult for our family to continue with our daily lives. The cops don’t have any leads. It’s all quite.” Tau said he suspected Mojalefa’s disappearance could be linked to a road construction tender he was heading. “I heard people say construction won’t be able to continue without him,” said Tau. “We don’t know what to do. We just want him back home and alive. What scares us is we haven’t received any ransom demands from anyone.” North West police spokeswoman Adele Myburg said Mojalefa was last seen on 27 September wearing grey sneakers, blue jeans and a T-shirt. “He’s of medium build and height with brown eyes and a shaven head. “He drives a red Uno with registration number DGC 210 L,” Myburg told the People’s Paper. “When police visited his house in New Stand, Swartdam, it was unlocked and his cellphone was found on his bed, while his car was missing.” She said that a case of kidnapping was opened after an eyewitness allegedly saw him being abducted from his house.
