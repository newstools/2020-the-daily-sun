MPUMALANGA Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has urged residents to join the fight against malaria. Speaking at the launch of the indoor malaria residual spraying project in Masoyi near Hazyview on Friday, she said: “It is important for all of us to put our hands on deck to defeat this killer disease. “We have seen a decline in the number of patients who die from malaria. “This is partly due to our seasonal efforts in conducting malaria health promotion and prevention awareness campaigns.” Manzini said the aim of these campaigns was to raise awareness regularly until communities were fully educated about the dangers of malaria and how to treat and prevent it. “We are here to take control of the spread of malaria and make sure our fight against it gains renewed momentum in our province,” she said. “We strive to be declared a malaria-free province. “To achieve this goal, we are working closely with Mozambique and eSwatini through the Mosaswa agreement, because we border these two countries and many of the malaria cases being treated in our health facilities are patients who have come across the border from these countries.” Manzini urged residents to consult their local health facilities if they had any symptoms. “An urgent malaria blood test will be done and the results will be known immediately, so that treatment is obtained and initiated immediately,” said Manzini.
