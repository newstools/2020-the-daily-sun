COPS have warned residents about a new scam by hijackers. The hijackers pretend to be technicians sent by car dealerships to collect cars that were reported to have mechanical problems. Armed with a tow truck, the thugs tow the car and disappear with it. But they were recently bust when they tried to pull the same trick on a Mercedes-Benz driver in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. Constable Justice Ramaube of Boksburg North Police Station said the two suspects, aged between 36 and 27, were from Tshwane. He said they approached the victim pretending to be technicians from a Mercedes-Benz branch in Midrand. “They told her they were coming to fetch the car as it was allegedly reported to have a mechanical problem,” he said. Ramaube said the suspects immediately towed the victim’s car, informing her they were taking it to the Midrand branch. The woman refused and insisted her car rather be taken to the Boksburg Mercedes-Benz branch. “She became suspicious and called the police. “The police’s swift response led to the arrest of two suspects. Their explanation as to why they came to tow the car was not quite satisfying and were arrested,” he said. Ramaube said the two suspects will appear in the Boksburg Magistrates Court soon.
