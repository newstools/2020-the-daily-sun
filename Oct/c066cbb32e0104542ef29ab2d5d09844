SUPERSPORT United have confirmed that Aubrey Modiba has joined Mamelodi Sundowns with immediate effect. TH club released a statement on Friday confirming the move. "SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns have agreed terms for the permanent move of Bafana Bafana midfielder Aubrey Modiba with immediate effect," said the statement"Modiba joined the club in the 2016/17 season and played a crucial role in helping Matsatsantsa to lift the MTN 8 twice and Nedbank Cup trophy and contributed immensely in SuperSport United's historic CAF Confederations Cup journey, finishing as runners-up losing narrowly to DRC Giants TP Mazembe."The 25-year-old has over 100 caps under his belt scoring just less than 30 goals for Matsatsantsa and will always be remembered for his accurate free kicks." SuperSport CEO Stanley Matthews said: "The Club has been consistent in our approach to the release of players for many years now. When a player helps us win trophies, plays his part in the club's progress and gets a massive opportunity which is good for both him and us - then we open to discussion. "Sundowns have been pursuing Aubrey for a long time and the reality is we cannot come anywhere close to what is available to him. He has been a fantastic player for us on the pitch, a wonderful young man off the field, of whom we are very proud , and we wish him every success in the future - a future which looks very bright indeed." Modiba represented the South African U23 side in the Olympic games in 2016 in Brazil. He was later rewarded for his excellence and consistent club performance by getting a call up to Bafana.
