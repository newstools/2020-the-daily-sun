SHE tried to kiss her boyfriend while they were driving. But he didn’t kiss her back. And the whole incident was caught on camera. To add to Sphokuhle Ntanjana’s embarrassment, the video trended on social media and she’s been depressed ever since. The 23-year-old from Port Elizabeth said she even stayed away from social media and felt like a joke.  She cried a lot when she trended. “I felt embarrassed and everyone shared that video with mean comments,” she said. “I stayed home for days as I was scared to be seen outside. My phone was also off for several days.” Sphokuhle said being alone helped her realise she couldn’t stop living her life for people. She said: “I see no reason to respond to anyone about the video. I can now go to the shops without feeling scared or embarrassed.” She also received words of encouragement from people she didn’t even know.  The owner of Bonny Hairpiness Studio, Bonisile Thwala (24), also reached out to Sphokuhle and blessed her with a new 10-inch Peruvian weave to cheer her up. She said she was sad about what happened to Sphokuhle. “This can happen to anyone. These days you can easily get dragged on social media and trend without anyone noticing how it affects you,” said Bonisile. She said it was okay to find something funny, but passing hurtful words wasn’t. Bonisile said women needed each other now more than ever. She said she was happy Sphokuhle was feeling better. “She’s a very strong, God-fearing woman and she said she’s coping well with all the support she’s been getting,” said Bonisile.
