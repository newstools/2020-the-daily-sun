THE video showing a marked police van parked in the yard of a club has gone viral. The visible policing unit van of Ladybrand cop shop can be seen parked at the local tavern in the Free State kasi. The man who is making the video can be heard saying the van has parked and it will be parked for a while. The music playing loud can be heard while the man continues to say: “This is a state vehicle and I’m zooming it in the tavern. It’s nicely parked and it won’t be moving anytime soon. We call the police to ask for help and we are told that the vans are not available.” The video, which was taken on 9 October, has now landed the warrant officer in hot water. Resident Thabang Serole (28) said they were facing a challenge of police not attending their complaints. He said: “I was neither surprised nor shocked when I saw that video. It’s like a new norm and the police do as they please. But I have to stress that not all the police members are rotten. We also have a problem of those who check on their nyatsis using state cars. Some even buy groceries using the police vans. This needs to stop because it’s tax-payers’ money.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said they were aware of the incident. Makhele told Daily Sun: “There is an officer appointed to investigate the matter further with the intention for departmental steps to be taken on behaviour of the member implicated. The member has been identified and he is a warrant officer. We will allow the process of departmental steps to be completed. As the organisation, we deem any form of misuse of state resources as serious, hence we will never hesitate to take immediate steps against whoever is in the wrong or implicated in any manner. We want to urge our communities to report such conducts without any fear.” WARRANT OFFICER IN HOT WATER FOR TAKING POLICE VAN TO TARVEN! pic.twitter.com/G3IfMrWygY
