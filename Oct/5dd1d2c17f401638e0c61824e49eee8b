IT IS very common for people to gain weight after they get married and it is often dubbed “Happy Weight”. This type of weight gain seems to be acceptable in society to an extent that if you do not gain weight, your happiness in your marriage might be questioned. Many people say it is because one starts having sex regularly after they marry but this has been proven to be false by gynaecologist Dr Asha Jain, who said: “There is no physiological reason why the breasts or hips should become enlarged or disfigured after a woman starts having sex."

The real reason for this weight gain is that your eating habits are more to likely change after marriage and because you eat more than what you did when you were single. Another reason for this weight gain is caused by the sense of security. Couples who feel secure, loved and happy are more likely to gain weight in their marriage. The combination of commitment and sharing meals together are major contributors for weight gain. Research done by Stephanie Schoeppe, a senior postdoctoral research fellow at Central Queensland University, examined a large population sample of 15 000 adults to provide significant insight into this topic. Schoeppe and her team pooled data from the annual Queensland Social Survey. Questionnaires tracked if people were married or single, as well as a number of lifestyle factors such as whether or not they smoked, how often they exercised and ate vegetables and their BMIs. Schoeppe found that couples were more likely to plan meals around quality time together and that, although family meals were linked with greater fruit and vegetable consumption, they were also linked to larger portions and more consumption across the board. Single people eating alone tended to consume less.
