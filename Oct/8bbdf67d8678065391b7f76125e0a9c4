DSTV Premiership newcomers Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) aim to bounce back from their 3-2 home defeat to SuperSport United in the MTN8 quarter-finals last weekend. They host other newbies TS Galaxy in their opening league clash at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday (3pm). And adding spice to the clash is the fact that both clubs will be making their PSL debuts. TTM bought Bidvest Wits franchise, while Galaxy purchased Highlands Park’s Premiership status. Tshakhuma coach Joel Masutha was in a happy mood this week as his player problems have been resolved. Last Saturday, Tshakhuma only had 14 players to use in their 3-2 defeat to Matsatsantsa a Pitori, which was a huge concern to their fans. But the former Black Leopards and Chippa United coach said all is well in his team. “I am sure everyone has seen we have added new players and the paperwork of some of the players who missed last week’s game have been sorted,” said Masutha. United strikers exposed the TTM defence in the Wafa Wafa showdown on Saturday. But stressed Masutha: “I am spoiled for choice by having a big squad to choose from. “We have added new players this week. We have a strong team which is ready to fight for Tshakhuma.” This week, Tshakhuma signed three defenders – Alfred Ndengane, Diamond Thopolo and Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali. “I think now we will have stability at the back,” said Masutha. “We were shaky in defence when we started against United, but the experience of these (new) guys will help us a lot.” On their clash against Dan Malesela’s side, Masutha said: “We don’t have any choice but to win this game. We have to make sure we collect points at home, no matter how tough it will be. We can’t afford to lose two games in a row at home. It will be a tough game but I believe in my team.”
