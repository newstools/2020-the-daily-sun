CAPE Town City have continued bolstering their squad ahead of the 2020-21 Dstv Premiership. The Citizens on Friday morning announced the arrival of Zambia international Charles Zulu. Zulu’s move to the Mother City has long been rumoured, with his former club Zanaco suggesting the deal had been done months ago, but City have finally unveiled the player. "Cape Town City is delighted to announce the acquisition of Zambian international winger Charles Zulu," the club said on Twitter. "City and Zanaco have reached a transfer agreement, which sees Zulu sign a 4-year deal till June 2024!." The 24-year-old made his Chipolopolo debut as a 18-year-old in 2014, netting his first goal in the 2016 COSAFA Cup against Lesotho. Since then he has gained experience in the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup with Zanaco. His signing should fill up City’s foreign quota, with goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh (Netherlands), defenders Edmilson Dove (Mozambique) and Giannis Potouridis (Greece), and striker Prince Opoku Agyemang (Ghana) also on their books.
