INCREDIBLE Happenings Ministries leader Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng says his life is being threatened. Mboro claimed he was told his days were numbered after he tackled Prophet Shepherd Bushiri. He said he was targeted by foreign pastors after deciding to speak out against their fake miracles. “A number of foreign pastors came together to destroy me because they have unity, unlike South African pastors. “A prophet from Ghana said I will die a terrible death and my body wouldn’t be recognised if I don’t stop talking about Bushiri.” Mboro was speaking at the CRL Rights Commission in Braamfontein, Joburg yesterday, where he was meant to discuss several issues with the commission, including people who were scammed by foreign pastors. “The commission has been captured. They don’t treat people equally. They protect pastors from outside the country,” he said. Mboro said local pastors also did wrong things, but the commission would never face them. “The target is only me.” He said he was meant to meet the commission, but was dropped at the last hour. Through their lawyer, the commission said they’d meet on Monday. But Mboro said the commission leadership was avoiding him. “We confirmed the meeting two weeks ago and they said they sent an email yesterday, but I didn’t receive it. Even if I had received it, I would have challenged it.” The commission’s legal representative, Aubrey Sedupane said: “Those are serious allegations. At this juncture one would prefer that Mr Motsoeneng come in again and have an opportunity to present his challenges to the commission members. They will hear him out and say if what he’s saying is truthful and be able to defend themselves. Any allegation made by Mr Motsoeneng or a member of the public will have to be tested as to whether they are truthful or not.”
