EDWIN Gyimah may be back in favour at Black Leopards. But the rabble-rousing player is not yet off the hook. The Ghanaian midfielder faces a charge of misconduct after he went AWOL last season, and later levelled damning allegations against Leopards’ team director, Tshifhiwa Thidiela. Trouble started when Gyimah requested to be substituted in their last league fixture against Mamelodi Sundowns last season. The coach acceded to his request and he then went and collected his belongings from the hotel and disappeared. Weeks later, he came to his senses and apologised in writing for the public comments, which practically brought the team into disrepute. He has returned to the Lidoda Duvha camp, but that is not the end of the story. “He is back and currently training alone based on the fact he’d tested positive for Covid-19,” said CEO Moudy Mudzielwana. “We understood what happened then. Everybody makes a mistake. He understood that he has made a mistake. But the mistake he made wasn’t a footballing matter and we felt in the field he gives us more. We forgive and have him in the club. “However, we have to discipline him, just like everybody else. We’ve got a disciplinary structure. But we would not necessarily divulge what we have done to him.” Gyimah could also be facing action from the league after Leopards reported him for the same discretion. Leopards won the promotion/relegation play-offs to survive relegation last season. They begin their season with a home clash against SuperSport United at empty Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow night (8.15pm).
