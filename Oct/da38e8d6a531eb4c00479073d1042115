MASKANDI star Khuzani “King Khuba” Mpungose has healed many souls with his music over the past 10 years. He’s now on a mission to help fix sleeping 4-5s. Speaking to Daily Sun, Khuzani said he wanted Mzansi men to break their backs, so to speak, in an effort to make their ladies happy. He revealed on Monday that he’s become an ambassador for sexual products supplier, Obees Brands. The black-owned company makes it its business to ensure its customers don’t make the ladies doubt them. Khuzani, who recently launched a funeral cover policy, said: “I’m happy with this partnership, which is aimed at helping men live healthy lives, so they can perform better in the bedroom.” The singer from Nkandla, KZN, said the time of sleeping 4-5s, low libido and not satisfying women is over! “These products will help get sleeping 4-5s back to normal and boost those who have no problems getting it up.” He urged people to practise safe sex. He said: “I’m happy that many men listened to me when I asked them to get circumcised during a campaign I was part of. “I’d be happy if people protected themselves while enjoying sex.” Khuzani would probably be disappointed to find out that a recent study revealed that young adults in South Africa were having far less sex than their parents did in the past. It found possible causes could be stress, anxiety, safety concerns, and that they drink less than their madalas did. King Khuba has his work cut out.
