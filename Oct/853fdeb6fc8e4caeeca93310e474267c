FOOTBALL giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates are lacing up their boots for a big battle. The derby fever is running high, but the two teams will renew their rivalry in front of empty stands! Pirates will host Chiefs at their famous base, Orlando Stadium, on Saturday at 3pm for this leg of the MTN8 semi-finals. This will be a derby like no other, as the match will be played behind closed doors. There will be no cheers, no vuvuzelas and no supporters for health and safety reasons during Covid-19 challenges, which saw the PSL suspend fans from attending matches. But it will be broadcast live on TV. . . Daily Sun spoke to diehard supporters of both clubs, Masilo Machaka and Joyce “Mama Joy” Chauke, to find out how different their preparations for this derby behind closed doors were. Staunch Chiefs supporter Machaka said: “This derby will be very strange. It’s the supporters that make this fixture special, and it won’t be the same without them. “A Soweto derby without supporters is unheard of, but we understand the situation and continue to respect government rules. “We as supporters miss going to the stadium, but this time safety comes first. I urge fellow supporters not to go anywhere near the stadium. They might be tempted to get a feel of the action and run into the stadium.” Pirates supporter Mama Joy said: “You can tell this derby will be completely different. The hype around the match isn’t the same. Usually, you’d feel it’s Derby Week wherever you went because people would be excited about it, but not this time. “This is the first time I watch the derby on TV instead of being at the stadium.”
