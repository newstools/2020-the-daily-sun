AS many people are expected on the road this weekend following the reopening of ports of entry from yesterday, Mpumalanga community safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala has urged motorists to use the road cautiously. Shabalala warned while there’s movement across borders, there would be zero tolerance towards reckless and negligent driving. She appealed to motorists to use the road responsibly to save lives. This follows reports of heavy traffic at the Lebombo border gate near Komatipoort yesterday. The opening of the borders was in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement of alert level 1 a few weeks ago. Shabalala said her department is working with all stakeholders and is ready to deal with increased traffic volumes in and out of the country through the province from neighbouring countries, like the Kingdom of Eswatini and Mozambique. She appealed to motorists to respect the rules of the road and play their role in making roads safer, saying those who didn’t comply with the law should be harshly dealt with by law enforcement officers. She said bringing of unruly drivers to book and punishing them will go a long way towards ensuring road safety, signalling government’s zero tolerance towards bad driver behaviour. “Transport remains the backbone of the economy as the sector to provide many livelihoods to families through direct employment. It is therefore imperative that as part of ensuring growth in the sector, road safety initiatives are heightened at all times. Therefore our communities must also play a role in making our roads safer. Every road user, motorist and transport operator must respect the law,” said Shabalala.
