EVIL creche teacher Nellie Senwametsi has been sentenced to five years’ imprisonment! She was convicted of two counts of common assault and one count of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm of three children, two aged four and one aged 18 months. Daily Sun previously reported on three separate videos that went viral on 4 April 2019 showing Nelly continuously assaulting the kids. READ: SHAKA ZULU ANGERS KING The organisation Women and Men Against Child Abuse had called for a minimum sentence of 10 years and are displeased with the verdict. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ngaa Murombedzi said it is consolation that Senwametsi is finally sentenced but it’s not enough. “We wanted the public to know and understand that abuse against children will not be tolerated because of the lifetime psychological impact it has on the children. “For her to be given this sentence on the basis that she is remorseful is not enough. She is not sorry for what she did, but she is sorry because she got caught,” said Murombedzi.
