LWAZI Cele (27) from Highflats in KZN has written a book called Izidlamlilo in response to gender-based violence. He said: “I wrote this book during the lockdown and I finally released it in July. The book consists of 20 short stories. “The leading story is Izidlamlilo Zasemgodi which also happens to be the title of the book. This story revolves around a group of local men. They have become known criminals in the area, but the residents are too scared to speak up. This is because they’re ruthless and not scared to kill. But when their traditional healer dies of natural causes, they seek revenge. They end up accusing an old woman of witchcraft. Eventually they kill this old woman.” ALSO READ | MASTER KG'S BOLT DRAMA He said the purpose of this story was to show the realities of gender-based violence, particularly in rural areas. “This story portrays how men have lost their sense of humanity and how everything ends up connecting together. This story is fictional but relates to realities in our societies.” Another story that tackles violence is Itekisi elibomvu (a red taxi). “The story revolves around rape. A woman was raped by a taxi driver and fell pregnant. She decided not to abort the baby. Unfortunately, due to the damage in her womb, she cannot conceive anymore. Years later, she gets married. Little did she know her husband is her rapist. As times goes by, her husband pressurises her to have children. She is forced to tell her husband a red taxi’s driver raped her and caused injuries to her womb, therefore she cannot conceive. Then her husband recalls everything.” He wrote the story to warn men that whatever they do to women has a way of coming back. “I used rape because it’s one of the common crimes. The story intends to show men out there you reap what you sow. It might not be now, but it’s bound to come back,” he said. Lwazi’s book is available on Amazon, at Adams & Griggs in Durban and bookstores countrywide.
