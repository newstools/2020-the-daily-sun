A MAN accused of raping teenagers and young women applied for bail in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga yesterday. The 38-year-old man’s lawyer, Bheki Silubane, argued the man should be granted bail, which was denied by the court. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba ruled that the accused be held in police custody until next Thursday. Prosecutor Edith Nemukula told the court the accused is facing serious schedule six offences: seven counts of rape, as well as assault, robbery and armed robbery charges. Colonel Donald Mdluli confirmed the victims were raped around Sand River, Ireagh, Cunningmore and Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. “Police believe his arrest will somehow bring relief to many victims and justice will be served.” He wouldn’t rule out the possibility of adding more charges. “He’s also expected to appear in the Graskop Magistrates Court on 15 November,” said Mdluli.
