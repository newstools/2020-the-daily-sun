THE much-anticipated bail application judgment of pastor Timothy Omotoso in the Port Elizabeth High Court, has been postponed due to the coronavirus. The court was closed for decontamination soon after it emerged that one of the court orderlies who was working at the criminal courts during the week had tested positive for Covid-19. Members of the public and members of the legal fraternity could not enter the building as security refused anyone entry into the building. Judiciary spokesman Nathi Mncube said: “All court orderlies responsible for guarding awaiting trial detainees at the Port Elizabeth High Court are in self-quarantine due to a Covid-19 incident with one of the court orderlies. “As a result, all criminal cases are going to be postponed to Friday, 30 October in the absence of the accused. Civil cases and other operations of the court are not affected,” he said. Omotoso’s lawyer Peter Daubermann said: “The matter has been postponed to 4 November because Omotoso is in self-quarantine until Monday. Both bail applications and the main trial will commence then.” Omotoso has been in custody since his arrest at the Port Elizabeth International Airport in 2017. His co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho are out on bail. The trio is facing charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. Over the past three weeks, Judge Phillip Zilwa has listened to points raised by the Omotoso legal team. The first application was on the delay of the trial and the second application was the bail application based on new facts. During the three weeks, Omotoso’s legal team and the state called various witnesses to take the stand. Last Friday, both parties delivered their arguments.
