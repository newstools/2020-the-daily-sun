KAIZER Chiefs new head coach Gavin Hunt believes the Premier Soccer League will be weaker without Pitso Mosimene! The former Mamelodi Sundows mentor dominated the league winning five league title with the club in eight seasons with the club resigned last month. Mosimane joined Egptians giants Al Ahly, that move saw the club roping Steve Komphela to work with Manqoba Mngqithi and Rulani Mokwena as coaches. Hunt believes the league lost a big fish in Mosimane. talking at the MTN8 virtual press conference on Thursday Hunt said: “I think the league is weaker..." "Because you’re losing the fantastic expertise of a fantastic coach who’s done a good job. So I think the league is certainly‚ for me‚ weaker. However, Hunt made it clear that he does not think that Sundowns will be weaker, they still got coaches who are capable and knows the job. He added: "It doesn’t mean that Sundowns are weaker. They’ve certainly strengthened their technical department, they have guys who know. “And most important thing is they have the squad of players who can play all different formats in different ways. “But ja‚ certainly the league is weaker and not better off by him leaving‚ that’s for sure.“He’s gone to a great opportunity and I wished him well‚ and sent him a message. Great challenge." Hunt who joined Chiefs replacing Ernst Middendorp will begin his stint at Naturena with a tricky clash against Maritzburg United in the MTN8 quartefinals on Sunday at FNB Stadium. Hunt said he is expecting "Look, I don't see them (Maritzburg) being any different they will still be competitive, they had a great season last year. "They did well from being a relegation team a year before, I don't expect anything different. They done very well against Kaizer Chiefs in the last couple of season I know what to expect."
