I HAVE often heard that when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade, right? Simply put, we deal the cards life serves us, and taking a sip of lemonade or lemon juice can prove to be fruitful. Lemons, especially lemon juice, is good for you. Paying closer attention to men, lemon juice, according to experts, is good for your 4-5. The nutrients in this juice, including vitamin C and folate, help boost fertility. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, helping to prevent or reduce damage to cells in the body. Getting adequate amounts of vitamin C through lemon juice and other foods in the diet may improve male fertility. According to the US Department of Agriculture, one fluid ounce of lemon juice provides almost 12 milligrams of vitamin C. Seminal plasma, or fluid that mixes with sperm during ejaculation, contains a high concentration of vitamin C. In other words, the consumption of vitamin C can help prevent damage to sperm cells by increasing the amount of antioxidants in semen. So the next time he orders some lemon juice, ask them to make it a double.
