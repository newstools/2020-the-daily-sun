THE Animal Anti-Cruelty League has issued a stern warning to communities to stop “prostituting” their dogs for money by cross-breeding them. This after a four-year-old pit bull mauled its owner on Monday night in Port Elizabeth. The league said this incident should be an eye opener as kasi residents are continuing to breed dangerous dogs. Captain Sandra van Rensburg said: “It is alleged that on Monday at about 9:30pm the deceased and her husband (66), residing in Summerville Street, Morningside, were leaving their house. “The deceased Belinda Jonker had difficulty getting into the car. While her husband was busy assisting her, their four-year-old pit bull attacked her. “Her husband tried to get the dog off but was unable to assist his wife. After he called for help from the neighbours, they managed to remove the dog and tied him to a tree. “She sustained several wounds and was declared deceased on the scene. Animal Anti-Cruelty League was called to remove the dog from the house. An inquest was opened and is under investigation,” she said. Animal Anti-Cruelty League inspector Beverly Rademeyer said: “I have 20 years in this business but I never seen something like this where people prostitute their dogs to make money. “They cross-breed these dogs with hunting dogs. Then these dogs stop being home animals. They become wild dogs that are bred for fighting.” She said each and every dog has different brain cells. “The behaviour and way of thinking of a Jack Russell is different from a pit bull. But residents just cross-breed them with any dog in front of them to make money. “In kasis I’ve heard there are people who are selling puppies of the pit bulls. I was told that one of the sellers sells puppies with cuts ears and that makes these dogs so vicious,” said Rademeyer. “We don’t know what led the dog to attack its owner. Dexter, a male dog, has been with this family since he was a puppy. But we are going to put down him because he is a danger to society,” she said.
