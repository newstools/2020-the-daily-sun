RESIDENTS from Mfuleni said law enforcement demolished their stalls which they used for vending, despite having permission to build them. The incident happened on School Street on Wednesday afternoon. Angry residents told Daily Sun they were allowed by a law enforcement official to put up those stands. “Our stalls were here for the past two weeks, we were given permission by a law enforcement official to put up the stands. He said we should not build shacks, and said stands did not have any problem at all. “Surprisingly they demolished our stands, we cannot sell our stuff here when it’s windy because of too much sand in this area,” said resident Sinovuyo Mhlauli (48). A group of law enforcement officials demolished the stands and shacks that were built in the area and loaded the material onto a truck. Residents said though some shacks have been demolished at the same time with their stands, they knew erecting shacks is illegal. “When someone erects a shack they do it at their own risk because if law enforcement come around they will obviously destroy it. “Our stalls had been allowed to stand as long as they don’t have roofs on them. All of a sudden the heartless cops demolished them, leaving us with no place to do our business,” said another resident, Nomathemba Mayoyo (29). Residents could not provide the name of the officer who had given them permission to erect the stalls. The City of Cape Town confirmed that an operation was conducted in Mfuleni on School Street but said they are not aware of people being given permission to erect stalls. The municipality said eight half-built structures were demolished. Four were demolished between existing structures and another half-built structure on the side of the road in the same street. “I have no knowledge of any officer who gave permission to build structures on City of Cape Town property,” said Harold Jackie Peter from the City of Cape Town.
