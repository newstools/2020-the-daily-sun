HE got scared when he heard about Covid-19. So he decided to make shoes that would help him social distance. Now Hendrick Chebanga (32) from Dilopye in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, wears his one-metre long shoes when he goes to the shops. He said the name of his shoes were Covid-19. “They are made of plastic and rubber. They look like zinc, but they are actually comfortable,” he said. Hendrick said many people loved his shoes and some even posed for pictures with him.  “People always ask me who made the shoes and if they are not heavy to walk around in,” he said. “You can ride a bicycle in them and walk long distances, but you can’t drive wearing these shoes.” Hendrick said it took him a week to make his unique shoes. “God gave me talent and when something happens in the country, I reflect on it through art. I have made helicopters, statues and cars,” he said. He advised people to use their talents. “Art is around us and when one is an artist, they can create anything that can even generate money from it.” Hendrick said people could order the shoes from him. “They can contact me. I hope people will start wearing such shoes as it will be easier to practice social distancing. We don’t have to depend on marks and signs on the floor to do that.”
