She always tells me to keep quiet when I state my opinion.” He claimed his woman abuses him emotionally. Sugar mama Ermelina Sithole, a street vendor, said: “He’s childish and there’s nothing he can tell me. I’m getting tired of this man.” She threatened to break the SunTeam’s camera. Neighbours said they were worried by the way the sugar mama treated Ishmael. “He’s always complaining about the way she illtreats him and makes him feel less of a man,” said one neighbour.
