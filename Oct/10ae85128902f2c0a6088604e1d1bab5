RESIDENTS have warned Police Minister Bheki Cele they will go toe-to-toe with amaberete officers if they don’t toe the line. According to the people of Qumbu and Tsolo in the Eastern Cape, members sent to the area to deal with business robberies and stock theft have been abusing them. They told Daily Sun the officers stormed into their houses in the middle of the night wearing balaclavas and breaking doors. Sipho Nqiwa said members of the Amampondomise nation were ready to defend themselves if the government didn’t intervene. Sipho said the officers beat him in front of his family. The residents claimed five people had been killed by the officers since the beginning of this year. They included Majolandile Mcelu and Zolile Cina.  However, Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said the allegation that five people had been killed by the officers was untrue. “An investigation has to be done to prove the veracity of such allegations,” he said. Kinana said police management was aware of a march held in the Qumbu CBD where Amampondomise demanded the officers leave the area. “Previously, an appeal was made to the local communities to report the alleged incidents for investigation. All the cases were reported and are being attended to by Independent Police Investigative Directorate,” he said. The angry Amampondomise are also calling for the removal of Qumbu Police Station commander Colonel Mavala Feke. The SunTeam recently visited the area and spoke to youth from Nontyankashe, Small Farm and Ngxotwe villages. They said amaberete were behaving like apartheid police and had traumatised them. They said they even assaulted elderly people in their villages.
