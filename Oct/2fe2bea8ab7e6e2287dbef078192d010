WOMEN and kids in Mzansi get killed daily. Akasia cops are concerned about increased gender-based violence and femicide incidents despite there being awareness. A woman was recently shot and killed by a lover, who later turned the gun on himself. The incident took place in the Park Crescent Complex in Orchards, north of Tshwane, on Wednesday. Photos and videos of the incident circulated on social media: the couple can be seen lying in a pool of blood. He gasps while people take videos.  “He shot himself in the head and shot the woman on the body. I’m not sure if the face is also shot. He’s dying. He must die – minus one problem,” says a man recording the video.  Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said police were alerted to the shooting and responded swiftly. “On arrival, police discovered the female had been shot in her upper body and the man was alleged to have shot himself in the upper body,” he said. He said emergency services was contacted and, on arrival, certified the woman dead at the scene. “They transported the boyfriend for medical attention at a nearby hospital, where he succumbed to the injuries on arrival.” He said murder and inquest cases had been opened with Akasia police for further investigation.
