The 28-year-old is now a music, dance and acting teacher at Sizwe sa Batsha Community Theatre Group in Zola, Soweto. His life of crime started when he was seven. “I stole from the staff room during assembly, and at break time I’d take other pupils to town to steal sweets and biscuits.” He did bad things because he believed his mum didn’t love him. He said: “Whenever I asked my mum for anything, she never had money, but went the extra mile for my sister, who even knew her bank card pin number. Yamkela was convinced she didn’t love him and the best way was to hustle. He started a gang when he was seven and was bust for housebreaking the next year. He was bust again in 2009 when he was 17. Becaue he’d committed the same crime more than once, he was sentenced to 15 years, six of which were suspended. “Going to prison as a teenager is tough and I nearly joined two powerful rival gangs,” he said. “They fought to win me over, but I refused to join them. I wanted to be rehabilitated.” He attending school and did grade 10 until grade 12. “I attended counselling. I ended up doiing adult basic education and training in jail. “I was also a singer in the male choir and organised spiritual, educational, traditional and sports events.” Yamkela is in negotiations with Alex FM to present a new show about rehabilitating of ex-cons. “I’m ready to use my personal life to inspire those who need change.” Adjusting to the outside world wasn’t easy. People associated him with his old life. He’s working on his relationship with his mum Noluvo Xuba (58). They’ve forgiven each other.
