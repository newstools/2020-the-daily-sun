A DRIVER died and other people, including the suspect, survived with serious injuries after a high-speed chase between cops and a suspected criminal went wrong. The suspect crashed into three other vehicles. The accident happened on the R37 Burgersfort Road between Polokwane and Lebowakgomo in Limpopo. The Highway Patrol Unit were this morning at around 8am allegedly chasing a Toyota Quantum that was being driven recklessly along the Polokwane by-pass. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the vehicle joined the R37 towards Burgersfort and immediately after passing Polokwane Smelters, the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with three other vehicles travelling towards Polokwane. “The Quantum was transporting illicit cigarettes. The driver of one of the vehicles died on the scene. His wife, the suspect who is a foreign national and the occupants of the other two vehicles were taken to hospital with serious injuries,” Mojapelo said. Cases of culpable homicide and possession of illicit cigarettes have been opened and police investigations are continuing.
