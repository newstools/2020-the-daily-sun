THEY say the number of people becoming sangomas is on the rise. They’re misled by fake sangomas who want to milk them of their money. Members of Bathwali Bemithi Traditional Healers gathered in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Wednesday for their yearly meeting. They made arrangements to go up to the mountains to ask for help. Their leader, Gogo Rebone Tshabalala-Moloki, said the increase in cases of women and child abuse, human trafficking and fake sangomas using body parts were all signs the ancestors had turned their backs on people. She said: “By going up to the mountain, we want to plead with the ancestors to forgive the nation and plead for health after the loss of lives to the coronavirus.” They also wanted to restore sangomas’ dignity. She said they’re often dismissed as demons because fake sangomas take advantage of people. Co-ordinator Gogo Sheila Ngwenya said fake sangomas and prophets lie for money.  “People in desperate need go to consult and are told they have a calling,” said Ngwenya. “When they leave ukuthwasa they don’t know how to treat patients or appease and connect with the ancestors.”  Co-ordinator Phumelele Nyathela urged people to use sangomas with legitimate certificates and do background checks. Said Nyathela: “Parents should take care of their children when they suspect they have a calling. She encouraged youngsters to rather further their studies after their ukuthwasa training is complete.
