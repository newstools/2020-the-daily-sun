EMOTIONS have been running high in Mandela Village. Babyfaced gangsters went on the rampage in the village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. Siblings Themba Mahlangu (34) and Vincent Mabena (19) were attacked and stabbed to death by the gang of four in the early hours of Sunday morning.   Emily Ndala (65) said she was still struggling to accept that her two sons were gone. Emily said she hoped the culprits would rot in jail. She said: “Themba was attacked in front of my gate. We heard everything. His elder brother Thabo went outside to check what was happening “He and Vincent chased the boys away. Vincent grabbed one, but the boy stabbed him twice. He died on arrival in hospital. “The gang continued to attack Themba, stabbing him many times. His back was full of knife holes. I’m now left with the burden of raising his three kids.” Her surviving son, Thabo, said he’d just returned from a nearby tavern when the incident occurred. Apparently, the gang wanted to rob Thabo as well, but he fought back. Colonel Donald Mdluli said two murder cases were opened. “Two suspects aged 17 and 19 appeared in court and their cases were postponed to Tuesday,” said Mdluli. The cops spokesman didn’t believe the killings were gang-related.
