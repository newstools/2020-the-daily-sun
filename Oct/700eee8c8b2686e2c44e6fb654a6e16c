THE man went to the shack and demanded R350 owed to him. But Emmanuel Mabunda (43) didn’t have it. He was shot in an alley between shacks in Ramaphosa squatter camp in Cape Town on Sunday. The dead man’s lover, Siyabonga Mpila (25), believed the man is a mashonisa. She didn’t know where he lived and he was no friend of Emmanuel’s.

Siyabonga, who’s seven months pregnant, said their kid would grow up without a dad because of a skollie. Siyabonga’s cousin, Zizipho Gwakubana (23), said she’d do everything to support her cousin. “It’s hard to lose the father of your child when you’re expecting. I know Siyabonga is going through a tough time and I’ll try to be there for her,” she said. A resident saw the man talking to Emmanuel, but didn’t think he’d shoot him. “I was going to church when I saw them outside his shack,” he said. “The man is a mashonisa who operates around Philippi and Nyanga. I have a friend who borrowed money from him in January.” ALSO READ: KHAYA DLADLA GETS ENGEGED!
