GORDON Igesund has clarified the joint-coaching practice at Mamelodi Sundowns and reckons it can work for them. Sundowns introduced Steve Komphela as "senior coach" to join joint-coaches - Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena, following the sudden departure of Pitso Mosimane who has since joined Al Ahly in Egypt. Neil Tovey and Miguel Gamondi have had success in the 2005-06 PSL season by winning the championship, which has given Igesund a glimmer of hope in this new practice. Even though he is not a fan of it himself, but the former Bafana Bafana coach believes this practice needs a clear understanding from the coaching staff involved. Speaking to Daily Sun's Sports-Talk, Igesund says the situation at Mamelodi Sundowns is a unique exercise that will need to be treated with caution and a collective agreement be reached. Listen to what he has to say:  Steve Komphela starts work tomorrow at Mamelodi Sundowns as a First Team Coach. Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena remain Head Coaches. So basically, Steve will be the assistant, and it is understood he is happy to report to Manqoba and Rhulani. Very interesting this one. pic.twitter.com/wTfw9BcRFg  BREAKING! @Masandawana have confirmed that @komphelasteve will be joining the @OfficialPSL League Champions as Assistant Coach to Manqoba Mngqithi & Rhulani Mokwena. #Komphela penned this letter to @goldenarrowsfc1 confirming his departure from the club #SABCNews. pic.twitter.com/4qTTEbJvvE  Steve Komphela - senior coach Manqoba Mngqithi - head Coach Rhulani Mokwena - head coachSomeone explain to me how that works?
