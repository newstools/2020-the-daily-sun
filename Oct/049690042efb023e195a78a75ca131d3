POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has officially launched the new Ipid toll-free number. The launch was held during a media briefing at the government’s communications office in Tshwane yesterday. Cele said the number was aimed at centralising Ipid’s communication system. He said it would deal with misconduct by the police, death in custody, rape, torture and assault. Cele said anyone would be able to call the number at any time. “It’s a bold move that aims to serve the people of this country.” He said citizens could phone 0800 111 696 at any time to have direct access to the directorate, ensuring accountability in the police service. The minister said Ipid was committed to justice and the public interest. “While I’m confident that the majority of the men and women in blue are good, hard working, dedicated and honest officers, some of our own disgrace us by their actions,” he said. Cele urged Mzansi to use the number responsibly. “Report officers who sleep on duty, report officers who turn away victims of gender-based violence and domestic violence at police stations, and report officers who abuse state resources and state vehicles,” said the minister. “Report officers who harass and intimidate citizens. Report officers who aid in the sale of drugs and protect drug dealers and report all forms of corruption by officers.” Ipid’s executive director, Jennifer Nlatseng, said: “Any case relating to misconduct, we’re ready to investigate.”
