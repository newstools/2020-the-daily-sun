TS Galaxy will finally make their PSL debut on Sunday (3.30pm) when they tackle fellow rookies, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), in their opening DStv Premiership match at Thohoyandou Stadium in Venda. Ironically, both teams gained their PSL status via the boardroom. Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi bought the franchise of Highlands Park, while TTM boss Masala Mulaudzi purchased Bidvest Wits. The two owners have been busy in the transfer market, buying quality players to ensure they don’t taste top flight football for just one season. Galaxy players are excited they will, at last, make their debut on Sunday, while TTM tasted top flight football last weekend when lost 3-2 in the MTN8 to SuperSport United. Galaxy midfielder Given Msimango said they are ready for the challenge that lies ahead. “We have put in a lot of effort towards this game from day one since the integration of Highlands and TS Galaxy. Everyone has put in a good shift in the training ground. I think the way we prepared will pay off in the game,” said Msimango. Galaxy defender Bevan Fransman said: “We have to be competitive this season. We don’t want to fight relegation, so we definitely have to compete with best teams, starting with the TTM game.”
