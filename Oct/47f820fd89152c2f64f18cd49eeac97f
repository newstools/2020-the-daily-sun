ACTION-STARVED Mzansi boxing stars Thulani “Tulz Evolution” Mbenge and Xolisani “Nomeva” Ndongeni are set to headlined the TLB Boxing Promotions’ punchy return to the ring. Mbenge, the reigning Boxing South Africa male boxer of the year, will cross swords with Congolese opponent Katembo Kuvesa, while his homeboy will face off against Prince “The Demon” Dlomo. The eight-bout boxing feast will take place at Klipspruit Multi-purpose Centre in Soweto on 17 October. A TLB showdown that will feature a African Boxing Union (ABU) welterweight championship will be the first boxing event to be staged in SA shores since the Covid-19 outbreak six months ago. Both former International Boxing Organisation title-holders have not seen any action for more than a year. The pair were scheduled to fight earlier this year but their contest was cancelled due to coronavirus. Ndongeni was billed to fight in America, while Mbenge was scheduled to oppose Kuvesa in March. TLB Boxing Promotions co-director Lehlohonolo Ledwaba said they are elated about the boxing return. “As TLB Promotions, we are very happy that finally we’re back in action, especially with the much-waited clash between Mbenge and Kuvesa. We are looking forward to those exciting eight bouts. “It would be interesting to see how the main bout would pen out. Mbenge came from a long lay-off after losing his IBO crown and on other side, Kuvesa is on a journey to establish himself in the Africa continent,” said Ledwaba. The former IBF champion said the sad news though is that fans won’t be able to see their boxing stars in action, because the event will be behind closed doors as part of Covid-19 protocols. “That’s the sad situation for now but we are hoping Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa will allow us to have fans in the near future,” he said.
