EARLY indications are that a revolution is coming together at Kaizer Chiefs under Gavin Hunt. But victory against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday will not only bring Amakhosi an immense source of pride, but it will gain Hunt more support from the fans. Make no mistake. Hunt went into his first match - the MTN8 Cup quarterfinal against Maritzburg - under pressure to get everyone behind his new project and vision. Yes, the Team of Choice are not necessarily PSL powerhouses, yet greater enthusiasm from the 2-1 win cannot be ignored. Amakhosi suffered two defeats at the hands of Maritzburg last season, one of the losses eventually costing them the league. Pity the fans were not there to ramp up the atmosphere and give him a rapturous reception for his first match at FNB Stadium on Sunday. However, the performance suggested the team is taking a different direction. But the real test is this weekend when fierce rivals Mamelodi Sundowns visit FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). The pain of losing the league title to the Brazilians still rankles for the Soweto giants. The Fifa transfer ban, a list of injured players as well as fitness issues meant Hunt has to continue getting the best out of some highly talented, yet underperforming players. Sundowns are teeming with talent, having signed as many as 11 players, in addition to the treble-winning side, without losing any of their star players so far in the current transfers. The ageing Bernard Parker has drunk from a fountain of youth while Ramahlwe Mphahlele is back in the team. Njabulo Blom earned rave reviews while Khama Billiat provided two assists for two-goal hero Yagan Sasman against Maritzburg. Could Hunt be on to something?
