AMAZION musical group eNyonini Mission is excited about their Crown Gospel Music Awards nomination. They have been nominated in the Best Gospel Amazion of the Year category. Speaking to SunBuzz, Jabulani Ntshangase said: “We were announced as part of the nominees, we are so happy. It is an honour to be recognised by such prestigious awards. Ntshangase said it was unexpected because of external factors that have affected the music industry this year. The talented producer said winning this award would mean a lot to them. “Winning this award would really mean a lot to us because it will be a reminder to us that even in the midst of the challenges that we have faced this year we were able to win something,” he said. The group, which has extensive airplay on radio stations that play indigenous gospel music, is nominated for their album Eyokumkhonza.

We did this because we wanted to bless our fans with something fresh for the Easter, but it was unfortunate that everything had to go on a standstill. “Nonetheless, it was amazing putting this masterpiece together,” he said. Jabulani also shared with SunBuzz what they hope to achieve as eNyonini Mission. “As a group that sings indigenous gospel music our plan is to promote zion gospel music and to develop previously marginalised artists of South Africa in music, theatre, film and performance. “We also hope to encourage our youth to make positive decisions and follow their dreams as well as to allow them to attain the real meaning of gospel music and importance of loving God,” he said.
