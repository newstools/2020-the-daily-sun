OSCAR Vuyisile Mgudlwa, better known as his alter ego Madluphuthu, who became an instant hit and a household name across Mzansi with his hilarious movies, is back on the small screens again. He hosts a show called On A Point Of Order. Speaking to Daily Sun about his TV comeback, Madluphuthu said he was happy to be back doing what he loves. “It’s great to be back doing what I love. The show is a humorous show that pokes fun at the things that happen in parliament,” he said. He said poking fun at our politicians was a way of finding comic relief in the midst of storms. “We’ve been going through a lot as a country, so to host such a humorous show is for me a great joy, because I get to make people laugh, which is something I love doing,” the East Rand-born entertainer said. The show airs every Wednesday at 7.30pm on Soweto TV.
