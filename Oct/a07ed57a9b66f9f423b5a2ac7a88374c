GOGO’S grandkids have stolen everything from her. They even stole the gate she used to keep thugs out. Gogo Martha Khathide ran out of hiding places and resorted to hiding her stuff under a pillow. But they found her new hiding place and made away with her snuff. The 80-year-old gogo from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, is living in fear and wants her grandkids to be taken to rehab. She’s tired of reporting them to the cops. They ran away when they heard police were looking for them. “I don’t feel safe in my house. With the gate removed, I’m a target to thugs,” she said. Gogo said her grandkids, aged 35 and 24, also stole from neighbours and kept the goods at her house before getting buyers. “This will make me a target as people will think I’m harbouring criminals.” Gogo said her daughter, who lives in Swaziland, often sends grocery money, but the groceries disappear as soon as they’re bought. “They sell the mielie meal, braai pack and canned food to get nyaope. “I sometimes go hungry because there’s nothing to cook or eat.” Gogo said her grandkids had also stolen a two-plate gas stove, microwave and chairs, and vandalised her steel kist. “I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want them to be taken to rehab. Maybe I’ll have peace of mind.” Daily Sun spoke to Gauteng Social Development, which said it would look into the matter. Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza Police Station said the grandkids were arrested often, but released by the court. “We’ll visit gogo and see how best we can help her,” said Manaka. Daily Sun spoke to Tumelo (35) and Tebogo (24), who said they regret the pain they caused their gogo. They were willing to go to rehab. “What we’re using damages our families and us. Given a chance, we won’t look back,” said Tumelo.
