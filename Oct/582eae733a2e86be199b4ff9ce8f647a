BLACK Leopards may have lost a number of their stars but their number one goalkeeper, King Ndlovu, says he is going nowhere. Those Leopards players who have left are Lesedi Kapinga, Khuliso Mudau, Thabo Matlaba and Mwape Musonda. Kapinga and Mudau joined Mamelodi Sundowns, while Matlaba signed for DStv newcomers Swallows. Musonda has joined Hatta Club from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The 27-year-old Ndlovu, who displayed fine form in helping Leopards survive relegation through the promotion/relegation play-offs, said he is happy at Lidoda Duvha. “I am not thinking of leaving Leopards,” said Ndlovu. “It is sad to lose good players. But these things happen in football all the time when the season ends. “So we have accepted it and life must go on. And as for me, I am staying put.” Ndlovu said he is also impressed by the style of play of their new Belgium-born coach, Patrick Aussems. “He (Aussems) seems like a good guy,” said Ndlovu. “But I cannot say much (about him) as we have only worked with him for a few days. But from what I have seen at training, he is a guy who knows what he is doing. He likes playing good football.” Ndlovu has also vowed that Leopards will not fight for relegation this coming season. “Next season our aim is to compete with the big guns,” he said. “We are going to surprise many teams.”
