MAHINDRA South Africa is changing the appearance of inner-city traffic. CEO of Mahindra South Africa Rajesh Gupta said in recent years, there has been a rapid growth in online retailing and general delivery services. “This has only accelerated during the lockdown, as we have become more comfortable with our new online lives and the option of ordering in,” said Gupta. The #XPREZ is based on a Mahindra KUV100 NXT K2+, which shares the best-in-class low maintenance and repair costs, as validated in the annual AA Kinsey Report. The new #XPREZ is converted at Mahindra’s Special Fitment Centre in Gauteng to panel van specifications. The conversion process includes the addition of a flat and highly durable load area in the place of a rear bench seat and two cargo nets as standard.  Mahindra also adds a safety barrier from laser-cut steel mesh between the load area and the two front occupants and a fire extinguisher as standard. The #XPREZ further retains the KUV100’s safety features, which include dual front airbags and ABS brakes with electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). The #XPREZ is fitted with Mahindra’s popular 1.2-litre mFalcon petrol engine that delivers 61 kW and 115 Nm and has a rated fuel consumption of 5.9 litres/100 km in a combined cycle. The Mahindra KUV100 NXT #XPREZ will cost R174 999.
