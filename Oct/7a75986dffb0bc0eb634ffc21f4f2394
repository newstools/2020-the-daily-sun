THE controversial vaginal glitter made by a Texas woman, Lola-Butterflie Von-Kerius, took social media by storm to a point where it sold out within days of its launch. Lola-Butterflie claims that Passion Dust intimacy capsules make vaginas “magically delicious”. The mother of three said she was inspired by a meme that she saw online that said “I don’t sweat, I sparkle”. ALSO READ: 'PUNANI CLEAVAGE' IS NOW A THING!  The pellet is designed to be inserted into the punani prior to sex “to add sparkle and flavour to your natural vaginal fluids” and to make you “magically delicious”.

It also could be ‘edible glitter’, which is sugar. “Could the plastic be a breeding ground for bacteria? Sure. I’ve seen a nasty inflammatory vaginal discharge from sand so this could be a similar set-up. “Might the little flakes of plastic produce vaginal wall granulomas (a granuloma is an inflammatory mass produced by tissue in response to a foreign body)? They could. “If it isn’t plastic and it’s sugar, well, depositing sugar in the vagina lets the bad bacteria go wild,” Dr Gunter wrote on her blog.
