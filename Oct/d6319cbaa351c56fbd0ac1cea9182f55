Mbongeni Mavuso is a nurse by profession, but also a singer. The singer, known as “Moh” in the music industry, has  dedicated his life to healing and saving others. Moh (32) from Mandeni in northern KZN, uses his voice to reach out to and heal broken souls. Moh released his Afro pop house single, Hamba Kahle, last month. He worked with Fey on vocals. Master Ngiva produced the song, which is apparently Moh’s tribute to everyone who’s lost their loved ones to the coronavirus pandemic.

Iziqhaza released three singles: Gqezu, Ubongilindela and Yukuyuku. Moh said he’s been a nurse since 2012, and that he’s fulfilled when he sees people’s health improving. Said Moh: “As a nurse I’ve seen how people have lost family members.” “It’s not a depressing song but a happy one that you can dance to.” He said the pandemic has opened eyes and affected how people do things. “We no longer wash our hands in one dish like we used to at funerals,” he said. Moh is the outreach team leader at Phoenix Clinic in Durban. He told SunBuzz: “I work in the community, where I supervise community healthcare workers and identify health needs and refer them accordingly.” Moh said he’s also a fashion designer. “I design mainly modern traditional fashion designs. My designs are guided by spirit,” he said.
