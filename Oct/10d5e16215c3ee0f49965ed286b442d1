FOR 18 years, Irvin Khoza has diligently steered the PSL ship. Under his chairmanship, the league has grown in leaps and bounds, morphing from a million into a multi-billion rand business. Since he took over the helm back in 2002, the club’s grants have increased from R1m to more than R200m a season. But whether or not he will continue in the position will be known when the league holds it’s elective congress on 11 November. Khoza announced the date for the congress, as he also shared details of the executive committee meeting this week. “There’ll be the quadrennial general meeting where there’ll also be elections for the new leadership of the PSL,” Khoza revealed. Khoza was elected unopposed in the last election, in a sign of confidence from his constituency. Despite the financial strain on football, brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, the PSL has managed to maintain their revenue streams, paying out the grants to the clubs under football suspension. “Companies are adopting austerity measures because of this challenge. Who would have thought banks would not declare dividends? That goes to show the extent of the damage brought by the coronavirus,” said Khoza. “That is why we are grateful to DStv who have come on board. It was not easy. There were two or three companies we were engaged with. But DStv came into the party as a perfect partner because we are in the same business in a way.” Khoza also expressed gratitude to the sponsors for the support during the period where they could not fixture matches due to lockdown. “For four months we continued paying the grants to the teams. Remember, these were not grants but service fees for the services rendered when teams honour fixtures. “I thank our sponsors for not demanding a discount for not funding our obligations (hosting of matches),” added Khoza.
