AMAZULU have made another BIG signing and unveiled Xola Mlambo in Durban on Monday. Mlambo was supposed to be part of 10 players Usuthu unveiled last week Monday but he had to deal with his own personal issues. However, those issues seem to have been resolved and Mlambo was unveiled at the Hilton Hotel in Durban. As always, since chairman Sandile Zungu took over as owner of club at the beginning of this month, he has been at the forefront of everything, availing himself to the media. AmaZulu have beaten TS Galaxy on Mlambo, whom Usuthu will visit at Mbombela Stadium on Wednesday, after the newbies side’s chairman Tim Sukazi was interested to sign the former Chippa United midfielder. However, SunSport sources revealed that Mlambo wasn’t happy with the offer Galaxy had tabled. Mlambo was a free agent after he was released by Orlando Pirates earlier this month along with Justin Shonga, Augustine Mulenga, Luvuyo Memela just to name but the few. The latter duo have since joined Usuthu and will be reunited with Mlambo.
