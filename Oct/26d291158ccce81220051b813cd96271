GRANT money meant for the poor ended up in the hands of thugs. On Saturday, two men were bust in Pietermaritzburg with 495 Sassa cards. Sassa regional executive manager in KZN Themba Matlou said the men were arrested in the CBD. “A car travelling from Alexandra Road extension towards the N3 was stopped near Ashburton, where suspects were bust,” said Matlou. “They were in possession of 495 Sassa payment cards, which were activated.” Matlou urged the public to report similar cases they may be aware of to the Sassa fraud line, 0800 701 701. He said new grant beneficiaries had to have a valid, active bank account as new applicants were no longer getting Sassa cards. A resident said it was very sad that poor people were not getting their money. “Many people apply, but wait a long time for the money and sometimes don’t get a cent,” said the resident. “This pandemic has left many people unemployed and they really needed grants. “Some didn’t get anything because thugs stole the money.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cops from Alexandra Road cop shop and the Pietermaritzburg K9 unit were conducting their duties when they spotted a bakkie with two occupants and stopped it on the N3. They were bust when they couldn’t explain why they had the Sassa cards. “Police also seized a licensed firearm with 19 rounds of ammunition from the driver, and his bakkie was also seized for further investigation,” said Mbele. The men, aged 44 and 51, were charged with fraud and possession of suspected stolen property and were expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court soon.
