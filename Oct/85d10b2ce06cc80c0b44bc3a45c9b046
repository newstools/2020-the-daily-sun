JOSEF Zinnbauer is quite confident the work Orlando Pirates are putting in training will eventually pay off. “It’s coming. I know it’s coming,” the Pirates coach has said confidently, ahead of the MTN8 semi-final tie against Kaizer Chiefs at Orlando Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Three matches into the season and the Buccaneers are yet to fire upfront, managing only three goals in three matches. One of the goals has taken them to the semi-finals. But without more goals, they may lose out on the spot in the final. Zinnbauer has started to sound like a stuck record, trying to explain the goal-scoring problem which has derailed Pirates, even before he arrived. Worse, his prime striker, Gabadinho Mhango, is doubtful for the first leg of the epic Soweto derby semi-final. But Zinnbauer sees things differently as he works tirelessly to give Bucs the competitive edge. “But I have no fear. I believe in the players. We have new players and we are working within the structure of what we want to achieve. “Mhango is a key player. But we have other players, Terrence Dzukamanja, Zakhele Lepasa... Vincent Pule.” Amakhosi haven’t been firing either, trying to find their feet under the guidance of new coach Gavin Hunt. But Zinnbauer has admitted that there are no advantages in a derby. Without the pressure of the supporters, who are not allowed to attend games due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the Buccaneers will have less pressure, according to Zinnbauer. But playing behind closed doors hasn’t hidden their shortcomings upfront from their fans. Zinnbauer could field yet another different line-up tomorrow, given how his starting team has changed in the last three games.
