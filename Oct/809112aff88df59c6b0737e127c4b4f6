The recent announcement by the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development – to disburse about 900 state-owned farms amounting to 7 000 hectares of land to aspiring farmers – is welcomed. Taking into consideration the devastating effects of the coronavirus, land allocation on a bigger scale will fast-track the process of land reform and act as a catalyst for economic recovery. This is also a major milestone in the agrarian reform process because it delivers on the promise of the Freedom Charter: that the land shall be shared among those who work it. The emergence of the Mooikloof Mega City infrastructure project is another example. The project will see open land in Tshwane being used for human settlement purposes. During the launch of the project, President Cyril Ramaphosa mentioned that the R84 billion project will be a catalyst for inclusive housing development. As economists, government and relevant stakeholders are finalising the economic recovery report at Nedlac, they need to do the same by coming up with a holistic economic plan, as well as reforms that will enable growth.
