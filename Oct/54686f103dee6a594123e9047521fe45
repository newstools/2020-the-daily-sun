THURSDAY night was all about Themba “Mshishi” Zwane. He made a clean sweep of all the important trophies on offer. He was called to the podium three times last night to collect three major awards – 2019-20 PSL Footballer of the Season, Absa Premiership Player’s Player of the Season and Midfielder of the Season awards. The three gongs have boosted Zwane’s bank balance with a whopping R500 000. Is it unfair to have one player scoop three awards at once? NO! Zwane deserved every award bestowed on him following an extra ordinary season that he had after having contributed 65% to Mamelodi Sundowns’ success as they defended their Premiership title. Surely all players and coaches agree as they voted for him as their top player and footballer of the season, respectively. And players were not allowed to vote for their teammate. This was Zwane’s second successive nomination for the PSL Footballer of the Season. This year he beat teammates Gaston Sirino, Peter Shalulile and Kaizer Chiefs’ Samir “Kokota Mapiano” Nurkovic. "I would like to thank my teammates, family, my sponsor Puma... the whole Sundowns family, thanks for the support and I really appreciate. I obviously feel happy because hard work pays. All the awards are important, but the most I cherish is the Footballer of the Season,” said Zwane. His coach Pitso Mosimane, who has since moved on to join Al Ahly in Egypt, was voted as Coach of the Season after his trickery tactics that saw Sundowns wrestle the PSL title from Kaizer Chiefs’ grasp in the last match of the season. This award comes with R75 000. Still in Chloorkop, Hlompho Kekana’s strike against Orlando Pirates on 20 August this year was voted by the public as the Goal of the Season. In an all Sundowns affair, Gaston Sirino went home with the Telkom Knockout (R200 000) after being voted as Player of the Tournament. Maritzburg United’s 24-year-old, Rushine De Reuck, took home the Defender of the Season having featured in all 30 matches of the club, helping keep 13 clean sheets.
