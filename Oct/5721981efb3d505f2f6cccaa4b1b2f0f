 I’m not against anyone exercising their rights, but I have a problem when the person’s rights erase accountability. I’m referring here to former president Jacob Zuma, who’s been exercising his rights for almost two decades.I think it is time the South African justice system proves a point – to see who’s bigger between it and Msholozi. What Zuma is seeking is absolutely ridiculous.He just wants to delay the Zondo Commission, just like he delayed the arms deal case.What’s made him change his mind about Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo?Only two years ago, Zuma sang a different tune about the state capture inquiry chairman.South Africans are tired of his time-buying exercise.Letter by Bushy Green Kagiso
