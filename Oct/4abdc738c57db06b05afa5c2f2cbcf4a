Some women have lost respect and manners. They swim in liquor just like fish. It’s a fact, many women lose self-control and become immoral after a few drinks. I’ve seen many drunk women at taverns having sex in the toilets with drunk men. There’re also mothers who sell their daughters to older men for sex to get money to buy booze. It’s also not unusual to see pregnant women drinking. Alcohol is dangerous to their unborn babies. How are children going to respect them if women don’t have respect for themselves? Women should start looking at this differently and change their ways.
