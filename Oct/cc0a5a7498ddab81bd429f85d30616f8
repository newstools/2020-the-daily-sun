AmaZulu Football Club are evoking the “Rebirth of the Warrior” with their new official Umbro kit for the DSTV Premier Soccer League season. The club officially unveiled their new kit at The Zunguness in the KZN Midlands on Monday. Their new home and away jerseys are inspired by a Zulu spear print design that pays homage to the Zulu warriors of Isandlwana and the fighting spirit of AmaZulu F.C. In the battle of Isandlwana, Zulu warriors armed with spears defeated the invading British army who were armed with superior weapons. The bold emerald green home jersey features Zulu spears cascading downwards from the neck of the jersey capturing the essence of the modern-day warrior on the football field. Designed to be the new armor of Usuthu players for the new season, the jerseys are also constructed from innovative lightweight materials to provide players with ultimate athletic mobility. “The historical reference that has inspired this kit is relevant to the mantra of Usuthu. The club has players who are warriors and who fight till the very end,” says new AmaZulu President and owner Sandile Zungu.
