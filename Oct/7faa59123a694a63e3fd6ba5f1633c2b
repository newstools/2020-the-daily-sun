DURBAN-BASED artists took a stand against gender-based violence today. Artists like L’vovo Derrango, DJ Sox, Tzozo, Danger, Babo Ngcobo, Naima Kay, Sgwili Zuma, Bullistic and many more marched on KwaMashu streets, north of Durban, saying enough is enough while raising awareness about the murders of women and children. Crime is rising in KwaMashu, where four-year-old Minenhle Mhlongo was found dead last month after allegedly being raped and killed by her 15-year-old relative. Meanwhile, two young women were found dead in the bushes in KwaMashu last week. Another two women were found dead in KwaDabeka kasi, next to KwaMashu, on Monday.

They held placards, demanding killers and abusers stop what they are doing. They also visited little Minenhle’s family in KwaMashu to mourn with them and they gave them groceries. In the march, they were joined by KZN Economic Development MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, eThekwini Municipality speaker Weziwe Thusi and CCIFSA president Joy Mbewana. Leader of the march Thokozani “Tzozo” Zulu told Daily Sun that as artists they decided to have their voices heard to end the murders of women and children. “We chose KwaMashu because it is the township that seems to be number one in Durban with this nonsense killing of women and children. We hope that people will hear us as artists and stop what they are doing. “If we unite, this killing and rape pandemic can be easily stopped. We encourage people to be whistle blowers,” he said. DJ Sox told Daily Sun: “We want to tell anyone who is doing it, or planning to do it, to stop it. There is a better life without this killing and abuse, he said.
