WHEN Sipho Sibanyoni’s girlfriend told his mum she was going to kill him on Saturday, she thought it was a joke. But the 31-year-old from Mountainview, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, was later stabbed to death with a broken bottle, allegedly by his girlfriend. The woman spoke to Sipho’s mum after he’d not returned home the previous night. She later found him sleeping under a tree outside a tavern. She allegedly took a broken bottle and stabbed him in the back of his neck. Sipho tried to run back home, but collapsed and died in the street a few hours later. The girlfriend was arrested. READ: BEWARE OF WIDOWS IN INZILO Sipho’s mum, Bafunani (48), said she spoke to the girlfriend while they were returning from a baby shower in Springs, Ekurhuleni, in a taxi. “She told me she was going to kill my son. I then asked her to first join a burial society,” said Bafunani. She said Sipho and the girlfriend had been together on and off since 2008. She said they often fought and her son told her the woman became violent during arguments. Bafunani said residents told her they saw the girlfriend stabbing Sipho. She said she wanted justice for her son and for the woman to rot in jail. Colonel Donald Mdluli said a case of murder was opened. “A 31-year-old woman has been arrested and will appear in court today for murder.”
