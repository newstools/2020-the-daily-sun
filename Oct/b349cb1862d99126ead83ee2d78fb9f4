In his letter published on Wednesday, Thabo Lekwale said a mouthful regarding MK veterans. These guys and the ANC claim to have liberated us, which isn’t true. During the tough times of the apartheid era, these so-called MK veterans skipped the country to seek refuge in neighbouring states. We stayed behind under tough, harsh apartheid laws. We were subjected to all sorts of harassment, but didn’t run away. Instead, we endured the pain and tough laws of apartheid. It was only after Nelson Mandela was released from prison that things improved. We negotiated with the apartheid government to allow the exiles to return home. Today they claim to have liberated us, which isn’t true. Which war did they win against apartheid? The ANC must stop claiming it liberated us. They’re not telling the truth.
