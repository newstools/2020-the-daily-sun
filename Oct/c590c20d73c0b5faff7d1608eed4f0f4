PEOPLE normally decide what to eat. But this isn’t something the Baloyis can do as poverty often forces them to eat wild greens. The four brothers live in a collapsing five-roomed house in Bridgeview, near Hammanskraal in Tshwane, and are forced to use dirty water from a nearby stream for cooking. The eldest, William (42), told Daily Sun when they didn’t have seshebo to eat with pap, they cooked veggies from the bush.  He said no one in the family works. His dad died in 2016 and his mum earlier this year. He described his dad’s death as a major blow. “We’re appealing for help as we’re living under difficult conditions,’’ he said. According to William, his dad died and left them with an incomplete house. “My plea is for help to fix our house and a donation of food. We’re suffering.” His brother Simon (38) said being unable to live like other people was tough. “When it rains we sleep outside as water gets inside the house,” he said. “Rats bother us, some as big as cats. They eat our food and even our clothes.” Local Sanco chairman, Jeffrey Nyathikazi, said: “We’re appealing to businesspeople and individuals to donate food parcels and to help build the family a better house.” Jeffrey also asked for help to find the brothers jobs. Community leader, Gilbert Mabasa (41), said he’d known the family for almost 30 years. “These people need help. I hope someone can intervene in their situation,” he said. City of Tshwane administrator Mpho Nawa said: “Please send me their contacts so that we can see how the family can be helped.”
