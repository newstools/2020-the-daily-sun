OWETHU Mdlalose was found lying in a pool of blood inside a bedroom at home. Her body was riddled with stab wounds and she had succumbed to her injuries. While the family from Newcastle, south of KZN, was still shocked about the discovery and worried about who might have been behind the murder of the 11-year-old girl, Thamsanqa Cele vanished into thin air. Now, KZN cops need help in finding Cele as they believe he could assist them in the investigation of Owethu’s tragic death.
