A SCOOTER rider refused to be stopped by traffic cops and ended up in a coma. He caused an accident that involved 10 cars on a New Taipei City highway. In the video, the scooter rider can be seen riding on the highway when cops tried to pull him over for driving the scooter on the highway, which is prohibited. Following that the rider suddenly swerved to the far-right lane of the highway and slowed down fast. He was then knocked off after the scooter was hit by a small truck.
