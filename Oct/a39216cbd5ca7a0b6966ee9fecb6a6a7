TS Galaxy coach Dan Malesela says he was surprised that Kaizer Chiefs changed their traditional style of play under coach Ernst Middendorp last season. Malesela revealed during the South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA) Zoom meeting that Chiefs have lost their identify which attracted fans across Mzansi by playing route one football. “I have followed Chiefs since I was still at school and I have never seen them score a lot of goals through headers and set-piece, this was the first time last season," said Malesela. "Maybe somebody said to them (when they hired Gavin Hunt) 'go back to your game of entertaining people'. I am saying this because of the respect I have for Chiefs. A lot of people supported them because of the flair, not down the line, over (cross) head.” The former Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns defender says he used to have sleepless nights prior to their clash against Amakhosi. “Whenever we played Chiefs, we used to have anxiety and running stomach that’s how we feared them," added Malesela. "If we lose our style, South African football will lose big time. If Chiefs fans don’t come to the stadium it will be a huge setback. Yes, I want Galaxy to do well, but I want Chiefs up there, so is Pirates and Sundowns. Look in England, there is no noise about Man United and it's hurting English football, so we could lose the Chiefs of SA football.”
