POET Jessica Mbangeni has landed a gig with e.tv. The weekly show is called Africa in Me. The first episode was aired on Tuesday at 7.30am. In this show, she showcases different cultures from African countries. Her first guest was musician Busiswa Gqulu. “I was teaching her about Xhosa regalia. This means I had to dress her up in Xhosa clothes. As a Xhosa woman she must understand what each piece of clothing means, when and how to wear it,” said Jessica. She said she chose Busiswa because they easily connect. “I’ve known Busiswa for some time and she initially approached me to assist her with Xhosa regalia for her upcoming song, Umakazi. At that time I already had the Africa in Me concept. I then invited her to be part of my show,” said Jessica. The show will also see guests such as musician Nothembi Mkhwebana and Ester Mahlangu from the Ndebele culture, Ntombifuthi “Nomakhisimsi” Ncwayiba from Mpondo culture, Latozi “Madosini” Mpahleni and Tu Nokwe.

She told Daily Sun that the show will also show African cuisine. “This show is not necessarily South African but it will cover all African cultures including their food, musical instruments and languages, to name a few. “For example, as a Xhosa woman I shall be preparing some Xhosa foods whereas my colleagues from other cultures will prepare their different kinds of foods,” she said. According to Jessica, the aim of the show is to integrate African cultures and to enhance tourism on the African continent.
