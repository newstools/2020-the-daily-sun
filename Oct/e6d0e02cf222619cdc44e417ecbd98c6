ANOTHER PSL club has been sold? It is believed that the Sokhela family have decided to sell AmaZulu’s stakes to Sandile Zungu and the announcement is set to be made today. However, it is not clear whether the Sokhelas have sold its entire stake of the club to Zungu, who is from uMlazi and is the chairman of Zungu Investment Company. The Sokhelas are the minority shareholders at the club as they own 49 percent while the other 51 is owned by Spar. To clear all this, the club has called up a press conference (12.30pm) at Hilton Hotel where the chairman of AmaZulu Dr Patrick Sokhela and Zungu will be in attendance. But representatives from Spar are nowhere mentioned in the press release if they’ll part of the briefing. An insider has told SunSport that everyone at the club has been summoned to a meeting where general manager Lunga Sokhela will inform everybody of the new developments. “We have just been called to the meeting now and we’ll know everything from the management. All we hear is that the club has been sold and we are not sure whether the Sokhelas have sold their stakes or it is Spar who sold theirs,” said the mole. "This may come not as a huge surprise to many. Usuthu were the first club in the top flight to implement the salary cut when the season was halted due to Covid-19 pandemic in March. The insider added that it will be unfair to them as they fought so hard to save the club from relegation axe this past season in the bubble. “After all our hard work to save the team in the bubble and easily as that the club is being sold?” insider added. “We just hope some of us will be kept under the new management. But I’m told Lunga wasn’t in favour of selling, I hear it was his father (Patrick).”
