The case against kidnapping, robbery, extortion and murder accused has been postponed to Tuesday (06 October) for bail judgement. Kgaugelo Sibiya appeared before the Kabokweni Magistrates court on Monday (05 October) for the continuation of his bail application. The 19-year-old was arrested on 21 September following the murder of his 14-year-old cousin, Zinhle Sekgoapa. The teenager was reported missing on 17 September after her parents received strange calls and messages from an unknown person demanding an amount of R86 000 as a ransom. It has emerged in court that Sekgoapa's allege kidnapping was linked to an inheritance left by the suspect's grandmother. Investigating Officer, Sergeant Joseph Mnisi indicated that Sibiya's grandmother at her time of her passing left an inheritance at which the suspect and victim had to benefit from. Mnisi said each of them were to be given an amount of R140000 after they turned 18 years. "Money was a motive behind the committing of these offenses," he said Mnisi said should the victim be released on bail he would continue to commit more similar crimes in order to get the money. Meanwhile in closing, the defense told the court their client was a suitable candidate to be granted bail. Advocate Sipho Mashele told the court that they have proof that the reasons why they want to push bail is based solid on the fact that the (Family) want his client out of the picture so that they can be able to enjoy his inheritance.
