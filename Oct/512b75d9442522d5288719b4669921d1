NATIONAL Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole has expressed his condolences to the family of a murdered Eastern Cape Amabarete member during a cash in transit robbery on Monday night in Tsolo. Colonel Brenda Muridili said: “The 41-year-old Sergeant Mzoxolo Gxothani, attached to the East London Tactical Response Team, was on duty with his colleagues when they responded to a CIT robbery that had just taken place at Dangwana in Port St Johns. “The TRT members pursued and cornered the suspects’ vehicle in Tsolo, near Mhlakulo area. A shootout between the suspects and police ensued in which the sergeant sustained fatal gunshot wounds to his upper body. The suspects then managed to flee the scene with an undisclosed amount of money they had allegedly stolen following the bombing of an armoured cash van. “The province has already mobilised the necessary resources to track down the perpetrators as per the 72-Hour Activation Plan,” she said. The national commissioner has directed the province to also afford the family of the deceased member the necessary support through their time of bereavement and beyond. “It is always sad to learn of the falling of a police officer at the hands of ruthless criminals. The province has assured me that they will not rest until we arrest and bring to book the killers of Sergeant Gxothani. My sincere condolences to his family,” said General Sitole. Cops have appealed to anyone with information to call the police. “We are appealing to anyone with information which can lead to the arrest of the suspects to call Crime Stop on 086 00 10111 or send tip-offs on the MySAPS App,” she said.
