VETERAN musician Ishmael Morabe of Roba Letheka fame is on a journey to reconnect with his old and new fans. He told Daily Sun it had been a long time since he had touched base with his fans like he used to. “I am in a better space and I want my fans to be happy and remember where we come from,” he said. Ishmael said he was in the studio mixing old hit songs such as Avulekile Amasango, Waar Was Jy and Roba Letheka. “The remix will help preserve the tracks and will have an amapiano feel. I chose amapiano because it reminds me of kwaito music,” he said. Ishmael said it was due to be released on 20 October. “I’m working with Muthaland Entertainment and Ghetto Ruff because they understand me. DJ Snetja and DJ Meggie will produce the album,” he said. Ishmael promised to revive old memories and make his fans happy.
