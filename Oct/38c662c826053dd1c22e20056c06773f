THE Hawks today arrested a 48-year-old businesswoman, Pumza Portia Gambula, who is accused of fraud and corruption in a R4.8 million Covid-19 door-to-door campaign. After her arrest, she appeared at Mthatha Magistrates Court and she was granted R20 000 bail. The case has been postponed to 30 October. Her arrest came after allegations that her company, Phathilizwi Training Institute, was allegedly paid an amount of R4.8 million for a Covid-19 door-to-door campaign. The documentation supporting that she completed the services are allegedly fraudulent. The Mthatha Magistrates Court has ordered the businesswoman to report to Madeira police station once a week, starting from this Sunday, until the case is finalised.   Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale told reporters that the intensive investigation took about three months. “The arrest follows allegations that she was paid to conduct awareness to three local municipalities within OR Tambo District Municipality. “The documentation to support that she completed the services were done so fraudulently, she is facing charges of fraud.” Mogale said the investigation is still continuing. It is alleged that Gambula claimed her company Phathilizwi Training Institute has conducted door-to-door awareness workshops on Covid-19 in different wards in Mhlontlo and Port St John’s local municipalities. Reports further alleged that she never conducted the awareness workshops.
