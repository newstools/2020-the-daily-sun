HIS 17-year-old daughter was raped, but the police allegedly dragged their feet in arresting the suspect. So the angry father took the law into his own hands and moered the suspect. He said at the time of the incident their daughter, who lives in Tembisa, was visiting them in Phumula, near Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni.

He said his daughter visited her childhood friend (13) from next door, who asked her to accompany her to fetch her earphones from some guy. “This guy told them he was going to fetch the earphones somewhere else, but he was actually fetching another rape suspect,” said the father. He said the girls came back at about 10pm, just as his wife was returning from work. “They were crying and my daughter collapsed. “She was rushed to hospital and after she was stabilised, she told us what happened,” he said. The girls’ parents then went to look for the suspects after they opened a case. “I beat the crap out of him because the police took their time to arrive when we called them to say we found the culprits,” he said.
