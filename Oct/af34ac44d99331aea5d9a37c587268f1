“IT was long overdue…” An expression from Banyana Banyana coach, Desiree Ellis, as she reacts to the clinched deal of veteran Noko Matlou with Spanish side Eibar for the 2020-21 season. The move sees the 35-year-old Moletjie-born striker-turned-defender finally realising her dream of playing overseas at her age. “She never gave up. This is one of those moves that one can broadly say it’s well deserved,” said Ellis, who led Banyana to their first Fifa World Cup in France last year. Matlou has been part of the Banyana squad since 2006 and became the first South African to be named African Women Player of the Year after scoring six goals at the 2008 African Championship. Ellis is hoping that with most of Banyana players moving overseas, their experience will be valuable for the national team She stated: “This is amazing! Since we played at the World Cup, our players have been moving abroad. I hope the experience gained there will rub off in the national team, as we have seen with Nigeria and Cameroon national teams.” Matlou joins Banyana striker Thembi Kgatlana, who also plays in Span. Matlou said: “Look back at the World Cup, Africa Women’s Championship, Cosafa Cup,” she recalls. “I’ve been looking forward to playing overseas for a long time, but here I am, getting the opportunity at an old age, I’m happy.” Talking to Eyewitness News, Matlou added: “I think I’ve done well for my country and myself, so this is the reward.”
