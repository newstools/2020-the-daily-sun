WORKERS marched yesterday, demanding to be insourced. The Municipality Labour Forum marched from Marabastad to Tshwane House to hand over their memorandum of demands. Chairman Austin Mailula said the workers were supposed to be insourced in 2011, but for years have been given empty promises. He said because of lockdown regulations, they had to ask a number of workers not to take part in the march. “Our grievance is we have been trying to engage with the administration and the city manager, but no one is recognising us,” he said. Mailula said the municipality was supposed to absorb workers contracted through a labour broker. “We need at least 4 900 workers to be insourced under the municipality,” he said. Mailula said 627 workers signed contracts in November last year and were ending off this month. “These workers were supposed to be insourced in 2011. “We want city administrator Mpho Nawa to explain why these workers were not insourced for such a long time. “We want him to tell workers when they will be insourced,” he said. Mailula said last month, the forum met municipal management about the issue and management promised to engage with them, but never followed up. “We will not allow anyone or any organisation to disturb our workers,” he said. Mailula said that they were giving the municipality five days to respond to their memorandum and if it didn’t, workers would put a stop to all municipal work until their grievances were met. Nawa said he was aware of the protest. “Marchers are receiving the necessary attention.”
