TALENTED Maritzburg United midfielder Keagan Buchanan is going nowhere! Despite talk that Buchanan might leave the Team of Choice, chairman Farook Kadodia confirmed the 29-year-old is staying on this season to complete his contract. Buchanan is in the final year of his three-year contract after joining the club at the beginning of the 2018-19 season. It is expected Kadodia will sit down with Buchanan soon to discuss new terms. Stressed Kadodia: “Buchanan will be wearing the colours of Maritzburg United this coming season.” The former Bloemfontein Celtic ace helped United finish seventh in the Premiership and reach the Telkom Knockout final last season. Maritzburg, who have parted ways with Siyanda Xulu, Gabriel Nyoni and Miguel Timm, recently bolstered their midfielder department by signing Phumlani Ntshangase on a permanent basis. The Umlazi-born midfielder spent last season on loan to the Midlands club from the now defunct Bidvest Wits. But now that his contract with Wits ended, he became a free agent. Meanwhile, the Maritzburg boss also confirmed that Lotto will remain their kit sponsorship this coming season. The English sportswear company will be kitting out Maritzburg for a third consecutive season. The brand enjoyed a lot of exposure from the team’s impressive performances in the league and Knockout last term. Maritzburg coach Eric Tinkler is hard at work getting his charges ready for the start of the new season, which is just around the corner. The Team of Choice visit Kaizer Chiefs in their MTN8 quarterfinal showdown at FNB Stadium on 18 October.
