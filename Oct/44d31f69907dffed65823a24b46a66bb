WITH news coming from Egypt that Al Ahly coach, Pitso Mosimane, is touting Kaizer Chiefs' golden boy Samir Nurkovic, social media went abuzz and vented. "The Serbian striker Samir Nurkovic, the Kaizer Chiefs striker, entered the circle of Al-Ahly’s interests, especially in light of the conviction of the new coach, Mosimane, of his abilities, as he wanted to join Sundowns at the time he took charge there, but his club management (Chiefs) refused, and the player may be the striker who will be added to the red team’s list in new season," reported alkhaleejtoday online. On Twitter, Kardie_M said: "Pitso Mosimane wa kula (Mosimane is sick), @KaizerChiefs are not selling Nurkovic." Ta Mncenge warned Al Ahly to "just stay away from Nurkovic!" Black Plain congratulated Mosimane on his new job at Africa's Club of Century, but threw caution: "Great work bra Pitso, otherwise stay away from Nurkovic." Nurkovic has been a key player for Chiefs who has been consistent in scoring goals. But it will be hard for Chiefs to release him, even if they would agree with the offer from Al Ahly, because they are still awaiting judgment from their appeal with the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS) after being banned by Fifa from signing players in the next two tranfer windows. Ayabonga wrote: "Please don't leave Chiefs piano, we love you and still expect a lot from you, and please teach those younger attacking players at Chiefs. You are the best striker. "Tiisetso Sedibane said: "Nurkovic, the best to happen to us after a longtime. We are still embracing him, and we can't sell him continentally, worse after one season. Maybe after a second season, we can be content with accepting a possibility of losing him to Europe, same with Frosler."
