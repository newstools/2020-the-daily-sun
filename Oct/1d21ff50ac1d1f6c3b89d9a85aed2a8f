WITH many events going digital to accommodate the new normal, the city of Durban is set to host a drive-in concert, which is said to be the first of its kind on the African continent. The much anticipated concert is a collective partnership between the city’s top promoters and Gagasi FM. According to the event organisers, the event is the future of outdoor festivals and the current answer to the reopening of the entertainment economy which will provide a safer way to experience outdoor events. The event will be a three-day festival with live performances by some of South Africa’s hottest artists such as Zakes Bantwini, DJ Tira and DJ Sox. Speaking to Daily Sun, Drive In committee member Kgolo Mthembu said they pride themselves in creating tailor-made events that music lovers can enjoy. “Over the past decade we as an organisation have strived to curate entertainment experiences.” ALSO READ |HIT SONG JOHN VULI GATE GOES GLOBAL While DJ Sox, who is set to performance at the event, said: “The current government regulations have crippled not just our businesses but the entire entertainment industry. “With the introduction of the Drive In Festival, operating under strict measures, we are hoping to open financial opportunities for the industry again.” Zakhele Madida, better known as Zakes Bantwini, who is also a promoter for the event, told Daily Sun they have taken all measures to ensure patrons are safe and comfortable with unlimited options of entertainment. “With large gatherings being categorised as high risk, we as the stakeholders in the entertainment space need to rethink and invent ways to make these live events work,” he said. The three-day festival will take place from 22 October until 24 October at the Greyville Racecourse. Tickets for the event will range from R500 – R1 500 and they are available online at Webtickets and at Pick n Pay Stores nationwide.
