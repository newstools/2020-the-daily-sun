THE walk from Joburg to Tshwane is always worth it. Those were the words of social activist Khutsi Malala from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane. He was taking part in his fourth annual long walk with The Clean Up Squad, in partnership with Heaven’s Defence Force, Katekani and Royal Funerals. They arrived in Soshanguve on Wednesday, where they met the community and nyaope addicts who wanted to be part of a rehab programme.

We only want users who volunteer to go to rehab and those who’re serious about getting clean and aren’t forced by their parents,” he said. Khutsi urged addicts to get their medical certificates at local clinics. “The Clean Up Squad has encouraged users interested in volunteering in the programme to call 084 984 9045, and all those who want to be part of the walk or to financially contribute to the programme to also call the number,” he said. One of the volunteers, Thabo Radebe, said he’s been using nyaope for nine years. “My peers have their own homes and families, and I’m still here using nyaope,” he said. “I’m tired of this drug and want to see myself looking handsome and being responsible. I want to make my mum proud. He said his family had tried to rehabilitate him. “I wasn’t ready to stop then, but I now want to change my life. I want to be a better person,” he said.
