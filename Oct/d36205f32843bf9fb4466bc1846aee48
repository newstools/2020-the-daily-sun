THERE was yet another postponement in the case against EFF leader Julius Malema and EFF Member of Parliament Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. This time, the postponement was due to delays by media applications to cover the proceedings. The trial, which was supposed to be heard today, was postponed to 28 and 29 October.

Over 15 media houses applied to be in the Randburg Magistrates Court, but with social distancing regulations, the magistrate wanted a minimum number of people in the court. The court initially wanted to proceed without the media due to late applications, but the defence argued that if the media won’t be given permission, it would also oppose media coverage in court when it’s their turn to give evidence. Malema and Ndlozi were in the dock for an altercation with a police officer during the funeral of mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in April 2018. Speaking to scores of supporters outside the court, Malema said: “A white man who suffered from privilege thinks he cannot be pushed and the same police are pushed everyday. “When a policeman is pushed in a situation like that, they always understand. You have to be guided by the spirit of Ubuntu and understand that when people are at a grave site, majority of them are emotional, but white people don’t know Ubuntu.” He said there are people who are owned an apology and not the other way round.

Malema lashed out at the police, saying they came to monitor their peaceful march at court, but there were no police in Senekal, where white people were burning police vans and court buildings,. He said police were quick to react when black people  gathered, but did not do the same with white people.
