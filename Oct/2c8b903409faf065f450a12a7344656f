SIX suspects were bust for raping a 13-year-old girl. The suspects, aged between 18 and 22, allegedly raped her in separate incidents between January and August this year. They were arrested after the girl’s mother laid charges against them. Captain Solomon Sibiya said the suspects were traced to their homes and arrested yesterday. “The 13-year-old victim was allegedly raped on different dates and occasions.” On 22 January, a 22-year old suspect allegedly found the victim sitting in front of her home. “He then took the victim to extension 13’s unoccupied RDP houses where he raped her. He thereafter threatened the victim with death and warned her not to tell anyone,” said Sibiya. On 15 May, two suspects, both aged 18, found the victim next to her home and took her to an abandoned RDP house in Kagiso extension 13, where they also raped her. Again on 26 June, Captain Sibiya said the victim was going to the shop when she was taken by another two suspects, aged 22 and 19, who then forced her into the same abandoned RDP house where she was raped before. On 7 July, the girl was accompanied by her brother to the shop but came back home alone. On her way back, a 20-year-old suspect took her to his shack and raped her. On 26 August, she was accosted on the street by three suspects who later took her to one accomplice’s shack. The 21-year-old accomplice ended up raping her. Sibiya said on 17 October, the victim’s mother noticed something unusual with her and questioned her thoroughly. “The victim opened up and pointed out all six suspects. She then confronted them and they confessed to having committed the crime.The matter was then reported to police. All suspects were traced and arrested.” Sibiya said a case of rape was opened at Kagiso police station and the suspects will appear in court soon. Sibiya said the case is investigated by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit.
