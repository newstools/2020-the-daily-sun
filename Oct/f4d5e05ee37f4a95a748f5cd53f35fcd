EFF leader Julius Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi are expected to appear at the Randburg Magistrates Court today for trial in their assault case. The pair allegedly assaulted a police officer during the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in April 2018. Last month, the leader of the red berets lashed out at the court for calling them to come only for the case to be postponed. He said the court was endangering their lives and the lives of the members of the public who would often want to interact with them at the court. The pair had since denied that they assaulted the officer during the confrontation at Memorial Park, where Madikizela-Mandela was laid to rest.
