According to family spokesman, EFF’s Kenny Motsamai, when Richard drove off trying to get away from the gunmen, he hit a rock, which led to his car capsizing. He said the hitmen followed him and finished him off. Motsamai said: “People owed him money and they decided they cannot pay him and hired hitmen to kill him. “He was shot 13 times in front of his house.” Richard was described as a man who helped the community. “He donated food parcels. He didn’t want to see the community suffer,” said Motsamai. He said the family wanted the people responsible arrested. “What we know is that the long arm of the law is bound to catch them. They can run, but they can’t hide. We want justice,” he said. He said Richard fought for the liberation of the country and was also badly injured during dark days of apartheid. Motsamai said Richard was like a brother to him. ALSO READ: WHY IS LEMON JUICE GOOD FOR THE 4-5? “He was one of the negotiators when I was getting married. He helped me with everything.
