A COP allegedly gunned down a nurse after he accused him of having an affair with his wife. The 39-year-old cop of KwaCeza Police Station, northern KZN, was arrested yesterday after the 47-year-old nurse was shot and killed outside his rented room. The nurse was returning from working a night shift and as he was about to enter his room, the cop allegedly shot him once. He tried to escape but the residents caught him. “The police were called and he was arrested immediately,” said a resident. According to the resident, who asked not to be named, the cop’s wife and the nurse worked together at Thulasizwe Hospital. “They were apparently having an affair for about four months. The cop found out about the affair and warned the nurse to stop seeing his wife. I heard that he even told him to pay R40 000 damages for having a relationship with his wife. I think they didn’t stop and that’s why the cop ended up killing him,” said the resident. Attempts to reach the families were unsuccessful. Indipendent Police Investigative Ddirectorate spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said the case of the 39-year-old police officer from KwaCeza was being investigated. According to preliminary investigations, the deceased was allegedly having an affair with the suspect’s wife. Cola said the suspect has been detained and is facing a charge of murder. “He will appear in the Mahlabathini Magistrates Court soon,” said Cola.
