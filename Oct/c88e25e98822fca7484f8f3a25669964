BHEKUYISE Kheswa couldn’t hold back his tears when a brand new fully-furnished house was handed over to him and his family. The house was built by the national task team investigating political cases and given to the family from Umlazi, south of Durban, yesterday. The handover in Adams Mission, Durban, was attended by Police Minister Bheki Cele and eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda.   The family’s four-roomed house in Umlazi was destroyed by floods last April. The family of eight had been sleeping in a one-roomed shack ever since. The floods destroyed hundreds of homes, killed 70 people and displaced more than 1 000 people. Cele said the task team showed the police didn’t just arrest people, but also helped them. “The task team built the house from their own pockets. “The house is worth R250 000. They managed to get the site for free and then built it,” said Cele. “Everything in the house is from their own pockets.” Cele said they had also been doing a good job making arrests. He said 222 people had been arrested and 39 sentenced. Kaunda said a total of 780 houses would be built for residents affected by the floods. He said to tide them over, residents were given building materials to build shacks. Thandi Kheswa (57), whose family received the house, said they were not aware they’d be given a furnished house yesterday. “The cops told us they were bringing us here to show us a site where we could build our own house. When we arrived, we were all shocked and speechless,” she said. “Now we will sleep in a nice house. There are even groceries. “The fridge and cupboards are full.” Her husband Bhekuyise (59) couldn’t stop crying. “May God bless all those who donated money to build my family a house,” he said.
