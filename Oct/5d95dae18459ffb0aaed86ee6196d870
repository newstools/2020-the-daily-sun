Bafana Bafana shot stopper Itumeleng Khune will have tough times ahead to become the Kaizer Chiefs No 1 keeper ahead of Daniel Akpeyi. Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt says Khune has yet to reach the level that he wants following a long lay-off due to injury. The darling of Amakhosi fans was dropped from the starting line-up on Tuesday in favour of the Nigerian shot stopper when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in a DStv Premiership match played in Port Elizabeth. Khune conceded three goals in their humiliating 3-0 defeat to champions Mamelodi Sundowns in their first Premiership match last weekend. However, Hunt insist that this was not the reason he was dropped. He said: “I don’t think so. The problem is we haven’t had a proper pre-season and I think Itu (Khune) came back from a major injury and didn’t play much until right at the end (of season). We have had two, maybe three and a half weeks to try and get everybody settle in. Daniel Akpeyi had a problem with his work permit, and it came through yesterday (Monday), so I just felt he was certainly ready to play and lets have a look (going forward)."
