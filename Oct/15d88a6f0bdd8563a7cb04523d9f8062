THE moment of truth has arrived for coach Manqoba Mngqithi! Mngqithi has been an assistant coach at Mamelodi Sundowns since 2013-14 season and now he will be in charge of the Brazilians for their first competitive match of the new season. He says he understands the expectations placed on his shoulders as he prepares Sundowns for their first competitive match of the new season. The Brazilians return to action in their MTN8 quarter-final clash against Bloemfontein Celtic on 18 October. Mngqithi will be at the helm of the 2019-20 Premiership treble winners, alongside Rulani Mokwena, with the pair having taken over from the departed Pitso Mosimane ahead of the new season. Speaking to the club's official website following their first training session, Mngqithi outlined his immediate ambitions, while underpinning the importance of his co-coach. Mngqithi said: "The first session went well, the players really adapted well to the session, very smooth, flowing, and efficient. "I am looking forward to working with these talented and very professional players. "We will be pushing very hard for the MTN 8 and we will see what we will get out of it." The 49-year-old led Arrows to their first and only major trophy which is the MTN8 in 2009 as Abafana Bes'thende defeated Ajax Cape Town in the final, while Mokwena returned to Sundowns to serve under Mosimane in July 2020 for the second time following his spells with Orlando Pirates and Chippa United, where he served as the head coach.
