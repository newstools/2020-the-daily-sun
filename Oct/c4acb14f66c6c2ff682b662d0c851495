A THIRD suspect linked to the murder of a teacher from Estcourt, south of KZN, has been arrested. The man was caught in Joburg and was brought to KZN. He and two other suspects, aged 37 and 46, will appear together at Colenso Magistrates court today. They are all facing murder and malicious damage to property charges. They were arrested for the murder of the Phasiwe Primary School teacher, Hlengiwe Ndaba (35). The two suspects had abandoned bail in their appearance last month. They were appearing to introduce their lawyers and the lawyers told the court that both the accused were abandoning bail. The matter was then postponed to today for further investigation. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a third suspect has been arrested. She said the suspect was caught in Joburg on 26 September. “He is expected to join the two accused in court,” said Gwala. On 23 July 2020, a burnt bakkie belonging to Hlengiwe, who was eight months pregnant, was found with human remains in the Winterton area. The body was burnt beyond recognition and the car had bullet holes. A post-mortem was done and the results showed that the remains were that of Hlengiwe.
