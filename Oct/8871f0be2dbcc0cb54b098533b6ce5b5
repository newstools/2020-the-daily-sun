BONGI Mputhi wants to go back to school. But this isn’t possible as she’s unable to walk long distances. This is because the 19-year-old from Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga, was born with a disability. She’s been using a prosthetic leg for years, but her leg is now damaged. The prosthetic leg also no longer fits her as she’s grown. She told Daily Sun she needed help to get a new leg or a wheelchair, so she could go to school. “I live with my single, unemployed mum and six siblings. We live in a room because our house is half-built due to financial constraints,” she said. Bongi told the People’s Paper she wanted to complete high school. “I stopped going to school late last year in grade 10 because I could no longer walk long distances.” Bongi’s wish is to become a traffic cop when she completes her studies. She felt humiliated and helpless in her condition. “It’s not good to stay at home at my age. I want to go back to school wholeheartedly, but it’s not possible.” Bongi said she’s seen people get help through Daily Sun and hoped a Good Samaritan would help her too. “I know there are people out there who can help me and I’m praying to get help, so I can continue with my studies and become a better person in life,” she said.
