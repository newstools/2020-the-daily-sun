The 21-year-old from Ga-Mashashane in Limpopo said the song was released under OBS Media, and he’s been getting positive feedback from other producers. “I noticed that many DJs play it on their live sets and the song has been featured on a lot of mixes,” he said. He described his sound as a fusion of Afro tech with a touch of electronic elements. “I’m inspired by Da Capo because he’s dedicated to the craft and his sound always heals my soul and motivate me to do great things.” Midnight SA said artists from Limpopo are unique. “They don’t second guess themselves or change their lane. “Artists from Limpopo have developed a system to support one another and push each other to the top,” he said. “During lockdown I learnt to create my sound, which is unusual and a sound which represents me. I’ve also touched upon my deejaying creativity as I always practised indoors,” he said. The producer aims to elevate his craft by enrolling for a sound engineering course. Midnight SA enjoys being a music produce r morethan being a DJ. “I believe a world without music would be a lonely place,” he said. “I strive to find a sound that will be the reason behind the healing power of music. “Creating music for me is all about making people happy.”
