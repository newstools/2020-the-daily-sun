  WHEN it rains, it
pours for former Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Presidential spokeswoman Khusela
Diko. Masuku was sacked as the
health MEC last week following the preliminary findings of the SIU on the
Gauteng PPE scandal while Khusela has also taken special leave following the
corruption allegations. The pair was also
removed from organizational matters of the ANC. Reading the ANC
Gauteng PEC statement at the media briefing earlier today, Provincial Treasurer
General Parks Tau said, “The PEC decided that comrade Bandile Masuku and
comrade Khusela Diko, should be referred to the provincial disciplinary
committee of the ANC to protect the integrity of the ANC and the affected
comrades. “The PEC further
decided that comrades Bandile and Khusela should step aside from organizational
activities pending the finalization of the disciplinary processes,” he said. Bandile, his wife MMC
Loyiso Masuku, and Khusela were all implicated in a PPE corruption scandal
after the Gauteng Health department irregularly awarded the contract of over
R125 million to Khusela’s husband Madzikane II Thandisizwe Diko’s company Roya
Bhaca Projects. However, on all the
implicated parties, Loyiso has been dodged the bullet as she was cleared and
told to resume her duties. Parks said, “The PEC
report and the follow-up work done by the PWC found that allegations against
Loyiso Masuku concerning her involvement in this regard could not be
substantiated. “Accordingly the PEC
decided that she should resume her responsibilities.” Parks added, “This
decision takes into account that there are currently SIU investigations, and
should anything be found on all these matters, the PEC would apply its mind and
reconsider its decision based on any new information that is provided.
