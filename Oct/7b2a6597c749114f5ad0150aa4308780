CONTROVERSIAL church leader Shepherd Bushiri has been arrested again! His Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church confirmed that its leader handed himself to the police. This was after Bushiri’s wife Mary, was arrested at their home in Pretoria by the on-fire Hawks. According to the churches’ spokesman, Ephraim Nyondo, the arrest came before a scheduled meeting  between the Hawks and the Bushiris  could take place. “The Hawks informed our leaders Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and Prophetess Mary Bushiri, that they (Hawks) are requesting them to go to their office by 11am accompanied by their lawyers to discuss an issue concerning a certain investment pertaining to certain company called Rising Estate”, said Nyondo  in a brief statement. Nyondo added that: “We are told as the Prophet and lawyers were getting prepared for the 11am appointment when the Hawks went to their house before the appointment and arrested the Prophet's wife alone. “We are told the Prophet is on his way to the Hawks office to hand over himself,” said Nyondo. According to a Hawks' statement four suspects, including a pastor aged between 25 and 39 were arrested for alleged involvement in fraud and money laundering worth R102 million.  Spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale said the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation members arrested the first couple on Saturday in Sandton and her husband at OR Tambo International airport.  The two, Willah Mudolo and Zethu Mudolo have since appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court and their case was postponed to 30 October for a formal bail application.  “On Tuesday, the team made a further arrest of another couple also involved in the same case. The woman (39) was arrested at her residence and the husband after trying to evade police handed himself over at the Silverton police station with an entourage of attorneys. The suspects are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon.”
