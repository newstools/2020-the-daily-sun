THE Maphanga family were left confused by their relative Sebenzile’s death. Sebenzile (44) had been missing since 3 October. A man who claimed to be Sebenzile’s lover confessed to killing her. The family, from Soshanguve in Tshwane, said the man woke Sebenzile up in the early hours of the morning, saying his car had broken down. Sebenzile never returned home. The family said they were shocked when police told them the man had confessed. “We were looking for her and even reported her missing at the police station,” the family said. They said they hadn’t identified the body and weren’t sure if the body was Sebenzile’s. The family said the man wasn’t dating Sebenzile. The man apparently asked for her phone number, but Sebenzile wasn’t interested. We were told the man said he wanted to sell her body parts because she was a praying woman. Captain Mavela Masondo said two suspects were bust and appeared in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court on Wednesday. “One of them is the deceased’s boyfriend, while the other is a self-proclaimed sangoma,” he said. He said they’d be back in court on 20 October. Preliminary investigations had revealed the last person in contact with the dead woman was the boyfriend, although telephonically. “This led to the arrest of the suspect on Saturday. Further investigations led police to the Dubai squatter camp on Sunday, where the missing woman’s remains were found. “The burnt body had been mutilated and the hands and feet were missing,” he said. Masondo said the second suspect was bust for his suspected involvement. “Investigations at this stage suggest that the motive for the killing may be muthi-related,” he said.
