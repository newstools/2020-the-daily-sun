ORANGE Farm has won the first round after murder accused Pontsho Mohlanka (29) abandoned her application for bail and the case was postponed to 17 November. The community sang in celebration after they heard about the abandonment of bail by Mohlanka, who is accused of killing two children, Simphiwe Mgcina (6) and Mpho Makondo (8), last month. In a brief appearance today at the Vereeniging Magistrates Court, Mohlanka, through her lawyer Advocate Viwe Skepu, told the magistrate that they would like to abandon their application for bail. Sophie Semo from Women In Motion said: “We are happy that she abandoned bail because they have been calling for her not to get bail. “She and her lawyer saw that she doesn’t deserve bail, we are happy and hoping that case will go smoothly.” She said they can’t celebrate too much because they have only won the first round and they will wait until the end of the case. Community leader Linda Ndebele said they want the case of the child who was found in a fridge at Mohlanka’s house in April to be reinstated. “We want that case back in court, and it must go hand-in-hand with this one. We need Pontsho to be in jail.” He said he was worried she was released from jail in that case. “Now the two were not found in her house, maybe they will release her again,” he said. Orange Farm residents still came in numbers to the court to support the families of the children who allegedly died at the hands of Mohlanka.
