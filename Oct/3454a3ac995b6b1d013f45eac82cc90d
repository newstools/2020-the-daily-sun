IF THE exchange rate and international oil prices keep working in Mzansi’s favour, the petrol price might drop. According to the Automobile Association (AA) commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, petrol and diesel prices are likely to fall. The AA has forecast a petrol price reduction of between 14 and 17 cents a litre with diesel set to fall by around 20 cents a litre. However, illuminating paraffin will see a possible 20-cent increase with the current data showing the fuel up by around five cents a litre. The association said despite some instabilities in international oil prices, the basic fuel prices were trending slightly downwards. It further said there seems to be some stability returning to oil as the world’s markets begin to find their equilibrium again.
