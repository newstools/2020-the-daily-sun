VILLAGERS can’t wait for the upgrade of the notorious R81 to be completed. The road, which goes past Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, is known for its high number of car accidents and has claimed many lives. A sub-contractor has been working to upgrade the 10km road. Villagers said they were tired of witnessing accidents. Recently, two trucks carrying cement crashed, three days apart. The latest accident happened on Monday when a driver lost control of his truck after failing to stop at a stop-and-go point, killing a 20-year-old pedestrian before the truck overturned.  Transport spokesman Mike Maringa said the cause of the accident might have been speeding or brake failure. The driver and passenger were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Resident Thapelo Malatjie (33) said: “Drivers fail to use lower gears and the brakes on some cars fail because they’re not serviced properly.” Another resident, Kedibone Maepa (29), told Daily Sun they prayed there won’t be construction delays. “A number of accidents have happened at the stop-and-go points because most trucks don’t stop. Workers become fearful when a truck approaches,” said Kedibone. Villagers were happy when construction started, citing job opportunities. Construction, which has been budgeted for R141 million, is set to be completed in February next year. It will have wider intersections with turning lanes, walkways, bus stop bays and two bridges. The bridges will have sidewalks for pedestrian safety.
