Black Leopards coach Patrick Aussems doesn’t want to set unobtainable targets ahead of the 2020-21 season. The 55-year-old Belgian, who has a strong record in Africa, joined Lidoda Duvha on a 3-year-deal. He has been entrusted with taking Leopards, who struggled last season as they survived relegation through the playoffs, to new heights. Aussems is capable of doing so having won league titles with AS Leopards in Congo-Brazzaville and Simba SC in Tanzania. The Belgian also helped Simba reach the quarterfinals of the 2018-19 Caf Champions League. Although he is aware of the expectations at the Limpopo club this season, Aussems is not getting too ahead of himself. Speaking at the club’s media launch where Leopards announced a new partnership with mining and logistics company Yethembe Group, Aussems said they need to be realistic. "I am not a liar,” said Aussems in a virtual question and answer session. “I cannot promise we will finish in the top four or top eight (in the Premiership) I can promise that we will work."I want the team to play football. I want the fans who come to the stadium to see good football. “I want to have happy players because I know they will play good football and that will make our fans happy whether we win or lose.”  Leopards are hoping their new sponsorship deal with Yethembe Group which will run for three years, will bring them success. “They demonstrated that they wanted to develop football in the country and we were able to convince them that Black Leopards would be the perfect platform,” said Leopards CEO Moudy Mudzielwana. “The relationship was based purely on the fact that we have a football team, they are looking for football development and we are a platform to the so our relationship is about football development.”
