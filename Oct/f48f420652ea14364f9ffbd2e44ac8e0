JAGUAR’S XE now features soft-touch and authentic materials throughout. For those with allergy problems, the Enhanced Cabin Air Ionisation improves interior air quality through the Nanoe Technology, which removes allergens and unpleasant odours by simply activating the system by pressing the “Purify” button. The exterior was broadly updated when the new XE was introduced last year. It features the same wide grille and bumper design, delivering a planted appearance. All the XE models are available with the enhanced Black Exterior Pack which delivers a stealthier appearance with bespoke elements finished in Gloss Black. These include the grille mesh, grille surrounds, lower air intake surrounds, side vents, window surrounds, and new for 21MY, black exterior badging. South African customers can choose from S, R-DYNAMIC SE, and R-DYNAMIC HSE specification packs. To help drivers access vital information quickly, a 12.3-inch HD Interactive Driver Display gets enhanced graphics and a configurable layout that can show full-screen navigation mapping with turn-by-turn instructions, digital dials, media, contact list, or infotainment details.  The second-generation wearable Activity Key can be used to lock, unlock, and start the vehicle without the need for the conventional key fob. The rechargeable key incorporates a watch and has a battery life of seven days between charges. The new XE will be available in South Africa with the next generation Ingenium 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine, and Jaguar’s eight-speed automatic transmission. It features the latest engine technologies including a twin-scroll turbocharger and Continuous Variable Valve Lift (CVVL), for a strong combination of refined performance and efficiency. The XE turbocharged engine produces 184kW and 365Nm with a 7.9 l/100km fuel economy. The updated Jaguar XE will be available in Mzansi in the first half of 2021.
