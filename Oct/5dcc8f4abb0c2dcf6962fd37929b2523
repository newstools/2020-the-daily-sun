THE Human Rights Commission says the attack on cops amounts to an attack on human rights of South Africans. Western Cape Human Rights Commissioner Chris Nissen said this during the funeral of the top detective Charl Kinnear, who was murdered outside his house in Bishop Lavis two weeks ago. “Members of the police are in the words of Human Rights Commission, the first defence because they defend, protect and serve. They are the first defence of human rights. When the first defence of human rights is murdered or killed in the manner that happened to Charl it also can happen to you. As the commission, we say to the minister no stone must be left unturned. All those involved in this crime must be brought to book,” said Nissen. Nissen said Kinnear was the detective after his two brothers were murdered many years ago. “He brought justice to many people. Through the cases he investigated, he brought comfort to many people who lost their husbands, brothers and sisters on the Cape Flats and crimes that are being committed in our country,” said Nissen. Police Minister Bheki Cele said the murder of Kinnear was a declaration of war and they are going to fight back. “This is a war and war has dead bodies as we see. When you find a war you don’t ask who started it, but you fight back,” said Cele. Kinnear was investigating criminals outside but was also investigating “our own criminality” of those cops who worked with criminals. He was regarded as top detective in Western Cape and was ranked third in South Africa. He was shot outside his home on 18 September at about 3pm while he was in his car. So far, a former rugby player Zane Killian has been arrested in connection with the murder of Kinnear and is expected to appear in the Bishop Lavis Magistrates Court tomorrow.
