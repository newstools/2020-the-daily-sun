LIEUTENANT-General Mondli Zuma is warning thugs to stop attacking cops. The Mpumalanga police boss issued this warning after shots were fired at officers by a gang of copper thieves at a mine. Zuma said police received information about suspects who were stealing copper cable at Bosmanspoort Gold Mine in Mpumalanga. “Our members followed the lead and went to the place where the illegal activities were reportedly taking place, but when they got there, they saw about 30 men outside the mine who were in possession of a large quantity of copper cables,” said Zuma. “When the suspects realised they were cornered, they quickly vanished inside a mine shaft. “They then started firing shots at the security formations and in response, the team retaliated.” There were no reports of any injuries. “But we want to warn them that if anyone attacks a police officer, that person attacks the state, and they will be found,” Zuma said. He praised the members for the arrest of suspects and the recovery of stolen copper cable. “Several cases of this nature have been reported across the province,’ said Zuma. “Police can’t allow a situation where criminals cause havoc and helping themselves to things that don’t belong to them.”
