THE John Vuli Gate music video has left people on social media unimpressed. The song has had the social media streets abuzz for the past few weeks, but people are not pleased with the actual music video by Mapara A Jazz. One of the John Vuli Gate girls, Arianna Katt, posted a snippet of the video on Twitter which left many saying the video wasn’t nice enough. The video showed the John Vuli Gate girls dancing with the hit makers. Most people said the video was not original and the girls were not the same anymore.

So much so that they were used for the music video. Gabrielle K commented on the video and said: “This is rubbish, I had to watch it twice before I realised it was you.” Darlington tweeted: “Is it only me or the persona of this dance has lost energy.” Ofentse Mwase commented: “Like where are the sunglasses? Why are there guys all over you?” Mandisi wrote: “This is not the video we ordered.”
