The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) have confirmed that next year's Comrades Marathon will take place on 13 June 2021. This year's race, which was scheduled for 14 June, was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The CMA, Athletics South Africa and KwaZulu-Natal Athletics confirmed the date for the 95th edition, which remains unchanged from the second Sunday in June. The CMA board has also confirmed that next year's ultra-distance race will be a Down Run, starting at the Pietermaritzburg City Hall and finishing at Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium, Covid-19 and government restrictions permitting. "With the inaugural Comrades Marathon having been staged on 24 May 1921, next year's event promises to be a very special edition of the race with the hosting of the Comrades Marathon Centenary Celebrations hopefully commencing on 23 May 2021," said CMA chairperson, Cheryl Winn. "We look forward to issuing more details on #Comrades2021 at our official media launch, especially information on the entry cap, entry fees and qualifying criteria, as well as protocols toÂ  be put into place to protect the health and safety of everyone involved with the race. "CMA had some wonderful plans for the 2020 'Race That Never Was' but we are pleased to announce that many of those ideas will be carried over to our Centenary Celebrations and make the 95th running of the Comrades Marathon a spectacular affair." -SPORT24
