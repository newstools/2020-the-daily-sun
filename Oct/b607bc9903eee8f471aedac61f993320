THE first accused in the Senekal arson case, Andre Pienaar, was granted R15 000 bail by the Bloemfontein High Court on Monday. The judgment cancelled out the one passed down by Senekal Magistrates Court last week, where Pienaar was denied bail. The 52-year-old is accused of being involved in chaos at the court on 6 October. Pienaar faces charges of public violence, attempted murder and incitement of violence after a group of farmers stormed into court, demanding two men accused of killing farm manager Brendin Horner be handed over to them. During the chaos, two shots were fired, holding cells were damaged and two accused in the holding cells were injured and had to be sent to hospital. A police vehicle was also overturned and torched. The chaos sparked tensions, which saw EFF members descending on Senekal on Friday to “defend democracy”. Free State NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said: “Even though the NPA wanted the accused to be incarcerated until the finalisation of the case, the NPA respects the decision of the high court and hopes he will abide by all his bail conditions. “Pienaar will appear again in the Senekal Magistrates Court on 20 November after the case was postponed for further investigations.” Meanwhile, the second suspect Stefanus Fourie (33), appeared in the Senekal Magistrates Court after he was bust on Friday, also for his alleged involvement in the chaos. Fourie was granted also R15 000 bail and his matter was postponed to 20 November. Though the town was calm yesterday, police remained on high alert. Murder accused Sekwetje Mahlamba and Sekola Matlaletsa will appear again in court today after their bail hearing was postponed on Friday.
