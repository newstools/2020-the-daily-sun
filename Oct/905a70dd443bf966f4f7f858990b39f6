THE family is angry that the boyfriend of Nomfundo Langa (28) has not been arrested for her murder. Nomfundo from Diepkloof, Soweto, was found murdered with bruises and burn wounds at her boyfriend’s place on Sunday, and the family believes the evidence points to the boyfriend as the murderer. Her sister, Nontsikelelo Sondwana (39) told Daily Sun they found out at about 8am. “My ex-husband went to see Nomfundo and he was told that she hadn’t woken up,” Nontsikelelo said.  She said when she arrived, the boyfriend’s family had not called the cops or an ambulance. Nontsikelelo said the residents wanted to moer the man, but he was rescued by police. “I wish they had dealt with him before the police arrived, because the police are not making an effort to arrest him,” she said. She said the police took him away, but he wasn’t arrested. “He was taken in for questioning, but they let him go,” she said. She said when she questioned why he was not arrested, she was told there’s no proof to detain him and that they must wait for the post-mortem results.  Nontsikelelo said Nomfundo’s neighbours told the family the guy beat Nomfundo all the time and also on the night before she died. Nomfundo’s mum, Lindiwe Langa (60) said her daughter was three months pregnant and also had a nine-year-old boy. “I’ll never forgive this man. “Women and children are killed every day while the police drag their feet,” said Lindiwe. Women from Nomfundo’s kasi protested. They said they wanted the killing of women and children to end.  Zodwa Ngwenya (35) said she wanted justice for Nomfundo. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said an inquest docket has been opened. He said the police were investigating and if new information came to light, the case will be changed to murder but until then, no one would be arrested.
