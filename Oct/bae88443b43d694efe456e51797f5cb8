BURNT-OUT shacks send a clear warning: it’s game over for thugs. Residents of Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane started hunting them down on Friday. They destroyed six shacks and burnt property belonging to alleged criminals. Community leader Khomotso Galoshi (42), told Daily Sun they were tired of thugs who’d made it hard to live in the township. She said two weeks ago they caught four thugs who’d been terrorising the community and moered them with sjamboks. According to Khomotso, two of the thugs died last week and their families opened cases against patrollers, who’d since been arrested. “We demand the patrollers be released. They’re innocent and help monitor the place,” he said. “The community burnt the six shacks belonging to the thugs. “We can’t be ruled by thugs. They make us scared to go out at night.” She said residents now felt safer, but were worried the thugs would grab their phones and handbags when it got dark. Said Khomotso: “People scream the whole night because of crime in the area. “We’ll continue enforcing safety because the police are failing us.” Lucky Sibiya (46) said before they burnt the shacks they discovered a slightly bloodied panga, four bullets, IDs, driver’s licences, bank cards and a necklace. “We’re cleaning up the place because police are protecting evil criminals. We want these thugs to go,” he said. Lucky demanded that Police Minister Bheki Cele visit the area. Patrol leader Sergeant Mthimkhulu (58) said locals won’t be controlled by thugs. “We’re helping police fight crime yet they arrest us instead of supporting us,” he said. “The criminal residents, whether South African or foreign, should run for dear life because it’s game over for them.”
