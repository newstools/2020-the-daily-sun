RESIDENTS have warned Police Minister Bheki Cele they will go toe to toe with Tactical Response Team members if they are not brought into line. According to the people of Qumbu and Tsolo, Eastern Cape, members deployed to the area to deal with business robberies and stock theft have been abusing them. They told Daily Sun officers stormed into their houses in the middle of the night wearing balaclavas and breaking doors. Sipho Nqiwa said members of the Amampondomise nation were ready to defend themselves if the government did not intervene. “You will remember there was a breakout of violence in Qumbu back in the 1990s and only the SANDF managed to calm the situation,” he said. Sipho said officers beat him in front of his family. Residents claimed five people had been killed by officers since the beginning of the year, including Majolandile Mcelu and Zolile Cina. However, Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said the allegation that five people had been killed was untrue. “An investigation has to be done to prove the veracity of such allegations,” he said. Kinana said police management was aware of a march held in the Qumbu CBD where Amampondomise demanded the officers leave the area. “Previously, an appeal was made to the local communities to report the alleged incidents for investigation. All the cases were reported and are being attended to by Ipid,” he said. The angry Amampondomise members are also calling for the removal of the Qumbu Police Station commander, Mavala Feke. The SunTeam recently visited the area and spoke to youth from Nontyankashe, Small Farm and Ngxotwe villages. They said the officers were behaving like apartheid police and had traumatised them. They said they even assaulted elderly people in their villages.
