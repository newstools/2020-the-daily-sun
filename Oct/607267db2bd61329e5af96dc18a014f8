Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has attempted to deflect the pressure of a first Soweto Derby in the hottest seat in South African football by claiming Orlando Pirates should be favourites to win the league. Chiefs travel to the Orlando Stadium to meet Pirates in their MTN8 semifinal, first leg, on Saturday, and while Hunt’s difficulties in not being able to sign players due to a Fifa ban imposed on the club are well documented, he insists Pirates should be flying. His words are likely intentioned to place the pressure on the Buccaneers, who were unconvincing in the MTN8 quarterfinal win over Cape Town City, and have followed that up with two tame draws in the DStv Premiership. “My opinion is that they [Pirates] are big favourites for the league title. They have built a good squad," Hunt said. "They have a lot of players who I know and obviously worked with [at BidVest Wits], so they have a very good squad of players. “But what they do is not for me to say. I’m concentrating on what we must do. Pirates are much stronger than they were last season. I know what is ahead of us so we look forward to the game. “I’m trying to get the team right, keep working on the team, trying to get us to play the way I want. “Obviously it is a derby. If you look at it, no supporters and that makes a huge difference. So I’m just trying to continue on my path forward and trying to build the team and trying to prove results.” Hunt admits he has had little time to prepare for the fixture after their 1-0 away DStv Premiership win over Chippa United on Tuesday. “It’s right on top of us, so not really much time to affect the team too much. We will do a little bit of a light session tomorrow [Friday] and then play on Saturday. So we are looking forward to the game.” Chiefs are seeking a first trophy success since they lifted the league title at the end of the 2014/15 season. -SUPERSPORT.COM
