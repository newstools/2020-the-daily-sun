KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt says youngster Nkosingiphile Ngcobo will need to maintain his form or he will get dropped. Hunt hailed the 20-year-old who grabbed the chance to be in his starting line-up with both hands. The youngster has never looked back since the former Bidvest Wits mentor throwed him in the deep end in their 2-1 win over Maritzburg United in the MTN8 Cup quarterfinal. He also played when Amakhosi lost 3-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns in their opening DStv Premiership match last weekend, while he displayed  a man of the match performance to help Amakhosi beat Chippa United 1-0 in another league game on Tuesday. Said Hunt: “I won’t say much to him, but if he drops below the standard then he can’t play. What he does off the ball is most important, the boy has so much ability. He should have scored tonight, and he missed two or three chances in the last two games, he should score.” Hunt doesn’t want to see Ngcobo follow a trend of youngsters who display good performances in one game only to slide into obscurity. “He has to get better without the ball, those are things he needs to have in him, I can only give him the platform, show and coach him, but it’s up to the boy. What we mustn’t do and they do it too much in South Africa is that they have one good game and then we blow them up. He’s got to keep his feet on the ground. He has only played three games. I only saw him for a week, and I put him straight in and he has now played three games. I think the next step is to try get on a score sheet.”
