DRUG addicts in Khayelitsha and Lower Cross Road in Cape Town are now stealing DStv signal Low Noise Block (LNB). They then open it, crush what’s inside the LNB and mix it with pain killers. One of the drug addicts told the SunTeam it didn’t take too long before the drug started working. “It’s something new. We mix it with pain killers and it doesn’t take too long before it starts working. You get high and feel good a few minutes after smoking it,” said the addict. He said he never stole the signal LNB, but his friends did and never asked where they got it from. “I just smoked and felt good,” he said. A resident (34) said: “We didn’t pay too much attention to this at first, but it’s been happening. “What are these addicts going to steal next?” Another resident said she noticed her DStv didn’t work and called someone to fix it. “He showed me the damage done by the addicts. “We never heard them when they took it off,” said the resident. A third resident (30) said they were in trouble. “They’re sick. They started by stealing ARVs to mix with drugs. “They need a beating, we can’t allow them to continue stealing from us,” she told Daily Sun.
