THIS weekend the SATMAs celebrated their 15th birthday at the Inogonyama Lodge in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. Traditional music lovers descended to the province of the rising sun to be part of the celebrations of the project that started as a pipe dream.  However, due to lockdown regulations still being in place,Â  the number of people in attendance had to be no more than 50% capacity of the venue as per government regulations. Those at the event, were entertained by the sounds of Dr Nothembi Mkhwebane, Yoki Yoki hit maker Vhudie as well as Blaq Diamonds.  Singing along to some of the popular songs performed at event was impractical as people had to put their masks on at all times. The awards ceremony, will be hosted also in the Mpumalanga Province in December.
