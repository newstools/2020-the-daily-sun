HE doesn’t have legs or hands, but DJ Majarine makes people lose their minds when he’s on the decks. The DJ, whose real name is Livhuwani Mutsharini (23) from Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo, said music kept him going. “I fell in love with music at a very young age and taught myself how to play. I had a small set at home, which I used to train on. The community radio station gave me an opportunity to train myself with their equipment.” He said he also focused on music at school and got better as time went by.

I believe they are there, but they don’t have a platform. I want to pave the way for them. I want to be their role model. I don’t let my disability stop me from achieving my goals. I go for what I want. I don’t care that I am wheelchair-bound and that I do not have hands.” He said his dream was to become one of the best DJs Mzansi ever produced and wished the industry would open channels for people living with disabilities. He also wants to study engineering next year. His manager, Aubrey Miswe of N.A.M Production, said he wished someone would help DJ Majarine with an electric wheelchair as he struggled with his current one. “Any kind of support will be highly appreciated.” He also pleaded for those with power in the industry to create opportunities for people living with disabilities. “DJ Majarine is talented. This is in his blood. All he needs is someone with the keys to open doors for him,” said Aubrey.
