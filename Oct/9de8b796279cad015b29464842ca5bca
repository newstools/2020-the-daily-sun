THE gruesome discovery of the lifeless bodies of a woman and a young girl has left residents in great fear. Residents from KwaDabeka, north of Durban, were terrified after the two bodies were found yesterday. It is suspected that the unknown victims, who were found by a passerby lying dead near the river, might be a mother and daughter. The young girl is estimated to be aged 13 and the woman is thought to be in her late 30s. They were allegedly assaulted, burnt and strangled to death and then dumped near a river in KwaDabeka. A shocked resident, who asked not to be named, said seeing this made her scared to even leave the house. “I don’t feel safe anymore. What kind of person does this to a woman and a child? I’m scared to even leave the house with my daughter because we too could be killed. Nobody deserves to be killed in such a brutal manner,” she said. Another resident said the way women and children are being killed recently is shocking. “It looks like there are people who have anger towards women and children so they are targeting them. We are all scared now as we sit and wonder who is next,” she said. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that bodies of two victims believed to be aged 13 and late 30s were found dumped near Lwandle Drive, Umgeni River in KwaDabeka. They were allegedly assaulted, burnt and strangled to death. A docket with two counts of murder was opened at KwaDabeka Police Station for investigation,” said Mbele.
