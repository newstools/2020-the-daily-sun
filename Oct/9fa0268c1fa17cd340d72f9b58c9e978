SOCIAL media has really changed the way we socialise and interact with
one another. Meeting up with friends and family is now done via live chats, and you
no longer have to physically wait for a woman to ask her out. Yes, courting her has moved, or “slid”, into DM Avenue, AKA direct
messages. According to social media stats, women receive at least one DM from a
guy who wants her hand in love. So with International Cybersecurity Month drawing to an end this
October, we take a look at what steps guys can take to slide appropriately into
her DMs: 1. Follow her first and wait for her to follow you back It’s really simple, if the person you’re into doesn’t follow you back,
chances are pretty low that they’re going to respond to your DM. 2. Please note that DMs are not dating apps According to social media strategists, it’s one thing to message someone
on a dating app, but it is quite another to invade someone’s inbox on
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. 3.  Don’t display thirsty tendencies, you’ll be left high and
dry Avoid liking or commenting on every single picture she posts. It doesn’t
look cute and it is borderline creepy.
