AMAZULU have confirmed they will not be playing their home games at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium or Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu this season. Instead, their home matches will be played at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium. According to the 2020-21 fixture list, AmaZulu are set to host Orlando Pirates in their opening DStv match of the season at Kings Park on 24 October. “Our thoughts for this season are that we must be consistent with our planning,” said the club’s media officer, Brilliant Mkhathini. “We’ve established a relationship with The Sharks (KZN rugby franchise), with the view to grow the brand and to establish some sort of consistency as far as playing (at home) and planning is concerned.” AmaZulu’s previous management, led by then general manager Lunga Sokhela, were angry at how they were treated by the eThekwini municipality. This after KwaMashu and Umlazi venues weren’t prioritised after they were badly affected by the heatwaves and music concerts that took place there last November and December, and made those stadiums unsuitable for PSL games. Usuthu used the Moses Mabhida Stadium as their third alternative venue. But they played only one game there against Mamelodi Sundowns in January. That was their last match before moving to Kings Park Stadium. With the club’s bar now set high under new chairman Sandile Zungu, who completed a 100% takeover of the club recently, Usuthu said playing at one home venue will augur well for the team to avoid the drama and relegation battle they went through last season. Coach Ayanda Dlamini desperately needs a stable home as he has been mandated by Zungu to finish in the top four this coming season.
