Zodwa Wabantu’s former Ben 10, Vusi Ngubane, is officially off the market. Vusi paid lobola for his girlfriend, Thenjiwe Mpanza, over the weekend. He posted a picture of three men on Instagram and captioned it: “Ngithembe nina.” A few hours later, he posted a picture with Thenjiwe, thanking her family. The couple became the talk of the town when Zodwa accused Vusi of defrauding her. In August, Zodwa claimed that Vusi went to an Audi dealership and took a car in her name.
