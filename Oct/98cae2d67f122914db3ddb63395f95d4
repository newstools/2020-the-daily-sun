THEY hear things moving around in their houses at night. They also hear voices of men fighting over a woman. But they can’t stop the fighting because the voices belong to ghosts! The villagers, who live next to graves in Manaleni Village near Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga, said they were having sleepless nights. They want the families of people buried there to perform rituals. Thokozani Mnguni (39) said the problem started three years ago. He said: “We no longer have proper sleep. They enter our homes while we’re sleeping and we can feel their presence. “You can hear the sounds of people talking or moving furniture. We sometimes hear sounds of doors opening and closing.” Duduzile Shabangu (47), who often sees shadows moving, said: “The graves are very old. You can sometimes hear windows open and close and taps running. “It becomes cold when it rains and the situation gets worse. Some families have left. They can no longer take this. “There are rooms near the graves, but no one wants to rent them. Those who rent them leave within a month.” Jabulile Mahlangu (49) said she’d been living in the area since 2014. At first she thought this was the work of evil people. She later heard three of her neighbours had the same problem. “I hear male voices fighting over a woman at night. The one says ‘leave my girlfriend or I’ll kill you’, and the other says the woman must choose,” she said. Her house became cold as soon as the voices went quiet. “I went to izangoma, but would only sleep peacefully for three nights afterwards.” Sangoma Maselempini Mashiyane from Bundu Village said: “They must get a goat and seek help from an inyanga. “It might be that only one grave is causing problems, but they don’t know which one. The ritual must be performed at the grave site to make the spirit sleep.”
