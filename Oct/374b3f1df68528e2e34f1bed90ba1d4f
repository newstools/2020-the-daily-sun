GAUTENG Premier David Makhura has fired Bandile Masuku from his position as MEC of Health in Gauteng. This was after the findings of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) placed Masuku at the centre of the Gauteng PPE scandal. Giving an update on the ongoing Special Investigation Union investigations, Makhura said, "Today I report back to the people of Gauteng on the founding of the SIU, their recommendations and therefore the decision that I would have taken. "The SIU has found that the health MEC has failed to execute his functions in compliance with the constitution and the Public Finance Management Act(PFMA). Based on the findings Makhura said the SIU recommended that the Premier of the province should take administrative action against the MEC to determine the suitability to hold office as the responsible MEC for Health. "I have decided as the Premier of the Province to discharge Dr Bandile Masuku as the Gauteng MEC for Health. Makhura added," with regards to the substantive public interest issue ofÂ  whether the MEC was involved in acts of corruption, the SIU reported to me that the investigation is ongoing." He said the investigation will hopefully be completed soon and he will be provided with the facts because he wants to know if the MEC was involved in corruption or collusion. Makhura had placed Masuku on special leave as the PPE corruption allegations mounted. Transport MEC, Jacob Mamabolo was appointed as the acting health MEC and according to Makhura, Mamabolo will act in the position until the completion of the SIU investigation. He said he won't be appointing anyone new as MEC of health until the investigation is completed and should Masuku be found not guilty, he won't hesitate to reinstate him. It appears that the Forensic report by Paul O'Sullivan that cleared him from any wrongdoing, was not enough to save him from being fired.
