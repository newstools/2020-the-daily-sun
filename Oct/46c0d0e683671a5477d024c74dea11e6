She said: “Men must step up as husbands and fathers. “They must be soldiers who’re called on to do their duties. “Even when the storm of life tempts them, they don’t abandon their posts.” She said running away from responsibility harms kids. “They end up developing anger if they don’t have a father figure. It’s no good to ask where your father is,” she said. Queen Jenny recently moved from wedding songs to house. “It’s still a continuation of my marriage advocacy,” she said. “My single, Koko Matswale, has wedding lyrics and house beats. “It was also popular with my fans in Limpopo, who enjoy my wedding songs.” Her new house album Honeymoon, produced by DJ Sunco, features Mukhosi and Azui from Zimbabwe. “We used the keyboard and drums as dominating instruments because they bring life to the songs,” said Queen Jenny. She said music relieves stress and is part of her workout routine. She’s also a dancer. She started out as a dancer for Mojela and Papa Irvin before going went solo.
