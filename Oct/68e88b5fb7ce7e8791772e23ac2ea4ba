SINGER Nomcebo Zikode believes the support the song Jerusalema is getting is a blessing from God. The song, through the #JerusalemaChallenge, has become a global phenomenon. Nomcebo told Daily Sun God is doing wonders with their music and that she never expected the song to be so big. “I’d love to thank God more than anything else,” she said. “I believe he brought me and Master KG together to do this song. “He knew South Africans could have a song that would dominate the world.” She also thanked everyone who supported the song. Nomcebo also thanked the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa for acknowledging their work. Nomcebo said people also love her album Xola Moya Wam, which was released a month ago. She advised fellow artists to be patient. “It’s important to love your craft. I know this isn’t an easy journey,” she said. “People see you as a celebrity but don’t know where you come from. “I love my fans and I’ve not changed. Fame won’t change Nomcebo.”
