Up-and-coming rapper EscoRichy is about to take a big step. EscoRichy, whose real name is Xola Gxashe, is moving to a new city to kickstart his career. EscoRichy, originally from East London in the Eastern Cape, is moving to the City of Gold in Gauteng. “I’ve gotten to a point where I want to make something out of myself in the industry,” he said. “Music is big in East London, but only gqom, kwaito and the likes. Hip hop isn’t that big and that’s a problem. “So I’m moving to Joburg next month, so I can reach my full potential.” EscoRichy said his sisters were the reason he fell in love with music. “Growing up, my sisters used to listen to a lot of R&B and hip hop. “I then developed an interest in hip hop because of its rawness. “I liked that rappers just didn’t care about anything.

So I started recording my own music.” The rapper said he released his first mainstream single, Doing Better, last year and is working on his debut EP. Said EscoRichy: “I’d been making music for years, but decided to finally take it seriously. “And I released Doing Better, which did well last year. “I’m working on an EP now and it will be out soon. It will be introducing Esco to the game. “People will get to know who I am. It will also be about my life experiences and past relationships. “My goal is to ultimately go international. But for now I’d really like to work with K.O. “I look up to him and I hope to get into studio with him soon.”
