SWALLOWS FC edged out Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in the DStv Premiership match at Dobsonville Stadium on Wednesday night. As a result, the Birds recorded their first victory of the season and the win took them to the fifth spot on the league standings, while Siwelele are placed 13th on the log. The Birds controlled the match in the opening stages of the match with Given Thibedi pulling the strings in midfield. However, Swallows found it difficult to penetrate the Phunya Sele Sele defence which was marshalled by Justice Chabalala. Celtic grew in confidence as the match progressed and they started pressing the the Swallows defence as they searched for the opening goal. The visitors could not seriously test Swallows goalkeeper Virgil Vries, who gathered Ronald Pfumbidzai's curling corner-kick with ease with the halftime break approaching. The score was 0-0 at the interval following an evenly balanced first-half. Kabelo Malinga was introduced by Swallows coach Brandon Truter prior to the start of the second-half as the hosts looked to break the deadlock. The former SuperSport United striker tried to make an immediate impact, but his effort from a free-kick was blocked by the wall. Swallows were creating chances which they could not convert with Ruzaigh Gamilden and Malinga working hard upfront. Gamiliden connected with Vuyo Mere's cross, but the former Ajax Cape Town striker placed his header over the crossbar. The deadlock was finally broken with seven minutes left when Pfumbidzai scored an own-goal from Gamildien's cross to make it 1-0 to Swallows. The goal sealed Swallows' 1-0 win over Celtic as they secured their maiden win of the season. -SUPERSPORT.COM
