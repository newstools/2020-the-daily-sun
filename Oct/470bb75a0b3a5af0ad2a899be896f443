AN EVIL mum dumped her baby girl at a dumpsite to die, but a loving woman has opened her arms to the little one. Bathabile Malapame (50) told Daily Sun she has five boys and always wanted a girl – and now her prayers have been answered. “I have named her Mahlatse. It means blessing,” said the community leader from Phomolong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. She said she was busy with the paperwork to adopt the child officially. “I was praying for a baby girl while this woman threw her little girl away.” Bathabile said an evil and heartless woman dumped the little child at the dumpsite last Wednesday and residents were alerted by the child’s screams at about 6am. Bathabile said the child was wrapped in a pink and white towel and wearing light brown baby clothes. “The baby was crying and smelling of alcohol,” she said. Bathabile rushed the baby to Mamelodi Day Hospital, where she spent the day for checkups. The doctor said she was about three months old and did not have any infections or illnesses. Bathabile said it was raining very hard when the baby was dumped. “But the baby survived and she is happy to get the warmth of a parent. I pray the mother can be arrested. I’m grateful to the community of Phomolong for getting up when they heard the child cry and for calling me to go and see what was happening.” She said she never thought her blessing would rise from a dump site.  “I love the child. She wasn’t feeling well, but she is now better,” she said. Bathabile is pleading for nappies , baby milk, food and clothes because she is not working. Local cops confirmed they were investigating a case of child neglect. MEC for Social Development spokesman Thamsanqa Kenke said the baby was not abandoned, but left in the care of the father, who was under the influence. “The social worker is investigating the matter and the child is now in the care of the maternal aunt. A more complete report will be available in November.”
