BERNARD Molekwa has QUIT Polokwane City. "I had a meeting with chairman (Johnny Mogaladi) and we decided it's best we part ways," Molekwa confirmed his resignation, which follows hot on the heels of Clinton Larsen who left the club after they were relegated to the GladAfrica Championship. "I can confirm to you that I am no longer with Polokwane City. It hurts, but life must go on. As a person you need to grow in your career and look for new challenges elsewhere." Molekwa's resignation will come as shock to Rise and Shine fans as he has been loyal to the Limpopo based side. Molekwa has been with City since they got promoted to the top flight in 2013. He has worked as team manager, assistant coach and interim coach on many occasions, mostly when City sacked their coach or someone resigned. "If you stay at one place for a long time makes you feel you're at comfort zone and forget about your future. I have worked with many coaches at City and I have gained lots of experience from them. I think it's time I go solo and try new challenges," said the 43-year-old coach from Bakenberg, Limpopo. Molekwa denied that he left because he was angry with club management for not considering him for the first team coach after Larsen part ways with City at the end of season, last month. City ended the season at the bottom of the DStv Premiership and got relegated to the GladAfrica Championship. City Chief Operations Officer, Tinsy Tema, has made it clear that Rise and Shine are looking for a new coach to lead them in the Championship and are likely to announce him this week. "I hold no grudge against Polokwane City. I am sad to leave this team (City) after they were relegated. It would have been good if I left them (City) when they were still in the top flight. I wish them all the best," Molekwa said.
