THE sound of clapping could be heard as four suspects got bail. The celebration was from the supporters of the suspects, who were bust by the Hawks over the weekend for the alleged fraud, corruption and theft of R4,8 million meant for the development of a livestock farming project. The matter was postponed to 4 December for further police investigations. The suspects bail application was granted after state prosecutor Ntendeleni Mphaphuli said they didn’t have previous convictions and were not a flight risk. “We have strong evidence against the suspects. We checked their financial records and the reasonable amount for bail should be more than R100 000, given the R4,8 million that was allegedly stolen,” he said. Beneficiaries of the project weren’t happy with the bail amount. Chief Kgolongwane Makgato said: “The bail amount is very little because they stole millions from us. “We got the money through land claims. Our mission was to create jobs for the community, but that’s still a wish since the money was stolen.”
