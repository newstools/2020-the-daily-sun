He wants to help up-and-coming musicians. Andile told SunBuzz: “To celebrate 20 years, we have exciting news for songwriters and singers. As part of building my legacy, I want to give young musicians an opportunity. “We’ll scout for talent and they’ll get to open for me during my tour for my new album. We want to give them a boost, something we never had.”“I never got to share the stage with the people I looked up to and I wanted young musicians to get that opportunity. Andile said 20 years in the industry have been bumpy, but he’s grateful to have made it. “I think about this journey from 2 000 when I recorded my first album,” he said.

People didn’t understand my style.” “I had written new songs and most gospel songs back then we normal hymns that everyone knew. So when I started singing new music, my music took a knock,”he said. He released an album, Chapter Ten: The Fullness, in May. “The road to Chapter Ten has been fulfilling. This is a personal album. “It’s about everything I’ve been through in 20 years. And 31 awards later, I’d like to thank every producer I’ve ever worked with. “They’re Thabang Mosheshoe, Percy Ingles, Ntokozo Ngongoma, Nathi Shongwe, Reggie Gcwensa, Shafrack Ndlovu and Ntuthuko Dlamini. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the work we did together.”
