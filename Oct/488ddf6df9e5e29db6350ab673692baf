VETERAN midfielder Renelwe Letsholonyane will be retained by TS Galaxy next season, according to club chairman Tim Sukazi. Sukazi says players like Letsholonyane are a rare breed and cannot be let go easily, as his experience will come in handy having seen them all in football circles. It was unclear what will happen to Letsholonyane after Sukazi bought the DStv Premiership status of Highlands Park. Letsholonyane joined the now defunct Tembisa-club on a one-year deal last year, just after the past term had started after leaving SuperSport United. “Letsholonyane has signed with us,” confirmed Sukazi in Durban where his marketing and PR team were auditioning for dancers, models and performers at Bat Centre on Sunday. “And you have to ask yourself what is the thinking behind having Letsholonyane. First of all, his contract had expired at Highlands Park and we looked into his situation and we said ‘there’s a professional, legend, good servant of the game and who’s got so much knowledge’. “‘Are we really going to be the one that will let go such a person?’ No! I think he’s got a lot of knowledge that would help our team and those inexperience players.” True to Sukazis’words, Letsholonyane, now 38, has won it all in the PSL. He has claimed two league titles, two MTN8, two Telkom Knockout and two Nedbank Cup. He was unfortunately in the losing finalist in the Caf Confederation Cup events where SuperSport went down to TP Mazembe in 2017. What also drew Sukazi to keep the former Kaizer Chiefs, SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana is because of his forward thinking, and rarely play a back pass. Add to that, Galaxy’s type of football is to keep position and that is a big compliment to coach Dan Malesela's emphasis of playing football on the ground. “The most surprising thing about Yeye is that he can still play and you’ll see that yourself,” added Sukazi. “And knowing how TS Galaxy plays, it suits his style so he’s very critical cog of our machinery.”
