CHILDREN were kept out of school for a large portion of the year to prevent the spread of Covid-19. To date, more than 50% of parents believe the roads are not safe enough for their children to use when making their way to school. Managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, said much importance must be placed on creating safe roads for children, as what was placed on preventing the transmission of Covid-19. “In South Africa, where the majority of children need to make their way to school by walking, cycling or using public transport, it is essential that not only authorities but drivers themselves do their part in making sure a child does not face danger just by going to school,” he said. “Authorities must do their part in ensuring there is strict regulation on school routes and resulting penalties when this is disobeyed.” He said drivers need to obey the regulation and use extra caution when they see schoolchildren on the road. “Every organisation or person who can affect road safety for children, needs to do their part in making safer roads for all.” The fact that, as much as half of parents are not satisfied with safety levels on the roads, was revealed in an international opinion survey conducted by YouGov for the Child Health Initiative. The survey also revealed that in South Africa: •79% of adults support road closures, speed reduction and restrictions on cars near schools. •65% of parents would change children’s school journeys to walking and cycling as part of Covid-19 social distancing measures but only if streets are safe Private organisations, government and parents can work together within their communities to ensure the right safety interventions for their areas are implemented. “The concerns of South African parents are not unfounded. Road crashes, including those where a child is a pedestrian, is one of the leading causes of death among South African children,” said Herbert.
