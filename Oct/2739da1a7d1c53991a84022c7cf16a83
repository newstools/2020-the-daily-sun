KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt was delighted to see his side progress to the semi-finals of the MTN 8 despite a below par performance. Amakhosi had to come from a goal down to overcome a resilient Maritzburg United outfit at FNB Stadium on Sunday. They will face arch rivals Orlando Pirates in the semi-finals of the Wafa Wafa competition. Although Hunt wasn't impressed by his side's overall performance against the Team of Choice, he was pleased with the result. “We were poor and a bit all over the show in the first half. Also, our back four was stretched,” said Hunt. "We changed a few things in the second half and we played better after that. It was not an easy game to come from behind, but the most important thing is to go through to the second round." Hunt, who is never shy of giving young players a chance, wasted little time doing so at Amakhosi. He handed young Nkosingiphile Ngcobo a start and also introduced Njabulo Blom and Happy Mashiane in the second half. Hunt also played fullback Ramahlwe Mphahlele as a centre back, a position Hunt believes the 30-year-old is most likely to see more action in. “I think Ramahlwe Mphahlele will play centre back most of the time,” revealed Hunt. “At his age, I don’t see him going up and down as much on the flanks as he used to. We also did not have much in centre with Mulomowandau Mathoho injured. We had Siyabonga Ngezana, who came in the second half. I had a chat with ‘Rama’ and worked with him throughout the week. If nothing happens that will be more of a long-term plan."
