FORMER ANC MP Vincent Smith has been granted R30 000 bail by the Joburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court sitting in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni. He appeared today at Palm Ridge Magistrates Court for fraud and corruption relating to state capture. READ: I SAID SORRY TO MY RAPIST Earlier, Smith handed himself over at Alberton Police Station. The magistrate said he attentively listened to his affidavit in support of his bail application. “He indicated he intends on pleading not guilty and he denies the allegations against him. He has a passport and he’s willing to surrender it to the investigation team.” Smith also assured the court through his affidavit that he would not interfere with investigations or the justice system in general. The state has not opposed bail, informing the court they verified his residential address and didn’t see him as a flight risk. He has known about the pending arrest for some time and has co-operated with the investigation team throughout. The magistrate said the court was satisfied after considering the merits in Smith’s affidavit, as well as the reason for not opposing application for bail that the interest of justice permitted his release on bail and granted it.
