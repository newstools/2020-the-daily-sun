Several people have died on Limpopo roads between Friday and today. The latest accident happened on the R101 near the Ranch hotel in the early hours of this morning. Three women, excluding the driver, died when the VW Polo they were travelling in collided with a Ford Bakkie and both vehicles overturned. The driver of the Polo is in a critical condition, while the driver of the bakkie managed to escape with minor injuries. Last night, a driver of a VW Polo died when he collided head on with a BMW sedan on the R71 road near Polokwane. Reckless and negligent driving was revealed as the possible cause of the accident. It is alleged that the deceased, a 31 year old driver was driving at a high speed and recklessly overtaking other vehicles. Mike Maringa, a spokesman for the Limpopo Transport Department, confirmed that on Saturday again, three people died when the Iveco minibus they were travelling in hit a truck from behind on the N1 near Nyl river in the Waterberg area. One person was critically injured and seven sustained minor injuries from the crash. “The number of fatalities recorded is less compared to nine registered in the previous weekend. Transport and Community Safety MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya urges drivers to be cautious to minimize accidents. The province is encouraging a Zero fatal October Transport month.” “The law enforcement officers are out in their numbers to ensure compliance on the roads. In the past weekend alone, 311 drivers were charged for over-speeding. Five hundred and seventy were screened for alcohol and 39 motorists were arrested for drunk driving,” Maringa said.
