CAVIN Johnson has expressed his appreciation to Al Ahly coach, Pitso Mosimane, who has called for his assistance with the Egyptian giants. Not only that Mosimane chose him as his assistant at the Red Eagles, but also that he will be involved with Africa’s Club of the Century, “what more could you ask for?”. “I’m thrilled, honoured and ecstatic! Coach Pitso had many other options and coaches that he could have chosen, but he chose me. For Pitso to identify me to help him, it’s such a great honour.” Mosimane shocked the local football fraternity by taking up the coaching job at Africa’s most successful club following his failed attempt to lure Rhulani Mokwena, who opted to stay on at Downs. Johnson is expected leave for Cairo on Tuesday to join Mosimane.
