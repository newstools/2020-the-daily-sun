EIGHT people have died and 13 others injured in a road crash involving a taxi. The incident happened this morning in Cape Town. According to Western Cape government Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokeswoman, Deanne Bessick, they responded to the incident that took place on N7 at the Melbos turn off earlier this morning. “WCGH’s EMS, along with various other services, arrived at the scene and discovered a stationary light motor vehicle (sedan) in the middle of the road and a taxi that ended up on its side, as well as a female entrapped in the taxi and a male who was trapped in the sedan. The male and female were extracted from the taxi and the sedan with Jaws of Life by EMS’ Metro Rescue,” said Bessick. Traffic cops spokeswoman Maxine Bezuidenhout said they closed Mamre road and the N7 after the incident. Speaking to the SunTeam, witness Mary Muzambindo said she saw a woman trapped under the taxi. “People did not do anything but waited for the EMS and other emergency services crews to come. Others suggested to lift up the taxi so that they can retrieve the woman who was crying in pain, but traffic cops said lifting the taxi may have killed her. The scene was scary, bodies were scattered all over,” said Mary. . Bessick said eight patients, five men and three women, sustained fatal injuries and their bodies were taken to Paarl government mortuary. “EMS transported a seriously injured man to Tygerberg Hospital, as well another man with light injuries, a male with serious injuries and a female with light injuries to Wesfleur Hospital. EMS also transported a seriously injured female patient and a male with light injuries to Somerset Hospital. Skymed transported a female with serious injuries to Groote Schuur Hospital. Furthermore, six patients were transported to Tygerberg, Wesfleur, Somerset and Groote Schuur Hospitals by private emergency services,” said Bessick.
