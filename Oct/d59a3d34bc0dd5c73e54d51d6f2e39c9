COPS are warning VW Polo TSI owners to be vigilant. This after six of these cars were hijacked in the space of a month in Duduza, Ekurhuleni. In some of the incidents, a driver was killed, while the other drivers had their belongings such as cellphones, laptops and cash stolen. Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza Police Station said the driver who was killed was driving his red Polo along Harry Gwala Street when he stopped to greet a friend. “A white Ford Fiesta with unknown occupants stopped behind him. An unknown man got out and approached the victim with a firearm,” said Manaka. “The victim tried to drive away and the suspect fired a shot through the driver’s window. The victim managed to drive for about 400m before crashing into a yard.” The owner of the yard said they were lucky the car didn’t crash into their house. “We were sitting in the house when I saw the car plough into my yard, removing the fence and my stall,” he said. Paramedics certified the driver dead on the scene. Another driver, also from Duduza, was hijacked. Manaka said the owner of a grey Polo alleged that he was approached by four men wearing face masks while he was opening the gate at his home. “One man demanded the car keys. The driver refused, but the suspect took them by force. “He wrestled with the suspect, but a second suspect joined in and they tried to put the driver in the boot of his car. “The driver managed to fight them off, but a shot was fired and he let go,” said Manaka. He said the man’s girlfriend was dragged out of the vehicle before all suspects drove off. The driver also lost his two iPhones 7s, house keys and a laptop. Duduza station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Bheki Mhlungu said the police were doing everything in their power to trace these criminals.
