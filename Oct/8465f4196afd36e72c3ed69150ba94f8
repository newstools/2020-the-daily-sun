South Africa faces coronavirus, gender-based violence and fraudulent activities happening in the church. These activities happening in churches are well-known. The question is: how to combat these evil deeds perpetrated by those weâ€™re supposed to look up to as spiritual leaders? Churches should be regulated in order to control the mushrooming of these fly-by-night churches. The regulation of churches is a controversial matter. But government should create a ministry of religion as well as body institutions where all churches should be registered, only if they qualify in terms of the set norms and standards of that ministry. Churches that are not registered should be immediately closed. Government officials should be stationed at all registered churches to collect all the money received from the congregants. That money should be deposited into a special kitty to be used to pay the salaries of pastors, reverends and other servants in the church. It should also be used towards the running costs of the churches. This way, the exploitation of innocent people by the churches would be put under control, let alone eliminated. - Letter by Vutivi Shibambo
