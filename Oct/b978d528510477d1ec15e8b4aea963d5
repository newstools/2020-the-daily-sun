#OPERATIONVULAPRESIDENT artists are threatening to shutdown another national key point after the case of 32 of them was withdrawn by Pinetown Magistrates Court on Friday. They were bust after closing the N3 in Durban last month. Leader Thokozani “Tzozo” Zulu told Daily Sun they identified another national key point, but would keep it a secret for now. He said they still didn’t agree with Covid-19 regulations to only allow 250 people at indoor events and 500 people outdoors. “We will not rest until we get what we want as artists. We are not criminals, but want to do our work as usual. “How can an event organiser organise an event with 250 people indoors or 500 outdoors? Where should event organisers get money to pay for sound systems, stage, artists, security, the venue and other things? “No event organiser will do such and artists will remain hungry,” he said.  Tzozo, KZN chairman of the Cultural and Creative Industries Federation of SA, said if President Cyril Ramaphosa didn’t change the regulations, they’d surprise him with another national key point blockage. “We’re not scared of the police because those cops failed to arrest protesting farmers in Senekal in the Free State. So they must leave us alone and let us do what we do to get what we want,” he said. KZN artists blocked the N3 with a truck last month, causing traffic chaos while demanding the president bring back festivals. Police fired at them with rubber bullets and teargas and 32 of them were arrested. Among those who were bust were former Uzalo actors Khaya Dladla and Nokuthula Mabika, kwaito star Character Langa and singer Naima Kay.
