TOYOTA’S much-loved Land Cruiser Prado has received an upgrade with more power and torque. At the heart of the revised range is an additional 20kW of power and 50Nm of torque derived from the switch to the new-generation 2.8-litre GD-6 turbo diesel engine. The Prado’s Overlanding and towing credentials benefit from the higher-performance engine that now delivers a maximum of 150kW and 500Nm. The latest generation 2.8 GD-6 engine from the updated Hilux has received a range of upgrades including a new ball-bearing turbocharger with a larger turbine and impeller. Despite the substantially stronger outputs, fuel consumption improves to 7.9 litres/100km, and CO2 emissions are down to 209 g/km. Fuel capacity is 150 litres with an 87-litre main tank and 63-litre sub-tank. A new-generation multimedia system is fitted across the range, which now incorporates a larger nine-inch touchscreen display, enhanced voice recognition and compatibility with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
