Those people are not weird students of life, but are what we call sapiosexual beings. A sapiosexual is a person who finds intelligence sexually attractive or arousing. The word sapio comes from the Latin verb sapere, meaning “to be wise” or “to have sense”. Sapiosexuals think that intelligence is the most attractive trait and value it more than a potential partner’s looks or even personality. According to experts, sapiosexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by sexual and erotic attraction to potential partners who are, first and foremost, intelligent. So the next question would be: How would you spot a sapiosexual? 1. Intellectual spark is more important to them than the emotional spark. 2.
