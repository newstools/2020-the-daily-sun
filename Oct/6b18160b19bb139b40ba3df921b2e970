A BIZARRE dress with a built-in mask from Pretty Little Thing had tongues wagging after it sold out within 24 hours of being on sale. The dress, which resembles a turtle neck with ear hooks attached to it, blew people’s minds with some saying that PLT has reached the peak of 2020 fashion. Kate Moss’ sister Lottie Moss was spotted in the face mask dress in London and customers have been begging the retailer to restock the dress.  The spokesperson said it will be restocking in new colours at the end of this week. “And then printed version (including PLT branded ones) next Tuesday.” This is a game-changer as you won’t have to worry about leaving your mask at home when you have this dress on.
