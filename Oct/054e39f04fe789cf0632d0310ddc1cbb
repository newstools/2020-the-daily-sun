IT’S been almost a year and the Mtswenis are still waiting for the remains of their loved one to be released. On 16 December last year Penuel Shabangu (22) from Weltevrede in Mpumalanga and two friends were in a taxi when it caught fire. The driver survived, but Shabangu and a friend were burnt beyond recognition. Penuel’s aunt, Bongi Mtsweni, (42) told Daily Sun families of the dead were required to undergo DNA tests. As both Penuel’s parents were dead, they sent his clothes for the test. She said the family started preparing for the funeral after the other victim’s DNA test results came out positive. Said Bongi: “We had hope that since the other body was correctly identified, police would release Penuel’s remains. “But we were told the results were negative. “We waited for another week, which turned into months.” Bongi didn’t understand why the results were negative. “We asked the investigating officer to use one of us for the tests, but he said only the parents could be used.” She said police had told them they could’t risk releasing the remains and had to wait for the process to finish. “It’s almost a year now and our wounds aren’t healing,” she said. Family member Julia Mtsweni (41) said the taxi driver confirmed he was with the two deceased during the accident. “All we want is for the remains to be released,” she said. “Then we can find closure knowing we laid him to rest.” Gauteng police spokesman, Captain Kay Makhubele, told the People’s Paper: “The case is still on and the driver is attending court, as he was charged with culpable homicide and reckless driving. “The body can’t be released without the positive identification of the deceased.”
