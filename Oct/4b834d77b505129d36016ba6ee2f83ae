RANGERS coach Steven Gerrard could hand new-signing Bongani Zungu his debut on Thursday. Zungu, who joined Rangers earlier this month, has completed his two-week quarantine period in Scotland and is rearing to go. And he could well make his first appearance for the Scottish Premier League side in their Europa League group D home fixture against Lech Poznan. "(We are) very excited to have Bongani Zungu involved. It would have been a long two weeks for him," said Gerrard in Wednesday. "He trained today which was fantastic. He will certainly feel that one-hour session later today but he is smiling and it was great to have him here." The week just gets better for Zungu, who also turns 28 this month. He has returned to the Bafana Bafana squad, called up for the upcoming back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe. "Training went well. It felt great to be out of the house and touch the ball," Zungu said. "feel good physically and feel confident. If the manager decides to give me a chance I feel ready to go." He would not be drawn on his Bafana call up.
