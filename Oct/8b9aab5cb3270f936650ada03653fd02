MPUMALANGA cops have launched a manhunt for unknown murderers after the half-naked body of mortuary worker Mahlokonolo Chuene (43) was found dumped with a bullet wound to his head near the road in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge this morning at about 2am. A shocked colleague told Daily Sun Mahlokonoloknocked off and went to a nearby local tavern to have fun and it was the last time he was seen. “In the early hours, police alerted the security guard at our branch that someone with a similar uniform to us has been found dead metres from our branch on the main road. “We then rushed to the scene and found our colleague lying down in the pool of blood and we don’t know what led to his death, because he left us going to have some drinks. His death has shocked us. He was a good colleague to us and was enjoying his work at our branch. But our wishes are that his killer be found.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police were notified by a motorist after noticing a dumped body near the road early this morning. “He had a bullet wound on his head and was certified dead on the scene by paramedics.
