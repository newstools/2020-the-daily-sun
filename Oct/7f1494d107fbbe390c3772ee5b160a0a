Government must grant amnesty to and expunge the records of ex-cons. Prisoners are also human beings, and they deserve a second chance. Therefore, the onus rests on government to create jobs for them without checking their criminal past. Government claims to rehabilitate prisoners. And it’s the very same government that decided that you can’t work as a policeman or prison warder if you have a criminal record. The main question here is: whose responsibility is it then to hire ex-cons after government has released them on parole? It’s double punishment to deprive ex-cons of a second chance and job opportunities. Why judge and punish them based on their criminal past? I’m therefore inviting Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola to a public round-table debate on this matter.
