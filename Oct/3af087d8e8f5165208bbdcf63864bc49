Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza cops said that the thugs robbed a spaza shop owner in Coolbreeze in Masechaba, Duduza on Friday. “The owner was in her fast food business, which is an outside building adjoining the house, when two men entered the premises,” he said. Manaka said one suspect was armed and they took the woman’s two cellphones. He said the thugs then led the victim into the main house where they demanded cash. When the complainant said she didn’t have any, they ransacked the house. “The two suspects were joined by another and altogether they left with a TV and R300.” In another incident, also on Friday, a 26-year-old man was shot five times in his spaza shop, but survived.
