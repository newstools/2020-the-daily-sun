 KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt is a big fan of youngster Njabulo Blom. Hunt, who has never been shy to give young players a chance, is already doing so at Amakhosi. In his first match in charge, the former Bidvest Wits handed 20-year-old Nkosingiphile Ngcobo a start against Maritzburg United in the MTN 8. Hunt also brought in youngsters Blom and Happy Mashiane from the bench as Amakhosi beat the Team of Choice 2-1 to advance to the semi-finals of the competition. Hunt, who cannot bring in any new players due to Chiefs' transfer ban, is happy to turn to the youngsters. He was particularly impressed with Blom, who came on and transformed Chiefs' midfield." This youngster we got, Blom, I think he's the future," said Hunt. "He's got huge ability, I've only watched him for a week but I've really been impressed with him. "I didn't want to start him, I should have maybe but in hindsight, everything is always easy in football. "But I thought he's certainly one for me, he can cover distances and has a great engine. He can play also. "He came on and in the first 30 seconds played a big long ball to Parker who could have scored. He's got a range of passing, he's a full package in midfield.\ "But he's a young player who needs time, I'll give him time. I'll work with him and show him a few things, see how it goes."
