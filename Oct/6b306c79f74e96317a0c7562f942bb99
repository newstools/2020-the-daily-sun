Qhoshangokwenzakwakhe Sibisi aims to break new ground with his upcoming music video, Ukipite Nesalukwazi. The music video is set to be released this month. The video was shot in Ballito, on the KZN North Coast. “I chose this location because it’s exclusive,” he said. “I wanted something that’s fresh and different from the other maskandi videos.” “I’m certain the music video will appeal to those living in urban and rural areas.” The musician said the video highlights the dangers of gender inequality. “It’s directed at parents to teach boys to do house chores, so they can take care of themselves. This music video talks about gender equality, especially in the rural areas. “I’ve seen situations whereby young men choose to cohabite with older women simply because they want them to cook, wash the dishes, do laundry and do the ironing for them. They basically want a mother figure in their lives. These types of relationships usually end in tears because they are not based on love but on favors,” said Qhosha. “It seeks to educate society that boys and girls should be treated equally. “It teaches and promotes equality from a very young age.” He used the rural areas because the practice is rife there compared to urban areas.

Qhosha told SunBuzz: “In my research I found that most young boys, particularly those in the rural areas, are raised in such a way that they’re unable to take care of themselves. “From a young age boys are treated like little kings at home, whereas young girls are treated like little wives. “As a result, when these young girls go out, there they can easily take care of themselves but young men usually struggle to stand on their own.Many of these boys can’t cook, iron or even clean their flats. “As a result, they end up cohabiting with older women in exchange for these benefits.” Qhosha said the video is already out and the song is on high rotation on radio.
