A MADALA cheated death after a mob set him and his house alight. This after the body of his wife, gogo Agnes Maswanganyi (60), was found hanging from a tree in nearby bushes in Ngove Village, outside Giyani in Limpopo. Agnes went missing on Tuesday. Villagers went on a rampage after accusing the 64-year-old madala and his friend of being involved in her disappearance and death. They torched his two mud houses and set him alight. The madala was rushed to hospital with severe injuries. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the public order policing unit responded swiftly. Ngoepe said the angry crowd tried to burn another house.  “Police responded swiftly and managed to stop them,” Ngoepe told Daily Sun. “At this stage the situation is quiet, but the public order policing unit is monitoring the situation.” He said arson and attempted murder cases were opened. No one had been arrested yet and investigations were continuing.  Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba told the People’s Paper: “We won’t allow this kind of behaviour in our province. “The suspects will be hunted down and brought to book.” He was referring to the mob. Anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects is urged to contact Colonel Robert Mudau on 082 729 0351.
