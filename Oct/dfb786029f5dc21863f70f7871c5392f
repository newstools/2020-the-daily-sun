THE Broadcast Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) has received several complaints regarding Cheeky Palate. This comes after outrage by members of the LGBTIQ+ community after television presenter Gerry Rantseli-Elsdon made homophobic remarks during her appearance as a guest on the 1Magic reality TV show. During the show, which saw some of Mzansi’s most high profile guests tackling the topic of spirituality, Gerry said: “The word of God is very specific. The bottom line is the word of God is very clear that homosexuality is a sin. “Having said that, the first command is to love. And in that it vein it would not matter who you are, homosexual or not, there is always a place for you at the cross,” she said. Shouneez Martin, who is a registrar at the BCCSA, confirmed to Daily Sun that they have received complaints regarding the show. “At this stage, we can confirm that we have received complaints and that the broadcaster is aware of the complaints.” MultiChoice spokesman Benedict Maaga told the SunTeam: Cheeky Palate is a new reality show on 1Magic hosted by Phat Joe, in which participants are encouraged to express their views on a variety of topical matters. “The first episode featured guests from different walks of life, who were invited to speak to their experiences and thoughts on spirituality. “We acknowledge concerns expressed by some viewers who may have been offended by some of the views expressed on the show, particularly around the LGBTIQ+ community. “The views expressed are not those of MultiChoice which embrace diversity, equality and inclusion,” he said.
