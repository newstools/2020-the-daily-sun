Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and his wife, Dr May, should get well soon. The minister has been at the forefront in the fight against the deadly coronavirus. Unfortunately, he and his wife tested positive for the disease. It’s good that the couple are self-isolating. Mkhize is leading by example. Regular updates from his department have been helpful. We should remain careful and safe as the second wave of Covid-19 is looming. This disease is a real threat and we should protect ourselves and those around us. Minister Gwede Mantashe and Minister Thulas NxesiI are some of the top public servants who recovered from Covid-19. We’ve made serious strides in the fight against the pandemic. Let’s take care of ourselves. I wish the Mkhizes a speedy recovery. Letter by Rachel Molema Theresa Mews
