THE family of a grade 6 pupil is pleading with Good Samaritans to buy him a bicycle. The donkey he used to ride to get to Tshiheni Primary School died in January. Faranani Mabuli (14) is now forced to walk an hour and a half from his home in Moremelani Village, outside Makhado in Limpopo, to get to school. Faranani, whose mum died in 2011, lives with his aunt Selina Namandivhe (44) and they survive on the money she gets from piece jobs and child grants. Selina told Daily Sun: “When the donkey, which belonged to  a neighbour, was still alive he’d walk one day and ride it the next. ”She wanted to buy Faranani  a bicycle, but it would mean not being able to buy food for the entire month. “Faranani still needs a proper uniform and school shoes because his are old and in tatters,” she said. His cousin, Mpho Rambuwana, (25) said when Faranani arrived at school on the donkey, he’d release it to feed in nearby bushes and fetch it when he needed to go home. “He was close to that donkey and it was like it knew his situation,” he said. “It’s hard for us as a family.  I thought I’d get a job when I finished matric but nothing positive is coming my way. “Faranani’s story is a true  reflection of our family’s circumstances, and if he gets a bicycle I believe he’ll finish his schooling and become an inspiration one day.”
