OFTEN, women go crazy for men with deep voices, but it turns out that men with deep voices are more likely to cheat on their partners. Researchers from Southwest University in Chongqing, China claim that the pitch of a man’s voice can be used to tell if he is likely to cheat. The team studied 116 male students and 145 female students who were in relatively short relationships and the participants were recorded saying the same phrases, allowing the researchers to assess the depth of their voice and were also asked how likely they were to cheat when in a relationship. READ: WHY ARE WOMEN ATTRACTED TO A MAN’S DEEP VOICE? An analysis of the results revealed that men with deep voices were the most likely to cheat but women’s voices were not linked to their likelihood to cheat. In the study published in Personality and Individual Differences, the researchers, led by Jing Zhang, said: “Our findings demonstrated that masculine men are more likely to engage in infidelity and commit less to their romantic relationships compared with feminine men.” They added: “This result might suggest that masculine voices and infidelity development in men have the same biological basis, that is, they are influenced by testosterone levels. “Another probable reason that men with masculine voices have a stronger intention to commit infidelity and positive attitudes toward infidelity is increased access to mates. “Masculine voices among males are significantly associated with long-term health and social dominance, and are more likely to be perceived as attaining higher social positions, all of which were valuable for women during evolutionary history. “Given that, the relationship between men’s vocal characteristics and infidelity intentions is more likely to be mediated by increased access to women. It is necessary for future studies to explore this relationship.”
