KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt has warned Khama Billiat to put the team first and himself second in order to play in his side. Hunt lashed out at the Zimbabwean winger for playing as an individual instead of a unit. The former Bidvest Wits mentor made this statement after he guided his side to a 1-0 win over Chippa United in a DStv Premiership match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday night. Said Hunt: “He can’t think of himself. I mean on Saturday (against Mamelodi Sundowns) he tried to shoot from corner flags and things like that and it’s not acceptable I told him.” However, the former Bidvest Wits mentor revealed that Billiat has been frustrated due to lack of goals. He went on: “Khama is a little bit frustrated, he hasn’t scored much in last couple games. He’s got to simplify the game a little bit more, in the second half he tried to get a little too clever. But to be fair in three games now he has had some good couple chances.” Hunt says Billiat will improve if he keeps working hard. “As long as he keeps running off the ball, keeps defending, keeps doing the right things he will keep playing. I think if he breaks the ice, he will get a couple of goals and I thought tonight was a chance, he hit the post once or twice. The second one he should have score, but he is working hard, team first, him second and he will be okay, that’s the most important thing. As long as we advise him he will get better.”
