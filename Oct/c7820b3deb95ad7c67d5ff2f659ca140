RAPPER Cassper Nyovest has revealed that he had contracted Covid-19 During an interview with American radio personality Kojo Ebro Odogwu, the new dad spoke about life during the pandemic and his album, that dropped last month. Although he wasn’t specific about when he contracted it, he said he was training for the boxing match with AKA. “The training was so hectic that my fitness got very high and just at the peak of my fitness, I contracted Covid-19 in a meeting.

And somehow I caught it and if I wasn’t called by the person who tested positive then I wouldn’t have known. “I just had a little headache and I thought someone hit my head too hard. So I went and got tested and I found out I was positive,” he said. Cassper said he was isolated for 14 days and seven days into the isolation he had a terrible fever. But he said seven days after the fever, he started training again. The rapper also spoke about the financial difficulties that came with the pandemic. “It took away jobs from the people that are around me. And I made a decision to still pay employees, even though no one was working,” he continued. Kojo also spoke to Cassper about his songs and their meaning as well as the artists that he featured in the project.
