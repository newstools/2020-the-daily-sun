RELATIONSHIPS between Kermit Erasmus and Bafana Bafana coaches haven’t always been cordial. His public outbursts over omission from the set-up in the past are well documented. But there can be no doubting Erasmus’ commitment since he returned to the national team fold where he plans to revive the national team, as well as his international career. Erasmus missed out on the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) under ex-coach Stuart Baxter, but fought hard to force himself back in the reckoning under incumbent Molefi Ntseki. He is part of the 25-man team that is travelling to Rustenburg for the back-to-back friendly matches against Namibia and Zambia on Thursday and on Sunday, respectively. At 30, the new Mamelodi Sundowns striker is easily a senior member of the squad and a lot will be expected from him in the coming international matches. “It’s been exciting to be back, seeing that we had a challenge with the coronavirus. Preparation has been good. It’s good to see everybody back in camp and looking forward to the upcoming games,” said Erasmus. Erasmus was in sizzling form in the Premiership last season, missing out on the top scorer prize with four goals. He was on the bench when Bafana faced Japan in a pre-World Cup friendly, but made his international debut in an Afcon qualifier against Niger in Mbombela, 10 years ago. Since then he has been in and out of the team. However, under Ntseki he has been receiving regular call-ups. “Hopefully I can continue my form for the national team and contribute positively. It’s been tough with the virus. We’ve got to adapt and hopefully get positive results,” Erasmus added. Erasmus was among the locally-based players who trekked to Royal Marang hotel to resume preparations. Bafana have enjoyed considerable success in Rustenburg and Ntseki hopes their luck continues against neighbours.
