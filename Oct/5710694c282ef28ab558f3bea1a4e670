DOBSONVILLE residents in Soweto are gatvol and want the cops to start doing their job. They took to the streets to deliver a memorandum of grievances to Dobsonville police. Their march started at 5am yesterday.  Phillip Matsawame said his wife was killed in July this year. “My wife was robbed, raped and brutally murdered, but no one has been held accountable. I feel the police don’t take GBV cases seriously because perpetrators are arrested, but you see them walk past your house.” He said they needed patrollers to be stationed in their kasi to ensure their safety.  “Roodepoort and Dobsonville have had so many deaths this year alone. We vow the kasi will be shut down should there be another murder,” Phillip told Daily Sun. Community leader Bongani Shikuhele said crime was high in their area and they wanted it to stop. “Despite all the reported robberies, burglaries and GBV cases, there’s still no police visibility in our kasi. The community organised their own patrollers, which were later stopped by the police from operating.” He said the residents demanded that police management be changed as it was ineffective. “We have unsolved cases dating back four years. We’ve asked cops to join us several times in our meetings to help them understand our plight, but with no luck.”
