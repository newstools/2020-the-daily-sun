ANOTHER chairman from GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC has been shot dead. Acting club’s chairman Sthembiso Chamane was shot dead in the township called Hundred, in Tongaat last night, while driving to his home. Armed men stopped him with AK 47 firearms and shot him repeatedly and when he was getting assistant that didn’t help as he was declared dead. Chamane was acting after Nicholas Mkhize, the club chairman Nicholas Mkhize, was gunned down on 12 September 2018. Mkhize was shot after leaving a technical meeting with other club members where they discussed plans for their next league game then. “Our acting chairman Chamane was shot dead in Tongaat last night with plenty of bullets while in his car,” said the club director Nkosinathi Chili. With this happening for the second time for the club, Chili says their lives are not safe anymore. “We are shocked and we don’t know what we did wrong,” said Chili. “Even when we are sitting together in a meeting, we even joke to ourselves on who is next because signs are there someone is next. “We don’t know what we did wrong that we can’t be forgiven we are deeply saddened to see our fellow colleagues are passing away in this manner because you can see this thing is planned.” Mkhize’s death was related to being shot by hitmen since he was a taxi owner in Ixopo, Northern part of KwaZulu-Natal. And this of Chamane, it is not clear why he was killed.
