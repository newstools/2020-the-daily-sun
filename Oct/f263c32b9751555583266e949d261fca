THE uMkhonto we Sizwe military veterans are not willing to back down until Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula is behind bars. Association members marched from Luthuli House to Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s office yesterday, demanding action be taken against Mbalula. They claimed he deliberately took no action while railway infrastructure was vandalised. Speaking to Daily Sun, their secretary-general Thanduxolo Ndyondo said they demanded Mbalula be held accountable. “He relieved all the security guards of their duties and made no alternative means to keep the infrastructure looked after during lockdown. “Now, there’s nothing left of Kliptown, Booysens and Orange Farm train stations, to name a few,” said Ndyondo. He said in November last year, Prasa security contracts were terminated and cases of theft and vandalism immediately spiked. “In December the guards were brought back, but the damage had already been done,” he said. He said in April contracts were terminated again, and this was not only about infrastructure, but people’s income. Ndyondo said government was sidelining veterans. “We’re well-trained yet have nothing to do. We’re excluded in all sectors of government and aren’t benefiting like we’re supposed to,” he said. The veterans demanded Premier David Makhura address them, but he sent a representative. Yesterday, Mbalula angered the veterans when he took to Twitter and claimed they were “tired self-defence units calling themselves MK with old Gupta-sponsored camouflage uniform that’s worn out”. But Ndyondo said Mbalula they were not deterred.
