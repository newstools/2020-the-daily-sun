SUPERSPORT United coach Kitano Tembo feels that his goalkeeper Ronwen Williams should be crowned the 2019-20 Premier Soccer League (PSL) goalkeeper of the season. Williams is a strong contender to claim his second successive Absa Premiership Goalkeeper of the Season award after keeping 13 clean sheets in 30 appearances this past season. He is nominated alongside the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns Denis Onyango and Daniel Akpeyi of Kaizer Chiefs. The awards are scheduled for Thursday night (8pm) and will be broadcasted live on SuperSport TV. Tembo feels that Williams has an edge over others.Tembo said: “He (Williams) deserves it he has done well, to be honest. “His progress is unbelievable. He has the most number of clean-sheets and he is becoming Bafana Bafana's’ number one. “I think we should give him that credit for working so hard. I do not want to talk about other goalkeepers, but Williams deserves it. Tembo added: “He just stepped up from being our vice-captain to being a captain that should maturity. I think for the past two seasons he has had the most number of clean sheets.” Williams has managed 12 and 13 clean sheets in the previous two seasons respectively, in which he made a total of 60 league appearances.
