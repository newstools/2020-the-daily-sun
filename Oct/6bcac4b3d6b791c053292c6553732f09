PUPILS outside the Fairvale Secondary School in Wentworth, Durban were injured yesterday after a reckless driver ploughed into them. Apparently, they were on their way home when the driver drove past them and started drag racing. In a 30-second video of the incident, believed to have been filmed by a pupil and which has gone viral on social media, a white Toyota Corolla is seen driving up and down the road. It turns onto the road and towards the end of the clip, the car is seen veering off the road and crashing into the group of pupils standing against a wall. READ: SOME PASTORS ARE NOW EVIL! One pupil (17) said she was standing near the pupils who were filming the car drag racing. “Most pupils were cheering the driver. Nobody thought the car would lose control like that. But it did and I’m glad I didn’t get injured. It was so sad to see the pupils injured. Some of those with the ones that got injured managed to run away when the car came towards them,” she said. KZN EMS spokesman Robert McKenzie said four pupils were injured after being hit by a car that crashed into them on the side of the road. “Three sustained minor injuries and were transported to hospital in a private car, while one pupil required to be transported to hospital in an ambulance.” Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed the incident and said charges of possession of stolen property, reckless and negligent driving, failing to produce a drivers licence and failing to report injuries after an accident were being investigated by Wentworth cops.
