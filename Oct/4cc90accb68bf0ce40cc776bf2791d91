A mother and her two-year-old daughter were both brutally attacked with a bush knife at their Mount Royal home in Durban on Wednesday. Their attacker escaped and the woman (34) died at the scene, while the little girl passed away while being transported to hospital. The tragedy left residents, especially kids in the area in great shock. One resident said everyone was scared seeing the mother and child bleeding. “We don’t know why the man did such a terrible thing to his baby mama and child. Nobody wants to talk about this because we are all scared,” said the resident. But police bust the suspect for double murder on Wednesday night and the VIP KZN Special Weapons And Tactics team was sent to the area to relieve tension. Yesterday, the children and their parents were feeling a lot more at ease and the parents were reassured the police would do everything to ensure justice will be served. Brigadier Jay Naicker said the man who had been on the run was bust after he fled into the bushes on Wednesday and police cornered off the area and searched for him throughout the night. “He was spotted returning to the house where the murder took place in the early hours of this morning and he was arrested,” said Naicker.
