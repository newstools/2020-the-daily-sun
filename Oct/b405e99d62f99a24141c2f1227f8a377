MAMELODI Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs are the favourites to win the 2020-21 DStv Premiership title. This is the view of Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer. Last season Chiefs were at the top of the season for the better half of the campaign, they were pipped by Sundowns in the last day of the season to finish second. The Buccaneers managed to finish third. Talking during the MTN8 quarter-final press conference Zinnbauer said last season champions and runners’ up are the favorites. “Sundowns won the treble last year‚ and they have lost the coach‚ but he earned this move. But he‚ and the squad that he had‚ won three titles last season at Sundowns, that’s normal they are the favourites,” Zinnbauer said. “They (Sundowns) have‚ 40 or 50 players with top qualities in their squad, we cannot say now they are not the favorites. He went on: “Kaizer Chiefs finished in second place. They were in the top position for a long‚ long time‚ and in the last game they lost that position to finish second, we can now say that both teams will fight for the title. “But we (Pirates) have a chance. We are behind these clubs. But for me, it’s Sundowns or Chiefs who are the favourites this season.” This coming weekend the new season will kick off with MTN8 fixtures where Pirates will hot Cape Town City Pirates on Saturday at Orlando Stadium, 3pm)
