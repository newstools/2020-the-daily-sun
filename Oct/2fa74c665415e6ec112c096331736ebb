BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga has appealed to parents to allow their children to return to school. She told a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday she was concerned some pupils hadn’t returned to school. Motshekga said in the schools she’d visited, the return rate was between 80% and 90%. It’s been four months since schools reopened after the forced closure in March, and it’s one month since all grades have been back. She said safety remained their top priority as the coronavirus was still a threat. About grade 12s, Motshekga said provinces had put measures in place to support them. This included Saturday and Sunday classes. “At this point I need to pay special tribute to our teachers, who’ve sacrificed their time to support the pupils. “The director-general, Mathanzima Mweli, has been visiting provinces to monitor progress and he reports the attendance.” She thanked teachers for heeding the call to return to school. Schools would reopen on 25 January next year.  The school calendar would be gazetted today, after which it would be publicly available. “We’re fully aware that the country needs the school calendar for effective planning purposes,” she said. “And we’ve worked hard to ensure that it’s done properly, taking into account the disruptions that have occurred in 2020.” This year’s National Senior Certificate exams would start on 5 November and end on 15 December.
