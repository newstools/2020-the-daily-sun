FORMER Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi has been denied bail by the Specialised Commercial Crimes court sitting in Palm Ridge. He appeared alongside former ANC MP Vincent Smith who appeared in the same court earlier this month. Magistrate Philip Venter said the interest of justice requires that the incomprehensible amounts of money which were expropriated to be recovered. “The biggest headache of the  National Prosecuting Authority in the Gupta saga and their accountability is extradition to South Africa to stand trial to face the allegations against them. I cannot contribute to yet another name being added to that headache. Mr Agrizzi after all considered, your application for bail is dismissed.”    The court heard that Agrizzi  (56) was a father of two adult kids and a grandfather as well. His house is worth just over R20-million. He handed in his South African passport, but his Italian passport cannot be found. According to the state, this made Agrizzi a severe flight risk and that should he flee to Italy, it would be difficult and expensive to extradite him back to Mzansi.  Agrizzi’s defence argued that he suffered from comorbidities and overall health issues and therefore it would not be ideal for him to be in jail particular during the corona pandemic. He arrived in court carrying a portable oxygen pump, after his failure to appear in court last month and provided medical documentation explaining his health issues.  Agrizzi will be appearing for allegedly bribing for Smith. Vincent Smith had his day in court two weeks ago after he handed himself to the police at the Alberton Police station. He was then a released on R30 000 bail. Agrizzi shot to prominence for spilling beans at the state capture inquiry during his testimony, he implicated a lot of ANC heavy weights when he took the stand before Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo. Agrizzi and Smith are facing corruption and money laundering charges.
