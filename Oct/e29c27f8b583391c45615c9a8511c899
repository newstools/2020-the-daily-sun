WHILE Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Themba Zwane was holed up at home during the lockdown, an imposter using his name was conning unsuspecting people. Daily Sun learnt Zwane, who recently scooped the South African Football Journalists’ Association Men’s Footballer of the Season award, was a victim of identity theft fraud. Mshishi, as the footballer is known, opened a case of fraud in May after he found an imposter was abusing his name. According to the statement he made to the cops, the unknown suspect hacked into his phone and requested friends and family for help to be bailed out of jail. The imposter asked money from a number of people on Facebook, and one of Mshishi’s friends deposited R7 500. The crime only came to the footballer’s attention when he wanted to pay at a shop in Greenstone Shopping Centre in Ekurhuleni. Edenvale cop spokesman Jacob Mashile said a case was opened but no arrests have been made. “Somebody used Zwane’s identity and has been going around requesting money from friends to help bail him out. It went as far as a friend depositing R7 500. The case is still under investigation. “We appeal to all members of the public to be alert, even on social media. On platforms like Facebook, please make sure you hide your personal contact details to avoid such incidents,” said Mashile. Mshishi had not responded to calls and texts at time of publication.
