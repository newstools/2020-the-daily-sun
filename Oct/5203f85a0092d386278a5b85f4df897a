What should have just been a normal Zoom video chat ended up
being shocking viewing for members of the New Yorker and WNYC radio. This comes after a reporter named reporter Jeffrey Toobin
was seen masturbating on a Zoom video chat Russian-American journalist and author Masha Gessen seems to
be the only brave soul to speak out on the record about what occurred during
the fateful ZDI. First, they told the New York Times in the immediate wake of
the incident, “I am quite sure that Toobin didn’t realize that the people on
the New Yorker call could see him. I suspect he thought that when the breakout
rooms started, he was disconnected and he didn’t realize we’d all returned to a
live camera.” he said. Two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order
to speak freely, noted that it was unclear how much each person saw, but both
said that they saw Toobin jerking off. The two sources described a juncture in the election
simulation when there was a strategy session, and the Democrats and Republicans
went into their respective break out rooms for about 10 minutes. At this point, they said, it seemed like Toobin was on a
second video call. The sources said that when the groups returned from their
break out rooms, Toobin lowered the camera. The people on the call said they
could see Toobin touching his 4-5. Toobin then left the call. Moments later,
he called back in, seemingly unaware of what his colleagues had been able to
see, and the simulation continued The New Yorker has suspended reporter Jeffrey Toobin for
masturbating on a Zoom video chat between members of the New Yorker and WNYC
radio last week. Toobin says he did not realize his video was on. “I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was
off-camera. I apologize to my wife, family, friends and co-workers,” Toobin
told Motherboard. “I believed I was not visible on Zoom. I thought no one on
the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video,” he added.
