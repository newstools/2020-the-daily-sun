MZOLI Ngcwawuzela is tired of people calling his family and friends, sending their condolences that he is “dead”. Others would call just to enquire about the funeral dates. On Thursday Mzoli, the owner of the popular Gugulethu tourists attraction shisa nyama Mzoli Meats, hosted a birthday celebration with his family at his home. “I’m celebrating my 66th birthday. I want to thank God for giving me more years. Having a celebration means God gave me another year to live, meaning that I’m alive,” he said. Mzoli said it bothers him that, on several occasions, people thought he was dead. “My family and friends have received calls from people who sent their condolences after rumours of my death spread like wildfire. This has happened not once or twice. It is more than that, probably four or five times. You’d see people coming to my home wanting to comfort and pray for my family. I don’t know why people always think I’m dead when I’m alive and well,” he said. Mzoli said he suffered a stroke while in the Eastern Cape a few years back, but he’s feeling much better. His wife Maphindi said the issue of people lying about her husband’s death does not sit well with her. “These rumours are spread on social media and you wonder who is behind it and what are their intentions. It hurts us as a family when someone spreads malicious rumours continuously. I’m glad God has added more years to my husband’s life,” she said. Mzoli now divides his time between the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, where he is running some projects. He has always advocated for township economy and in Eastern the Cape, he is developing a mall in Mdantsane kasi.
