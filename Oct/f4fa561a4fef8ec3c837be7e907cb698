A WEEK ago, Mamelodi Sundowns left the pitch with many questions and doubts, following their crash in the MTN8. But they not only laid the marker in the DStv Premiership with a crushing 3-0 win against Kaizer Chiefs, they have also sent out a strong message that they will not relinquish their league title without a fight. For three years, the Brazilians have maintained their grip on the Premiership trophy, despite some fierce contest against powerhouses Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. And if the words of co-coach Manqoba Mngqithi are anything to go by, many are still going to feel the wrath of the reigning league champions. “Our personality as a big team is that we should be a side that dominate games and not look for goals only but also to dominate possession, to dominate penetrations and just dominate generally in terms of our width and depth,” said Mngqithi. Any coach should be happy with a comprehensive 3-0, especially considering the new signings were on the scoresheet. Marksmen Peter Shalulile and Kermit Erasmus bagged two goals, Themba Zwane netted the third. “From time to time, I felt we did a lot right, especially in the first half. “Structurally, we made it very difficult for them by what we were trying to do,” said Mngqithi. “It caused a lot of confusion, especially on (Bernard) Parker and Reeve Frosler. “They couldn’t find Themba Zwane and it made our lives a bit better.”
