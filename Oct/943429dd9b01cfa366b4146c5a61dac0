A TRUCK driver had a lucky escape from heavily armed hijackers. And videos of the attempted highjacking went viral on social media. Social media users said the driver needed to thank his God and ancestors for the lucky escape. This as some noticed that the driver wore traditional beads. In one of the videos, the truck’s dashcams showed the truck cruising on the road. Three men then jumped onto the road and shot at the truck. Meanwhile, a camera in the truck shows the driver listening to the radio and enjoying music. He is suddenly heard shouting: “Hawe ma”.     He then immediately ducks while his hands are still on the steering wheel. But bullets hit the windscreen and passenger window and the driver was thankfully unharmed. Twitter user, TK, praised the driver. He said he showed bravery and that his company should compensate him for this. Elijah Mwale seconded it. “He deserves a better reward from his company, can they build him a house and have his children’s school fees paid up to university level. He can be promoted as well to be stationed at the base to do driver management.” UKhozi FM DJ, Tshatha Ngobe wrote on Facebook: “Kunzima okwalelizwe lakithi madoda” (It’s hard what our country is faced with). Other social media users said government should eradicate crime on the roads, especially in KZN. They said this happened a lot in areas such as Ladysmith, Weenen and Greytown, where thugs have apparently found ways to distract drivers by placing stones on the road, throwing paint at the car windscreen or sending a lot of cows on the road. The Department of Transport has condemned this incident.
