NUMSA marched to the offices of the company Venture in Rosslyn in Tshwane yesterday to protest against hostile managers. According to Numsa regional secretary Jerry Morulane, Numsa in Hlanganani condemned the actions of Venture. The company supplies car parts to BMW. He said management was hostile to employees. It had dismissed 21 workers before lockdown after they refused to work because of lack of water. “Workers downed tools for a few hours,” said Morulane. “They were concerned because the lack of water meaning they couldn’t sanitise and wash their hands to prevent Covid-19. During our engagements with the employer, they promised to reinstate the workers, but failed to keep their promise.” Morulane said the matter was referred to the Dispute Resolution Council of the Motor Industries Bargaining Council for resolution. “Management has retaliated by victimising workers and shop stewards. They attack our shop stewards and one of them was even disciplined by the employer. Management denied her the right to be represented by the union and, as a result, she lost the case and was unfairly dismissed. “We want to remind management of Venture that we’re a recognised union and have a right to defend employees. “We condemn them for undermining us and for inflicting misery on our members.” Numsa handed a memorandum of demands to BMW, which was accepted by Peter Dantjie, who promised to respond within seven days. Chief Executive Officer of Venture Mark Walker said: “I’m aware of the Numsa protest, that’s it and no further comment than that.”
