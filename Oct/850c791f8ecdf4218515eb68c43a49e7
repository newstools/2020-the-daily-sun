THE ancestors chose his partner. “She’s my gift from them,” said inyanga Robert Ngwenya (58) about his traditional healer wife. Ngwenya, known as Mathambo in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni, met his wife Flora Mhlongo (53) about 30 years ago. “My ancestors came to me in a dream and said I must attend a wedding at Malalane near Mbombela,” he said. “They told me we all have the desire to love and they’d show me my future wife at the wedding.” Mathambo said when he saw her he felt a strong attraction. “The ancestors guide us towards what we want, but we ignore it because we’re stubborn,” said Mathambo. Flora said she threw bones to make sure Mathambo really was the chosen one. She said: “The bones confirmed he was and there was no need for korobela. If you’re matched by your ancestors, nothing will come between you.” Flora and Robert have seven children and six grandchildren. “I’ve helped many women who have problems with childbirth, and some have named babies after me,” she said. Mathambo said those who don’t believe in ancestors don’t know where they come from. “Western civilisation found us using herbs to heal and protect ourselves,” he told Daily Sun. “There were no hospitals. People must start believing in the ancestors now before it’s too late.” Caroline Sithole (52), the first student to graduate after being trained by Mathambo in 1994, said she’d never seen a couple as loving as Robert and Flora. “Mathambo took me away from suffering and always encouraged me to appease my ancestors in order to have a healthy marriage,” said Caroline.
