HUNDREDS of Enlightened Christian Gathering members are expected to flock to the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane this morning. ECG leader Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and wife Mary are set to appear. The couple face charges of fraud, money laundering, and contravening the Prevention of Organised Crime Act for offences they allegedly committed from 2015. One of the charges relates to contravention of exchange control regulations to the sum of about R15 million at the time. Bushiri and his wife are both out on R100 000 bail.  Their supporters vowed to stand in solidarity with them during their court appearance. ECG spokesman Ephraim Nyondo sent out a message of support to the couple. He said their message as a church hadn’t changed and they were still calling for peace and calm. “We’re still calling for your continued devotion to prayer and fasting,” he said. “Our prayer is that God moves this mountain to ensure fair, impartial and speedy justice isn’t just done, but should also be seen to be done.” He said those coming to court should observe Covid-19 regulations. National Council of Churches general secretary, Dr Prophet Hlobo, said: “We reiterate our position to support and pray for Prophet Bushiri during this difficult time. “The Constitution dictates that anyone is innocent until found guilty by a court of law. “We want this matter done and dusted as it’s long overdue. We wish Bushiri a free and fair trial.” Social media users also showed support for the Bushiris.
