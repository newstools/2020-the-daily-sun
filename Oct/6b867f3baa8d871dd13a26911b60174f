I would like to appeal to Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha and Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka to appoint singer Makhadzi as the provinceâ€™s cultural ambassador. Makhadzi, whose real name Ndivhudzannyi Ralivhona, deserves praise and recognition for producing the hit Matorokisi. Her latest offering, Murahu, proves Makhadzi is the right person to represent the province in cultural events as her music unites the nation. The queen of Limpopo is undoubtedly the provincial artist of the moment and has put Limpopo on the map with both her singing and dancing talent. We need to honour artists for their hard work.
