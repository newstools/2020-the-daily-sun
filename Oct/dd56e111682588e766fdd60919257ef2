FORMER Black Leopards captain Robert Ng’ambi is still to make up his mind whether to hang up his soccer boots or to continue his long career. The Malawian international veteran midfielder was released by Lidoda Duvha at the end of last season despite helping them survive relegation through the promotion/relegation play-offs. But he has other priorities right now as the 34-year-old midfielder explained: “I am going home to Malawi to be with my family. This was a hectic year of football because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. My contract with Leopards expired and they did not renew it. “So now I am not thinking about football I just want to go home and spend time with my family. I have not seen them for a long time because of Covid-19. I will decide about my future when I am at home.” Ng’ambi has been playing top flight football in South Africa for 15 years. He arrived in Mzanzi in 2005 to join Leopards from Malawian outfit Monomotapa United. The Blantyre born star left Lidoda Duvha in 2011 and signed for Platinum Stars and spent seven years with the North West based side. After Bakwena were sold and to Ubuntu Cape Town and moved to the Mother City two seasons ago, Ng’ambi returned to Leopards. The veteran midfielder says he does not hold any grudges against Leopards after they let him go. “I love Leopards and I am thankful to their management as they are the first club that gave me a chance to play in South Africa,” explained Ng’ambi. “I am happy I am leaving them while they are still in the Premiership. It would have hurt me if we failed to save their top flight status. I am proud and leaving with my head held high.”
