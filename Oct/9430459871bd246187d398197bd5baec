DESPITE the Hawks flatly denying any knowledge of a warrant of arrest out for ANC secretary general Ace Magashule, he has instructed his lawyers to make inquiries with the National Prosecuting Authority. The news of the arrest first came to light yesterday when reports emerged that his arrest was pending. First, Magashule gave contradicting confirmations to two different publications on the same night. According to Independent Media, Magashule confirmed to them that he was aware of a warrant of arrest out for him. “I am aware. I am aware. It’s going to be a Hollywood style type of a thing. But we will see,” he told the publication. In another publication, it was reported that he denied knowing anything about the warrant but said his lawyer will be in touch with the NPA this morning. Magashule could only confirm hearing rumours of his imminent arrest and said he was the least worried about it. The Hawks were quick to deny there was a warrant, saying it was fake news. “The Hawks would like to categorically distance itself from the IOL report regarding the so-called impending arrest against Mr Ace Magashule. “The DPCI view the report as a malicious intent to undermine the integrity of the organisation,” Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement released last night. Reports suggest that the arrest was linked to the Estina Dairy Farm project. Magashule also confirmed this.
