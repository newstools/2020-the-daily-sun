Kagiso said the punani piercing is the current trend. “Many people like it but some think it isn’t for blacks,” he said. “We’re professionals and doing our work. We want business to grow and open new branches.” Mpho said: “I’m a photographer. I take pictures and videos while Kagiso does tattoos and piercings.” They wouldn’t disclose in detail how much they charge. Said Mpho: “Tattoos depend on size and detail. Piercings depend on where you want it, but the cheapest is R300.”  A 36-year-old woman gave reasons to Daily Sun why she did the piercing. “The piercing doesn’t only look sexy, it also enhances sexual pleasure. The jewellery increases pressure on the clitoris, and that’s why I’m happy all the time during intercourse,” one said. Gynecologist Dr Hlengane Maluleke said if done under sterile conditions and by trained, accredited people, the risk of infection is minimal. He said there are no known side effects.
