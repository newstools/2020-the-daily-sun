NORMAN Mapeza and PSL rookies Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have yet to reach an agreement. TTM CEO Sello Chokoe revealed via the South African Football Journalist Association (SAFJA) Zoom meeting that the Venda based side are still without a coach. Chokoe says they are still negotiating with the right candidate and If they fail to reach agreement, their caretaker coach Lucky Nelukau will be at the helm when they host SuperSport United in a MTN8 quarterfinals match at Thohoyandou Stadium on 17 October. Although, Daily Sun reported that Mapeza is already in the country to take over the job, Chokoe refused to divulge the name of a coach that will guide their side this coming season. He went on: “We are still trying to finalise terms and at this stage our caretaker coach Lucky Nelukau is still in charge. We will unveil  (If he signs) the new coach on Monday or
Tuesday together with new players.” Chokoe hopes the MTN8 match will give the new coach a chance
to assess his side before their opening DSTV fixture against fellow newly promoted
side TS Galaxy at the same venue on 25 October. He went on: “We have little time to prepare and we hope that the game will help us before the start of the league.”
