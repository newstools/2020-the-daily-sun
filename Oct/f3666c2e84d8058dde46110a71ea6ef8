VULA Vala’s lead actor, Khanyisani Kheswa, has shared his experience playing Mzikayise Msomi. The show revolves around Mzi, who leaves his home town, Ladysmith in KZN, to pursue a better life in Joburg. But his mum is reluctant to let him go because Mzi might find his long lost father, Bra Rex. Eventually, Mzi leaves KZN for Joburg to stay with his uncle. During his stay in Joburg he joins a football club, The Warriors, owned by Bra Rex (played by Sello Maake Ka-Ncube). ALSO READ: ZOZIBINI TUNZI OFFERED ACTING ROLE ON THE RIVER! Indeed the secret is finally out when the two find each other. Speaking about his experience, he said: “Mzi’s journey from KZN to Joburg is similar to mine. When I left home I had a newborn daughter. In Vula Vala, when Mzi left KZN he left his pregnant girlfriend. We both did not have a good start in Joburg, for example I came to Joburg to start my acting career in 2016 and things did not really work out for me. Fortunately for Mzi, he came to Joburg to play soccer and things quickly came together for him,” he said. He told Daily Sun that this is his biggest gig on screen. “I can remember that when I went for auditions I was anxious and nervous but I was put at ease. The cherry on top was playing alongside my role models such as Sello Maake Ka-Ncube, Darlington Michaels, Tina Jaxa and others. They received me well in the acting industry and have become my biggest motivators. Being in the same cast as them is the biggest thing for me.” He said he hopes to get more leading roles. “My dream is to get more leading roles and possibly get leading roles in international films. I believe this is possible because I am still young and time is still on my side,” said Khanyisani. Vula Vala plays on Sundays on DStv’s channel 161.
