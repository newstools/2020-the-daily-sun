THEY were celebrating a friend’s birthday and had no idea their dance moves would go viral. Their moves to Mapara A Jazz’s song, John Vuli Gate, not only captivated many fans, but helped them make some money. The young ladies are getting gigs and brands are featuring them after their dance. Birthday girl Kgomotso Aphane (19) told Daily Sun they had no idea their video would receive so much love and open doors for them. They’d initially planned to go to Gold Reef City, but changed plans because of finances. “This didn’t mean we were going to have a dull celebration. A plan had to be made. We celebrated at Kolonnade Mall in Tshwane,” said Kgomotso. ALSO READ: IDOLS TOP NINE PERFORM LOCKDOWN HITS! They decided to dance at a petrol station on their way and filmed themselves on 11 October. “A friend posted the John Vuli Gate challenge on her WhatsApp status and we loved it,” she said. Katlego Mohlahlo (18) didn’t think the video would be this big. They’ve secured several gigs, two clothing brands want to work with them, and they’re also ambassadors of a beer brand. About people criticising them for calling themselves stoko, Katlego said: “We’re young and had fun without a man around us. That’s why people are bitter. I don’t see the need to explain ourselves.” Tshegofatso Maepa (19) said: “As for the word stoko, it’s been there for ages. Boys have been calling women that and it’s normal.” Oratilwe Mokwatlo (18) hoped “bitter” people would stop harassing people online. Lebogang Motalane (19) said people will always talk. Kgomotso’s gogo, Maria Kekana (72), said the respectful kids deserved the joy they received. Lebogang’s mum, Ouma Simelani (38), said: “All will go well so long as they continue to put effort and God in everything they do.’’
