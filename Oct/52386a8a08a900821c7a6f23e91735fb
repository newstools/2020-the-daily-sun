Child abuse at creches or early childhood development centres must not be tolerated. Parents send their kids to creches to be taken care of, not to be abused by those who are supposed to be looking after them. The greater parent involvement and vigilance will help combat improper practices at creches. Parents must become active participants, so they can have a say in the way creches are run. Children’s safety must be a priority. We don’t want to see the shocking videos of caregivers abusing our children trending on social media. Some creche teachers are not equipped to take care of young children. Parents must exercise caution when they enrol their kids at creches. They need to consider the quality of care provided. Kids must be protected at all times. Letter bySlight Ramphaka, Florida
