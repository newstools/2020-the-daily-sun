NEWBIES Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and TS Galaxy got their first-ever taste of life in the top-flight when the two sides squared off against each other in their first match. The encounter, played at the Thohoyandou Stadium yesterday, ended in a 1-1 draw with both sides earning a point to kick off their debut seasons. Veteran defender Bevan Fransman was on target for The Rockets while Mogakolodi Ngele netted for TTM. Galaxy, who bought the top flight status of Highlands Park, were eager to get the better of their fellow newcomers TTM. They started the brighter of the two teams as they created a number of chances in the first half but only converted one. Fransman rose highest to thunder a header past Washington Arubi in the TTM goal to give his side the lead just before the half-time interval. It took TTM until the 54th minute to gain parity in the match with Ngele converting a Meshack Maphangule corner. This was Ngele’s third goal in two matches after he netted a brace in TTM’s 3-2 defeat at the hands of SuperSport United in the MTN 8 last weekend. Vhadau Vha Damani, as TTM are also known, had managed to get back into the game and were hoping to bag all three points at home. The Limpopo side, who bought the top-flight status of 99-year-old Bidvest Wits, are hoping to be a tough proposition for their opponents this season, especially at home. However, try as they might, they could not get past the Galaxy defenses for the second time as Ngele was denied by  Westen van der Linde in the Galaxy goal. In the end, both coaches Dan “Dance” Malesela and Joel Masutha we’re content with a share of the spoils.  TTM next travel to Tshwane for a clash with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium on Wednesday (7.30).  Galaxy host AmaZulu at Mbombela Stadium on the same day.
