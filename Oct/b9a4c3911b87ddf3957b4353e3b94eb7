A TEENAGE boy was playing with a ball
when it went into the main busy road yesterday afternoon. The 14-year-old was killed by a speeding
car when he was chasing after the ball on Dr Belcher Road in Mangaung. A white Datsun Go was heading to town
when it hit him and he flew to the other side of the road. A witness, Thapelo Leeuw (37), said the
car was speeding like the taxis do on the deadly road. He told Daily Sun: “This road has
claimed so many lives and those who survived are crippled and have lifetime
scars. The only time we stopped seeing accidents here was when we were on level
4 and 5 of lockdown. Since we got into level 3, 2 and 1, it’s getting worse. “The taxis seem to be doing a race on
this road. They don't care about pedestrians. The young boy was playing soccer
and he was chasing after the ball when he was hit by the speeding Datsun Go. The
driver, who was alone, was not drunk and he was co-operating with the police.
But he will forever remember that he took a life and that is sad." The teenager was certified dead at the
scene. Heidedal police are investigating a case
of culpable homicide after the incident.
