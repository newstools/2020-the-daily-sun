I don’t understand what this hullabaloo is all about with the Senekal incident, which resulted in police vehicles being torched. Not long ago the EFF caused mayhem and destroyed the property at some Clicks stores countrywide over a racist hair advert, and there was a deafening silent. Now people cry foul because it is the so-called racist boers who were out of order. Yes, destroying government property shouldn’t be tolerated, but I’d like to commend the Senekal cops for not fighting fire with fire. Things could have been worse had the cops used force to control those protesters, especially considering the fact that they were armed to the teeth. And since the police are in possession of that video footage, it is time they nail every culprit one by one. The Senekal incident showed we still have a long way to go before this country can have real racial reconciliation. Letter by Samuel Radebe, from Heilbron
