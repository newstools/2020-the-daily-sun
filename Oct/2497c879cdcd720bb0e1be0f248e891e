FORMER Black Leopards captain Thabo “Festival” Matlaba says he would have loved to stay at Lidoda Duvha next season but family issues forced him to leave. Matlaba told SunSport that he enjoyed his stay at Leopards last season despite the Venda-based side struggling against relegation throughout the season. But Leopards under interim coaches, Morgan Shivambu and Mongezi Bobe, managed to save the club’s top flight status through the promotion/relegation play-offs. “I was happy at Leopards if I have to be honest,” said the former Orlando Pirates defender. “The management, technical staff and teammates treated me well. It’s just that I have family issues that needed me to be in Gauteng and when I spoke to management, we agreed that it’s best I go back to Gauteng. I loved every moment at Leopards.” Matlaba, who joined Leopards last season on a two-year contract from Pirates, said what pleased him most is that he managed to help Leopards escape the axe. “It would have been sad for me if the team (Leopards) was relegated and I had to leave them after the support they gave me throughout my time in Limpopo,” explained Matlaba. “I have made lots of friends in Venda and people there love football. I am sad to leave, but I had no choice because my family needed me and I hope they understand.” Matlaba is also appealing to Leopards fans to keep supporting the team the way they did last season. “At Leopards you enjoy playing football, especially at home as the Thohoyandou Stadium is always full,” said the Tembisa-born star. “I hope the fans will keep supporting the team next season despite the coronavirus pandemic crisis. I will miss Leopards fans and I wish them and the club all the best.” Matlaba said he is optimistic of finding a new team in the Premiership next season. He has been linked with newly promoted Swallows FC.
