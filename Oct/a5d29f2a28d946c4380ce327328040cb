  Spokesperson Reynold Thakhuli explained that one of the big cats had already figured out how they could get in and out, and which spots along the fence were easiest to dig under, in order to go hunting on the other side. On Monday, the seven lions made a break for it in the high mountainous areas - twice in 24 hours - killing 10 sheep near the reserve in the Beaufort West area. Rangers rounded up the lions and slept in the mountain to keep an eye on them. But they escaped again, to go back to the carcasses. Shot      A tough call had to be made.Â  "The crucial aspects, which were considered in making the decision to put down these specific animals are, firstly, this female lion group had left the park before, killing a number of sheep from a neighbouring farm and presenting a threat to human beings," he explained. "Secondly, the pride had familiarised themselves with a specific area from which they escaped, and one of the members of the pride had developed a habit of digging underneath fences." It was clear there was a high probability of the lions leaving again and posing a risk to livestock and people. "SANParks is obligated and has a legal duty to respond and mitigate such risks," he continued. He explained that lions are opportunistic, prefer easy prey, are fast learners and could become habitual livestock raiders. Problem lions According to SANParks' Large Mammal Ecologists, various drivers contribute to the behaviour of problem lions: one being that male lions disperse when they are adults, and the prides move around and compete for food. This is not a problem because there is no fencing and other land use between reserves, but the Karoo National Park is bordered by people. Left unchecked, populations within reserves can increase by 22% a year - and, if the lions do not get enough food, there is a risk they will break out of the reserve.
