AFTER waiting for almost six months for the DNA test result of their sister to be released, the family’s long wait has finally ended. The family from Phoenix, north of Durban, has been waiting for the DNA test results of their sister, Khulakazi Ndlovu (39). Khulakazi went missing on 2 April this year. She left home in the evening and told the children she’d be back soon, but she didn’t. Her family then reported her missing to the Phoenix police. A burnt car with human remains fitting her description was found in Molweni cemetery the next day. Speaking on behalf of the family, Esihle Nqeketho (29) said when they heard that a car had been found in Molweni cemetery, they suspected that it could be Khulakazi’s car. She said they went to the police and told the cops that they believed that the car was that of Khulakazi. “Cops than did DNA tests. We waited for all these months. As we were waiting somehow we knew that the results would come back positive. The reason we believed so is that I opened her tablet and saw that her car tracking company stated that Khulakazi’s vehicle did go the cemetery on the day she didnt come back home,” she said. She said but what shocked them is that a relative has been arrested for Khulakazi’s death. “We can’t wait to find out why this relative killed our sister. I don’t want to talk much about the arrested person, but what I can say is that we are hurt by this,” she said. She said now they will start making funeral arrangements. Khulakazi lived with two children aged 15 and five. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said on 3 April a vehicle with human remains was found at Molweni cemetery. He said the DNA was conducted and revealed that the human remains were that of Khulukazi Ndlovu (39). “An inquest docket was opened for investigation and was later changed to murder. A 46-year-old known suspect was arrested on 16 October. He is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistratess Court,” said Naicker.
