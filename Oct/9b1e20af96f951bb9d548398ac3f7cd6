A WOMAN is behind bars for allegedly being an accomplice in the rape of her niece. Joburg Central SAPS spokesman captain Xoli Mbele told Daily Sun that a 24-year-old woman was arrested this morning in Joburg. Mbele said it is alleged that the suspect assisted a man, who is still on the run, to rape a 15-year-old at her place of work. “The victim visited her aunt yesterday coming from Soweto,” said Mbele. He said the victim’s aunt requested her to bring her lunch at work. “When she arrived, the male suspect, who also happens to be the her boss, closed the door,” said Mbele. He further stated that they allegedly dragged the victim to a room, where her aunt assisted the male suspect by binding her hands and covering her mouth with sellotape. "She undressed her niece and watched her boss rape her," said Mbele. He said after they finished, they released her. She told her mother about what had happened and a case was opened. “An investigation is underway and the suspect will appear at the Johannesburg Magistrates Court soon,” said Mbele.
