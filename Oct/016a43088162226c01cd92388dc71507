RUGBY player and fire survivor Qaphela Titus Goboda will soon launch a motivational book titled Burnt Alive: But They Also Left A Flame Within. The 19-year-old from Mbekweni in Paarl, Western Cape, was set alight by jealous classmates at Hoërskool Garsfontein in Tshwane when he was 15. Speaking about his ordeal to Daily Sun, Qaphela said: “I was the first black kid to play rugby at my school. It was in September and I felt sick and asked my teacher if I could go to the toilet. “On my way back from the toilet, I noticed two boys but didn’t pay attention. I then noticed someone was following me. When I turned around I was hit with something like a golf club.”  Qaphela said after he fell, paraffin or thinners was poured on him. He became unconscious for a few minutes. “I was woken up by screams around me,” he said. “I had to run to the tap and was later rushed to hospital.” Qaphela was in ICU for 26 days and had more than 20 operations on his head and right leg. He turned his pain into motivation. MASKANDI ARTIST PORN SHOCK! “The book is already out and I’m happy with the response and orders are coming in,” he said.
