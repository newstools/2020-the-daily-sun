DENEL is still paying off debt the company made in 2015 when it entered into a joint venture with a Gupta-linked company. Yesterday, board chairwoman Monhla Hlahla told the Zondo Commission when her board took over in 2018, the company was in crisis mode. She said there was a cash shortage and staff and service providers were not paid. “The company looked headless as if there was no leadership. It was almost a hopeless scenario.” Hlahla said the situation hadn’t improved much as the company was still paying historical debt instead of investing in the business. Denel SA wanted to start Denel Asia with Gupta-linked company VR Laser to do business in Asia.

A Denel that used to be strong is suddenly being looked at with suspicion,” Hlahla said. “Unfortunately, the defence industry has its own way of doing things and culture. It destroyed relationships built over a period of time. We are still feeling the impact today.” She said the board was engaging with the Special Investigating Unit to investigate the wrongdoing of the past. “Some of the markets will not do business with us until these issues are concluded and they know they won’t have to deal with corrupt tendencies again.” Former Denel board member Nonyameko Mandindi told the inquiry the Asian deal was rushed and three executives, who refused to co-operate with the Guptas, were suspended. She said CEO Riaz Saloojee, company secretary Elizabeth Africa and chief financial officer Fikile Mlhontlo were asked to give reasons within 24 hours why they should not be suspended. She said the notice to suspend the executives was raised at a board meeting without board members being given documents before the meeting, which was the normal practice.
