BEFORE the V-Class and Hyundai H1 took their slice of the pie, the Volkswagen Caravelle was the boss of the weekend. The Caravelle T3 is still the most loved weekend party bus warrior. The T-Series, especially the Kombi and Caravelle, have been best sellers for 60 years. The Transporter range has sold 10 097 units in Mzansi of the T6 range since its launch in 2015. VW’s updated T6.1 is continuing the sales success story. On all versions, two chrome-plated cross-bars link the new headlights to the radiator grille. The lines of the two cross-bars are continued as LED daytime running lights, extending into the headlight housing units, which depending on specification, can also be LED. The T6.1 has six newly-designed wheels, six new exterior colours and seven newly-combined, two-tone paintwork finishes rounding off the new exterior updates to the range. In the interior, a new panel has been given an extra shelf in front of the driver. The air vents in the dashboard can now be adjusted in every direction and simultaneously opened or closed, using one slider control.  The T6.1’s entire range of infotainment systems has been reconfigured. All models have a Composition Colour radio system as standard, whereas the Caravelle and California have the Discover Pro Media system with navigation as standard, and on the Kombi Trendline Plus, as an optional feature. The range will launch with three 2,0-litre turbo diesel engines with common rail injection, both economical and sustainable. The four-cylinder engines deliver between 81kW and 146kW of power. The 2.0 TDI develops power output of 81kW. The maximum torque of 250 Nm is already available at the very low engine speed of 1 250rpm. It has a five-speed manual gearbox and fuel consumption of 7,9 l/100 km in the Pick-Up Single Cab and Double Cab, 7,5 l/100 km in the Panel Van, and 7,3 l/100 km in the Crew Bus and Kombi. The 2,0-litre BiTDI model with the top engine specification is powered by a 146 kW twin-turbo engine, supplied as standard in combination with seven-speed direct shift gearbox (DSG)®.
