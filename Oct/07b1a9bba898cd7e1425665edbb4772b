MUSICIAN L’vovo Derrango has slammed black South Africans. This after the talented musician, whose real name is Thokozani Ndlovu, joined in on a conversation where a tweep said the way black South Africans love white people is so pathetic. “They will literally fight you for calling out racism by white people. It’s honestly draining. It’s starting to make me think our people are really stupid,” the tweep said. Responding to the tweep, L’vovo, who is known for his hit song Bayang’sukela, agreed with the tweep and said black people are damaged mentally. “There is nothing that they love more than people that hate them,” he said. The Durban-born star continued to weigh in on the topic and said: “Racism stems from money! If you are poor you will always be subjected to ill treatment. “If you win the economic war you have won the race war! Our people should leave everything else and fight for economic freedom – that’s where true liberation resides!” he said. Black people are damaged mentally! There is nothing they love more than the people that hate them! https://t.co/qURccOXA8W
