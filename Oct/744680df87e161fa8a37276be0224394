T here will never be a valid reason to be involved in crime. It doesn’t matter what you’re going through or how hard life is. You might be facing a dire situation: no job, no money and not knowing where your next meal will come from. But always remember that crime isn’t the answer. Try by all means to earn a living in an honest way, regardless of what you’re going through. You’re not the first person to go through difficulties. There are many people who were in your situation, or even worse, but they managed to rise above that situation. They never thought of taking shortcuts in their darkest moments. Learn from them and convert your challenges into opportunities. Have hope that things will turn out right. Never throw your hands in the air and fall into the trap of crime. Always strive for success and believe in yourself. Every successful person you see has a story to tell and may have gone through the worst to achieve what they have today. I know many people whose first jobs were being petrol attendants, cleaners, packers and security guards, among other things. Today they hold high positions. Keep pushing and have the courage to knock on those doors. Don’t be discouraged by those regret letters. Your time is coming. Letter by Thebe Kgwetiane Maandagshoek
