TIKOLOSHI hitmakers Soweto’s Finest and KayGee DaKing & Bizizi are at loggerheads. Members of Soweto’s Finest said they wanted nothing to do with KayGee DaKing and Bizizi. Soweto’s Finest, made up of Tom London, Njabz, Basho and Samson Cakes, said KayGee had been causing trouble for months. He was previously a member of the group, but left after a fight.

Before the song was released, they wanted us to make it a collaboration and not a feature, but we disagreed. “They also leaked the song and posted it on their WhatsApp statuses before it was released.” According to Soweto’s Finest, KayGee & Bizizi had been performing the song without permission. “When we perform, we always make it a point to invite them to sing with us, but they don’t come. They act as if it’s their own and don’t credit us,” said the member. “We’ve invited them to three major performances on TV, but they didn’t show up.” Things apparently got really bad when KayGee & Bizizi performed the song on Trace without permission two weeks ago. “After the performance, our fans raised questions on Twitter. We also had enough and confronted them, but they haven’t yet responded,” the member said.

I wrote it. I also helped them with the verses. Bizizi and I don’t complain when they perform without us. We don’t go around claiming they’re singing our lyrics. We all own the song. They know this is a collaboration, but went ahead and registered it as a feature. “When we asked them why, they said it was a mistake.” We don’t know what acknowledgement they want from us,,” KayGee said.
