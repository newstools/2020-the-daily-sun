EXPERTS have always maintained that sex should not be restricted or subjected to gender. Otherwise, we run the risk of policing the act and forget that it’s different strokes for different folks. We have previously spoken about sapiosexuals, and today we shine the light on pansexuals. Admittedly, a pansexual is often associated with being bisexual, but according to experts, there is a clear difference. A pansexual is someone who is attracted either emotionally, physically, or both, to all genders. This includes cisgender, transgender, agender and gender non-conforming individuals. The prefix is taken from a Greek root word, “pan”, which means “all”. Many pansexual people describe themselves as being attracted to people based on personality and not gender. How does it differ to bisexuality, you might ask? According to Healthline magazine, bisexual means attracted to multiple genders, and pansexual means attracted to all genders. These are different because “multiple” is not the same thing as “all”. Celebrities such as Janelle Monae came out as queer, saying she identified with some aspects of pansexuality. Other celebs like Miley Cyrus have publicly declared their pansexual being.
