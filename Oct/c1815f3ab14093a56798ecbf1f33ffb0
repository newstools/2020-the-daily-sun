 A Louisiana kid put himself in the driver's seat of a vehicle where he'd normally be a passenger 'his school bus' and there's a video of him leading cops on a wild high-speed chase. The unidentified 11-year-old boy was bust on Sunday in Baton Rouge, Louisiana after cops say he somehow managed to start a school bus and sped off. The boy is said to have started the car and a wild goose chase started with police. They tried stopping him but the young boy evaded them and sped off. What followed, according to authorities, was an intense 45-MINUTE PURSUIT through city streets. Cops say the kid taunted and flipped off officers as they gave chase, before eventually crashing into a tree. The real miracle here is the kid was okay and was immediately arrested.

The speed chase ended when the boy hit a tree and came to a complete halt. He was then placed in handcuffs at the scene. He was booked on charges of theft of a vehicle, aggravated flight, damage to property, and aggravated assault. Unclear how he got a hold of the keys, to begin with especially since schools would presumably be closed on a weekend, not to mention during a pandemic. What's really curious is how the heck he reached the pedals well enough to joyride for almost an hour?
