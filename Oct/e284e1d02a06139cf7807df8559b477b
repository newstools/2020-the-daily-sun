AMAZULU coach Ayanda Dlamini has a headache many coaches would love. Dlamini has welcomed the fact he has plenty of options and players to choose from when Usuthu open their the new DStv Premiership campaign against Orlando Pirates at Jonsson Kings Park on Saturday (8.15pm) The Usuthu management, led by chairman Sandile Zungu, flexed their financial muscle by signing players Dlamini had requested. In total 10 new players including former Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs star Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala have been brought on board for the new season in which Zungu has mandated Dlamini, a former AmaZulu striker, to finish in the top four. “I’m sure every coach will tell you that you don’t want your job to be made easy when you are choosing the team,” said Dlamini, who rescued AmaZulu from relegation last season. “To have plenty of options is good for the team because a lot of things happen during the season, especially this season as the fixtures are very close to each other. Injuries will happen as will suspensions. Having options is also good for competition for places because no player will walk into the starting line-up.” However, Usuthu will go to this game as underdogs. They have not defeated Pirates in their last 10 games in all competitions. The last time they beat Bucs was in a 1-0 win at the FNB Stadium in August 2013. Coincidently that victory came in the opening game of the 2013-14 season. Ayanda Dlamini was part of that Usuthu squad under then coach Craig Rosslee. Meanwhile, Tshabalala, who enjoyed playing against Pirates down the years having scored 12 times in a record 31 Soweto derby matches in his 11-year stay at Chiefs, is looking forward to the match at the venue that is very much familiar to him as he has had a lot of success there down the years. “I definitely think that the guys are up for it. As top players (we want) to compete against the best,” said Shabba.
