HERE’S a challenge where you can walk away with R200. All you have to do is finish a full chicken in 20 minutes! The Who is the Best challenge is hosted by Mike Mahlangu (32) from Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. Mike, the owner of Brown Tea brand, appealed to people to be part of the challenge. He said there would be four full chickens to be eaten in 20 minutes. The winner will walk away with R200. “People from the age of 12 can enter the competition. We’re keeping the youth on the positive side of life, because most get involved in crime and drugs,” he said. According to Mike, the competition was not about eating, but expressing talent. He said when it started in February, the winner won R200 after eating 20 eggs and 10 green apples in 10 minutes, but Covid-19 affected their monthly competition. He said his mission was to make it a national competition and be on TV. “This is a good platform. We’re giving people who are gifted in eating a platform.” Mike said other ideas were welcome to grow the competition. He said to enter, you must subscribe to Brown Tea on YouTube. You can also follow Brown Tea on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.
