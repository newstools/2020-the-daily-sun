Ntseki called two unknown players who will be making their debut in the senior national team, with some who have been called but never got enough opportunity. Centre-back Thibang Phete (26) who's plying his trade in Portugal an 23-year-oldd forward Kurt Abrahams of Westerlo in Belgium are the new players who will have their first taste in the Bafana setup.
