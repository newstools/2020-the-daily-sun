OLE Gunnar Solskjaer felt individual mistakes and a lack of aggression were key factors as Manchester United suffered a painful 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday afternoon. ERRORS COST US, he shouted in a post match media briefing. “After 2-1, we're still in the game. You don't win games of football by making individual mistakes, errors and making a performance like that,” he said. “Well of course when we get the start we did, you think, 'Yeah, we've got the game where we want it.' And then you make a few bad decisions and you're suddenly two or three-one down. Of course it's alarming. It's nowhere near good enough. I hold my hand up. It's my decision to pick the team I did and we, us as a squad, that's not good enough for Man United.” Full-time.#MUFC #MUNTOT @Chevrolet  “It's no excuse. But he must be having an operation in his throat, the boy. It's a bad reaction by Anthony [though]. No excuse because the game's not lost there and then but we were in the game by then. If that [Lamela] was one of my players, I would absolutely hang him up to dry because you don't go down like that. If Ant had gone down, it could have been going the other way. But he shouldn't react like that.” “Yeah of course. It's nowhere near good enough. And when you have a defeat like this, which has happened at the club before, you've just got to look yourself in the mirror. They're lucky now, the boys, or I don't know if it is lucky, but they're going away on international duty some of them and for the ones who are staying here, we've got a good [amount of] time to work. But we don't [all] see each other for ten days and that's hard now because we need to batten down the hatches and get together because that wasn't anywhere near good enough as a squad or a team.”
