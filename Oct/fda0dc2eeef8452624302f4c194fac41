Keaoleboga Sebalo sings about love and respect for women. Said the 24-year-old pop singer from Jan Kempdorp outside Kimberley, Northern Cape: “Women are primary caregivers in the world. They take the lead and help families adjust to new realities and challenges.” And his new single, Forever, is about love. He described it as a pop song that will appeal to everyone. “It’s a ballad with a fusion of African elements. I used the grand piano, violins and African toms for that African feel,” he said. The singer said the single was released last month and he produced it from his own studio in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. “It’s distributed by my record label, Zero One One.” He said his sound was inspired by different types of music. “It defines my life – like water and oxygen,” he said. Keaoleboga started creating music when he was seven years old. “My dad used to run a tavern and a game shop. I’d dance to my favourite music at the game shop and later at home do sing-alongs.” In high school, his friend Jason Bailey gave him the guitar. And that was his introduction to music writing. “I wrote over 50 songs that had never been recorded. When I moved to Tembisa in 2015, I met many producers who owned studios,” Keaoleboga said. He studied journalism at Rosebank College, followed by training in theatre at Grace of Destiny where he learnt dance and acting. “I played in many theatres around Joburg. I was well-known for my gay roles. “Today, I run a fully-equipped studio and record my own music. I’ve recorded over 50 songs,” he said.
