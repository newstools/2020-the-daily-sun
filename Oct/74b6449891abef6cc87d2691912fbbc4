THE Lekau Foundation held a cancer awareness event at the weekend to educate people about the deadly disease. Bikers, poets, drum majorettes and local artists entertained residents of Hammanskraal, Tshwane, at the local sports ground on Saturday before educating them. Priests and counsellors motivated those feeling down, while cancer survivors and those still undergoing treatment shared their individual stories. Founder Walter Kay said caring for his aunt inspired him to host the event.He said when she was diagnosed, he didn’t know anything about the disease.  “It was a shock.My family didn’t know anything about cancer or how to care for a cancer patient,” he said. “We relied on nurses and survivors for help. “I wanted to share all I learned so we could help others and maybe save lives. My aunt’s diagnosis made me realise that little is known about the disease.” Breast cancer patient Sheila Matjie (40) shared her story. “I’m on chemotherapy at Dr George Mukhari Hospital and although my breast has shrunk and my hair is falling out, I’m optimistic,” she said. Sheila said the support she got made her realise cancer was not a death sentence. “I thought it was the end, but I’m lucky to be surrounded by positive people who are knowledgeable. They’ve helped me cope. The Lekau Foundation has also held my hand throughout the process.”  Sheila said detecting cancer early saves lives. “Women need to know their breasts, touch them and seek help when they notice any change,” she said. Resident Bertha Selolo (35) said she learnt a lot. “I had a relative who died from breast cancer,” she said. “She wasted time thinking she’d been bewitched and only sought medical treatment when it was already late.” I wished I had the information I have now back then. She would still be here with us,” she said. Bertha said she would share the information with a women’s prayer group of women she belonged to.
