WHEN it comes to trends, we cannot deny the power that Kim Kardashian and her family have. But it seems like people did not receive this one well. The trendsetter, who turns 40 tomorrow, recently posted a photo of herself in a backless dress from Matthew Williams’ debut collection for Givenchy, which revealed a jaw-dropping red thong.  Kim made sure that the red G-string was visible with the red dress and became the centre of attention. It is actually a built-in feature of the dress. The mother of four captioned the photo: “WOW @matthewmwilliams. Congratulations on your first @givenchyofficial collection! It is such a beautiful collection. I can’t wait to wear all of the looks you’ve sent!!” Some of her followers were not impressed and begged for the trend not to come back. “Please don’t bring the showing thong back,” one user commented. The visible thong trend had its time and was very popular on the red carpet. Celebrities would show off their underwear while wearing backless dresses and even low rise jeans or skirts.
