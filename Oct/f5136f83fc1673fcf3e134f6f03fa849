TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila will be heading back to Venda a happy team. This after the DStv Premiership newbies managed to hold defending league champions Mamelodi Sundowns to a goalless draw at Loftus Versfeld Stadium. Vhadau Vha Damani are still unbeaten in the league so far after they also drew their first match against TS Galaxy at the weekend. Their only defeat remains the 3-2 loss at the hands of SuperSport United in the MTN 8 in their first match of the season. TTM coach Joel Masutha was ecstatic with his side’s gritty performance against a dangerous Sundowns outfit. “Everyone had to dig deep to get what I think was a golden point,” Masutha told SuperSport TV. “They are not champions for no reason, we knew that they would come at us and press us. “If you get anything against Sundowns you must be happy. You need luck and for their players to not be on it on the day. “You could see that they know what they are doing. They are a well drilled.” Meanwhile, the result felt like a defeat for Sundowns who could maintain their winning start in Premiership after they thrashed Kaizer Chiefs 3-0 last time out. Sundowns joint-coach Manqoba Mnqithi was left ruing some of the early chances his side could not convert. “It’s two points dropped because honestly speaking we pushed from the first whistle until the last,” said Mnqithi. “I believe we should have had a penalty and that situation also caused the injury to Keletso (Makgalwa).”
