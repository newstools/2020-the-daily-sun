ZULU King Goodwill Zwelithini and the royal family have criticised the SABC1 for broadcasting Shaka Zulu again. They claim the series, which has been airing on Saturday nights, spreads lies about Shaka and the history of black people. The series was shot in 1986 and starred the late Henry Cele as Shaka. Royal family spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu told Daily Sun the production was an embarrassment. “We didn’t write a formal complaint to the SABC1, but I’m calling on all black people to unite and stand together to fight for their history,” he said. “It’s disappointing to see our national broadcaster giving a platform to a series that teaches the wrong information about black people.” Thulani said the series was made during apartheid and had no place in current times. He said it didn’t show any of the good things Shaka did. “He’s only painted as a bad person who loved war, yet Shaka was also a good negotiator,” he said. Cultural and history expert Dr Velaphi “VVO” Mkhize told Daily Sun he was disappointed to see the series back on SABC. “King Shaka played a big role in creating one Zulu nation from different Nguni clans,” he said. “In this movie, we don’t see him shown as the hero we know, but as a bad person.” The SABC’s acting spokeswoman, Mmoni Seapolelo, said the series was fictional and not meant to be factual. “The SABC hasn’t received any formal complaint,” she said. “However, any complaints received will be addressed directly with the complainant.”
