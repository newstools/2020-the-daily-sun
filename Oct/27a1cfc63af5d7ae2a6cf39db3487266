SHE bought herself a pair of takkies worth R1 200 and went to show them off at a tavern on Friday. But Nthabiseng Lebitso (29) died for her new Le Coq Sportif sneakers. Her body and that of a male friend were found dumped near a cemetery on Tuesday. The bodies, which were already decomposing, were found by a passerby, who alerted cops. Nthabiseng’s friends from Spooktown in Bekkersdal now regret letting her leave the tavern. “We wish we could have stopped her. Maybe she’d still be alive,” said one of her friends, Ntokozo Balweli (34). According to her friends, thugs outside the tavern threatened to take her shoes and she ran away leaving one shoe behind. But she came back for the shoe accompanied by a male friend, whom she left with.  They were both later found dead. Nthabiseng was identified by her family, but the man hasn’t been identified. Nthabiseng’s cousin, Mamodumo Ralejwe (33), said she was devastated by her death. Nthabiseng worked for a contractor hired by Rand West Municipality to clean the streets of Bekkersdal. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said cops have opened a double murder case and are appealing to anyone with information to come forward.
