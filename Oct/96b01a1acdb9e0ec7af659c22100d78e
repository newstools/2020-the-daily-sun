STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker has confirmed that Argentina midfielder Junior Mendieta is set to arrive at the club next week. Barker, whose side will open their DStv Premiership against Swallows FC at the refurbished venue Danie Craven Stadium on Sunday in Stellenbosch, said the club has also signed a Nigerian striker. However, he didn’t want to divulge their names, but SunSport has picked up that Mendieta is the player Barker was referring to who plays for Atletico De Rafaela in Argentina. These players have left Barker beaming with a smile. “They are not here yet and their paperwork hasn’t been finalised,” said Barker. “But once they are finalised we’ll do an announcement on the two players. Having said that, we are very excited and we see them as players who will take us to the next level. “It has been quite a struggle to eventual get them on a flight to come to the country. As we speak, the Argentinean is flying on Monday and we are now waiting for Nigerian to have his Visa.” However, Barker was able to confirm that the club has parted ways with Jarrod Moroole, Ovidy Karuru, Diego Franco, Zwelethu Ndlovu and Bongani Mathabela.
