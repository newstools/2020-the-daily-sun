Banyana Banyana players called up for selection camp ahead of the 2020 COSAFA Womenâ€™s Cup, have all reported for camp that will run from 20-27 October at the SAFA Technical Centre, south of Johannesburg. Coach Desiree Ellis will select her final squad that will travel to Nelson Mandela Bay to represent South Africa at the regional tournament that will run from 3-14 November 2020. Banyana Banyana are the defending champions of this annual tournament and have now won the trophy three times in a row. They will be aiming for an unprecedented fourth successive title, something no other national team has managed to do. Coach Ellis said she is encouraged by the physical condition of most players despite the coronavirus induced long lay-off. This is mainly because personalised training programmes were sent to the players to ensure they keep fit during the covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Before getting into camp, thorough safety measures were taken, with all players and officials undergoing mandatory covid-19 tests before being allowed to report for camp. -SAFA
