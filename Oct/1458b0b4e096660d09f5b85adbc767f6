THE pending Kaizer Chiefs Fifa ban has got Amakhosi fans worried if they current squad will be able to compete and win some silverware this season. But the club head coach Gavin Hunt seem to be not bothered as he belies that he has enough in his disposal to challenge for titles in the upcoming 2020-21 season. Hunt will lead the Soweto giants for the first time on Sunday when they entertain tricky Maritzburg United at FNB Stadium at 3pm. Speaking to the media ahead of the season start on Thursday, Hunt was quick to remind everyone in the virtual press conference that the same Amakhosi squad ended last season as runners-up to Mamelodi Sundowns. Hunt said: “Look, we all know the situation of the signing of players and those types of things, but I mean we’ve got a squad that did very well last year (season) but very unfortunate." “We’ll try and work with that and hopefully the ruling will be made sooner rather than later so there’s not much I can say about the whole thing. “The players have been very committed at training and as I said the proof will be on Sunday. I’ve only been here two and a half weeks. He added: But no excuses, the good thing is I know the league, I know the players, I know what we’re facing and what we’ve got in our squad. “So, I have to work around that and there are quite a few good young players here that certainly will get their chance. “I always say if you good enough and you can still do the job, it doesn’t matter what your age is, but we’ve got to balance the two because of the situation at the club. “I am very confident in some of the players we’ve got. I’m sure they’ve got a lot to prove as well.”
