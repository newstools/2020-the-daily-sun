THE mother of murdered Amahle, Mandulele Quku, wants the clothes her daughter was wearing on the day she was killed. She said she is not at peace because she has not received the clothes her daughter was wearing on the day she was murdered. Amahle’s body was found dumped on an open space in Philippi in June this year. This was after she went missing on her birthday. Mandulele said the suspected killer did not show her where he put her daughter’s clothes. “It still boggles my mind as to what happened to my daughter’s clothes. I think about it every day. The cops dealing with the matter have not given me feedback on what happened to Amahle’s clothes. It’s only that the suspected killer is now in Pollsmoor and I cannot go there to ask him. I’m not at peace with myself because I know if Amahle was alive, she would have not rested knowing her clothes are not home,” she said. On Saturday, a group of young people from around Philippi planted trees at the seen where Amahle’s body was found dumped. They went on to plant some more three at the scene where Nomvuzo Atoli’s body was found two months ago. Mandulele said its been hard three months since the death of her daughter, but she thanked the residents and Mzansi people for supporting her. “A group of young people came here and told me that they wanted to do something for Amahle on Saturday. They went to the scene she was found and planted trees. They also left some flowers. This alone gives me comfort knowing that many people are empathising with me and my family,” she added. The suspected killer is expected to appear in Wynberg court tomorrow.
