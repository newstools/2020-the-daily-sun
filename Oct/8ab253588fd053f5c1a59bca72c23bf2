THE Free State ANC Youth League provincial task team has hit
out at members of the league from the province who came out in defense of ANC
secretary general Ace Magashule. The task team in a statement peppered with colorful words
distanced itself from the statement, labeling the group a ma-gang-shule. It further described the group as an erstwhile youth league
leadership whose purpose is to create shadow-imaginary stories that "a
possible arrest of criminals such as Ace will destroy the ANC". The task team said it believed the arrest of Magashule will
be made soon. This despite the Hawks reiterating on Wednesday that there was no
warrant of arrest for Magashule. "There is no amount of ideological farting and twerking
of eldership can convince us that State institutions of law enforcements are
used against "RET-forces. "Ace Magashule has led no "Economic Struggle"
in Free State as a former Premier and Provincial Chairperson of the ANC, except
for destroying comrades and wrecking marriages," said the task team. It said the members who released the statement doesÂ  not represent the young people of Free State
but their persal numbers and tenders. " They must be moerd tomorrow for making the
revolutionary house a play ground to twerk for leadership," it said. As news of alleged imminent arrest of Magashule, a statement
purporting to be from the Free State ANCYL began circulating, denouncing the
intended move saying this was abuse of state resources to settle political
scores. It alleged this was done to target political "big
fish" who it said was Magashule "By so doing, the public is sold a negative narrative
underpinned by falsehoods, character assassinations and manufactured allegations
which will never stand a test of time in a competent court of law," it
said.
