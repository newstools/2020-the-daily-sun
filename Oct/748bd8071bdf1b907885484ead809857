SINCE Covid-19 broke out, there’s been a new development called the “new normal”, seen by the World Health Organisation as a new chapter after the pandemic. The world will have to adapt to a new way of doing things politically, financially and socially and one of these new ways of doing things includes co-parenting. Relationships are very complex, and the way they end can be even more so. Along the way, God also blesses us with little bundles of joy which need both their parents to navigate their journey through life. So, what happens when things go south and you now have a young or older child to raise? Instead of going through an ugly custody or child maintenance battle, you can maturely go the co-parenting route. Co-parenting or joint parenting is the shared parenting of children by their parents or parental figures who aren’t married or are living apart. These co-parents may be divorced or never have been married and aren’t romantically involved with each other. According to research published in the Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Family Science, children raised by co-operative co-parents have fewer behaviour problems and are also closer to their fathers than kids raised by hostile co-parents or a single parent. Remember, whatever may have happened in your relationship in the past, is in the past. Your present focus should be on what’s best for your child or children.
