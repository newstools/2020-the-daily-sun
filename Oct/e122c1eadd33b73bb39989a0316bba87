MOTORISTS and residents say the pool of water on the kasi’s main road is making their lives difficult. For the past two months, cars have been unable to drive on Link Road in Philippi, Cape Town. Now motorists are putting pedestrians lives at risks by driving on the pavement. Nomzamo Njokozana (34) told Daily Sun: “We can’t walk in peace because cars are jostling for the same path we use. We’re forced to take longer routes in between shacks to avoid being hit by cars.”  Residents said the Toyota Avanza drivers, who are known as amaphela, were the main culprits. “Amaphela drivers forget the pavement is for pedestrians and they must respect us,” said another resident. Amaphela drivers said they couldn’t drive through the water as the road has many potholes. Mthuthuzeli Rani (43) said: “When there’s no water, I can see the potholes and avoid them. But I can’t do that when there’s water.” He said he was forced to use the road because it was where passengers waited. “This is creating tension between us and residents because we always fight over who gets to use the pavement first,” he said. Transport MMC Felicity Purchase said they attended to a sinkhole caused by collapsed stormwater infrastructure last month, but the problem kept returning. “It’s important to add that after repairing the pipe, the flooding reoccurred due to silt and rubble stuck in the stormwater pipe – all of this material ended up in the stormwater system due to illegal dumping,” she said. “Water still flows through the system, but at a minimal rate. “We will, in due course, clear the pipe with a high pressure jet machine followed by bucket machines. The machines will be on site as soon as the new tender for mechanical machinery is in place.” But she said the flooding would keep happening as long as people dump waste in stormwater drains.
