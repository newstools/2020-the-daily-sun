THE atmosphere was emotional as hundreds of residents, family and friends bid farewell to the Mahashe family members who were shot on Heritage Day. Four family members – Gogo Mqazana Mahashe (69), her grandchild Sithule (18), Gogo’s last born Asanele (30) and Asanele’s son Ahlume (11) – were murdered on 24 September in their house in Philippi, Cape Town. Three men entered the house looking for gogo’s son, who was not at home. After being told that he was not there, the killers went on a rampage and shot everyone who was in the house. A resident who was at the house at the time was also shot and was rushed to the hospital and died days later.  Family member Siyabulela Ngamtini said they are devastated, adding that it happened when they least expected it. “Gogo Mqazana was sick sometimes and would be taken to the hospital. She was in good health when she died. We never thought she would die from being shot. We have lost an elder of our family who was a pillar to many of us,”  said Siyabulela. He said Gogo helped him fix his marriage which was about to break down in 2004 because of her wisdom. Leaders of the Evangelic Method Apostolic Church, where gogo was a member, said she was an honest person who would speak her mind. She was one of the elders at the church who mentored newly married women. Gogo Mqazana was a member of ANC Women’s League. A group of her friends sang revolutionary songs and danced during the funeral. The tent that the service was held in was full as many residents came to support the family.  Resident Zandibuze Quqani said the Mahashe family will get their support any time they need it. “As residents, we will be there for them. Just like the day it happened, we did not sleep at our homes. We spent all night here in their home. We will do that every time they need us, we will always be there for them,” said Zandibuze.
