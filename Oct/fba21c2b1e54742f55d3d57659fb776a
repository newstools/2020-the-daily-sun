The first Spanish Clasico of the season between Barcelona and Real Madrid will be played on Saturday, 24 October, LaLiga said on Tuesday. The match was originally pencilled in for the following day, when the majority of games in the seventh round of the Liga season will be played. It will be behind closed doors at the Camp Nou. The two giants of the Spanish championship begin their Champions League campaigns a few days earlier. Barca host Ferencvaros of Hungary on Tuesday, 20 October, while Real Madrid are at home to Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine the following day. Real Madrid lead the LaLiga standings after five games, three points ahead of fifth-placed Barcelona. Real beat Barcelona 2-0 at the Bernabeu in the last meeting between the clubs at the start of January to overtake the Catalan club at the top of LaLiga. -AFP
