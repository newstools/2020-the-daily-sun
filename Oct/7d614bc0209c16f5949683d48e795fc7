GAUTENG traffic police are serious about tackling reckless driving on the roads. Provincial traffic police spokesman, Sello Maremane, said since the beginning of this month, which marked Transport Month, 37 drivers were bust for speeding at roadblocks across the province. Yesterday, the department conducted another roadblock on the N1 highway near Diepkloof in Soweto. Maremane said many drivers were caught speeding and there was high incidence of reckless and negligent driving. “We’ve also scrapped off more than 80 unroadworthy vehicles and 82 drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol,” he said. Maremane said motorists needed to change their behaviour when using public roads and not put other drivers at risk.

Maremane said one of the objectives of Transport Month was to encourage safety on the roads. “We remind motorists to make sure that their cars are roadworthy and the drivers are fit to drive a car.” At the roadblock, cops were on the lookout for worn-out tyres and broken indicator, head and brake lights. Traffic cops also checked for stolen or unlawful items. ““Motorists can also bring their cars to our centres for a thorough roadworthy check to be done free of charge,” he said. During yesterday’s roadblock, a foreign national was nabbed after he was found with a pile of IDs, passports and driver’s licenses. He denied being the owner of the car, alleging it was borrowed to him and he was not aware what was inside the boot. However, it was further found he didn’t have a driver’s licence.
