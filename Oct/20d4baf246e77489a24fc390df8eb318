WE NOW live in a world that has virtually changed in a big way. The Covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed a lot in terms of human behaviour. From how we work, school, and how we communicate and socialise. This pandemic has really brought about a new normal. Another new normal is something called virtual sex. Yes, having sex online and with the past lockdown regulations, this phenomenon had become a new trend globally. By definition, virtual sex is anything sexual in nature happening in a digital space, according to psychotherapist Ashley D. Sweet. This act includes any type of sexual activity over the internet. From video chats, phone sex, sexting, long-distance sexual play enabled by toys and sex-tech, and even some forms of interactive pornography, all fall under the umbrella of virtual sex. According to experts, most of us at some stage in our sexual lives have experienced virtual sex. Some people easily assume virtual sex only refers to having sex on Zoom or interacting with cam girls, she notes, but the first paid phone sex line was established about 40 years ago. According to experts, virtual sex is convenient, accessible for people of all abilities, and a great option to explore new sexual acts you may not feel comfortable doing in person.
