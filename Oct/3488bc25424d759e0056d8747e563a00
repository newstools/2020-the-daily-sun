HE allegedly raped and killed a three-year-old girl in his shack on Saturday night. He then put her body in a dustbin! He dragged the bin out to the street, but realised he’d forgotten something and went back to his shack. While gone, a resident saw the bin and opened it. She was shocked by what she saw and screamed to alert other residents. The man tried to flee, but residents of Phola Park in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, caught him and beat him before setting him alight. The man’s burnt body was found by cops on Sunday morning. WOMEN WITH TWO PUNANIS! The girl’s mum was too traumatised to speak to Daily Sun and refused to be photographed. Community leader Khuthala Kayingana said they were worried by incidents of violence against children in the squatter camp. Captain Vuyisile Mvelase of Thokoza Police Station said the three-year-old went missing on Saturday at about 11am after she and her sister went out to play. “The grandmother and the girl’s mum were surprised when the 11-year-old sister returned alone and went to search for her without success,” said Mvelase. Cops searched for the child, but couldn’t find her. “A missing persons case was opened,” she said. Mvelase said while opening the case cops received a call that the child had been found, but was dead. Residents caught the suspect as he was about to dispose of the body. “He was beaten and set alight. Cops tried to rescue him, but angry residents attacked them with stones, injuring one cop,” she said. Rape and murder cases were opened.
