HOUSE and gqom DJ Boonu was relieved when his Covid-19 test came back negative. He went for a test after he came into contact with Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who’s tested positive. The DJ, whose real name is Andile Chili, has asked people to grow up. He came into contact with the minister after they sat next to each other during a flight from Joburg to Durban on Saturday. On Sunday, the minister announced he was infected and going into isolation. People then started making fun of DJ Boonu, saying he was infected and hiding it. He was tested on Monday and the results came back negative on Tuesday. The uSwidi Wodwa singer shared his results on social media to prove he wasn’t lying. He told Daily Sun he posted a photo with the minister on his Facebook page on Saturday, which sparked the accusations. “I was excited to sit next to the minister and was surprised he knew who I was. I’m happy we followed regulations and wore masks,” he said. “After the minister announced he’d tested positive, my cellphone was flooded with calls and WhatsApp messages. “Some were calling to support me. Others accused me of lying. Those I met on Saturday were alarmed.” DJ Boonu said the minister’s son, Dedani, phoned him on Sunday. “Dedani told me to go and get tested ASAP,” he said. “I respected the minister’s instruction and I’m happy I tested negative. “People should stop accusing me of having Covid-19 and support those who’ve been infected.”
