UP-AND-COMING artist Mvelo “Nature Boy” Phakathi (25) has released a song about Zodwa Wabantu. The song is titled Zodwa Wabantu and it aims to appreciate her. Nature Boy told Daily Sun he met Zodwa Wabantu last year. “I met her in Durban at Mashamplani Lounge where I was performing. She must have liked my performance because as I was entertaining the crowd she also came and danced in front of me. After the performance she asked me to join her and her friends at her table,” said Nature Boy. ALSO READ: CONCERNS AS ZODWA WABANTU KISSES FANS! He said that from what he observed, Zodwa is the coolest celebrity he has ever met. “She was very relaxed, free spirited and fun to be around with. The idea of writing this song came from that encounter. A few weeks later I wrote the song. Once I was done I gave it to her and she approved it. But it took me more than a year to write and perfect it. “I only released it in May this year and the music video was released in June. Unfortunately I could not market it due to lockdown,” said Nature Boy. Speaking about Zodwa Wabantu, he said: “Zodwa Wabantu is my shero. She doesn’t let anything stand in her way. What I like about her is that she is not fake and she does her seek anyone’s approval. “Instead, she does her own thing and for that reason I salute her. I hope she is also an inspiration to other young women,” said Nature Boy. Zodwa Wabantu confirmed she is aware of the song. “I am very much aware of this song and I fully support Nature Boy. I am also happy that he chose me to be his shero and his role model. However, I would also encourage him to do the same to up-and-coming artists,” she said.
