Just hours before the business of the day begins at the Senekal Magistrates Court, there is already a hype of activities in this small Free State town. On the roads that are leading into Senekal, there are roadblocks with police doing stop and search. The cops were mainly searching for weapons. EFF members descended into the area in several buses. They were singing and dancing outside the court house around 7 am. The farmers were not seen outside court, they were only seen on the way to court on the outskirts of Senekal. Yesterday EFF leader Julius Malema said they were coming into the area to defend the democracy.  This was after the chaos that erupted at the Senekal Magistrates Court last week when two men accused of killing a young farm manager Brendin Horner. The court building was left vandalised and a police van was flipped over and set alight. #EFF members sing and dance as they make their way to #Senekal Magistrate Court.
