PROTESTERS went on the rampage yesterday, barricading roads with rocks and setting alight a house belonging to an alleged killer of a little girl. The residents of Motloung section in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, were left furious after the body of Ebenezer Ndebele (8) was found a few houses from her home on Monday. They claimed one of the men, who lived in the house they set alight, had been seen with blood stains on his shirt. But police could not confirm these claims. Ebenezer’s family told Daily Sun she left home on Sunday to visit her uncle on the same street at their house, but she never arrived. Her aunt, Sbongumusa Sibanda, said Ebenezer’s mum Pretty Sibanda (28) was not aware she had gone missing until she phoned her uncle that evening to find out if she’d be spending the night with his children.  “We all began to worry and started looking for her. We asked neighbours and her friends if they had seen her,” she said. Sbongumusa said the house that was burnt down was next to the yard where Ebenezer’s body was found, and was rented out to alleged drug addicts. She said the landlord also lived on the property. “Her tights were over her knees and there was clearly blood on her panties. “She had scratches and it looked like she had been thrown over a fence from the house,” she said. Sbongumusa said Pretty was traumatised and heavily pregnant. “She is due to give birth this week. “How will she have the strength to bury her child? The residents are very angry,” she said. Ebenezer’s other aunt, Buhle Mathema, said residents were gatvol of the house owner renting out rooms to drug addicts. Police spokesman Captain Leseja Mathobela said a man was taken in for questioning and later released. A case of murder is being investigated.
