RAIN is said to bring blessings and good luck. But in areas such as Stjwetla in Alexandra, east of Joburg, which is along the notorious Jukskei River, rain brings fear. Though the recent rain wasn’t enough to fill the river, people who live along the banks slept with one eye open. Betly Chauke (33) said people’s shacks often got swept away by the water.

He said they wanted to move out of the area as it was not conducive for living.  “No one wants to live here forever as most people came here to be closer to places of work.” Loveness Mandlati told the People’s Paper: “We get scared when it starts to rain. “There was a lot of water in the river yesterday, but it didn’t affect us because the river was not as full.” Joburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) said they would remain on high alert. This after a man, believed to be in his 30s, was struck and killed by lightning on a farm in Elandsfontein on Monday. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics responded to the scene and found the man lying motionless. “He was surrounded by his colleagues. Medics assessed him and found he showed no signs of life. He was declared dead,” said Meiring.  EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said another person was also struck by lightning in Melville. “Unfortunately, the patient was confirmed dead on the scene and investigations by local authorities are currently underway,” he said.
