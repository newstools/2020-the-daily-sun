 SUNWHEELS took the Honda Amaze for a spin and was more than a bit surprised by this small sedan. The rear is awesome, with a combination of lights and dynamic lines that run to both ends. The same goes for the well-designed sides, complemented by a set of 15-inch alloys. But everything changes when you come to the front. That flat straight face is unique and I still need to be convinced about the straight nose. Actually, while I was driving it on the Golden highway, south of Joburg, an older model of the sedan swung by with a sharper nose and I wondered why Honda came up with this shape nose. When you jump inside, the interior is very cool and comfortable, with black and white finishes that run from the dashboard all the way to the doors and seats. I found the controls and the entertainment user-friendly and a good companion to the occupants, although there is room for improvement on the sound.  Under the bonnet sits the Honda’s i-VTEC intelligent valve-timing management system, offering great performance and fuel efficiency. The engine output is 66kW, paired with 110Nm of torque, which works quite well with the five-speed manual gearbox. Fuel consumption hovered around 5,0 to 5,5litres per 100km, which doesn’t hit the pocket hard at all. Pricing: 1.2 Trend Manual R193 156 1.2 Comfort Manual R217 356 1.2 Comfort Manual R217 356
