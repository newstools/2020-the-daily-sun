PEOPLE in Mzansi never run out of ways to party. This time, a group of young people were captured on video dancing on a ganda ganda. The video was apparently shot in Botshabelo in Bloemfontein, Free State. In the video, the young people are lifted on the excavator, while others hang on while the driver operates the boom and bucket. Another group is seen hanging inside the bucket while it moves up and down with a crowd cheering them on. The people are not wearing masks and aren’t practicing social distancing despite lockdown being on level 1. Many people on social media had a lot to say about the video. Most felt what the people were doing was irresponsible, especially during a pandemic.  But other users found the video entertaining. Joe Masemola (57), who works into construction, told Daily Sun that he also owns an excavator. He said that when he saw the video he was shocked. “That thing is expensive, and it was shocking to see people playing with it like that,” he said.
