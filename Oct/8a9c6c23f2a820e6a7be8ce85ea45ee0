ALEX Mahlare says a contributing factor to Mzansi’s high number of divorces is that partners don’t pray together. The 45-year-old author of Soon to be Divorced said he was shocked to find out how many Christians didn’t pray before meals. Alex from Phokwane Village, outside Nebo in Limpopo urged partners to pray together. He said it would strengthen their marriage and protect them against evil spirits. He said they should pray together before they go to bed and in the morning to grow closer to God and each other. “When praying, they should ask the Lord to guide and protect them and address the needs of those they love. They should also pray when one of them is troubled, even during emergencies.” Alex said at first, some couples might feel self-conscious or that they’re not close enough emotionally to pray together. “Partners who pray together stay together. That’s because prayer itself is such an intimate activity. When you pray with someone, you’re agreeing to making yourself vulnerable,” he said. Alex told Daily Sun prayer knitted hearts together and bonded partners in ways they could not experience any other way. He said partners couldn’t pray together and still be angry with each other, so they should choose a place and time to pray together each day. He said those who commuted together could also pray in the car. “Keep your sessions short, especially at first. “Pray for each other before you name anyone else. No one can pray for your partner like you and probably no one will. “Focus on one issue your partner will face that day – a difficult client, a dreaded parent-teacher conference or relatives from outer space,” Alex said.
