WITH many questions and no answers, parents wish to get their hands on the Orange Farm double murder accused, Pontsho Mohlanka (29). Seeing her in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court in the Vaal, where she appeared for bail application reminded the families of the murders of best friends Simphiwe Mgcina (6) and Mpho Makonde (8). Speaking to Daily Sun outside court yesterday, Mpho’s aunt Dimakatso Makonde, said: “She doesn’t deserve to be in jail. What happened to the kids should happen to her. Her family must know how we feel.” Mpho’s other relative, Pinky Dlamini, said seeing the alleged killer invoked a lot of emotions. “We are not okay, especially when we see this girl. “She is not saying anything about the killings. We don’t want her to get bail,” she said. Pinky said they were getting better, but the sight of the alleged killer brought back the pain. The families and residents wanted to know why Mohlanka allegedly killed the kids. They also want their suspicions that she could be working with more people to kidnap and kill children confirmed. Pinky said: “The kids didn’t deserve to die the way they did. We want those who work with her to be arrested because they deserve to rot in jail.” The case was postponed to next Monday for Mohlanka to decide whether she will get a private or state lawyer. Mpho and Simphiwe are not the first kids to be killed in the area. In April, the naked body of a five-year-old boy, who had been missing, was found between fridges in one of his neighbour’s yards.
