There have been mixed feelings about Bafana Bafana's 2-1 loss to Zambia on Sunday, which came hot on the heels of their 1-1 draw against Namibia in their two international friendlies.  Bafana are preparing for theÂ  back-to-back 2021 Afcon qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe on 9 and 17 November where they will have to win at all costs. Bafana coach, Molefi Ntseki, used the game to identify more talent and to look at his charges' ability after having stayed for long without playing, owing to Covid-19 enforced lockdowns. Players themselves have not been busy as they also had to stay away until last month when they finished the 2019-20 PSL season in a bio-bubble. But Ntseki admits physically they were not at their best due to inactivity, but tactically they were spot on.  However, he is happy now that the PSL season is about to start with the MTN8 this weekend, and then the DStv Premiership a week later, which he reckons will help his players with game time. Percy Tau and Thulani Hlatshwayo didn't hide their unhappiness as they believe they should have won against Zambia and Namibia, but they're hoping to do better against Sao Tome and Principe. To help us unpack and analyse Bafana's latest setbacks, we're joined by Daily Sun's Maxwell Ramaru, Kgomotso Sethusha and eNCA's Tshepo Thobane.
