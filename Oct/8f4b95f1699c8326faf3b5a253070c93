“WE are free ... We are free!” This is what the #OperationVulaPresident artists, also known as KZN 32,
shouted as they stepped out of Pinetown Magistrates Court. Charges against the 32 artists were withdrawn yesterday. Among them were Idols SA star Noma Khumalo, Naima Kay, Mduduzi Mkhize,
Khaya Dladla, Sandy B, Nokuthula Mabika and Melusi Ndlovu. They were arrested on 2 September this year and charged for illegal
gathering and for the contravention of the National Road Traffic Act. The artists closed the N3 between Pavilion Mall and the Durban CBD. They
demanded that President Cyril Ramphosa open the industry. They were later released on bail. They made their first appearance on 9 September. The case was then postponed for further investigation and yesterday, all
the artists were set free. Prosecutor January Ndoda told Pree Pillay that the state has decided to
withdraw the charges against all the accused. No reasons were given to the court. Representative lawyer Thula Mlondo told Daily Sun: “We made our
representations and the state accepted them. Unfortunately I cannot disclose
the grounds of our defence,” he said. One of the artists, Sandy B, said: “I am very much relieved that this is
over. It was stressful and we were not sure how it would turn out. In the same
breath we would like to apologise to those who were inconvenienced during the
march.” Musician Naima Kay said she was quite relieved because they meant no
harm. “The march was meant to make our voices heard. But today we are happy
that the case is over and we can go back to our normal lives,” she said. She said that the police were harsh on them. “I still feel we were treated badly because our march was innocent and
peaceful. But we found ourselves being chased like criminals. Yet, in a recent
case whereby the farmers damaged state property we never saw the same
treatment. I still feel we were treated unfairly,” she said.
