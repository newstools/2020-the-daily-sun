FANNIE Mamba (33), originally from Zimbabwe, briefly appeared in Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court today. Mamba, a pastor at Holiness Church in Shatale, allegedly forced entry into a teacher’s home in College View in Bushbuckridge on Wednesday at about 7am as the 48-year-old and her son (13) were about to go to school. When he had tied both up with cable ties, he ransacked their house. The pastor was listening attentively in the dock when public prosecutor Aletta Mnisi told the court he was facing two counts of house robbery with aggravating circumstances and pointing a person with a firearm. “I don’t understand the assault charges against me,” said Mamba. But Magistrate Ayesha Kikia warned him. “Sir, currently we are not dealing with the merits of the matter, but your bail circumstances as the offence you are facing is very serious and falls under schedule six. This advises you to either get a representative from the Legal Aid Board or at your expense.” Kikia said: “Allegedly, you assaulted the victim at gunpoint, and tied her and her son with cable ties before robbing her of a sound system, plasma TV, three cellphones, house keys and car keys and bank credit cards and her Toyota Avanza to the total value of R272 330.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the suspect, wearing a balaclava, forced entry into the victims’ house and held them hostage as he demanded money. He said he tied them up before robbing them of valuable items and made off with her Avanza. Police started investigating, working with a car tracking company. The collective were led to a house in Violetbank, where the stolen items were found and the car was later recovered abandoned in Acornhoek. “The suspect was arrested in Bushbuckridge. Police searched his place and found a toy gun they believe was used by the suspect earlier to commit house robbery.” The matter has been postponed until next Thursday for bail application and lawyer arrangements.
