A MOZAMBICAN and two minors were among those bust during Operation Okae Molao at Ekandustria near Bronkhorstspruit, Tshwane, yesterday. The operation was led by Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and provincial police commissioner, General Elias Mawela. Mazibuko was shocked when they stopped a bakkie carrying two boys aged 15 and 16, who were allegedly going to work at a nearby township. When she asked why they were not at school, she realised they were illegal immigrants from Mozambique. “This is wrong. Kids their age should be at school, not working. This is child labour,” she said. The boys and their driver were bust on the spot. She said Home Affairs would help the boys and hopefully Social Development would also help them go back to their country or be taken to school in Mzansi. A man running an illegal tavern in Ekangala was also bust. Alcohol was confiscated, while a jukebox was disconnected. Mazibuko gave the cops the thumbs-up for a job well done. She said based on the motorists’ reaction, it seemed the area was neglected by police. “Criminals hide in such places which are in rural areas, but they now know we can appear at any time and uproot their criminal activities,” she said.  A lot of people were given fines as they were driving with expired licence disks and driver’s licences, or driving while on the phone. An 18-year-old school boy was given a fine after he was found driving a car with an expired learner driver’s licence. Cops also discovered several car registration plates and sjamboks in his car. Mawela praised the police. “The operations won’t stop while we still have criminal activities taking place in our province,” he said. Motorist Mandla Skhosana said: “We wish such operations were done more frequently. This would minimise crime.”
