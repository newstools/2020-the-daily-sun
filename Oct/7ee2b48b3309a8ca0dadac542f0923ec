I always feel bad when I see couples divorcing. Statistics reveal that three out of five South African marriages end in divorce. Men and women seem to fight harder for their divorces than they do for their marriages. To our ancestors, marriage is sacred and considered a lifelong commitment. Our forebears stayed married until death did them part. Today, marriage isn’t the institution it once was. It seems marriage has been reduced to a self-fulfilling adventure that’s without meaning and value. Celebrities in Mzansi have joined the disgraceful Western club of popcorn marriages where children are victims of single-parent homes or careless parents. It’s about time we see marriage as a sacred thing and keep it that way. - Letter by Esther Sithole, Tsakane
