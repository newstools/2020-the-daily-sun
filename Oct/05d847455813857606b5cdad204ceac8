AMAPIANO artist Cutjolicious, whose real name is Khutso Chuene, has reason to smile. Born in Ga-Makata Village, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, the amapiano star wants to take the music industry by storm. He recently released his double music videos Delicious and Piano, featuring various local artists. Cutjolicious said: “I’ve dedicated my time, energy and effort to the project. “This has worked for me and I’m happy with the final results. “The video was shot in Gauteng, which taught me that it takes a collective to succeed in the music industry.” According to the artist, people will enjoy watching some of the music videos on television.

He was worried that many artists from Limpopo undermine each other and don’t help each other out. “Our province has some of the best talent,” he said. “I believe working as a collective can work for many of us now and in generations to come.” Cutjolicious said he always makes time to communicate with his fans through social media whenever he’s about to shoot a music video. “I do so to measure whether or not the video I’m about to release would do it for the fans and to get their response,” he said. “This works for me because it always yields good results.” His next plan is to shoot five music videos before the end of the year. “I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and that assures me my plan can work despite Covid-19. “The fourth music video, Bomma, will be shot during my fifth birthday extravaganza celebration on Saturday. “The last one, Release Her, will be shot either in November or December.” He said his two remaining projects would be a major success, and that his fans would be crying out for more.
