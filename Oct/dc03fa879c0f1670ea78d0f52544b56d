ORLANDO Pirates have parted ways with French goalkeeper Joris Delle and loaned out Justin Shonga. Delle struggled to break it into the Buccaneers line up on his firt season in South Africa and the player has since requested to leave citing that he is struggling to adjust to new surroundings. "After spending a year in South Africa, Delle has submitted a request in writing citing his inability to adjust to his new surroundings and wants to return to Europe," said the club in a statement. "The Club met the player this morning and has acceded to the 30-year old's request. "His contract has been terminated with immediate effect." Pirates also confirmed that they have loaned out Zambia striker, Shonga. "The Club can also confirm that striker Justin Shonga has also left the Club and will be joining TTM," the statement continued. Defender Ntsikelelo Nyauza has extended his stay for three more seasons. "Defender Ntsikelelo Nyauza put pen to paper on a new deal that will see the 30-year old extend his stay on board the Bucs ship for a further three seasons." The Club is still in talks with 33-year old Luvuyo Memela over extending his stay at the Club, however the two parties are yet to reach an agreement.
