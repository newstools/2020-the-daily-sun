AMAZULU have shown a huge statement of intent in this coming season's transfer market. The Durban-based side has signed former Orlando Pirates duo - Xola Mlambo and Augustine Mulenga. Both these players were free agent after parting company with the Soweto giants recently. Mulenga was said to have signed newbies Tshakhuma Tsha Madzihvandila a few days ago, but the player wasn’t interested to join the Limpopo side. Mlambo was also wanted by another new side TS Galaxy and its chairman Tim Sukazi confirmed that he was interested in the player he managed while he was an agent. However, Sukazi has lost out in Mlambo. “Yes, AmaZulu have signed Xola Mlambo and Augustine Mulenga,” said the insider. “I know you might be surprised by Mulenga, because many people thought he joined TTM. That didn’t happen, the player belongs to AmaZulu.” Both these players have arrived in Durban now and SunSport also spotted them ushered to the hotel. These players will be unveiled by Usuthu management on Monday, which new owner Sandile Zungu will be attendance, at Hilton Hotel. There’s also an opportunity the club will confirm the signing of Siphelele Mthembu and Makhehleni Makhaula. For now, according to SunSport insider, the club is set to finalise everything with the duo on Sunday. Both Makhaula and Mthembu were clubless after leaving now-defunct Highlands Park and Cape Town City respectively. The signing of Mulenga and Mlambo doesn’t come as a surprise though. Chairman Zungu made it clear at the club’s jersey unveiling on Monday last week that there were players they were interested both locally and internationally and didn’t’ divulge their names. When Zungu bought the club from the Sokhela family on 2 October and unveiling his plans at Hilton Hotel, he said the club will have to finish in the top four this season and coach Ayanda Dlamini will be backed in the market.
