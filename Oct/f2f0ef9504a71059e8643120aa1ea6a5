ACTOR Thabo Mnguni’s on screen character, Mr Mabtha on Uzalo, sees him preying on young unsuspecting girls at the KwaMashu Kingdom Church, where he’s a pastor. But in real life, he has been accused of being a sexual predator. A female co-star reportedly accused the star of being a sexual predator, but Stained Glass Productions has come to his defence and rubbished the allegations against their star. In a statement, the company that produces the hit show, rubbished the claims. “The talented Thabo Mnguni, who plays Mr Mbatha, has been the subject of numerous media headlines and stories tainting his professional and private image. Uzalo has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to workplace misconduct,” read the statement in part.

Thabo Mnguni’s character on Uzalo is currently involved in some unscrupulous activities, including a sexual abuse scandal,” the statement further reads. Actor Mangaliso Ngema, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by fellow star Lorraine Moropa, has since been axed from SABC2’s Lithapo.
