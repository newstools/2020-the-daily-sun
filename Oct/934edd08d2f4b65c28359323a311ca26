PRINCE Moses Mahlalela says he wants to be recognised by the authorities as king of Mpumalanga’s Ngwane clan. He was declared crown prince by his late father, Chief Jakalazi Mahlalela of the Ngwane kingdom, in 1973 before the chief joined Umkhonto weSizwe in Zambia. He said: “Our forefather Ngwane travelled from Kenya with his two sons, Mahlalela and younger brother Dlamini, to settle in the Nkomazi area. “Today, his people are led by a certain chief. “I submitted a claim to the Nhlapo Commission, Mpumalanga Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs and provincial House of Traditional Leaders. But they’re sending us from pillar to post.” His lawyer, Advocate Innocent Mabaso, told Daily Sun they were waiting for a response from the department and the House of Traditional Leaders. “Even the eldest in the Masibekela royal family attested that Prince Moses is crown prince,” said Mabaso. “But Mpumalanga Cogta and the House of Traditional Leaders have not yet responded to our request.” But Cogta spokesman, George Mthethwa, said: “The department hasn’t received any request of this nature.” Mpumalanga House of Traditional leaders chairman, Inkosi Sandile Ngomane, said: “Prince Moses Mahlalela made a presentation to the Mpumalanga House of Traditional Leaders once or twice about their lost chieftaincy. “We advised them to approach the Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims Commission for recognition by government.” Ngomane said the House of Traditional Leaders has no jurisdiction on people who aren’t recognised as amakhosi by government, nor does it have the power to restore a lost kingship or chieftaincy.
