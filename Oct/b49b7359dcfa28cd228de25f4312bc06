NEWBIES Swallows FC are set to face their toughest test yet since their return to the big time when they face a dangerous Bloemfontein Celtic outfit. The match will take place at the Dobsonville Stadium ton Wednesday night (7.30pm). Phunya Sele Sele were described by Golden Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi as “one of the best teams in the country at the moment” after their 1-1 draw. Celtic have grown from strength to strength under John Maduka, and they find themselves in the semi-finals of the MTN8. They are expected to give Birds their toughest test ever since their promotion to the big league. But the Soweto outfit will be relishing the challenge and hoping to continue their positive start to the season after they managed to earn a point in their opening match against Stellenbosch FC. Swallows coach Brandon Truter is wary of the threat posed by Celtic, but he believes he will learn a lot about his side against a very good team. “That’s a really difficult game. Celtic are Nedbank Cup finalists and they are now in the semi-finals of the MTN8,” said Truter. “They’re really well drilled. They have good structure and their players are really good. “It’s undoubtedly going to be a tough game for us, but it will give us a good idea of how far we are as a team. “It’s tough games like that which give you a clear picture of where you are at, so we are definitely looking forward to it.” Truter was pleased with what his side were able to do against Stellies last time out but insists they have to take it up a notch against Celtic. “We were tactically sound, but we got caught out here and there because we tend to overdo things,” added Truter. “The players need to realise that you get away with some things in the GladAfrica Championship, but not in the Premiership. “In this division teams will punish you if you are not at it for the entire 90 plus minutes. It’s a tough league.”
