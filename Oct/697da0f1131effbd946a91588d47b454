AT FIRST glance, you’d think it’s a sci-fi movie car that’s ready to transform into Megatron and wage a war against Optimus Prime. Nissan South Africa has launched its latest stylish addition to the Qashqai City Proof family called the Midnight Edition. It’s the ultimate urban crossover and that has made the world pay since 2006.  If you are an urban jungle warrior with style, presence, and personality this might be your perfect go-to Autobot. From its black roofline to black “Wind” 19-inch alloys, to gloss black mirror caps – the trendy Midnight Edition is built to turn heads day or night.  Nissan Group of Africa marketing director Kabelo Rabotho said they want to bring customers products that are innovative and beautiful by bringing ingenuity into the areas of vehicle engineering, development and production. This impressive range of design updates includes a black roofline, black roof rails, and darkened front bumper insert which will ensure that you will be the centre of attention from a distance.  The darkened V-Motion grille, black “Wind” 19-inch alloy wheels and glossy black mirror caps combine a high sense of style, emotional design, space, comfort, and technology to make the mobility experience unified. To close it off and to ensure the customer has the modern appeal linked to comfort, the Midnight Edition stays true to its name by having black air vents and a gear knob, Alcantara seats, and floor mats with red “Qashqai” stitching. The Qashqai Midnight Edition is also kitted out with the latest in Nissan Intelligent Mobility features including the Around View Monitor with Moving Object Detection and Forward Collision Warning to easily anticipate the unexpected.
