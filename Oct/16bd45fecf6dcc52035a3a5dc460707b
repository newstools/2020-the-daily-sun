AMBITIOUS Swallows FC have launched a serious man hunt for Mamelodi Sundowns youngster Sammy Seabi, SunSport can confirm. SunSport has reliably learnt that Swallows have approached Sundowns for the services of the 25-year-old midfielder. The Limpopo-born star joined the Brazilians last season from Polokwane City where he was an integral part of the team's success in the previous season, when they ended the season within the top eight backet. It however remains unclear whether Sundowns will release him after Pitso Mosimane's shock resignation from the club to join Egyptian giants Al Ahly last week. Manqoba Mngqithi and Rhulani Mokwena are busy ascertaining whether they are ready to lose him to the Soweto club, or not. Swallows chairman, David Mogashoa, said they are talking to different players and was in no position to reveal whether Seabi is one of them. However, an insider at Sundowns has confirmed that the Dube Birds are desperate to lure the youngster into their star-studded nest.
