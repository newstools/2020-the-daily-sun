LAST year, Volkswagen announced that it was overhauling its logo and in Mzansi the Polo GTI is the first to bear the new logo. The locally manufactured Polo, including the Polo GTI, is the first model range to have the new Volkswagen logo in South Africa. The new Volkswagen logo is incorporated in the front and rear of the car as well as the steering wheel, wheels caps, radio, and the car key.
