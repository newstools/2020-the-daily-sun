NEW Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Joel Masutha is impressed by his team’s performance despite a 3-2 defeat against SuperSport United in the MTN8 quarter-finals at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Tshakhuma conceded three goals in 33 minutes, but bounced back and scored twice. And the former Black Leopards and Chippa United coach said there is a lot of positives to take from the defeat ahead of the club’s maiden season in the DStv Premiership. “I think we were very nervous when we started the game on Saturday and it cost us,” Masutha said. “But United scored three goals, but we came back and started to play according to our plan. “I think we were unlucky not to get a third goal because we created many scoring chances in the second half. But I am happy with the way we played. It’s not easy to score two goals against a big team like SuperSport United.” Masutha was appointed as the Venda-based side head coach last week, and only had seven days to assemble a team for the weekend clash. The former Leopards goalkeeper believes he has a quality team after signing experienced players such as Brighton Mhlongo, Ayanda Nkili, Meshack Maphangule, Miguel Timm, Mogakolodi Ngele and Justin Shonga. “We have a good team and I see things going well in the new season,” added Masutha. “We have a strong team, and we were unlucky on Saturday. We will do well this season.” Both TTM’s goals were scored by Botswana international Ngele, while Bradley Grobler, Iqraam Rayners and Lungu Ghampani netted for Matsatsantsa a Pitori.
