FANS can expect no new look Mamelodi Sundowns team post the Pitso Mosimane era. New coach Manqoba Mngqithi doesn't intend to fix what ain't broken.Together with co-coach Rhulani Mokwena, Mngqithi guides the Brazilians in his first match against Bloemfontein Celtic in their opening MTN8 Cup match in Atteridgeville on Sunday. But according to the former Sundowns assistant coach, it will be more or less the same team that clinched a treble last season. ”We would not like to tamper much with what has been happening all along because we have been part of it, but obviously all coaches have their own individual differences," said Mngqithi. ”There are going to be small elements that can change in the game and approach and probably the personality of the team, and also looking at the number of players (new signings) we have. "It's more slightly they will bring small elements into the game and that's why we brought them here.” Mngqithi, however, admitted change is inevitable and with the new signings on board, and that they will be gradually phasing them in. He added: ”One cannot say it's going to be exactly the same but we will try as much as we can that the team can be okay... more or less as Pitso's era. "As I said, there will be changes here and there but they have to be slowly introduced."
