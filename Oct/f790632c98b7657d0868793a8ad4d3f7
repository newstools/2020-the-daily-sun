It gives people tips about the way forward and how people can survive the consequences of 2020.” He said the book has different topics that can help people restore their credit worthiness. “People are forced to use the internet for money matters and can be exposed to fraud and phishing scams. It will help people not to become fraud victims.” “It helps people on how they can improve the value of their properties and helps with financial planning and budgeting.” Siboniso’s first book, Automotive Excellence, was published in 2016. “It’s about business management and it’s a simple equation to make people stay safe in their financial matters,” he said.
