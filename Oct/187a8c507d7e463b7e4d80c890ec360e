A POLICEMAN arrested for corruption and demanding a bribe from a suspect allegedly dealing in drugs has been denied bail. Warrant Officer Tlabo Mapotla (52) appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court today in connection with a charge of corruption and extortion of R6 000. He will remain in police cells until next Tuesday when he appears for a formal bail application. NPA spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the suspect is a detective warrant officer at Westernburg police station. “It is alleged that he extorted money from the suspect whom police had arrested on drug dealing charges in 2018. He demanded money in order to destroy the docket,” she said. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said the policeman was arrested in Polokwane immediately after receiving a R6 000 gratification from the victim. “The suspect was also found in possession of more than R27 000 in cash. The victim reportedly gave the suspect R6 000 in the past but the police detective kept on demanding more until the matter was reported to the Hawks,” Matimba added.
