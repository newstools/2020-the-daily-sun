Transformers always blow up in kasis such as Soweto, Diepsloot, Alexandra and parts of Tshwane, leaving people in the dark. This is really boring. Citizens are forever being given excuses when they complain about not having electricity. Meanwhile, they’re forced to throw away rotten food because of not having electricity. Thugs rob people under the cover of darkness, and businesses are put on hold. I’m also worried about those who keep medicine in fridges. How does Eskom expect people to live without electricity for months? The power utility has failed many people and always shifts the blame to izinyoka. It should prioritise fixing damaged transformers, so people can start living normal lives again. Or, could it be that the company doesn’t have money to repair damaged transformers? - Letter by Norman Maake, Tembisa
