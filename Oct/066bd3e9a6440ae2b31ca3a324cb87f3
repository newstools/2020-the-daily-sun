A PASTOR’s son, who also is the brother of a Mpumalanga cop, together with three other suspects aged 25–34 were bust on the N4 in Malelane, Mpumalanga in possession of stolen booze, illegal firearms and ammunition yesterday. The pastor’s son from Cottondale, outside Acornhoek, works at Sassa in Bushbuckridge. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the four were bust with firearms and devices believed to be explosives on the N4 yesterday.  “The four are suspected to have been involved in a business burglary carried out earlier, where cash and other items were stolen. The arrest came after police were busy with a routine patrol on the N4, when they noticed a blue VW Golf and instructed its driver to stop. “One occupant got out and disappeared into a nearby bush, and that made police search the vehicle and discover liquor, packets of cigarettes as well as cash stashed inside. Police also found devices, three firearms and ammunition, where they immediately arrested the suspects.” Hlathi said preliminary investigation revealed that after midnight yesterday, there was a business burglary at a bottle store in Mjejane near Malelane, where booze, cigarettes and other items were stolen. Police learnt a safe was detonated with explosives and money was taken.  “The four suspects are expected to appear before Tonga Magistrates Court on Monday for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. They also face additional charges of possession of suspected stolen property and possible charges regarding the burglary at the bottle store might be added.” Meanwhile, cops are also looking for the suspects who broke into Twala Bottle Store in Rolle outside Thulamahashe and stole booze worth R400 000 on Wednesday night.
