Zakhele Lepasa and Vincent Pule scored the two goals wich ensured that Pitrates goes to the second leg next weekend leading by tw goals to nil.  In the second half of the match both sidesÂ  failed to create any clear-cut chances in the early stages of the second period with the two teams cancelling each other out. Gavin Hunt tried to affect the match by making an early double-change in the 59th minute with Bernard Parker replacing Lebogang Manyama and Happy Mashiane in for Nkosingiphile Ngcobo. Pule doubled Pirates' lead in the 66th minute after taking a neat touch inside the area before twisting and hitting a low shot past a despairing Daniel Akpeyi.
