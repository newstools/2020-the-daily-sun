MEMBERS of the Truckers Association of South Africa (TASA) took to the streets of Tshwane. They marched from Marabastaad to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula’s office to hand over a memorandum on issues they wanted fixed in the trucking industry. Some held placards with the words: “Bra Fiks, fix our transport industry.” Members, who had came from across Mzansi, said they were tired of being side-lined in the trucking and logistics industry. They claimed most big trucking companies exploited them by using small companies to gain funding from government. TASA president Mary Phadi called for government to review certain issues regarding travel permits. Phadi said emerging truckers were excluded from participating meaningfully in the sector. “We want the department to regulate the industry so that it can be transformed,” she said. Phadi said also smaller truck operators were being bullied by established operators. The marchers believe their industry would be properly monitored if they were given permits, just like the taxi industry. One of the truck drivers from Mpumalanga said their province was known to have more mineral resources, but only few people benefitted. He said they struggled to get through the industry as big companies created red tape for them. “Government needs to come in and fix this mess. It’s difficult for us to get through provinces because there are no permits,” he said. Roads and transport deputy director-general, Chris Hlabisa, accepted the memorandum on behalf of the department. He told the marchers he’d make sure it got the necessary attention it deserved. Marchers vowed their protest won’t be as peaceful as it was yesterday, if their demands were not met.
