N a moving ceremony, gogo Martha Marais, was laid to rest at Eersterust cemetery in Tshwane on Saturday. She passed away last Saturday at the Eersterust Association and Community Health centre (EACH) in Eersterust, east of Tshwane. Gogo Martha passed away after her children and grandchildren had visited her and celebrating her son Vernon's birthday. IN 2019 gogo Martha Marais made news when she was handcuffed and tied to a steel bench in Mamelodi Day Hospital. NGOs that spoke out against her I'll treatment by health officials including the South African Human Rights Commission's Buang Jones attended her funeral. Speaker after speaker condemned the I'll treatment of elderly patients by health officials. The funeral service started at her home, then proceeded to the Anglican church before going to Eersterust cemetery where she was buried. Videos and pictures of her abuse at the hands of health officials in Mamelodi Hospital angered many people. In the video that went viral on social media networks, the gogo's daughter, Staphanie Marais, was seen begging staff to let her mother loose in vain. Gogo Martha Marais, of Eersterust east of Tshwane was apparently referred to Mamelodi Day Hospital from Eersterust clinic at the time. The gogo's niece, Virginia Kepler, said her aunt lived a full life. "She was 77-years-old and had spent her last days with family. Her last days on earth filled with happiness although she was frail and her health was deteriorating," she said. She thanked the Human Rights Commission for standing by her aunt. "Buang Jones worked very hard to bring back auntie Martha's dignity back after the humiliating experience she had at Mamelodi Hospital, he and MEC Bandile Masuku were very supportive to the family and auntie Martha," she said. Gogo Martha leaves behind her four children, 9 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
