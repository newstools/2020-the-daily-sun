MUNGENA High School matric pupil Tlangelani Maluleke (18) was crowned Miss Bushbuckridge High School in Hluvukani, Mpumalanga, on Sunday. It was the first time the pageant was being held. It took place at the Latter Rain Christian Church in Zion. An excited Tlangelani told Daily Sun: “I didn’t waste time. I entered with my previous experience of winning Miss Lewis Queen in 2017 and Miss Hluvukani last year. This encouraged me to push the boundaries. “After completing high school, I plan to study radiography because of my grandparents’ encouragement. “They’d always send me to fetch stacks of medicine in the morning, afternoon and evening, but are never healed. “I took an oath to study medicine that deals with bones, what they always complained about.” Tlangelani said she wants to change the world. “I want to make people healthy. A sick body is a sick mind,” she said. “I put everything in God’s hands and he decides, but the sky is the limit. Next, I’m going to go for Miss Mpumalanga,” Organiser Dumisani Mathebula said the pageant promotes education. “Girls and boys are faced with many challenges and distractions,” he said. “We’re equipping them with leadership skills, public speaking and etiquette, and grooming them to become responsible adults.”
