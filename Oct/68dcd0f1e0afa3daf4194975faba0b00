Actress Latoya Makhene and her partner businesswoman Lebohang Keswa have engaged. The romantic engagement happened on Saturday morning. Late in the evening, friends and families of the two love birds gathered at Houghton hotel to celebrate with them. It was a night to remember. Latoya told the guests that she was madly in love with Lebo. “She is everything I need,” she said. She said it’s been 8 months since they’ve been together and their love was growing stronger by day. “We won’t say we don’t have our ups and downs because that’s what every relationship has but what I like is that our love conquers all.” “When we started with this relationship, we got a lot of critism but we’ve learned to live with them.” She said she got her father’s blessings and that’s all that mattered to her. “Lebo makes me happy. She has taught me to see value in my life. I’ve been through a lot in the past and that broke me but being with her has made me whole again.” Lebo said Latoya was everything she has ever dream off. “I love you,” she told her. Latoya narrated to the guests a bit of how her engagement happened. She said she was taken, in the morning, to the hot air balloon. “We flew up to the sky and when we were landing, there was a writing on the ground. While I was still surprised, Lebo was already on one knee asking for my hand in marriage.” “I said yes,” she waived her ring. She said it was the best moment of her life which she will never ever forget. Glimpse of the celebration through pictures and video.
