DEPUTY Minister of State Security, Zizi Kodwa, has warned gangs that are demanding money from Khayelitsha residents in the name of “protection fees” to stop what they are doing. Kodwa said if the thugs don’t stop, “it will not end well” for them. Kodwa was part of a prayer meeting against the gangs held at Khayelitsha stadium this afternoon. “Let me warn these thugs that what they are doing is going to end and will not end well. For now, we are giving them a chance to stop this because we are saying make right your ways. These are our children who are doing this. I’m saying parents speak to your children,” said Kodwa.  The Khayelitsha Development Forum (KDF) chairperson, Ndithini Tyhido, said for years, gangs in Khayelitsha have been extorting spaza shop owners of protection money but recently the gangs have turned against residents. “They give each other money with Somali spaza owners and we kept quiet not because we liked it, but now they enter into our homes. As Khayelitsha we must reject this. We cannot allow this extortion to go on. We must reject this issue of women selling inyama on the streets to be asked to pay thugs,” said Tyhido. The KDF leader urged people to unite and stop divisions along political or religious lines, but to come together and fight the thugs. South African Civic National Organisation national executive member, Nomfundo Moshani, said the army must be brought to Khayelitsha. “We want the army to come to our kasi and deal with these gangs. We need the army here because people are dying. We have had enough as Khayelitsha residents. This has to come to an end,” said Moshani.
