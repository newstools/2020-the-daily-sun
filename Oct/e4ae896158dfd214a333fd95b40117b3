WHAT do Barry White, Will Downing and Kwesta have in common? Besides all three being talented musicians, they all have
some of the deepest voices in music. Many women are drawn to their music because of how deep
their voices sound on a record, and according to science. There is a deep and sexy explanation to why women are drawn
to a man’s voice. Scientists have said women like lower-pitched voices because
of human evolutionary history. Men who have lower-pitched voices have higher testosterone,
they’re more likely to be healthy, dominant and attain a high social status. Sadly though, according to a McMaster University study,
women are drawn to men with deep voices but only for short flings. This is
because these male suitors also come off as cheaters. Author and expert Dr. Jillian O’Connor explains the
importance of a man’s voice to attracting women. “Voice pitch is a clue as to how good a mate a man is in
terms of genetic quality. Lower-pitched voices are going to have what we call
good genes, and that’s what women are picking up on. “They may not know this consciously but they know it
subconsciously. They demonstrate it by being attracted to these men.” So, the question is: Is your voice deep enough to grab her attention?
