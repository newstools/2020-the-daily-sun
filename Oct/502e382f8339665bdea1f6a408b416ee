THE programme to decongest squatter camps continues. This is according to City of Joburg housing MMC Mlungisi Mabaso, who told Daily Sun  they couldn’t neglect the programme because the virus was still part of daily life in Mzansi and across the world. “Lockdown has eased up, but this doesn’t mean we won’t go back to level 5,” said Mabaso. “We have to continue moving people to temporary housing to avoid having many people crammed in one shack.” He said although his department has been criticised for evicting people in Fleurhof, lawlessness can’t be tolerated. “We understand the frustration of people who don’t have places to stay,” said Mabaso. “But we can’t allow people to think they’re above the law.” He said those that have moved in during lockdown were evicted. “Such incidents make the housing backlog worse because you find that some of these people didn’t even apply for houses but are fighting about it,” he said. “Those with proper allocation letters are inconvenienced by those who break the law.” Mabaso said they’d heard the plea of people wanting to be given land, so they could build for themselves. “We’ve taken this into consideration and will be implementing it soon, but no one will be allowed to erect shacks,” he said. “Only brick structures will be permitted in order to minimise the spread of squatter camps.” Mabaso said the department was working tirelessly to serve the people and change their lives despite the huge backlog they carry with them.
