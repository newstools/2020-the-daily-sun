MEET Fortune Mthethwa from Vosloorus, whose biking experience is almost as old as our democracy. Many bikers can learn a lot about responsible and safe riding. “My inspiration to start biking comes from my family, we are a family of bikers and by 1996 I started biking and I am still going strong,” he said. Q: Over many years of biking, what has kept you safe? A: Nothing beats following or obeying the rules and regulations of the road. That coupled with respect for other road users. Q: What do you want motorists to know about bikers? A: I want motorists to respect bikers as we are also road users. Checking their mirrors before changing lanes and to always think about bikers may go a long way in saving our lives on the roads. Q: Why is riding gear so important? A: Protective gear is very important as it keeps you safe in case you fall, as well as protecting you from stone chips while ridding. Q: Why is riding in a club better than riding alone? A: Riding in a club is better than riding alone because whenever you have any problem, you get assistance from other riders and in case you have been involved in an accident and you are unconscious, you can quickly be identified by the colours you are wearing. Q: What club do u belong to? A: The name of my club is Chain and Shaft Inc. and we attend rallies and sometimes do charities when the need arises. Q: Any out of the country riding tours yet? A: Yes, the furthest I have taken my bike is Swaziland and it was awesome. - If you want to show off your wheels in SunWheels, send an email to our petrolheads, Njabulo Ngcobo or Peter Matsebula: njabulo.ngcobo@dailysun.co.za or Peter.Matsebula@media24.com
