THE Satmas celebrated their 15th anniversary at the weekend. Founder Dumisani Goba took the opportunity to announce that this year would be his last with the awards. Speaking at the celebration held at Ingwenyama Lodge in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, he said: “Great ideas like these get killed by founders like myself. “I made the decision a long time ago that when we hit 15 years, I would take a break. I need young guys to run the project. I’m stepping down but I’m not selling the project.” Dumisani said the project would continue and only grow bigger.

Dumisani said he would be focusing on completing a PhD. Speaking about how the awards started, he said he came up with the idea after seeing the unity of Americans during his visit to the US in 2002. “I thought of something that would unite South Africans, regardless of race or tribe. I said to myself that traditional music would be the perfect tool to unite South Africans because each and every tribe has its own indigenous music,” he said. Dumisani said when he first came up with the idea, he shared it with the late Joseph Shabalala, the founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. “He said it was a good idea because our music isn’t appreciated,” he said. During the celebration, guests were entertained by Yoki Yoki singer Vhudie, Blaq Diamond and Nothembi Mkhwebane. The awards ceremony will take place in Mpumalanga in December.
