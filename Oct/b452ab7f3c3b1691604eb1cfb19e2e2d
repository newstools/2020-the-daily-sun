NEW signing AmaZulu signing Xola Mlambo is baffled at why he didn't see much game time at Orlando Pirates last season. Mlambo has since hit out at the coaches of Pirates that they didn’t see the rare breed of his talent and compared himself as a rare car like a Lamborghini that you hardly see on the streets because it is expensive. Mlambo, who was supposed to be unveiled by Usuthu last week along with ten others but had a family bereavement that he had to attend to, was finally unveiled by Usuthu president Sandile Zungu at the press conference at Hilton Hotel in Durban on Monday.  “Coaches have their own opinions,” said Mlambo on why he was didn’t play much at Pirates. “They have their own decisions to take. But if I can make an example of Lamborghini, you will never see it more often on the street. “And not a lot of people will have it. But it doesn’t lose its value and its depreciation.” The 29-year-old, who has signed a four year deal with the ambitious Usuthu, added: “In simple terms, not being seen (playing more often last season) doesn’t mean I have lost quality, it doesn’t mean I’m a different person. “I’m still the same Xola that people were talking about in the past. I’m still the same Xola that was winning accolades and I can still be the better Xola with the new family that I have now.” Mlambo, who has won three major trophies in his PSL career which all came at now-defunct Bidvest Wits, didn’t stop there to express himself. When asked if his fitness is in top shape and will he be ready to face TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium on Wednesday? He said: “I was born ready,” the former Chippa United midfielder said.
