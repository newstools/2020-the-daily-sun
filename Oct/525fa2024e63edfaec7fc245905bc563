A TAXI patroller allegedly shot a motorist dead after an argument. Gauteng SAPS spokesman captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun police have arrested a 40-year old suspect following the fatal shooting of a 35-year-old motorist this afternoon at the corner of Birch and Zesfontein Road in Crystal Park. Masondo said preliminary evidence suggests that the suspect, a taxi patroller, got into a physical altercation with the deceased after accusing the latter of illegally operating as a taxi driver. “It is alleged that the suspect drew his firearm and fired shots at the deceased who was then certified dead on the scene,” said Masondo. Police can confirm that the firearm in question is licenced to the suspect. “The suspect is expected to appear before the Benoni Magistrates Court on Monday, 26 October 2020 on a charge of murder,” said Masondo.
