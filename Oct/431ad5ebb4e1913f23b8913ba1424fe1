The single celebrates African women and tackles another pandemic facing Mzansi. “Gender-based violence is a problem that needs urgent attention. “The lyrics state that as men we appreciate women and are grateful to have them. “We equally find pride and joy with them.” Teddy Cash, born and raised in Taung in North West, said it took him and his producer four months to complete Mi Namba 1. “We started with the beat, which is produced by BrianBeatz. “Once lockdown levels were relaxed to level 2, we got into studio to record at TruHitz Studios. “The single was mastered and mixed by Zephbeatz.” He told SunBuzz he’d like to work with L.A.X because he’s talented, humble and doing good music. “You can pre-order Mi Namba 1 on all online platforms. It will be available for purchase from 20 October,’’ said Teddy Cash. “I’m signed under Gaolebale Entertainment. “I’m ready to take over the world with my unique sound, which is inspired by some of the country’s leading artists from my home province: HHP, Kuli Chana, Morafe and award- winning hip hop sensation Cassper Nyovest.”
