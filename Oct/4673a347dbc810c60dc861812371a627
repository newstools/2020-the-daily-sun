AFTER parting ways with TS Galaxy, Mabhuti Khenyeza has returned to Golden Arrows to take the assistant coach role. Khenyeza will work under head coach Mandla Ncikazi at Arrows, following Steve Komphela's move to Mamelodi Sundowns. Khenyeza was Galaxy's head coach for nearly a year before being demoted to MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach when Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi bought Highlands Park's PSL status. "An opportunity emerged for coach Mabhuti and when he and I looked at it, we thought, you know what as opposed to waiting for the MDC to start or even an announcement for the MDC to start, he'd be better off if he would take an opportunity of going and assist at Golden Arrows," Sukazi told the TS Galaxy media team. "I mean it's a PSL club after all. So, unless if the MDC was active, it wouldn't have been a problem. "So, when we looked at it, we thought we don't even know the exact date as to when the MDC would start." So, rather he, be involved at the highest level which are plenty of opportunities and when he and I looked at it, we thought it's the best under the circumstances."
