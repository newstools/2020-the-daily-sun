EASTERN Cape Premier Lubabalo Mabuyane is set to take legal action against the social media users who have been spreading information that his wife is a director of many companies at Amatola Water. The premier’s spokesman Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha said: “It has come to Premier Mabuyane’s attention that there is a document being circulated on social media platforms and via WhatsApp chat groups making false and malicious claims about his wife, Siyasanga Mabuyane. “The document is labelled as a report on ‘conflict of interest and nepotism between Amatola Water officials and/or relatives of officials and/or business associates and suppliers at Amatola Water.’ “The author(s) of this document falsely claim that Mrs Mabuyane is a director of companies that ‘have been appointed by Amatola Water through Burncon Group to cart water.’ “The statement made in this document is a lie, false information peddled with malicious intent aimed at damaging Mabuyane’s good reputation and by inference, that of her husband,” said Sicwetsha. “Mrs Mabuyane is a director of only one company. She is not a director of companies that got contracts from Amatola Water. The premier and his wife will take legal action against the author(s) of this document to put an end to these false and malicious claims,” he said.
