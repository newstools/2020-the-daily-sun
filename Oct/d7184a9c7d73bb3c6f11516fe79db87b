The tournament is set to take place in Port Elizabeth from the 3-14 November. The hosts and defending champions South Africa have won this tournament a record six times and are gunning for their seventh title and fourth in a row. Ellis had a one week to prepare and select her charges that will participate in this years tournament. She selected a squad of 20 young players where she blended experienced players with young blood. Banyana are in Group A alongside Eswatini, Comoros and Angola. “The COSAFA Cup is for local players and it is always great to give new players a chance to prove themselves," Ellis said. "I have been impressed with the work that the current crop of players have put in and the pre-tournament week will be an important one for us to polish up before the tournament starts." The team flew to Port Elizabeth on Tuesday afternoon and will begin with their pre-tournament camp that will run from 28 October to 2 November 2020.
