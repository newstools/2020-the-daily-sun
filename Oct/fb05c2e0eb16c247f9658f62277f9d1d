UKUTHWALA can be extremely dangerous and the Mamlambo snake is very sexually active. This is the warning from Tumi Motsoeneng, known as gobela Sikhotheni. She told Daily Sun that although ukuthwala was known to bring wealth, there was a huge price to pay. She said when a client wanted ukuthwala, sangomas use a snake known as Mamlambo or a zombie. And they both demand yearly sacrifices by slaughtering as well as to have sex with their partners. She said those who have undergone ukuthwala were able to drain the blessings meant for the people close to them, and took it for themselves. Sikhotheni said not all sangomas were telling their clients the truth about ukuthwala and after a while, they were confronted by horrifying demands.  Failure to do this, said Sikhotheni, may result in either extreme poverty or even death. She said men and women flood ndumbas wanting ukuthwala and they were willing to pay. “People who are interested in ukuthwala are too lazy to use their brains to make money.” Sikhotheni said she is also gifted to help people with ukuthwala, but she didn’t like it.  “Not all sangomas can do it. But very few turn away customers because of their love of money. After ukuthwala, a client is expected to bring money every month for as long as they live to the sangoma who is taking care of their Mamlambo,” she said. The gobela said people who went through ukuthwala succeed in business and entertainment, and some of them are prophets, pastors even sangomas. “It has become common for people to go into relationships for material things. They have no idea where the money comes from and they pay a painful price,” said Sikhotheni.
