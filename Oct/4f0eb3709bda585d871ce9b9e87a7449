Once a
taboo and hardly spoken about topic, these days typing anything ‘male’ and ‘spa’
related into your search engine and you’ll be flooded with reports on how male
grooming is on an upward trajectory. Articles point to men being more
progressive about the way they look and how they groom. Terms like
‘man-scaping’, ‘man-kini’ and ‘Bro-tox’ now exist as an attempt to further
entice men into an arena traditionally dominated by women. In fact, there are
now men only spas with barbers, skin therapists and some even tattoo artists,
all dedicated to looking after top to toe male grooming. In South
Africa, where men are sent solo up mountains to find their manhood, rated on
their braai-ing prowess and judged on their knowledge of contact sport – is the
idea of entering a spa acceptable? Themba
Ndlovu, Clere For Men brand manager says we still have a way to go in this
country to convince men that spa-based grooming is an acceptable pastime.
“South African men like to look, feel and smell good, but the idea of entering
a spa, no matter how male focused it is, still doesn’t sit well with the average
guy.” Ndlovu
looks at the latest in male spa-based grooming trends: “As a
brand, we support the trend for South African men to take part in more intense
grooming experiences – it’s an international movement, and one I’m sure we’ll
see more uptake of locally. It’s not just a youthful pastime either – men in
their fifties are just as keen to keep their appearance in tip-top shape as men
in their twenties are,” says Ndlovu.
