COLONEL Jeffrey Seroka of Groblersdal Police Station shop was gunned down in front of his gate at 4am on Saturday. He was about to attend a family funeral in Maganagobuswa Village in Dennilton, Limpopo when the incident happened. He left behind his wife and five children. Family spokesman Segopane Seroka said they were devastated. “My brother’s assailants were there to kill him. “If it was a robbery, they’d have taken his belongings. They took his bakkie, but it was dumped along a local road, with the keys still in the ignition,” said Segopane. “He was shot multiple times and also had stab wounds.” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a manhunt was launched. “The suspects took his Hilux and fled. A manhunt was started and the vehicle was found on the Dennilton-Maklerekeng road.” Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba told cops to ensure the killers were brought to book. Anyone with information should call Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or 08600 10111.
