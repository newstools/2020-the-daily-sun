TEACHING and learning at Joe Slovo Primary School in Port Elizabeth, Esatern Cape, have been disrupted since last Thursday over delays of a fencing project. Dozens of angry parents have been protesting at the school, and pupils and teachers have been blocked from entering the premises. The parents marched, singing: “Angie Motshekga must fence our school now because we are gatvol of waiting.” This protest started in February and the school was shut down for two weeks. The parents say they were promised that a fencing project would resume in May, but it was disrupted by lockdown. Parent Ncedile Soxujwa said: “The fencing was supposed to start in May and we were first on the list of schools to be fenced. Three weeks ago, officials from the Eastern Cape Department of Education were here to do an assessment. “We were left confused and angry because doing an assessment again means we’re still going to wait.” A staff member at the school said: “All our budget goes to repairs. Taps, window panes, electricity and doors have been ripped out by vandals. So far we have spent over R100 000 repairing the damages.” Provincial Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “Joe Slovo is still our priority. Coega Development Corporation has been given instruction to do the fencing. “They have bought the fencing stock and are preparing for the implementation of the fence.”
