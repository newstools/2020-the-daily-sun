 A TEACHER got a kak lesson from an angry pupil. All because she allegedly said a word in her economics class which the grade 12 pupil couldn’t understand. In anger, the pupil (19) found a bucket and filled it with kak scooped up from the school yard. He then went back to the classroom in Khotsong near Bothaville, Free State, and poured the kak all over the teacher. READ: CONCERNS AS ZODWA WABANTU KISSES FANS! A video of the incident went viral on social media, leaving many people fuming. Daily Sun couldn’t get hold of the teacher, but a pupil said the teacher opened a case against the culprit and he was arrested. “We know him to be non-violent. I don’t know what’s going to happen to him, but what he did isn’t cool,” said the pupil. Another pupil (15) said: “I think we’re misusing our rights because what happened to the teacher violated her rights. “He knew he’d have called the police if the teacher retaliated.  “I won’t mind if corporal punishment comes back. How would he feel if the teacher was his mum?” Free State education spokesman Howard Ndaba told Daily Sun: “We condemn the incident in the strongest terms. We’ve suspended the pupil for five days. “He’ll appear before the school’s disciplinary committee on Friday.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the teacher asked grade 12 pupils, who weren’t in uniform, if they were going home early.

But one of the pupils started an argument with the teacher and the matter was resolved on Monday,” said Makhele. “On Tuesday, the same teacher was in class when the pupil poured sewage over her.” He said another teacher tried to reprimand the pupil, but he threatened him. “The two teachers opened a case of assault. The pupil was arrested and appeared in the Bothaville Magistrates Court yesterday, where he was granted R500 bail,” he said.
