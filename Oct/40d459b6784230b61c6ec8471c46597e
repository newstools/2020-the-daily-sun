EFF leader Julius Malema challenged Zondo Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo to face him like a man. Malema was addressing scores of EFF members outside the Randburg Magistrates Court today, where he appeared alongside party MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi for assault. “They say Zondo wants bank statements of Malema. He must give me a date and time, I will make copies for him, for his wife and his child that he has outside. “Zondo, don’t come to me through newspapers. If you are a man, face me straight and ask for my bank details. We are not scared of Zondo, he is not Jesus Christ. He’s a human being like us. If he wants me, he will get me,” he said. Malema also accused Zondo of using the commission for political agendas. “If he wants to use the commission that we established ourselves to further the political agendas of Jamnadas and Cyril Ramaphosa, we will expose him for who he is.” The ANC and its leadership were also in the firing line. Malema said they would follow each other to prison. He said the Hawks should start with Ramaphosa. “He’s a thief. He stole money and he’s refusing to hand over papers of the CR17 campaign.” Yesterday was the second day of Malema and Ndlozi’s assault trial. Lieutenant-Colonel Johannes Venter was on the witness stand. He told the court he denied the vehicle transporting Malema entry into the cemetery as it was not part of the convoy, which consisted of family members, the president, deputy president and current and former heads of state and other guests. Venter said that he didn’t allow the vehicle in as it never had a permit. The case was postponed to 9 March next year.
