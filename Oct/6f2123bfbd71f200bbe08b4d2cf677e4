Thabo Nthethe has parted ways with PSL rookies TS Galaxy. SunSport has reliably learnt that the former Mamelodi Sundowns defender vacated his position as Galaxy's Team Manager last week due to contractual issues. Nthethe has now followed Mabhuti Khenyeza out the exit door. READ: WATCH: TRUCK DRIVER ESCAPES HAIL OF BULLETS! Khenyeza left the Mpumalanga based club to join Golden Arrows technical staff following the departure of coach Steve Komphela to Sundowns. According to an insider, Nthethe was disappointed when Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi offered him the same salary that he was earning while playing in the GladAfrica Championship. Explained the insider: “Thabo was shocked that Sukazi wanted to offer him the salary he was getting in the lower division even though he has a new demanding role as part of technical staff in the top flight. He wanted him to use his own car, pour petrol from his pocket and use his own airtime for doing the club’s duties. He wasn't even given a budget, let alone a laptop to use on a daily basis. There was no way that he could execute the job from his pocket with the paltry salary he was earning and that’s why he decided to leave the club last Wednesday.” However, when contacted, Nthethe refused to divulge reasons that led to his departure. He said: “I have left the club, but I don’t want to talk about TS Galaxy issues in public and instead I would rather talk about my career as a footballer.” ALSO READ: MAGOSHAS LOCKDOWN DISCOUNT At 36, Nthethe believes he still has a lot to offer in the top flight. He went on: “I can still play in the PSL for two more seasons. My legs can still carry me and I am still fit to play for any club that is willing to give me a chance."
