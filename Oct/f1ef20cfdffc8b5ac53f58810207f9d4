“I will not go down alone.” This is what former president Jacob Zuma said four years ago when asked of his possible imprisonment. Surely such an utterance is indicative of someone who didn’t act alone when committing wrong misdemeanours. “All of us have smallanyana skeletons,” is a known quote from former minister of social development, Bathabile Dlamini. She said this in response to an attack from one of her colleagues. These utterances are a true reflection of the ruling party leaders’ modus operandi. The voters should remove these people from power. - Letter from Albert Kiviet, Emdeni South
