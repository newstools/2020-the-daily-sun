THE assault trial of EFF leader Julius Malema and MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi might be far from over, as more people are expected to take the stand after two more witnesses were brought into the Randburg Magistrates Court towards the end of proceedings today. They will testify tomorrow. Lieutenant-Colonel Johannes Venter took the stand today and testified how he was assaulted by Malema and Ndlozi. He said he was pushed hard by the pair while trying to get into the cemetery where mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was being laid to rest. Venter said he stopped the car transporting Malema as it was not part of the presidential convoy. “The vehicle (Malema’s car) could have had accreditation, but it was for stadium access. I didn’t see a permit.” Poking holes in Venter’s testimony, the defence’s Advocate Laurence Hodes asked why there was no medical records or J88 to show the extent of his injuries during the altercation. Venter told the court: “I woke up and my left side was sore. I went to the doctor on Tuesday. He said he doesn’t do the injury on duty cases. “My muscles could have been injured.” He said that he had no visible injuries. Scores of EFF members braved the sun outside court as they awaited their leaders. But their Malema could not address them as he was under oath. “We’ve already pleaded inside. We were advised by our lawyers to say very few things so we don’t get accused of undermining the court. We’ll possibly speak tomorrow inside court,” Malema told supporters. “Once we’ve spoken inside, we will come to speak to you because we have an appointment to meet here. It was arranged by the ANC. We are not cowards. We must never be threatened by apartheid policemen.”
