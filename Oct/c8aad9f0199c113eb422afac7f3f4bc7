THERE’S finally been some positive news for schoolboy Faranani Mabuli since the death of the donkey he rode to school. After Daily Sun published the story of how the 14-year-old had to walk hours daily, a bicycle and R1 200 in cash were donated to him. His aunt, Selina Nemadivhe (44) from Muremelani Village , outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, said many people had been calling to offer help since the story was published two weeks ago. “Faranani is happy with the new bicycle and the new school uniform we’ve bought with the R1 200 donated by a Good Samaritan,” Selinah said. “The bicycle came on Friday and he can’t wait for the new week to start. I’ve been overwhelmed by the support we got from people we don’t even know. I don’t know how to thank them. For the past few years, I’ve not been able to buy such important things for him.” Selina said the donations would boost the boy’s confidence.  Elizabeth Xaba (63) from Orlando West, Soweto, said she was touched by Faranani’s story. “Five years ago, I bought a bicycle for my son and he no longer uses it. I called Daily Sun and said I had a bicycle for the boy I’m so happy it has reached him safely,” said Elizabeth. She urged SunLanders not to throw their old things away. Another SunReader, who didn’t want to be named, donated the R1 200. “I was touched by his story and felt I needed to help,” she said.
