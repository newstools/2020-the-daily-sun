FANELO Sibuyi’s family is struggling to accept his death after he hanged himself. The 22-year-old from Hluvukani Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga was last seen on Sunday. The family was shocked when his cousin came to ask them about his whereabouts yesterday afternoon. But they didn’t know he was already dead, hanging from his back room with loud music playing. His shocked cousin Ponani Makhubele told Daily Sun they both were in grade 11 and he become worried when he didn’t see Fanelo at school since Monday. “On Tuesday I tried to send him a message but he didn’t respond and went to his home where he lives with his aunt and they didn’t know his whereabouts. They told me to go and knock at his door because he was playing loud music and they suspected he might be studying. “When I knocked, he didn’t respond and I tried to look through his window and saw the keys were still in the lock. We tried to open the window when we found him hanging with a rope from the roof. We don’t know why he decided to kill himself and he left us with many questions. As a family we believed if he was having a problem, he should have told us rather than take his life,” said Ponani. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police are investigating a case of inquest.
