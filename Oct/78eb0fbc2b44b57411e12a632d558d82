JUSTIN Shoga has revealed that he was seemingly forced to join Tshakuma FC by circumstances, but against his will. He says his plan was to move to Europe, but his club Orlando Pirates already had plans about his future. Even though he's put up a disclaimer and blames no one for this, but reading in between the lines, Shonga is not happy to be in Venda. He will start his stay at Tshakuma FC with a tough encounter against defending MTN8 champions, SuperSport United, on Saturday afternoon at 3pm. According to Shonga, Pirates only released him when the European transfer window had already closed, which shut his slim chance of moving abroad. He told journalists that the maximum time he plans on staying at Tshakuma is six month before he launches a move in Europe, when the next transfer window open.

There is a chance now to get game time. I agree that I still had a lot to offer the club. I'm disappointed because we didn't win trophies "-Justin Shonga on #SAFMSportOn @SAfmRadio
