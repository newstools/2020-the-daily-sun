FORMER Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama lied that he didn’t know former Communications Minister General Sphiwe Nyanda when he awarded his company the R18 million security tender. Yesterday, Christopher Todd, director of law firm Bowman Gilfillan told the Zondo Commission this led to Gama being charged with misconduct in 2009 and being fired. Todd said 11 contractors put in bids for the tender and four were shortlisted. He said Nyanda’s company, GNS, was not among the bidders. Todd said Gama cancelled the tender process without giving any reasons. “At the same time, GNS made an unsolicited pitch. There were documents from computers of Transnet officials managing this process, showing they were helping General Nyanda to draft their submissions to Transnet around September or October,” he said. “It was rapidly approved by the Freight Rail security division. That meant a single source procurement on the grounds that it was urgent.” He said Gama claimed he had no personal relations with Nyanda. “Transnet presented telephone conversations with Nyanda weeks before the contract was signed. Gama admitted he gave incorrect instructions to his lawyer. He misled the disciplinary hearing.” Todd said it was found GNS had no record of rendering that kind of service and wasn’t registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, and only applied in June the next year. “More importantly, it had no employees.” He said he advised Transnet there was proper basis to institute disciplinary proceedings against Gama, who approached the high court that September, trying to stop the disciplinary proceedings, complaining a cabal at Transnet wanted him out. Todd said another charge brought against Gama was he defied board instructions and awarded an R800 million contract for refurbishing locomotives to an international manufacturer in which he and his wife had an interest, despite the board’s instruction for the work to be done by Transnet rail engineering. “It was a fraud process.”
