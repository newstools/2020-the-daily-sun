A FATHER who apparently had marital problems burnt himself and his two kids to death on Monday. The dad (51) and his daughters, aged Mikateko12 and Tsakane nine, died inside their home in Nkowankowa, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. He apparently poured petrol all over the house and set it alight. The man was living with the kids because his wife had apparently left him. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said neighbours jumped over the fence when they realised the house was on fire. “The neighbours broke one of the windows to gain entry into the house,” said Mojapelo.  “In the process they managed to rescue the man, who’d already died from smoke inhalation.” They were prevented from saving the kids by the raging fire and thick smoke. Said Mojapelo: “Preliminary police investigations revealed the man and his wife were separated and his daughters stayed with him.” Both kids were pupils at Meridian College in Nkowankowa. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the incident and advised residents with domestic problems to seek professional help instead of resorting to violence. Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale said: “Incidents of gender-based violence are happening at an alarming rate in the province. We call upon people to contact social workers when they experience difficulties in relationships and families.”
