KHAYELITSHA residents in Cape Town are still shocked after a taxi driver was shot and killed by two men who were inside the taxi. Nontuthuzelo Valelo (39) said she was visiting her friend when she heard gunshots. “It never crossed my mind that the person who was being shot at is a taxi driver,” said Nontuthuzelo. Another resident said he thought someone was being robbed. “It is common for criminals to shoot at people they are robbing but I was shocked to see that it was a taxi driver being shot by people who were inside the taxi,” said the resident. He said some people said the taxi was coming from the SST section heading to Harare and there were two men and two women in the taxi. “It is clear they wanted him dead because they told him to stop the taxi before shooting. It is clear that the people who gave that information were the other two that were in the same taxi,” said the resident. Captain FC van Wyk said circumstances surrounding the shooting incident yesterday at about noon near Kuyasa clinic where a 35-year old was shot and fatally wounded are under investigation. “According to reports the deceased was driving from SST section in Town 2 to Harare with four passengers in the taxi (two women and two men),” said Van Wyk. He said while approaching Kuyasa Clinic two men asked him to stop. While stopping the taxi they both fired several shots at the driver and fatally wounded him. “A murder case was registered for investigation,” said Van Wyk. Anyone with any information about the shooting incident is kindly requested to contact Captain T. Sidiya on 021 363 9004 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
