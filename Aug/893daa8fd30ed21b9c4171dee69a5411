CAPE Umoya boss Roger de Sa has put his money behind Lucas “Rhoo” Radebe to replace Danny Jordaan as South African Football Association (Safa) president. Radebe was ineligible to run for the top job in 2018 as he didn’t meet the requirement. The electoral code states that the candidate needs to have served in the Safa structures for a period of five years in the lead up to the election and the former Bafana Bafana captain only served in the technical committee. In a Zoom meeting with the South African Football Journalists Association (SAFJA) De Sa said Safa needs someone with great influence locally and abroad like the former Leeds United and Kaizer Chiefs captain. Said De Sa: “We need people that can speak like Lucas with a lot of experience to head the federation. He also made his name in Europe, but does he want it (the job)? I doubt it. He will be a great leader in football. He would probably need to have a good team around him.” De Sa, whose side campaigns in the GladAfrica Championship says there are a lot of former professional players with a great business acumen to lead football in the country to greater heights. He went on: “It’s nice to see ex professionals lead the game.  Graeme Smith (Director of Cricket at Cricket SA)  is now doing it in Cricket, so we need others (former players) to lead football.”
