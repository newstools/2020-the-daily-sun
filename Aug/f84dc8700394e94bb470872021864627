RESIDENTS are warned not to try and kill snakes found in their homes, but to rather call authorities to remove them. This came after the Bushbuckridge Local Municipality fire and rescue worker, Cockroach Mdluli, caught a 2.6 Black Mamba which was found at a family’s garage in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Friday morning. He told Daily Sun that a family noticed the snake while they were trying to move the car from the garage, but it quickly fled. “When we arrived we searched for it and found it hiding under the table. But after we noticed that is was a mamba, we tried to cool it down before catching it,” he said. “We found that the snake was 2.6 longer and dangerous. It could kill anything, so we want to warn residents that they shouldn’t try to kill snakes because if they can miss, it can fight back, especially the Black Mamba. “So residents living near the rivers should be on the lookout for such mambas and pythons. “For the past years in the same location, we have managed to rescue many snakes and this time of the season, snakes flee from bushes to search for rats and too meet each other for penetrations.” Cockroach said the snake will be taken to Kruger National Park and people who see snakes in their houses should call the municipality’s fire and rescue on 060 506 4020, or 079 887 9814. The 36-year-old house owner said he was shocked because it was the first time he’d seen a Black Mamba. “I’m pleased that it has been removed.”
