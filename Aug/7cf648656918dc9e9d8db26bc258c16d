BOOZERS and smokers said yesterday was a beautiful day. It was business as usual again at Makhanana Tavern in Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane. Manager Donald Zabane couldn’t believe his eyes when he opened the door. “We thank government for opening alcohol trade again,” he said. “We almost lost hope alcohol would be sold again this year.” Amos Msiza (63) from nearby Pienaarspoort made sure to arrive early to avoid a long queue. “I depend on selling alcohol and the removal of the ban wiped away our tears,” he said. Mike Sabela, a tavern worker, said the day would be busy. Zuluboy Matiki, another worker, said: “Climbing on the ladder for customers makes me happy.” Meanwhile, Moffat “Moftouch” Mokobodi from Soffel Park in Mamelodi East was happy to be smoking without fearing cops. Never Sibanda was disappointed. He couldn’t find his favourite beer brands and had to push his wheelbarrow all over the place. Meanwhile, SAB vice-president for corporate affairs Zoleka Lisa was confident tavern owners would follow lockdown rules. Speaking to Daily Sun in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni, she was there to check tavern’s state of readiness. “Our clients were hit hard and we want to make sure they know what’s expected.” Kagiso Mojela (30), owner of Mojela’s Place, was happy to be back in business. “We have 11 employees who’ve been at home without a stable income. We’ve been assisting them with food parcels, which weren’t enough.” The Beer Association’s Nicole Mirkin called on people to drink responsibly.
