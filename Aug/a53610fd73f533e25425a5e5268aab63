MORE than 29 women and kids died as a result of gender-based violence in Joburg in July alone. This was according to Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo, who recently unveiled the city’s Women’s Month programme, which seeks to address the scourge of gender-based violence. Makhubo said: “We need to reflect on the contribution women make in society. “They carry a special burden. Many women are unsung heroes. “These are the women we celebrate. We still have a long way to go and it starts with us.” Meanwhile, female Joburg Metro cops on Sunday handed out flowers to female drivers at Kliprivier and Rifle Range roads in Joburg in support of Women’s Month. The officers committed to handing out whistles and safety pamphlets throughout the month. Metro cops director Chief Superintendent Angie Mokasi interacted with female motorists while handing out the flowers. “We’re celebrating Women’s Month. However, we also want to inform ladies they should say no to gender-based violence and we shouldn’t allow ourselves to die at the hands of people we say we love,” she said. The cops also used the roadblock as an opportunity to raise awareness about Covid-19 safety measures. Motorist Thandi Mtshweni (36) told Daily Sun: “I feel special knowing our cops care about us.” Another motorist, Sindi Sithole, said: “We need this kind of initiative throughout the year.”
