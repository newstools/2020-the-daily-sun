Known for his smooth and beautiful rich voice that melts people’s hearts, singer Donald Moatshe has released a new single, Oh Nana, featuring DJ Mvzzle. Speaking to SunBuzz, Donald said: “OhNana speaks about being awestruck with your significant other, leaving you speechless and all you can say is Oh Nana. “This song is a catchy electro dance music track and will also be another memorable love anthem. “It’s a fusion of traditional R&B, deep and Afro-soul.” The Rustenburg-born musician said the song talks about communication in relationships. “The song also talks about lack of communication in relationships and the strain it puts on the growth of the relationship,” he said.

I knew then that he was someone I needed to work with. “We have great chemistry in studio,” he said. Donald plans to release a new album next year. He said that things have been difficult since lockdown started. “I am happy that lockdown restrictions are being eased. As artists, we’ve gone over five months with no income. “That has put a lot of strain on us as musicians. But we’ve tried to stay busy with online solutions and ideas to help keep our brands alive during this time,” he said.
