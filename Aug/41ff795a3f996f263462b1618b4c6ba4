THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) is hoping that Safa will deal with the matter of two spots in the GladAfrica Championship. As the football resumes this weekend, at the end of the season two teams will be relegated from the GladAfrica and they must be replaced by clubs from the ABC Motsepe League which will finish in top two of the provincial play-offs. However, with the country still under lockdown, Safa has said the amateur league will only resume under level 1. On Friday, PSL chairman Irvin Khoza announced that the new season, 2020-21 will start on 9 October. Now it remains uncertain what will happen with the two spots as Motsepe League remains postponed. The mother body of football in Mzansi is under pressure to get their league campaign back as PSL will need two teams (national play-off champions and runners' up) to complete the 16 clubs in GladAfrica. Nine provincial winners of the Motsepe league participate in the national play-offs finals where two teams that reach the final wins automatic promotion to First Division. “From the teams that will join us (next season) from the GladAfrica Championship from Motsepe League, it is not for us to make any pronouncement on what will happen,” said Khoza. Safa, as of yet, has not submitted a document to the minister of sports Nathi Mthethwa if they are planning to get the amateur back on track just like the PSL into a bubble. This season’s bio-bubble in Gauteng will cost all 32 clubs over R100 million in six weeks, according to the chairman. Despite things being dark in the amateur level, Khoza remained confident that Safa will make arrangements as the PSL have done everything in their power to see the games restart. “But I’m sure the are efforts made to make sure that two teams will join us come the next season,” Khoza revealed.
