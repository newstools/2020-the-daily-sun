PHILIPPI residents have barricaded their streets to stop e-hailing drivers from coming to their area. This is because of thugs who are targeting Bolt and Uber drivers in the area, which also puts residents’ lives at risk. Residents said the robberies increased during lockdown when some school kids stopped going to school. They said people who are robbing e-hailing services drivers are mostly teenagers in high school. “We barricaded the roads to ensure that the Bolt and Uber drivers only pick up people on the main road. That way it is safe for them. This is because there are kids who request the drivers to come on our streets and rob them. After hijacking the car, they use it for drag-racing and spinning on our streets, endangering our children’s lives,” said Nandipha Shumi (38). Last month, residents said some of the robbers crashed a car into a concrete cast fencing while they were racing on the streets. “We then told ourselves that enough is enough, hence we put the boulders on the roads to stop e-hailing services to enter our area. We are protecting them and ourselves from these daring robbers,” said another resident. Nyanga cops recently warned drivers to avoid entering Philippi, Nyanga and Crossroads, citing these areas as hotspots. “Incidents of hijackings where Uber and Bolt drivers are victims have been reported at the station and so far, the incidents occurred mostly at night in Crossroads and Browns Farm areas,” said Nyanga police spokeswoman Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi. She said in some instances, robbers use women to lure unsuspecting drivers and pounce on them. “In some cases women are involved because they are the ones who would make a call and when the driver arrives to pick up the client, a different persons would come and hijack and rob the driver, sometimes drive away with him,” said Sitshitshi.
