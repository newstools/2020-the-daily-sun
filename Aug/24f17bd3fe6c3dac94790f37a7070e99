The ANC is letting down its supporters. People who voted for the ANC are frustrated and disgruntled. Corruption is a cancer within the party and President Cyril Ramaphosa is doing nothing against those involved. He talks about launching institutions tasked with dealing with corruption. But this won’t help, considering that law enforcement institutions have failed to deal with it. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha recently cut a ribbon to hand over shacks, which reportedly cost government R2,4 million. And when the public complained about this, he turned around and said he wasn’t aware the homes were built with corrugated zinc. Indeed, something is very fishy here. How on earth can a premier hand over something, only to turn around and say he didn’t know anything about it? The premier must take full responsibility for this mess and resign. If he doesn’t walk, the president must fire him. ) Letter by Sam Magana, from Dennilton
