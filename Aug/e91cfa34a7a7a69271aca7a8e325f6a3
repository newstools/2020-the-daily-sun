  As the coronavirus numbers peak, people gathered for a braai and booze. Shocking images have emerged on social media showing hundreds of people
having what appears to be a party on Sunday. These images were taken from KwaMai Mai in the inner city of Joburg. Cars lined up with loud music playing from the background as a group of
young people are seen having fun while holding different brands of alcohol. Covid-19 regulations were totally disregarded, none of the people
spotted from these circulating images and videos were wearing masks and
physical distancing was not practiced at all. Kwa Mai Mai is happening mos , no social distancing in sight just vibes ???? pic.twitter.com/4yPjQJxiYz  “It is fun in Joburg,” said one young man who took a video during the
gathering as he continued to sip his cider. These images and videos have since caused an outrage on social media
while others questioned the police presence. Social Media users said it was sad that people are still not taking the
deadly virus seriously.
