THE family of Nathaniel Julies (16) said they are confident that justice will be served. Nathaniel’s father, Clint, said Police Minister Bheki Cele has provided them with his personal contact details for any clarity they might seek in finding justice. On Friday, Cele visited Nathaniel’s family in Eldorado Park, South of Joburg. His visit comes after Nathaniel, who had a down syndrome, was allegedly shot and killed by the police on Wednesday evening. His death sparked an outrage in the community. Residents gathered outside Nathaniel’s home chanting, “We want justice”, as Cele arrived. Cele was taken to the scene where the teenager was shot, 100 metres away from his home. Clint said: “We deeply appreciate the minister’s visit. He assured us that justice will be served, and we truly trust that it will be served. He even gave us his personal contact details and said he will make sure that Nathaniel’s death does not go in vain,” said Clint. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has expressed sadness at the death of Nthaniel. He said his thoughts and prayers are with the family and neighbours. Ramaphosa said Nathaniel was deprived of his future.
