MUVHANGO actor Gabriel Temudzani has been married to his two wives for the longest time on the SABC2 soapie. But in real life, Temudzani, who plays Chief Vhafuwi Azwindini, saw his marital life crumble. According to sources close to the situation, the star is running his castle without a queen after his marriage to his wife, Refiloe, disintegrated. The source said Temudzani has pulled the plug on his marriage and dumped his wife of seven years. According to family members, the star has also moved out of his matrimonial home in the north of Jozi. Temudzani told the SunTeam that his separation from his wife is nobody’s business. “So, what is the issue when I am separated from my wife?” he asked. “That’s none of your business. It’s not a story that I’m separated from my wife.” Sources say the couple has been going through marital problems for a long time. “They have tried to fix their marriage, but everything seems to have failed,” said a source. Another source said the two even involved their families, but nothing has worked. “Their families don’t want them to throw in the towel as yet. They want them to sort it out and continue to be a happy family they were before they started having problems,” said the source. According to a family friend, the couple also tried marriage counseling but Temudzani appears to have made up his mind. Refiloe was not available for comment.
