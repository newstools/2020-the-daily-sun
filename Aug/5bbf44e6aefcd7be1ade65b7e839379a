Singer and songwriter Sjava has joined the cast of SABC1's soapie Uzalo. The Umama hitmaker, whose real name is Jabulani Hadebe, will play the role of Jombigazi, who is Nkunzi's right-hand man. Uzalo's publicist Nomfundo Zondi told Daily Sun that Jombigazi is a chilled person who doesn't speak a lot. "Jombigazi is a man of few words who has many dead bodies to his name and is still counting." "He has worked with Nkuzi since he was a kid, and he's very loyal to him." "He loves maskandi music and gqom. He is never without his leather jacket, even on the hottest day," she said.
