ACTOR and singer Marques Houston is officially off the market. The 39-year-old actor married 19-year-old Miya Dickey last Monday. Both the newlyweds took to Instagram to share photos of their wedding day. They both wrote: “The day when the two of us were bonded together before Jehovah to become one. Jehovah has blessed us with true happiness that is unmatched!” The pair got engaged last year after five months of dating, leaving tongues wagging over the age difference. Some people claimed Marques started dating Miya before she was 18, but he rubbished those rumours. “Miya and I didn’t start dating until she was an adult. We fell in love and got engaged in March of 2019. My dad Michael loves her, and the people I am closest to all love her as well. Most importantly, we have Jehovah’s blessing,” Marques said in an Instagram post months back. Marques, who’s now a businessman, has been in the limelight for a while. He started in the 1994 sitcom Sister, Sister alongside Tia and Tamera Mowry. Since then, he’s been on movies such as You Got Served, Will to Love and Fat Albert. He also has albums such as Mattress Music and Naked among many others. My happily ever after. A post shared by  Miya Houston (@iammiyahouston) on Aug 29, 2020 at 3:47pm PDT
