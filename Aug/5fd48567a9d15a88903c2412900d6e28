Redbull’s Shay’imoto spinning champion, Veejaro has advice for this year’s spinners. The spinner, whose real name is Vernon Hendrick, won last year’s competition and says this year’s contestants must stand strong. He said: “This competition is a hard one and people need to stand strong. They mustn’t let anyone break their spirit. Most importantly, they must put God first in their journey and they must pray because it’s a tough competition.” The 35-year old from Nigel in Ekurhuleni said he started spinning when he was still in school. “Every time I came back home from school, I’d take my dad’s car and drive it around without his permission. I realised it could go in circles and then I started spinning it, just for fun and that’s where I fell in love with it. So now every time I took it, I didn’t just drive around, I’d spin it around. When I bought my first car, I perfected my spinning and started spinning professionally.” he said. Veejaro said he has won five spinning competitions so far, but Shay’imoto is the biggest one. “I’ve entered for about ten competitions so far and I’ve won five. And winning this competition was amazing and I will be entering again this year. I was nominated to enter and I accepted the nomination. I’d like to win again, but at the same time, I really want to see other people winning. I feel like other people deserve this victory and to feel the way I felt last year. But I’m preparing for the competition right now,” said Veejaro. The competition will be held next month, but details have not been finalised yet.
