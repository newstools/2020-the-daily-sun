Rapper AKA says he is retiring from hip hop. The F.R.E.E singer took to Twitter to say he's too mainstream for South African music, especially hip hop. "Year after year I compete on the charts against the best that this country has to offer ... DOESN'T MATTER WHAT GENRE. SA Hip Hop I’m sorry, but it’s official ... I RETIRE. I kiss you on your forehead. I’m too mainstream," he wrote. The last time he announced his retirement was before dropping his 2018 album, Touch My Blood. Sheila Afari, who does PR for AK, said he's just quitting hip hop and not music as a whole because he's too mainstream.
