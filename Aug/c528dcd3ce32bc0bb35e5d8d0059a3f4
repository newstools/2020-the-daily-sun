ORLANDO Pirates' woes continue. They Buccaneers can't seem to buy a win in bio-bubble. They were condemned to their first defeat in the bubble as their winless run show no signs of letting up. Cape Town City edged them 1-0 at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Sunday to stretch their winless run to six. Kermit Erasmus scored the only game of the match on the stroke of half time to hand the Citizens maximum points against his former side. The diminutive striker has now scored 12 goals in the league this season and is just two goals shy of equalling Pirates’ Gabadinho Mhango and Highlands’ Peter Shalulie who have 14, respectively. Erasmus’ solitary strike ensured that City bounce back from their 1-0 loss to Stellenbosch FC in the Cape derby midweek. They have now collected nine points from a possible 12 and look set to cement their spot in the top eight despite a poor start to the season. Pirates, on the other hand, have had a tough restart and are yet to win a match since the league resumed. Bucs are yet taste victory since the restart, playing to three consecutive draws prior to the defeat to the Citizens. Pirates were handed a boost by the return of their star man Thembinkosi Lorch, however, last season’s player of the season could not inspire his side to victory. Mhango, who started off the bench, was also unable to effect the match as his dry spell in front of goal of late continued. City, who were reduced to ten men after former Pirates midfielder Mpho Makola was given his marching orders, had to dig deep for the win. But they were able to hold on to their slender lead and now look forward to a clash against Golden Arrows at Ellis Park on Saturday (6pm). Pirates will look to bounce back against SuperSport at the same venue (1.30pm).
