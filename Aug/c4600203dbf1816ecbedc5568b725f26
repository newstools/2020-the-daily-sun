THERE is confusion inside the Bloemfontein Celtic camp. There are rumours that Phunya Sele Sele players allegedly threatened not to honour their Absa Premiership fixture against SuperSport United at the Bidvest Stadium on Sunday (6pm). The bone of contention is the injury suffered by defender Teboho Khasipe who broke his ankle at training in the bio-bubble in Gauteng last Wednesday. A SunSport source claims that Khasipe has been not attended to and had not been taken to hospital. Explain the Source:  “Khasipe has not been attended to in camp after he broke his ankle and on Saturday the players didn’t go for breakfast and they didn’t go to training.” But Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco has denied the allegations of a “revolt”  and said the news that the players have downed tools because of Khasipe’s injury are rubbish. He revealed that Khasipe indeed broke his ankle last Wednesday at training and the player has seen the doctor. “Yes, Khasipe broke his ankle and he immediately went to hospital where his ankle was examined,” said Konco. “The club then booked an operation and was done on Saturday. And whoever gave you the information that the players are angry that their fellow player has not been looked after, I don’t know what he wants. All our players are insured, including our officials.” The 24-year-old is expected to be out for six to seven months.
