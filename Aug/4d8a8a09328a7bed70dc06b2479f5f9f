TONIA Tshabalala is used to hearing couples fighting in the middle of the night, but never expected to hear a baby’s cries. The 47-year-old from Lethabong squatter camp, near Mamelodi east in Tshwane, was asleep in the early hours of Sunday morning when she heard people arguing outside. Moments later she was stunned to hear a baby crying non-stop. “I woke up to check, but I wasn’t prepared to see a baby all alone near my gate. The baby was wrapped in a dirty blanket and wasn’t dressed. “I quickly took her into the house,” Tonia told Daily Sun. The baby had a bump on her head and Tonia was worried she might be hurt. “I rushed to my neighbour to help me take the baby to the clinic. “But we decided to call an ambulance and police instead. “Police asked me to stay with the baby for the night while they waited for social workers to take her and hopefully find her mother.” She said news of the baby spread and they were able to find the mother. The woman was arrested. Asked why she’d abandoned her two-week-old baby, the mum had told them she fought with the baby’s father and wanted him to take the baby, but he refused. “I’m happy she’s in jail. She needs to pay for what she did to the poor baby,” she said. “What kind of mother does such to their own child? What if dogs had mauled the child? “If I had the means to take care of the baby, I’d ask to keep her permanently.” Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a 28-year-old woman was arrested and charged with child neglect. She appeared in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrates Court.
