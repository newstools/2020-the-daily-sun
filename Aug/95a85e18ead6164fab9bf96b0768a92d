Dear MizzB I’m 30 and have umkhaba. My girlfriend is always showing me guys with six packs and muscles and says they’re her type. She’s no longer interested in having sex with me. She says I don’t turn her on, even when I do the things she used to enjoy. What does this mean? Does she still love me? Dear Brother People are different, and not every man will have a six pack and muscles. People use the word “type” to describe the person they’d prefer to date. It’s different strokes for different folks, so someone out there is looking at you as their type. Attending gym and getting yourself in shape should only be a decision you make for yourself and not to please your girlfriend. Allow her to express how she feels and whether she wants the relationship or not.
