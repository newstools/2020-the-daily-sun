The GladAfrica Championship swung back into action on Tuesday with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila the big winners. The PSL bound club beat strugglers Jomo Cosmos 2-1at the Wits Rugby Stadium. The result has sunk Ezenkosi deeper into relegation struggles as they now face an uphill battle save their status. They remain second from bottom with 22 points from 25 matches. For TTM, the result meant their season is getting even better even though they are guaranteed a place in the top flight next season. “It was not an easy game as you know that we come from a long break,” said TTM coach Lucky Nelukau. “But my boys tried their best and I’m happy. Cosmos were not an easy team.” The eagerly anticipated clash between play-off chasing JDR Stars and Uthongathi ended in an underwhelming goalless draw. The two sides could not break each other down with their hopes of earning promotion taking a minor setback. In the other match, Free State Stars could not get past relegation favorites Royal Eagles with the encounter ending in a goalless draw.
