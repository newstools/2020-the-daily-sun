SA Football Association (Safa) acting chief executive officer Tebogo Motlanthe has assured the Premier Soccer League (PSL) that there would be two teams promoted to GladAfrica Championship. The association confirmed that they have submitted a request for the resumption of amateur football under Level 2 to the Government in line with Regulations gazetted on 17 August 2020. Motlanthe said they are now waiting for approval from the Government, they will then be able to release dates on when SAB League and ABC Motsepe League will resume. With the PSL chairman Irvin Khoza announcing that they have tentatively set down 9 October as the date to start the new 2020-21 season. The third-tier league is racing against time to finish their season to meet the start date for the GladAfrica Championship, wherein they must promote two clubs. “I would like to repeat that the association is going to promote two clubs from ABC Motsepe League to GladAfrica Championship,” said Motlanthe. “What we are doing we have now developed the protocol to ensure that we observe all Covid-19 related protocols. We are waiting for the government to give thumbs up.” The Motsepe League national play-offs which will see the nine provincial winners battling for the two spots in the First Division will be held in Gauteng, the date is yet to be confirmed. Motlanthe confirmed: “We can safely confirm to you that the play-offs will be held in Gauteng province. Once the government approves our plans, we can then communicate the actual date.”
