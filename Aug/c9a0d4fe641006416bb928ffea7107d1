SUPERSPORT United will release their most prized assets Aubrey Modiba and Bradley Grobler during the next transfer window period. United CEO Stan Matthews told the SA Football Journalists Association that they will be forced to sell the duo to cover shortfalls due to financial difficulties, as a result of Covid-19. Modiba has caught the attention of city rivals Mamelodi Sundowns, while Orlando Pirates are understood to have shown interest on Grobler’s services. Said Matthews: “Modiba is a player we will look to put on sale within the next window. On Grobler, we will sit down with him and find out how he feels. We are limited in our financial reserves. “From a financial perspective it (the Covid-19) has impacted us. It is what it is. We will be rocked by cash flow moving forward.” Matthews stressed that due to a lack of sponsorship, the next months will be challenging for them financially. “We are impacted by contractual situations. “I’ve got in my club Iqraam Rayners who was meant to join us on a pre-contract from 1 July. He is on our payroll, he is ineligible to play until next season. “I have the expense, but I don’t have the utility of the assets. “The second consequence is players whose contracts were set to end in June but were kept on to end in August, some in September. “These are salaries that were not budgeted for because the season was meant to be over. “The other one is that no fans coming to the stadium, means no gate money. “The next eight or nine months we will have extra expense incurred, a revenue that we haven’t got. “We will have to sell one or two assets to make up for the shortfall.” Matthews said they will now rely heavily on youth produced from their development structures to succeed in the future.
