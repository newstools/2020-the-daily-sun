Dr Dre's wife, Nicole, is challenging the prenup she signed with her soon-to-be ex-husband. According to TMZ, Dre and Nicole signed a prenup when they married in 1996. However, Nicole claims she was forced to sign it. "Nicole says Dre is now worth $1 bil, and says before they tied the knot, 'I was extremely reluctant, resistant and afraid to sign the agreement and felt backed into a corner. Given the extraordinary pressure and intimidation by Andre, I was left with no option but to hire a lawyer (of course, with the help of Andre's team of professionals) and unwillingly signed the agreement very shortly before our marriage,'" read the article. She also said that two years into the marriage, Dre tore copies of the prenup because he was ashamed of the prenup. Also read:Â BLACK COFFEE AND ALEXANDRA CANE SPARK DATING RUMOURS! But, people close to Dre say she's lying and the prenup was never torn. "Sources connected to Dre beg to differ, telling TMZ, he never expressed shame over the prenup and he never tore it up or said it was invalid. Our sources also say Nicole had her own lawyer and she had a clear choice on whether to sign or not," continues the article. The couple announced their divorce last month and Nicole wanted spousal support and now, she wants more.
