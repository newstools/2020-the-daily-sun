FOR the next seven months struggling Gauteng-based female fighters will no longer have to worry about where their next meal will come from. The ring queens will receive monthly groceries as from today. Now the female fighters will be able to focus on getting fit and not have to worry about food. This was announced by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Zingiswa Losi during a women’s month’s celebrations event in Soweto at the weekend. The donation was made by good Samaritan Lesego Modise, who has a long term vision for reviving township economies and empowering women through his Buntu Foods. Meanwhile, the Workers Foundation also donated R10 000 to TLB Boxing Promotions to form a Covid-19 relief fund for female boxers. Cosatu, together with the Gauteng Department of Sports, Arts, Recreation and Culture, donated essential food packages and sanitary pads to female boxers who were hit hard by Covid-19. Positive Women’s Network, represented by Sindi Shangase - in association with LHC Pharma, have also pledged hygiene kits to make the lives of the women boxers safe and comfortable. TLB Boxing Promotions boss Joyce Kungwane said she was excited to see success of her initiative. “I’m very humbled by their support. I got so emotional when I heard of the pledge from Worker’s Foundation because I didn’t know of them until Friday morning. They heeded a call from the Cosatu president to form a Covid-19 relief fund for female boxers.” Mapule Ngubane, who has been out of action for a year, said: “We really appreciate what mama Joyce has done for us. It has been tough for us.” Sharing the same sentiment is former World Boxing Federation (WBF) bantamweight world champion Bukiwe Nonina. “I thank all the donors who heeded the call of supporting ... Other businesses can also follow,” said Nonina.
