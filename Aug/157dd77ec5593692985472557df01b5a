THE office of the Public Protector led by Busisiwe Mkhwebane has been receiving complaints about service delivery issues and the mismanagement of funds during lockdown. Yesterday, Mkhwebane said some of the complaints were related to the distribution of the R350 social relief grant.She said as many as 450 people had approached her office to complain about what they deemed unreasonable grounds for declining their applications. “In most cases, the complainants either allege that they weren’t provided with reasons as to why their applications were unsuccessful, or that the applications were declined on the basis that the applicants were found to be recipients of some form of income or that they qualified for UIF, which they disputed,” she said. Mkhwebane said she planned to meet with Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu with a view to finding a speedy resolution to the complaints. The public protector’s office said it would also look into alleged maladministration and irregularities in the procurement process relating to the R37 million Beitbridge Border Post Fence and the R30 million Gauteng e-Government Information Technology tender. “In Mpumalanga, the office is investigating alleged tender irregularities in the awarding of a quarantine camp tender. “It was alleged that the Zithabiseni facility, which got the contract, is dilapidated. “In KZN, the office is probing allegations of irregularities in the procurement of PPE by the Department of Education.” Mkhwebane said they’d look into allegations that a lodge being used as a quarantine site was owned by a member of the Eastern Cape executive council.
