A MANHUNT for the killer of a gogo and her daughter is under way. Mudzunga Muvhulawa (90) and Caroline Muvhulawa (54) were found dead in their home in Lunungwi Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, by a neighbour on Sunday.

Tshifhiwa got a call from neighbours telling her to rush home. “There were many people outside and police in the house. She instantly knew something bad had happened. “I wasn’t allowed to see the bodies, but the house was turned upside down, a sign the killer had been searching for money. “Their death has shocked me and left me in pain. They were my only family. They were my pillars. They both collected grants and I worked so we could have a better life.” The murderer entered the house by breaking down a front door. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said two murder cases had been opened. “Police investigations have revealed the killings might have taken place on Saturday,” he said. “The motive is still unknown, but police investigations are under way.” Mojapelo pleaded with anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of those responsible to contact Colonel Shumani Raphulo on 082 565 8179 or to visit their nearest cop shop. Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the brutal killing of two vulnerable women and instructed the district commissioner to assemble a team to hunt down the killer.
