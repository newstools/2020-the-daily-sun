A North West police constable, who was shot dead and his car set alight, was given a great send off on Friday morning in Seweding village in Mahikeng, North West. Constable Thato Makhoana (26) was described as a brave young man who was dedicated to his work. Makhoana’s lifeless body was found along the road outside Mahikeng with gunshots and died last week. His car was later found torched at Majemantsho village. He was stationed at the Mmabatho police station in Mahikeng. His mother said the person who killed her son has broken her heart. “The person who has done this has not only hurt me, he has hurt the whole nation because police officers are our protectors  but at the end, we as their parents are left hurt. I wish to meet Bheki Cele and ask him to have stern measures to protect the police. I am really hurt,” she said. His colleague Constable Kgampepe said Thato was an active person when it comes to his work. “He knew how to make one enjoy his or her work. When he was around at work, we would always be laughing. He was full of jokes. What had happened broke my heart,” he said. Mmabatho police station commander Phenyo Otukile said every day when they wear their uniforms they wear death. “Every morning when we leave our homes, we know that we are not making criminals happy. “Pray for us, there is nothing that hurts like being a police officer but we took an oath to serve the nation. It’s a challenge to us.” He said Thato’s murder will not deter them from doing their job. “We won't be scared saying police are being killed, instead we will be heroes because of you,” he said. The suspect, aged 47, accused of killing Thato, appeared before the Mmabatho Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. He is facing a murder charge and is expected to make another appearance in court on 11 August for legal representation.
