Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says football in the bio-bubble is completely different to normal as his side dropped more points following a 1-1 draw with Stellenbosch FC on Sunday. Chiefs have taken five points from a possible 12 since the resumption of the season, when a healthier return might have seen them out of sight in the championship race. But Middendorp says that the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates have also battled to find their rhythm in the unusual circumstances of the season finale. "This is not just Kaizer Chiefs. It's Sundowns. It's Pirates,” Middendorp said. “The blueprint in this bubble is absolutely deep block [a packed defence]. Wait for the mistake of defender. That is what happened today again. One in the first half. One in the second. "Then you get caught. You are zero one. Then you start to play. Then you have to unbreak a deep block of … I think you have seen the game. I don't know. I didn't count anymore. “It is not the first time. We have seen it in a number of games in the bubble. And of course not really having the opportunity to train with the players over a number of weeks. "The attacking work needed to break down the deep block is difficult. The defensive work is easier. We really tried from the beginning. We pushed ourselves right until the end to get the second goal. In the end it's a 1-1. And of course it's a result we didn't want. "It's the same for Sundowns and Pirates. It's difficult for us to break down these teams. We see this week in and week out." Chiefs hold a five-point lead over second-placed Sundowns, but have played a game more and have four remaining in the season. Their next fixture is against The Brazilians on Thursday, while Sundowns played again before then and are back in action on Monday against Lamontville Golden Arrows. It means Thursday’s clash is shaping up as a potential title decider. - SuperSport
