EMTEE has vowed to sue up-and-coming rapper Lil Zara for defamation of character. Emtee told Daily Sun he’d go to court if Lil Zara didn’t stop tweeting about him and demanded that he apologised for publicly claiming that he didn’t promote their song, Truth, after being paid to do so. On Wednesday, the two got into a war of words on Twitter. Emtee said: “He will get a letter from my lawyers soon. “I said he must stop tweeting about me and he’s continuing. “I’ll sue him for defamation of character. He must pay for this campaign he’s running to ruin my name. “I’ll make sure he works for me for the rest of his life.  Emtee also accused Lil Zara of hacking his Instagram and Twitter accounts. “I can’t use my Instagram account at the moment because it was hacked. I know it was him.” Lil Zara said he wanted an apology from Emtee. “It’s not about the money. It’s about the respect,” he told the People’s Paper.  When asked about the hacking allegations, he said he bought the page from someone earlier this year. “When I got it, it already had 14 000 followers. I’m not a computer guy, so it’s impossible for me to hack accounts,” he said. Lil Zara said he was waiting for Emtee’s lawyers. “I’ll be waiting. If he wishes, we’ll go that route, ” he said.
