KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says no player should drop below the standards when they face Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday evening and has urged the squad to "maintain a sharp focus”. Chiefs will be aiming to extend their lead at the top of the Absa Premiership standings with victory over Celtic at Tuks Stadium (6pm). This fixture promises to be a tricky affair for both sides. In the first round, Chiefs collected maximum points in an eight goals thriller which took place at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Last weekend Chiefs broke a two-game winless streak in the league by coming from two goals down to defeat Polokwane City 3-2 away in their most recent outing, with strikes from Willard Katsande, Anthony Akumu and Samir Nurkovic leading them to victory. A win would move the Amakhosi nine points clear atop the league standings and a step closer to ending their trophy drought.“We need to be patient and maintain a sharp focus for the full 90 minutes against Celtic,” Middendorp said. “It will be crucial to show good off-the-ball movement and produce intensive and smart game pace which I believe will benefit us at the end.” "He continued: “At the end, it doesn’t matter much who the opposition are, our aim remains going into each contest to collect the maximum points. Coach John Maduka is going to field a team of eleven fighters. They will step up when they need a goal and can form a wall when they defend. The German mentor says they got a plan for Celtic players who could cause trouble for them on the night. He said: “We are playing a very disciplined Celtic. They have some industrious players in their team. “We must closely watch the roles that Lucky Baloyi and Justice Chabalala play to close their channels. Remember they have their influential player in Ndumiso Mabena, who makes them play. We will need to watch him as well. “We have a solid plan for them. It is going to be a tight contest, but we are ready for another victory.”
