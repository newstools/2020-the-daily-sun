A FAMILY of nine children live in fear and are looking for help. They live in a one-roomed mud house in Mnambithi in Ladysmith, KZN, and are scared it will collapse on them any day. The children’s aunt, Cebi Shabalala (37), said other family members offered whatever little they had to help the family. She told Daily Sun things had become worse since the children’s mum died in 2018. She said one of her nieces tried to look for a job, but was unlucky. “She just wants to better their lives, but things don’t seem to get better,” she said. Cebi said it also worried her that all the kids were girls, and she felt it wasn’t safe for them.  She said the kids’ father wasn’t involved in their lives and they didn’t even know where he was. She pleaded with SunReaders to help her struggling family with anything from food, clothing or building material.  “We’d appreciate anything we can get.” said Cebi. “I also try to help whenever I can, but it’s not enough. KZN social development spokesman, Mhlaba Memela, said officials would visit the family, assess the situation and the department would then take it from there.
