AS much as he has made some excellent signings, Pitso Mosimane, the most successful coach in the history of Mamelodi Sundowns, has made the worst recruits since he assumed the hot seat in 2013. Here, KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA looks at some of the flops he wasted money on. SIYABONGA ZULU He arrived in the 2018 January window but spent more time attending to disciplinary issues than on the pitch. A year later, his contract was terminated after he failed to report for training for a month, having played only three matches. FARES HACHI With his vast experience on continental football, Hachi was expected to help the Brazilians deliver the second Caf Champions League title. But the Algerian international spent only a year at Chloorkop before being sent out to Chippa United on loan. On his return, he was summarily released at the start of the 2017-18 season. GLENN VERBAUWHEDE Verbauwhede joined Sundowns from his native Belgian side Westerlo in 2013, but left without making an appearance. Fourth down the pecking order, the goalkeeper switched to Free State Stars on loan and ended up at Maritzburg United, where he retired three years later. HICHANI HIMOONDE Himoonde joined from another continental powerhouses, TP Mazembe, in the 2014 January transfer window. But he spent a season on loan at Zesco United in the Zambian league. He left without playing a single game. JEREMY BROCKIE He arrived amid huge expectations, but he is on the verge of leaving Sundowns with the “biggest flop” tag on his back. Brockie battles to rediscover the form that earned him a multi-million move to the Brazilians in the 2018 January transfer window. He has just completed a season-long loan at Maritzburg United, and is unlikely to have his contract extended at Downs.
