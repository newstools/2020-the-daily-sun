RESIDENTS vowed they won’t leave the flats in Fleurhof on the West Rand – and when cops were gone they went back! Sandile Mabaso told Daily Sun he had nowhere to go. “We told them we’re not going anywhere,” he said. “They kept these flats unoccupied while there are people who’re desperate for somewhere to stay. “If I die here it’s fine. My children will know I died trying to build a home for them.” Louise Brown (61) said she moved into her flat three months ago because she desperately needed a place to stay. “I used to stay in a house in Meadowlands, but I now have grandchildren and the house was too small,” she said.  She said she applied for an RDP in 2008. On Wednesday Daily Sun reported that a man died while community members were running away from the Red Ants, and Joburg Metro cops fired rubber bullets. Police distanced themselves from the death, but a witness claimed he found the man still breathing.  “It was clear he was struggling. I called the police and asked them for help and told them to call an ambulance. “I didn’t move because I wanted to make sure he got help.” MMC for housing, Mlungisi Mabaso, said chaos won’t be tolerated. “We’ll no longer do a handover on Friday because we have to assess the damage,” he said. “We can’t accept lawlessness. People should follow procedure and wait their turn. Invasion is a criminal act and people will be arrested.”
