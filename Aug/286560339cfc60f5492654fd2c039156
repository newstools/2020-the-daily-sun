SUSPECTS implicated in the R100 million Royal Bafokeng Trust fraud case have been found guilty. They were found guilty of fraud by the Mokopane Regional Court yesterday and the matter was postponed to 20 August for formal bail application and later 28 August for sentencing. This after it was proven that Nwabisa Goci(29), Tshepo Daniel Sehlapelo (27) and Aaron Madanda (40) acted with common purpose to unlawfully transfer money from the trust. Nwabisi and Sehlapelo were also found guilty of contravention of the identification act. The suspects were arrested in 2018 after they allegedly approached a consultant at ABSA and asked her to help them open a fraudulent account, where R100 million from the Royal Bafokeng Trust account was to be transferred. State prosecutor Advocate Sammy Mogoshi submitted to the court that the suspects should be sent directly to jail. This after Magistrate Gert Pretorious asked the defendant and states prosecutor whether anyone would like to pursue with the extension of the bail. Mogoshi said: “The case involves big cash of more than R500 000. Direct imprisonment will be a suitable ruling against the suspects.” Reading his judgement, Pretorious said images from the CCTV and the evidence presented during trial made it clear that the suspects were aware of their unlawful actions. “This court has proved beyond reasonable doubt that they wanted to rob the bank on 20 July which they planned ahead of their actions,” he said. Sammy Mmethi from ABSA said they were grateful justice prevailed. “We have been working hand in hand with the police since this case started providing necessary information needed for the hearing. As ABSA we will always protect our clients’ assets,” he said.
