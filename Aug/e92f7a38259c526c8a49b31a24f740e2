GRAEME Smith has reaffirmed his commitment to cricket in South Africa, in light of growing criticism against Cricket SA (CSA). Smith, Cricket Director, has found himself in the coalface of stinging criticism from the public, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter campaign, particularly over his own appointment and the appointment of Proteas coaches and staff. In a teleconference with the media, Smith also spoke on a wide range of issues, the media leaks, internal agendas and a “cancer” within the organisation. “I think it’s been a cancer from within the organisation for a while and it’s not getting any better, ” said Smith. “You try and sit and work out who in senior positions in this organisation is doing this, and why. What is the end goal? Is it serving cricket? It’s quite clearly someone in a high-profile position, whether it is in the business part or the board part, because some of the stuff being leaked can only be from those parties within the organisation and that’s disappointing. “We’re an organisation that spends all our time talking about these other things instead of the game of cricket. “It certainly does feel that there are people within these positions that have ulterior motives.” Smith has recently been criticised for his appointment of his former teammates Mark Boucher as head coach of the Proteas, among others. “If you look at some of the things which are being said around appointments, my appointment and the appointment of my staff, I think some of those things are extremely unfair and it was good to see the president put that straight,” Smith said. “I think the narrative is really unfair. I was appointed by a really vigorous process and didn’t go and appoint myself. I’ve made it clear why I got involved. “Internally, with these leaked documents and trying to create some stories out in the media, I do feel that there is a plan at play at times.”
