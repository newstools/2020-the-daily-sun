AMAZULU caretaker coach Ayanda Dlamini says he is fully aware of the task that lies ahead in trying to save the club from relegation. He believes players must raise their hands and says there’s no place to hide, and leaders will have to be born to see the coastal outfit survive the chop. Dlamini took the role of caretaker after Usuthu management placed coach Josef Vukusic on special leave in February. The Absa Premiership will resume on 11 August in Gauteng, which was chosen as the biologically safe environment. AmaZulu, who will share Lucas Moripe Stadium with Maritzburg United for home games, lie second from bottom on 23 points from 24 matches, three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards. However, Dlamini, based on what he has seen since the club restarted training late last month, is confident that players are willing to put their bodies on the line and save the club. “Since we came back to training last month, I see a good attitude and dedication from the players because we need to get their fitness back as soon as possible,” Dlamini said. “Why I’m saying that is we won’t have much time as games will be coming thick and fast. But their dedication brings me hope that the team we have is willing to fight to survive. We don’t need to be reminded of the huge responsibility we are facing, and I’m calling on the players to save the team, save our careers and the entire Usuthu family.
