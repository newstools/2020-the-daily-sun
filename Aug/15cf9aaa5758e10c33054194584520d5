GOLDEN Arrow Bus company has offered a reward for information leading to the conviction of people burning its buses. Two buses were torched in Philippi this morning, taking the number of recently torched buses to five in two weeks. Company manager Derick Meyer said they were offering a R200 000 reward. “Golden Arrow is extremely concerned about the arson attacks, which resulted in five destroyed buses in the last two weeks. The police are mandated to investigate and bring these perpetrators to book and we plead with them to intervene decisively. Golden Arrow will also be offering R200 000 for any information, including video footage of perpetrators setting the buses alight, which will lead to the arrest and conviction of these perpetrators.” About today’s incident, company spokeswoman Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said: “Golden Arrow can confirm two buses were set alight in Philippi this morning. Both were completely gutted. That brings the total to five buses completely gutted in just two weeks. Fortunately, no injuries were reported and only the drivers were on board.” Last Friday, two buses were completely destroyed and one salvaged during an attack on the R300, while two weeks ago, drivers were attacked and robbed before a bus was torched. “This cannot continue. We need help and we need it now. We are calling on SAPS and the authorities to keep our drivers and passengers safe. Public transport must be allowed to operate safely and criminals must be brought to book,” said Dyke-Beyer. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Philippi East police are investigating a case of public violence and malicious damage to property following violence early this morning. According to reports, a group of about 70 people from Siyabangena informal settlement participated in a service delivery protest at Eisleben Road. They blocked the road, two buses were torched and motorists were thrown with stones. No one has been arrested. Police are monitoring the situation.”
