Independent National Gospel Music Awards (INGOMA) have been postponed to 31 October this year. These awards were set to take place this coming Monday but due to lockdown they have been postponed. “Initially we were planning to host these awards online but it seems the country will be moved to level one sooner. We also considered the fact that our target market is not yet accustomed to digital platforms. Based on this we decided to postpone the event by at least two months. As a result we’ve gone back to our original plan, and that means hosting the normal event with our nominees, public and our special guests at the venue,” said Dan Raseluma, the founder and event organiser of these awards. He said the preparations are underway already including venue, hosts, voting, sponsorships and ticket sales. “The event will take place at Redemption Church just outside Johannesburg. The voting lines are already open and the public is already voting for the nominees. Ayanda Ncwane and Aaron Molousi will be our hosts. A team of judges have been chosen already. Unfortunately the ticket prices have not been set but they will be less than R200 unlike other years,” he explained. Although he plans for a normal event he said he is leaving room for disappointment. “If it does happen that the country is not yet moved to level one on that date we will have no choice but to do them virtually. There’ll be no postponement or cancelling. This is because we want to leave the month of November free for SABC Crown Gospel Awards.”
