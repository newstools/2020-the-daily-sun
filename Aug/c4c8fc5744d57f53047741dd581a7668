LINDA Maponyane (37) was once a domestic worker, but today she runs Kenako Media House with her friend Tshego Moholo in Randburg, Joburg. “Being a domestic worker taught me to be sympathetic and be concerned about those who’re suffering,” she said. Linda ventured into publishing her own work after being cheated by people who were supposed to facilitate her work. “They took my money and never delivered,” she said. “I started my own publishing company. I didn’t want others to get the same bad treatment.” Linda published her first book, Shadows of My Scars, in 2016. “This book introduced me to the public as author, motivational speaker, coach and councillor,” she said. “I wrote the book to give hope to those who’d been in dark spaces and needed healing.” Her second book, My Father’s Blessing, was published last year. “I wrote the book to absent fathers and children who grew up without their fathers as I did,” said Linda, who only met her dad three years ago. Her third book, What the Seven Goodbyes did to Me, will be released at the end of the year. The book is about what rejection can do to a human being. “Rejection can make you lose trust and take away your ability to maintain love relationships,” said Linda. Linda is also a pastor at Jubilee Global Ministries in Randburg. She’s from Moletji in Polokwane, Limpopo, and came to Joburg and worked as a cleaner, tea lady, filing clerk at a freight company in City Deep. Later she was promoted to cargo controller, where she learnt the value of time. She urged people who’re struggling to never give up.
