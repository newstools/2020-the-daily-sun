FOR many generations impepho has been used to connect with the ancestors. Sangoma Romeo Mapela from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni has now produced an impepho soap bar. He said the soap performs the same duties as impepho. It cleanses bad luck, gets rid of dark forces, and moisturises the skin. He started producing the soap four months ago and it costs R100. It has a number of ingredients such as sea salt, holy ash and coconut, but impepho is the main ingredient. Romeo said turning impepho into soap came to him in a dream. He dreamt he was crushing impepho into powder and next to it appeared a soap bar. “I didn’t have money to start producing the soap and sold some of my personal items. My wife also contributed. “I was the first person to use it and was happy with the results,” he said. Romeo, who started practising as a sangoma a few months ago, said he used to suffer from bad luck. “I used to irritate people when I spoke. My opinions were overlooked. I also suffered from bad dreams.  Those who’ve been using the soap told Daily Sun it didn’t smell like impepho and they were able to use the soap before going into public spaces. One of his customers, Sechaba Kgalala, said he’s been using the soap for two months and is happy with the results. “My skin hasn’t been dry since I started using the soap and I like the smell of coconut.  Sangoma Makgadi Nkele said: “I speak to my ancestors while taking a bath. I’ve used two soaps so far and can see the results.  The soap bar is sold across the country and distributed to customers through courier services. Romeo works on other products which include impepho candles and oil.
