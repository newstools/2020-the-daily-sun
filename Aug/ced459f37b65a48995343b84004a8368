PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) chairman Dr Irvin Khoza has confirmed the team the finished 15th in the Absa Premiership this season will not start the playoffs immediately. Khoza said the team should be given two or three days after the completion of the Absa Premiership. The playoffs are scheduled to commence on 6 September just a day later after the completion of this delayed Absa Premiership season. The Premier Division team will enter them on the 9th of September. The reason for this is to allow the Absa Premiership team that finished 15 on the table a sufficient time to prepare for the mini-league. The Absa Premiership will conclude on 5 September while the Championship will end on Sunday. “To start the playoffs on the 6th of September, it creates a complication. A complication as far as the Premier Division team is concerned,” said Khoza at the press conference early today. “It can never be that immediately after the last game the team finished number 15 (in the Absa Premiership) goes straight to the play-offs. “It is the principle in the league that the minimum date is 48 hours and 72 hours for the next fixture. And that is the norm.” There’s also finalisation of the new date of the Nedbank Cup final. The PSL initial gave two dates and the first was on the 8th of September and the other was on the 12th of September. The PSL has now settled with the latter one. Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic will contest the Nedbank Cup final which will take at Orlando Stadium. “The final is now on the 12th of the September,” said the chairman. Khoza also confirmed that Sundowns and Celtic will remain in the bubble along with three teams that will contest the PSL play-offs.
