FOLLOWING 17 road accidents in Nelson Mandela Bay over the weekend, acting mayor Thsonono Buyeye has condemn motorists for reckless driving. Since President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the introduction lockdown level 2 from 17 August, the Nelson Mandela Bay has recorded 26 car accidents. Buyeye said: “It is disappointing to note that from 17 to 24 August, the city has recorded 26 reported accidents, with 17 of these accidents occurring over the past weekend. The majority of the accidents occurred during the first weekend following the lifting on the alcohol ban. “A lot of these accidents have been attributed to reckless driving as a result of drunken driving. We saw a similar behaviour when the alcohol ban was first lifted, forcing the governmental to later ban liquor sales with immediate effect.” “We really thought our resident had learnt their lesson but if these numbers tell us anything, it is that we have some irresponsible drivers as some drink alcohol while under the influence of alcohol and put other road users at risk.” “To deal with this problem, our Metro police and traffic officers will reinforce their operations to deal with irresponsible drivers. Covid-19 is not over yet. The last thing we want is to be hit by a second wave and also deal with alarming accidents.” City’s director for traffic and licensing, Warren Prins, said the city recorded one fatality during the weekend. Prins said: “We started seeing a rise in the number of accidents across our city after level 2 came into effect. It is understandable as the economy was reopened, but the 17 accidents during one weekend is a major concern. We are exploring the option of holding roadblocks during the weekends to curb these accidents.” “We would like to call on motorists to not drink and drive. We urge motorists to not speed while driving as many of these accidents are attributed to speed. If people could adhere to the road rules a lot of these accidents could be avoided and many lives saved.”
