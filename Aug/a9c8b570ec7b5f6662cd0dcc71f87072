WHEN the cat’s away, the mice will play! Thugs took advantage when the caretaker at Khethamahle Primary School in KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, was away and broke into the school on Sunday. The thugs allegedly stole laptops and a router that was kept in an office. Resident Ntando Mkhize (36) told Daily Sun that they heard in the morning that the school was broken into. He said the principal arrived at the school to check on things as the caretaker wasn’t there and she found out that it had been broken into. “The caretaker wasn’t at school when the break in happened as he was visiting his family. So I think the thugs saw that the caretaker’s room was locked and they went in to break in,” said Ntando. Another resident said the thugs broke the wall of the office where the laptops were kept. “They are selfish and don’t care about the future of the children. The principal is doing a great job at the school, but selfish thugs are targeting schools and stealing,” said the resident. KZN education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: “We have been made aware of the unfortunate incident. We ask the local community to work with the police to ensure the culprits are apprehended.” Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a school on Klolo Road in J section was allegedly broken into. “Laptops and a router were allegedly stolen. A case of burglary was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation,” said Mbele.
