SOUTH African Rugby took another step back to normality on Thursday after getting the green light to return to the playing field, albeit under certain conditions. The news was gazetted by Mr Nathi Mthethwa, the Minister for Sports, Arts and Culture, on Thursday. It allows for a return to competitive action subject to compliance with measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.The directions stipulate that contact training is permitted and matches can be played in empty stadiums, with only limited people allowed to attend games as part of essential services to make these events possible and from within a "bio safe environment".This means SA Rugby can now continue with their plan to play a domestic season from September and salvage some part of the domestic season that was stopped by the Covid pandemic.It also means that teams can move onto their second phase and start contact training after being only able to train in small groups since being allowed back a few weeks ago.It is also massively good news for the Springbok players, who are likely to get some game time in before having to head to New Zealand for the Rugby Championship in November.“Since the start of this pandemic we have been working hard at ensuring we get back on the field and we’ve kept the Government informed of our plans throughout the process,” said Roux.“We are very grateful for the opportunity to move to the next phase of our return-to-play plans and will provide the Department with all the necessary information required, such as venues for matches, to ensure a smooth transition to competitive rugby.“Having said that, our eight franchise teams that returned to the training field recently still need a few more weeks of preparation before they will be ready for matches, and from SA Rugby’s side we will assist them with whatever is necessary.Roux said there was still a hope to play matches by early next month.“At this stage, we hope to have our first matches by early to mid-September and our plans on the structure of the planned competition will be announced in due course, as we have various options to consider.” -supersport.com
