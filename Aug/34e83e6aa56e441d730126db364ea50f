PLAYING at the home ground of your arch-rival will always bring discomfort, says Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp. Amakhosi were drawn to be based at Orlando Stadium‚ the ground of their Soweto rivals, Orlando Pirates‚ for the remainder of the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season, as per the bio-bubble rules. On Wednesday, Chiefs played their first game at their temporary base where they were held to a 1-1 draw by Bidvest Wits. During a virtual post-match briefing, Middendorp admitted it was a “strange feeling”. “It is strange, let me be honest,” Middendorp said with a chuckle. “You look into it and actually everybody knows, being a rival of Orlando Pirates and you have to face the faces of the heroes of Orlando Pirates. "You go in (the changerooms) you see it on the left and you see it on the right. It's not really comfortable. "It doesn't make you really feel at home, there's no doubt about it. It's quite a challenge." Chiefs remain at the top of the PSL standings with 49 points - four points ahead of Mamelodi Sundowns who are occupying the second spot with 45 points. Chiefs will be looking to get back to winning ways on Saturday when they visit Polokwane City away at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday (3.30pm). Middendorp also revealed that the likes of Yagan Sasman and Leonardo Castro, who were substituted limping, could be back for the Saturday match. He stated: “Leonardo Castro could be more serious, very close to getting him on for Saturday. Yagan Sasman is not a hamstring only is just cramping. “Majority of the players who were taken off today will be available on Saturday, but that does not mean we will not change the squad.”
