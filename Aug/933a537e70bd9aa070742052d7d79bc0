REACHING the Nedbank Cup final could be an opportunity of a lifetime for Baroka FC players. And head coach Dylan Kerr has told his charges to grab it with both hands. Bakgaga will face Bloemfontein Celtic at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday (2pm) for a berth in the final of the Ke Yona Cup. They stand to gain R2,5 million just by reaching the final and R7 million should they manage to go all the way and lift the coveted trophy. Kerr is relishing the opportunity of leading the Ga-Mphahlele outfit to their second major final after they won the Telekom Knockout in 2018. “It’s an opportunity of a lifetime,” said Kerr. “I’ve told my players that they might never find themselves in this position ever again. They have to grab it with both hands and have no regrets after. “They have the chance to put themselves in the history books of South African football. No one remembers the runners up or those that come third. Only the winners will be remembered. “We will be watched by a lot of people all over the continent. We need to give a good account of ourselves.” Kerr, however, has bemoaned the lack of sufficient time to prepare for what the English mentor has described as the first of seven finals. “We’ve got a small squad and we are coming back from five months inactivity, it will not be easy on them,” added Kerr. “I’ve got to manage my team’s health  in the coming few weeks and ensure we have a fit squad for the rest of our matches. “There’s loads of concerns and issues but on football side I just ask my players if they are fit and feeling well, whether they are ready mentally and those sort of questions. “We’ve had to change everything in training programme in the last two weeks , I’ve had to push my players hard but not injure them. “I’ve never experienced such a long break but we can’t dwell on that, we can only watch what’s happened in Europe and learn from them. What I’ve seen is that teams have taken time to reach their normal level.”
