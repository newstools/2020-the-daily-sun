THE heartless killer woke up his girlfriend’s mum Vuyiswa Mnyaka this morning at her home in Marikana kasi in Joe Slovo, Port Elizabeth to show her how he’d killed her daughter, Ayanda Mnyaka. Vuyiswa (51) said, “At 5.17am, my daughter’s boyfriend, with hands and clothes covered in blood, knocked at my house. He told me, ‘Ou lady please come and see I have killed your daughter.’ I thought he was joking. But he said it several times. “In their shack, I found my daughter in bed full of blood, including on the walls and wearing only a panty. On the floor there were broken booze bottles and planks full of blood. “Then I cried because I could l not watch that terrible scene. “I can’t believe that my daughter is no more. Yesterday afternoon they were drinking two beers at my house on the back street from here and then they left my place. But now my daughter is killed.” “They have been dating for a few months. According to neighbours, they used to fight when drunk. But she never came to my house with visible injuries or complained about abuse.” The mother wished the suspect a painful death. “My daughter’s blood would be the last blood on his hands. He showed no remorse. What he did to my daughter is stabbing me in my heart.” Vuyiswa’s boyfriend Zwelinzima Molo (55) said: “This boy even assaulted the deceased’s young sister in front us when she confronted him. He punched and kicked her.” Captain Sandra van Rensburg said: “A 25-year-old suspect was arrested on charges of murder on Monday. The members discovered the body of Ayanda Mnyaka on the bed with open wounds. The suspect will appear in New Brighton Magistrates Court during the week on charges of murder.”
