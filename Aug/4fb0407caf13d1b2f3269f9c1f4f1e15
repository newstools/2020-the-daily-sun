THE EFF’s Godrich Gardee found himself in the middle of a TWAR. While everybody was celebrating Women’s Day, Ntando Duma was throwing heavy insults at Twitter trolls. The Twar started when she posted her photo in an EFF doek. She captioned the photo “Chiefkazi” followed with a red heart emoji “#EFFWomensDayrally” she also wrote. Then Mlungisi Simelane posted a pic-mix of Ntando. In one photo Ntando can be seen standing in front of an ANC banner wearing an ANC doek, on the right-hand side, Ntando can be seen in full EFF regalia. Mlungisi then tagged Ntando and wrote: “Buya ekhaya Qabane”, followed by ANC colours. Ntando wasted no time and started throwing punches at Mlungisi, she wrote: “Awusemdala for le Nonsense. Ubhoreka kabi Mnjendevu ndini. Simply translated to: “You’re too old to write this nonsense, being a spinster is boring you.” But this did not discourage the twitter trolls, as Pinky Phungula tagged Ntando and wrote: “Political B***C that has no direction,” Ntando clapped back and wrote: “iB***h unyoko, ngo****n ongena direction.” The twar was so intense that the EFF’s Gardee intervened and disciplined both Pinky and Duma. He wrote: “You did not have to stoop so low.” Soon the Twitter streets were divided as some felt Ntando dragged Pinky's parents in the fight. But Ntando's fans felt she had every right to defend herself because she is also a parent herself.
