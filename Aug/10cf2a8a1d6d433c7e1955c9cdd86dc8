VOLKSWAGEN GTI drivers have a reputation for being bad on the road. SunWheels published a story previously of a Polo GTI that lost control on a curve in India on a highway. The Polo GTI was reportedly driving at 104 km/h in a 40 km/h zone.  In a video that has surfaced on social media, another GTI got involved in an accident while speeding. The driver of the GTI can be seen approaching robots with several cars waiting for the lights to go green, but he couldnâ€™t bring the car to a stop fast enough and crashed into the other cars.
