BEATING Cape Town City at Orlando Stadium on Thursday night (6pm) should be enough to enure that Stellenbosch FC retain their Absa Premiership status. This is the belief of Stellies coach Steve Barker, whose side are 10th on the table with 30 points from 25 games, and seven points ahead of the bottom two sides. Barker has prioritised a win over City because their next game is against Kaizer Chiefs at the same venue on Sunday. He admitted that getting something against Chiefs, who are at the summit of the table, will be a tall order as the Soweto giants have their sights firmly set on winning the league title. Amakhosi hammered Stellies 4-0 in the first round. “The objective for us is to get to 33 points quickly and what a better way to do that against your local rivals Cape Town City,” Barker said. The 33 points targeted by Barker is the same number of points that his opponents have accumulated so far. “They have done well and they seem to get better as the season goes on and it does seem like the coach’s tactics are starting to pay off,” added Barker. “So we are mindful of that situation. “They keep the ball well and they have good individual players who can win matches for them. Tactically, we are aware of that and our plan is to counter that.” Barker will be without Ovidy Karuru, who was sent off when they defeated Golden Arrows 1-0 at Tuks Stadium last weekend. Mpho Matsi will also miss the game as he has a knee injury and is out for the season. But the good news is that defender Sibusiso Mthethwa is back from suspension. However, the former AmaZulu coach has admitted that the way City beat Mamelodi Sundowns 3-2 at Loftus Stadium on Monday has made his side wary. “They are obviously in a good space and the team looks like it is a happy camp,” Barker acknowledges.
