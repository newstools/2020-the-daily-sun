Uzalo fans were heartbroken as the Khanyile Brothers left the show on Thursday. Godfather and Thulani, played by Sizwe Khumbuza and Thulane Shange, respectively have brought drama to the SABC1 soapie.The brothers were Khathaza's (Sibonile Ngubane) sons and had come to avenge their father's death and get his riches back.Nkunzi, played by Masoja Msiza, shot and buried them alive. Like that, their journey on Uzalo was over.Their fans said their goodbyes on Twitter and appreciated the two actors.
