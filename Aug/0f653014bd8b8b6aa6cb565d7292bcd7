THABANE Zulu has distanced himself from the R255 million Free State asbestos audit tender. The former human settlements director-general told the Zondo Commission yesterday that the plan Free State used to remove asbestos from houses didn’t originate from the national government, but from Gauteng. He said his only involvement was to ensure processes were followed when the business plan was revised. “I don’t have jurisdiction over the provincial department on who they appoint as service providers,” said Zulu The tender was awarded to a joint venture between Gauteng-based engineering consultancy firm Blackhead Consulting owned by Edwin Sodi and Diamond Hill Trading 71, a firm owned by slain Ignatius “Igo” Mpambani. The joint venture was to produce an audit and assessment on how to eradicate asbestos from the province. “When Blackhead was being considered by the Free State Department of Human Settlements to do the work for them, they didn’t use this department. That was done by the national department. They used the Gauteng process,” said Zulu.  He admitted that Sodi paid a R600 000 deposit towards SMD in Ballito, KZN for a Range Rover. Zulu said Sodi owed him money. Zulu told the commission that the national department had different service providers who were members of the panel, but were not appointed to do any specific work. He said he was not involved in the appointment of service providers in provinces. He only approved businesses plans.
