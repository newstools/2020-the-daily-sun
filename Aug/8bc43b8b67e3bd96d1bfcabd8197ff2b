BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coach John Maduka says they won’t allow Witbank Spurs to distract his charges from achieving their target of reaching the Nedbank Cup final. ABC Motsepe League outfit BTM Sports, formerly known as Spurs, have opened a case against Siwelele with the PSL Dispute Resolution Chamber for allegedly not properly registering defender Aviwe Nyamende. According to reports, BTM boss Freddy Mapulane wants Celtic to forfeit their place in the competition, claiming that the defender was still contracted to Spurs when he played for Celtic against AmaZulu in the Ke Yona Cup. But Maduka said during a Zoom press briefing yesterday that their focus is currently at Orlando Stadium, where they will tackle Baroka FC in the opening cup competition on Saturday (2pm). Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns will face Bidvest Wits in the other semi-final showdown on the same day at 7.15pm. Said Maduka: “We don’t allow negative stuff to distract us. We will leave management to deal with the issue. Our focus is on the players to try to ensure we don’t allow external matters to affect us. “Our job is to play Baroka and get to the final. “This issue hasn’t affected our focus on preparations.” Maduka made it clear that he won’t change the philosophy instilled by former coach Lehlohonolo Seema, who joined Chippa United last month. “Losing Seema was not good for the team as we used to work well together. We should understand that time comes when a coach has to leave. I am not happy he left, but it’s something we expect in the industry and life goes on. I won’t change because we were co-coaches sharing ideas.” The 49-year-old Siwelele legend said they will tread carefully on Saturday to avoid getting injuries since his side hasn’t played a single match in four months. “It’s tricky, but we need to gradually take it step-by-step to avoid injuries. “If Baroka play quick football, we need to adjust because we can get injuries,” added Maduka.
