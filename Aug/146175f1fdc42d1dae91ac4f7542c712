TWO friends are using their hands to make beautiful items to sell to their kasi. Mike Chirume (71) and Ejay Takawira (30) from RDP in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun they made cake tins, chicken feed, tool boxes, safe boxes and water boxes from zinc. Mike said he has been working with his hands for more than 30 years. “People like our items. This is our daily work and it has been putting food on the table for many years,” he said. Mike said they sold their products all over Gauteng and employed two people to handle sales. He said their products ranged from R15 to R1 000. Mike said they bought zinc and wire in Denneboom, near their kasi. “At the moment, we’re experiencing challenges because of lockdown. It has been difficult to sell our products,” he said. He said they were appealing for help to get a bigger place to grow their business and show their products. Ejay said they’d love to share their skills with the youth as it would help with the country’s high unemployment rate. “Working has been our pillar of strength as it gives us hope and food,” he said.
