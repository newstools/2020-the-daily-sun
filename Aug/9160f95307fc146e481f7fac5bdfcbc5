KAIZER Chiefs’ No 1 goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune, says they are lucky that they had a bit more time to prepare for the Premiership resumption through discussion on various aspects on their “Keeper Corner”. According to him, this is their goalies communicating with Chiefs goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter. “It’s basically about learning from the past to go forward. Going back into the field will all be about mental strength… We just need to be ready, come 11 August,” Khune told his club website. The Bafana Bafana goalie added that he is happy they will soon be able to do what they all love again – playing football, with Chiefs being allocated Orlando Stadium as their temporary home venue for the return to football. He followed the resumption of the competitions in Europe, like the English Premiership, the Spanish La Liga, the Italian Serie A and the German Bundesliga. As usual, Khune’s focus is on the goalkeepers: “I realised that the break, due to this Covid-19 pandemic, affected a lot of keepers, including Manchester United’s David de Gea and Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel. They didn’t seem to have the same confidence as before the break. There was clearly a lot of rustiness.” Amakhosi are currently top of the premiership table, with 48 points from 22 games, while Mamelodi Sundowns are second with 44 from 21 matches. He admitted that they will miss their supporters on the stands as the matches will be played behind closed doors. “You are the driving force behind this team and we will miss you cheering us up when the league restarts,” he said to the Khosi Nation. “We still want to make you proud and you will be that pillar of strength for us. We are at present in the number one spot and we don’t want to disappoint you when we go past the finish line. It’s important for us to continue where we left off.”
