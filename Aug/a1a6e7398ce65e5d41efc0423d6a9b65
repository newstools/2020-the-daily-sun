THEY broke into the house in Zola extension outside Thulamahashe on Monday through the kitchen door. They helped themselves to food, a TV, DVD player, amplifier, takkies, clothes, blankets and jewellery. Florence Makavi (39) said she and her husband Ezekiel were in Gauteng when they got a call from family members that thugs broke in. “We left family members to look after the house. But they didn’t hear the thugs breaking the burglar bars. “We believe the criminals used muthi and one thug’s family members said their son said he was responsible.  “We reported the matter to the police,” said Florence. Cousin Karabo Lukhele (19) said: “I was asleep and heard nothing. I couldn’t believe the sitting room was empty when I got up in the morning. “We found black muthi.” Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu said:  Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops responded swiftly. The suspect appeared in Mhala Magistrates Court and was out on R500 bail.
