ALL squatter camps in Mamelodi need to be relocated to permanent stands in safer areas. According to the squatters in the Tshwane kasi, every summer when it rained they feared they’d die in floods. The residents of 77 Buffer Lake, near Eerste Fabrieke Station, said they wanted to be moved somewhere safer before it started raining again. In December, a number of residents lost everything when floods swept away shacks. Last week they marched to the local municipal offices to hand over a memorandum of demands. Community leader Mandla Mahlangu (47) said the march was to make sure the authorities heard their grievances. “We want to know when we’re moving to our new places as the rain could start at any time,” he said. “The municipality must tell us when we’re moving to Mooiplaas as was promised.” Mandla pleaded with the authorities to involve residents in the process. “We’re begging the municipality to treat all squatter camps equally and that the Inkandla squatter camp in Mamelodi West shouldn’t be left behind,” he said. Mandla said if they didn’t get a response within seven days, they’d build have to shacks outside the municipal offices. Vusi Sibiya (24), another local leader, said they needed the municipality to tell them when relocation would happen. Human settlements deputy director for region six, Mandla Skudla, received the memorandum and promised to respond this week. Tshwane administrator Mpho Nawa told the People’s Paper: “The city is relocating people and asks residents to be patient.”
