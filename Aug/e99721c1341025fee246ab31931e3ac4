MARITZBURG United players let themselves down against Black Leopards and this will not be acceptable when they face title chasing Mamelodi Sundowns in an Absa Premiership clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (6pm), stressed assistant coach Vincent Kobola. The Team of Choice were defeated 3-2 by Lidoda Duvha at FNB Stadium last Sunday. The club from Midlands are lying sixth on the log, having earned 39 points from 25 games. But the Maritzburg are aiming at a higher target, according to Kobola. Said Kobola: “We want to finish in the top five and it doesn’t matter who we are playing against. We have to go there and compete, and make sure we win this game.” The Brazilians also have to bounce back if they hope to catch leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Downs have failed to win their three league matches played since the league resumed this month. Pitso Mosimane’s players suffered a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Cape Town City at Loftus Stadium on Monday. The Tshwane giants, who are six points behind Chiefs, will be looking to get their title challenge back on track and close the gap on Amakhosi, who were stunned 3-1 by Bloemfontein Celtic at Tuks Stadium on Wednesday. Said Kobola: “After their defeat against Cape Town City, Sundowns will want to win against us and close the gap between them and Chiefs. But we also want to win because we come from a defeat.” Maritzburg, who lost two matches against Sundowns this season (including the Telkom Knockout final last December), will face the nine times league champions without Mxolisi Kunene, who was taken off against Leopards after he twisted his knee. He’s set to be out for the rest of the delayed season. “Other than that, all the players are injury free,” said Kobola.
