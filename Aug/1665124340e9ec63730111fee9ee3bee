Maritzburg United coach Eric Tinkler and midfielder Daylon Claasen will resume the Absa Premiership in high spirits. This after the duo were voted coach and player of the month of February/March, respectively. They had to wait over four and a half months to receive their accolades after football in the country was halted by the coronavirus outbreak. But prior to the break, Tinkler guided Maritzburg United to four successive wins, beating title contenders Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits away from home as well as Stellenbosch FC and Polokwane City, impressive results that moved the Team of Choice to 5th place on the log standings. Claasen, also from the Maritzburg-based club, played an integral role in Unitedâ€™s good form back in February. The stylish playmaker was the key man for his side, scoring four goals and providing a couple of assists in that period.
