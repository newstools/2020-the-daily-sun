UMKHONTO weSizwe military veterans have warned that divisions within the ANC’s NEC are tearing the organisation apart. The veterans said the problem, if not addressed, would collapse the party or result in it losing power. They said the matter had been reflected on at their own NEC over the weekend. It had been agreed that decisive action had to be taken to “protect the revolution”. Their president Kebby Maphatsoe said they’d consulted widely with members about problems the party was faced with and agreed. Maphatsoe spoke about lack of leadership within the party, saying the party’s 54th national conference resolutions hadn’t been implemented and that rampant corruption went unpunished under President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said infighting that started shortly after Ramaphosa was elected in Nasrec in 2017 had intensified. “This insidious and pathetic infighting and defending of factional turfs literally paralyses the national executive committee, and thus the whole ANC. “Hardly any decisions are taken because factions fight each other to a standstill. And more often than not, the ANC – which should be the leader of society – finds itself in a stalemate situation. “This is reflected in the communiques/media statements that are issued after NEC meetings.” Maphatsoe said even though the veterans didn’t support Ramaphosa going into the national conference in 2017, they now accepted him as leader of the organisation and were rallying behind him. He told Daily Sun veterans hoped the party would put its foot down regarding the recent looting of money set aside for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.
