GOGO Cynthia has a new shack after living in a dilapidated one for 20 years! Cynthia Mhlomi (68) from Ivory Park extension 9 in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, lived in the same room in a one-roomed shack with her sons, aged 25 and 27. She told Daily Sun she was worried her old mkhukhu would fall down. She also has a kidney problem which, she said, was made worse by her shack. She’s now received a three-roomed shack, as well as groceries and furniture from the community, local businesspeople and Sanco. “I visited my daughter in Ivory Park for a month, and when I got back on Monday I was surprised to see a big shack in my yard. “I even wondered if I was at the wrong place!”  Her niece, Busisiwe Mankumca (34), said she’s happy the family has a better place. “It will restore her dignity and prevent rainwater coming into the shack,” she said. “It’s so beautiful to see her smiling!” Sanco deputy secretary in ward 133, Thabo Mthethwa, said they identified her as she wasn’t well and living in a broken down shack. “We’ll carry on looking for disadvantaged community members and build houses for them,” said Thabo. “It’s a pleasure to make a difference in the community. “We encourage people to stand up and raise their concerns.” The neighbours said they were proud of Sanco for building the shack.
