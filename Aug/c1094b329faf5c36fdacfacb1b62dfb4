MEDIA personality Minnie Dlamini has landed herself in trouble. This is after she posted a picture of herself rocking Bantu Knots, and referred to the hairstyle as “ghetto”. “Just because it is ghetto, doesn’t mean it’s not fabulous, loving my Bantu Knots,” she captioned the picture. She also posted a similar picture on Instagram and captioned it: “I can go from lady to ghetto, in a second.” ALSO READ | VERY BONANG HITS TWO MILLION MARK Shortly after posting the pictures, many people were not pleased by Minnie’s captions and referring to the hairstyle that is primarily rocked by African women as ghetto. A tweep called her out and said natural hair will never be ghetto. “Our natural hair will never be ghetto. We should embrace our natural look. You look beautiful in that hair, dear.” While another said her caption is misleading: “We understand freedom of expression, but wow why must when embracing your natural hair be linked to ghetto.” “I find it disappointing that a weave makes one look lady like vs your own bantu knots. Black woman wake and own your power.” READ MORE |ACTRESS REMEMBERS THE DAY SHE WAS SHOT Another tweep said some girls are still struggling and seeing it being labelled as ghetto won’t do the good. “Umhle (You are beautiful) Minnie as always, but please be careful not to classify our African hair and hairstyle as ghetto in your huge platforms because there might be black girls who are still struggling to love their natural hair and seeing it being labelled as ghetto won’t do them good.” SEE POST BELOW: Just because it's ghetto, doesn't mean it's not fabulous ??
