BLACK Leopards stand-in coach Morgan Shivambu is not fazed by the challenge of saving the Thohoyandou outfit from relegation. But Shivambu, who replaced Allan Clark after he quit as Lidoda Duvha head coach last week, has targeted winning the first four of their six remaining Absa Premiership fixtures. He said they’ll need to win those four games to have a mathematical chance to remain in the Premiership next season. Failure to do so would see Leopards relegated. Lidoda Duvha are at the bottom of the Premiership on 20 points from 24 matches, three adrift of AmaZulu, Polokwane City and Baroka FC who are tied on 23 points. Leopards resume their campaign on 16 August against Maritzburg United at FNB Stadium, which is their biologically safe environment (BSE) home venue in Gauteng as required by the PSL. Shivambu, who will be assisted by former club skipper Mongezi Bobe, has prioritised wins over Maritzburg United, Golden Arrows, SuperSport United and AmaZulu. Leopards’ last two matches are against Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns. “We have to collect points in our first four matches so that in our last two games we’ll be relaxed and we don’t play under pressure,” said Shivambu. “If we don’t do well at the beginning of this mini league, it’s going to be difficult for us. The last two games are against Wits and Sundowns and I don’t want to face those teams while we are under pressure.” Leopards go into the final stretch on the backdrop of poor results. They lost all four matches in all competitions. However, that losing streak has not deterred Shivambu except the manner in which the team has been conceding goals. He said: “The players admitted they have been conceding easy goals. We have been working more on the defensive side because we know we are good going forward.”
