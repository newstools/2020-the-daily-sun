MANY South Africans have lost their income and are struggling to make ends meet. But Sibusiso “Mkhulu” Mathe eased the burden for residents of Makhaza in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Saturday. After the community approached him for help, he donated money to 100 struggling people. Before handing over the money, he said: “Go and buy food for your family. SKHOTHANE SANGOMA MAKES IT RAIN CASH! “I know things are hard, but you’ll not die of hunger as long as Mkhulu is here.” People who had registered for help lined up for their money before the sangoma started throwing cash to onlookers. Mkhulu said he compiled a list of the 100 most needy and gave them R300 each. “When you assist the needy, God will always bless you and open doors for more money,” he said. Blind Nompumelo Dada (42) thanked Mkhulu for helping her and others during tough times. “I’m a mother of two and looking after my kids isn’t easy,” said Nompumelo. “The money he gave us will help me buy food for them.” Mkhulu also threw R100 and R200 notes into the crowd. “I’m giving out this money, but I’ve sent R60 000 home to my parents,” he said. “It’s hypocrisy to care for people when you cannot care for your own family. “Blessings come from taking care of their own family, respecting your parents.” The sangoma, who’s also a maskandi musician, said he’d continue giving money to people until November. Next month he’ll help 200 people, 400 in October, and 500 in November – his birthday month. He promised to give out a new car on his birthday, which he intends to celebrate at Khayelitsha Stadium in November.
