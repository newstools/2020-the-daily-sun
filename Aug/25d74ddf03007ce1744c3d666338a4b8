IT was a hard day for both Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns as they played to a pulsating draw at Dobsonville Stadium, as the Absa Premiership return to action. Coach Pitso Mosimane says he will take a "good" point from Pirates while his opposite at the Soweto giants Josef Zinnbauer said he's satisfied with what he saw, and would take the point too. Much as Sundowns were denied what looked like a clear penalty, but Mosimane opted to keep mum about it. "Pirates missed two chances to score. The second half Pirates took the game to us. They looked much fresher than us. We survived," Mosimane said. It's okay." Zinnbauer reacted: "Zero-zero is fine. Sundowns always have a chance against any team. They always give us trouble, and they are a difficult team to beat. With luck you can win the game against them. Our focus now is our next match."
