Bidvest Wits will not be short of motivation in the remainder of the PSL season. This is according to head coach Gavin Hunt, who insist that his side have it all to play for. That's despite the situation they currently find themselves in after the club's status was sold to TTM. In fact, that is the exact reason why Hunt's charges are prepared to leave everything on the field. Although some Wits players have managed to secure contracts elsewhere for next season, the majority of the squad are playing to earn their own deals elsewhere. Hunt himself is auditioning for a job elsewhere. "We are playing for our future, myself included," said Hunt. "About seven or so players have managed to get contracts with other teams for next season, and some will be earning more than they were earning here. "But for the rest of the players and myself, we are playing for our future. The players that have got contracts need to help the ones that haven'y got them yet."
