The MKMVA and Daveyton residents want to stop the national disaster of women and children getting killed. Today they matched to the Daveyton police station to deliver a memorandum about gender based violence and the cases that have been left unresolved. Ekurhuleni secretary, Bafana Mahlabe said they want to play their part in ensuring that women and children are safe but need help from the police to make sure that perpetrators are behind bars. "We want to see change in the violence that has been taking place in our country and want all gender based violence cases resolved," he said. Bafana also said the memorandum has several issues with the most important one being the gender based violence cases that have not been resolved till today.  "Some dockets even went missing and no one has been help accountable. These are the kind of things holding us back," said Bafana. He also told the people's paper that there must be a Menâ€™s forum in the SAPS and Metro. "These forums should have regular meeting on weekly basis in which Men would have an opportunity to have a dialog on matters relating to their domestic challenges in their respective families," he said. They've also submitted a list of several cases that they need answered.  The CPF chairpman, Ramoitheki Madikgetla said men need to start practicing what they preach. He said there's been a lot of gender based violence matches but women and children are still getting killed. He also told Daily Sun they are giving police 14 days to respond to their memorandum. Daveyton SAPS spokesman, sergeant Connie Moalusi said the station has accepted the memorandum and will follow up on the list of cases submitted.
