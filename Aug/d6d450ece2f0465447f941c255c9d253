BRIAN Molefe used to go around with a light-brown leather backpack full of R200 notes. This was revealed at the Zondo Commission yesterday by the former Transnet CEO’s assigned driver and protection officer. The man, called Witness One to protect his identity because of threats to his life, said he drove Molefe to places like the Gupta compound in Saxonwold and the Sahara offices in Midrand. He said that once during a board meeting at the Transnet offices at the Carlton Centre, Joburg, Molefe asked him to fetch his cellphone. “I went as instructed. When I opened the bag I saw that it was almost full with R200 notes.  He said he asked Molefe about the money. “He was visibly upset. He said it’s none of my business what was in his bag,” he said. Witness One said Molefe would sometimes ask him to deposit money varying from R5 000 to R20 000 for him into various bank accounts. Witness One told the commission he received an SMS on 9 June last year, which commanded him to stop giving evidence.  He said when he drove Molefe to the Gupta residence and Sahara offices, he met Ajay Gupta. He said if Molefe went without the brown backpack, he came out with a brown sports bag. Witness Two, who worked as driver and close protection officer for former Transnet Group CEO Siyabonga Gama, told the inquiry his boss visited the Gupta residence about three times. He said on one occasion he saw Molefe and former Transnet engineering CEO, Thamsanqa Jiyane. “Jiyane came to me in the car and said in Zulu: ‘I’m exposed to their shady stuff’,” he said. He said Gama came out and told him that someone would bring something and he must put it in the car and a Gupta relative gave him a suitcase, which he placed in the boot.
