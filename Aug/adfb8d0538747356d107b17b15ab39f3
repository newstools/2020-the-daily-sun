SOCCER legend Daniel “Mambush” Mudau is giving back to the kasi where he grew up. The former Mamelodi Sundowns captain launched the Daniel Mambush Mudau Foundation on Sunday at DI17 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, by donating food parcels and sports gear. The legend said kasi people raised and supported him. “This is a blessing for me. I felt honoured to see elders in the community dancing and rejoicing for the little I did for them,” Mambush told Daily Sun. He said credit should go to his daughter Lerato (25) and son Dimpho (19), who came up with the idea. Lerato said her dad is an icon. “We felt we needed to honour him while he was still alive,” she said. Another former Sundowns legend, Alpheus “Go” Mabusela, said he was proud of Mambush for the initiative. Gogo Philippine Nyalunga (72) said they were happy to receive the groceries. “I will cook a delicious meal today. He is our child and he is very generous.”
