Banyana Banyana duo Zanele Nhlapho and Andisiwe Mngcoyi are on the the move. They have become the latest Banyana stars to earn moves abroad. Nhlapho and Mgcoyi have joined champions KFF Mitrovica in Kosovo, both penning one-year-deals. “The first two reinforcements for the 2020/21 season, Zanele Portia Nhlapho (Defender) and Andisiwe Mgcoyi (striker) both come from South Africa,” said Mitrovica in a statement. This comes after a number of their Banyana teammates signed for team abroad over the past few weeks. The likes of Thembi Kgatlana, Nothando Vilakazi, Lebogang Ramalepe and Rhoda Mulaudzi among others, all got their moves a few weeks ago. Mgcoyi has already represented a number of teams in Europe, including German side FC Saarbrücken. Nhlapho, who is a former Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies player, has less experience abroad. The pair will now feature in the UEFA Champions League.
