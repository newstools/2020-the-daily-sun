Captain Mavela Masondo said the two women allegedly went to the mum’s home in Ga-Mogale and told her they were from the father’s family and wanted to buy clothes for the baby. He said the mum went to the Magaliesburg CBD with them, where one asked to hold the baby, while the mum was given money to buy food. “When she came out of the shop, she found the two had disappeared with the baby.” Masondo said the suspects, who seemed to be in their mid-20s and spoke Tswana, wore blue jeans, black boots, and one wore a blue sweater.
