PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will tonight address the nation on the update of the government's efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic amid speculation of a downgrade and easing of restrictions. The Presidency in a statement said Ramaphosa will deliver what has come to be known as family at 8pm. "The President’s address follows a meeting earlier this week of the National Coronavirus Command Council and meetings today of the President’s Coordinating Council and Cabinet," his office said.
