 WITH the international travel ban still in force, the
tourism industry will be relying on South Africans to keep it afloat. Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said this would
give locals the opportunity to explore the country and get out of their homes. Apart from South Africa Week where locals are entitled to a
50% discount, the minister has not announced any incentives for locals who
wished to travel but stressed that the support of locals in the absence of
international tourists is crucial. She said the department was also putting together its
recovery plan. Updating the alert level 2 guidelines at an inter
ministerial meeting yesterday, Kubayi-Ngubane said the downgrade of the
lockdown would get business going and save jobs. She said people could now do game drives and guided tours
limited to 50 people in attendance. People are allowed to book into hotels for leisure but
hotels would have to adhere to strict restrictions. Restaurants will not be allowed to exceed 50% of its
capacity and bars can only serve liquor until 10pm. “Let us hold one another accountable for the sake of our
people and our industry,” she said.
