EIGHT teams will be scrambling to avoid finishing at the bottom of the Absa Premiership when the bio-bubble camp starts next weekend. The Premier Soccer League have scheduled next weekend to resume the league with Nedbank Cup semifinal matches. Battle for R15 million price money and survival is set to resume with a humdinger between Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns at Dobsonville Stadium on Tuesday 11 August. Most clubs have 15 points at stake as they went to the forced break in March having played 24 matches. The battle at the bottom of the table will to go down to the wire with eight clubs still in a perilous position‚ and just a nail-bitingly close one / two points separating them. Black Leopards (20 points), AmaZulu, Polokwane City, Baroka FC (all have managed to gather 23 points from 24 matches), Chippa United (26 points), Stellenbosch FC, Cape Town City FC (both have 27 points) and Bloemfontein Celtic (28 points)all will be involved in the intense relegation dogfight when the league resumes. However, AmaZulu striker Bongi Ntuli remains optimistic to continue where he left off, scoring goals to fire Usuthu into safety place by the end of the season. Ntuli scored 12 of his team’s 14 league goals this season and he scored when they shocked table-topping Kaizer Chiefs in the final game before lockdown. They will resume their season with a crucial clash against fellow strugglers Baroka FC at their new ‘home’ of the Lucas Moripe Stadium on 15 August, with the teams separated only by goal-difference and with each having the chance to deliver a psychological blow. Ntuli believes AmaZulu will be ready for the restart, and the remaining weeks of the season. “I think we’re ready as a team. We have the belief that we can come out of the position we’re currently in,” he said. “Our hopes are still quite high, everyone has been pushing at training even though it has been a long and difficult wait. "We have to go onto our game against Baroka with everything we’ve got.”
