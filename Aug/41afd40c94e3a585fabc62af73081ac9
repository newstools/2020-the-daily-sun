Tweeps are not happy about DJ Tira winning the SAMA for Best Kwaito Album for his album, Ikhenani. Malume Bearings was nominated alongside Maphorisa and Kabza De Small, Virgo Deep and MFR Souls. People on social media are asking how Tira won and beat the kings of Amapiano, who had two albums nominated in that category.Some even went as far as asking the SAMAs to explain why Tira won. The SAMAs just laughed at one of the tweets that were complaining about Tira winning. Also read: TIRA GOES DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH A REALITY SHOW!  But the #SAMA26 were in the evening. Your opinion is accepted though, but how can we trust you when you can't tell the difference between day and night?
