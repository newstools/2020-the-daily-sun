THULISWA was seven months pregnant when she found herself facing a dangerous decision. Her boyfriend Ditaba Bodibe told her to decide between him and her family. When the 26-year-old Thuliswa Dick chose her family over him, he allegedly stabbed her to death. According to the family, during the argument on Monday in Fochville, on the West Rand, Ditaba kicked her in the tummy before stabbing her to death. Thuliswa’s gogo, Nombulelo Dick (76), said before her death, Thuliswa was scared of even coming back home because of alleged threats by the boyfriend. 23 YEARS FOR RAPING MENTALLY ILL WOMAN! “She told us she was saving our lives by staying at her boyfriend’s place,” said gogo Nombulelo. “She said he threatened to kill every member of the family if she came back. “He said he’d start with me and finish with the children.” Gogo said he used to lock her up at his home for days because he didn’t want her to go to her family. “When she was here this week she had escaped through the window. “On Monday he asked her to choose between him and her family. She chose her family and was killed.” Gogo said she wished Ditaba was dead and not in jail. “He will spend his life in jail, but I’ll never see my granddaughter again.”   Thuliswa’s cousin, Nombuyiselo Jonas (29), said: “Ditaba abused her. He locked her in the house for days. She ended escaping because she could have gone into labour.” Ditaba’s matter has been postponed to 1 September for formal bail application. Outside court women marched, holding placards with slogans condemning gender-based violence.
