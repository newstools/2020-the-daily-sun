RESIDENTS say the church premises will soon become the Mzimela burial site. There’s a creche and school on the premises. The wife of late KwaMashu Christian Centre founder, Bishop Zwelakhe Mzimela, is buried next to him on the premises. Gogo Doris (70) died on 16 August and was buried on Saturday. Her husband was buried in July. KwaMashu residents were shocked when they heard gogo Doris had been buried there. Resident Nontobeko Dlamini (32) said: “We’ll never get used to having graves in the middle of kasi.” Another resident, Nhlanhla Mbuyazi (26), said: “First it was the bishop and now it’s his wife. “What will happen if the church appoints another bishop? “Will that bishop also be buried here?” A parent, whose child goes to the school at the church, said she’s not a member of the church, but sends her child to the school. The woman said she likes the school. But her child won’t set foot there next year! Church spokesman Pastor Mthethelezi Zulu said: “The bishop and his wife wanted to be buried at their workplace. “The eThekwini Municipality approved their application to be buried there.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela told Daily Sun: “Cemeteries and crematoria by-law permits anyone to be buried anywhere. “The church applied and it was approved. After approval a grave can be dug anywhere the person wishes.”
