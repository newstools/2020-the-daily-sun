RESIDENTS of Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town are occupying the Lower Crossroads community hall. This is because their area has been flooding since last week. When they first arrived there, they didn’t know what they would eat because their groceries were damaged by water. But now they have been receiving donations from different organisations. Ntombekhaya Nyama-Plati, a pastor and community provider, said she wouldn’t sit back and watch the Marikana squatters suffer. “They need help and I have a church in their area, so there was no way I was going to let them suffer this way,” said Plati. She donated food parcels. Anathi Kana, chairman and founder of Likuwe Ithembalethu Youth Foundation, said after the squatters occupied the community hall, he knew they had to do something. “Even though we gave them these donations, they still need more,” said Kana. Community leader Xolani Thukwayo said they occupied the hall because they had nowhere else to go. “The community hall was the only option. We never thought that people will help us with donations. We are grateful to all of them,” said Thukwayo. Ward 35 Councillor Mboniswa Chitha said people have been bringing donations to the people of Marikana. “The list is endless. But everyone who took their time and came to donate we are grateful because without them, maybe these people were going to sleep with empty stomachs,” said Chitha. He told Daily Sun that even though there are more than 200 people who sleep and stay in the community hall, many squatters are fed in the hall. We cannot chase them when they are here, because they are from the same community, even though they don’t sleep here. We are hoping that more donations will come because we don’t know how long are they going to stay here”, added Chitha.
