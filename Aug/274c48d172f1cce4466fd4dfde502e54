Our country always commemorates women during August and we observe 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children later in the year. Despite this, the violence against women and children continues unabated. My take is that we’re not dealing with the root cause of the problem here. Ever since 6 June, 1995, when government abolished the death penalty, human life has become so cheap. It had to be expected that the most vulnerable sector in society X women and children X would be the worst affected. South Africa has become violent and unsafe under the watch of our new democratic order. The only solution is to bring back the rule of law by reintroduction the death penalty. Then we’ll all become safe again.
