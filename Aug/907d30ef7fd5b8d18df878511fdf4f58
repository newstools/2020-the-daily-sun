ERNST Middendorp isn't eager to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by his antagonist Pitso Mosimane! The title-chasing Kaizer Chiefs coach knows all too well about the mind games to be distracted by the psychological warfare as the Premiership race gathers momentum. Amakhosi square up to Mamelodi Sundowns in a keenly-awaited, potential title decider in Soweto on Thursday. Mosimane, the forthright Sundowns coach, has claimed Chiefs have the league to lose, leading the race on 53 points. But Middendorp doesn't see it that way. ”It is nice to play mind games. But we have a clear understanding and we have our focus on our team, ” said Middendorp. ”We don't have to answer to what somebody puts out in the public. We know what we want and we have are focused and clear of what is at stake than to play the mind games. ”It's a huge game. And we are not going to make some sort of discussion just because someone said so.”
