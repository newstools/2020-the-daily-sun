VERY interesting week ahead with Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns set to battle it out for top honours in a top of the PSL table clash on Thursday. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is not happy with defensive approach applied by teams like Stellenbosch. Pitso Mosimane of Sundowns says they will keep knocking and the hinges will break and they might gain entry.Chiefs are top of the table with 53 points while Downs are breathing heavily behind their neck on 50 - which makes Thursday's (6pm) clash a six-pointer.  On the other side, Erick Tinkler is happy with how Maritzburg United have been performing so far, and his Bidvest Wits counterpart Gavin Hunt reckons his players are fighting too, despite all the matches coming in thick and fast.
