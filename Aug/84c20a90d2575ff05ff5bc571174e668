THEY watched in despair as what was supposed to be their homes got demolished. People who bought stands in Rosslyn, Tshwane, thinking they were making a legal deal, lost everything when the Red Ants arrived on Wednesday afternoon. One of the victims told Daily Sun he paid R100 000 for his stand! “I was passing by and I saw people building. They gave me the number for people who allegedly owned the land. I called them, we met and made transactions. “I started building a four-roomed house for my family. Now it’s all gone.” He said when he tried to call the people who sold him the stand, they were nowhere to be found. He said he was angry government let them build for months before acting. Another buyer said it felt like a nightmare. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police were there to monitor the execution of a court order by the Red Ants to evict people occupying land belonging to the Agricultural Research Council. “No injuries or incidents of violence were reported,” she said. Meanwhile, the Gauteng legislature’s ANC caucus condemned the increase in incidents of land being illegally sold, especially in Tshwane. Chief whip Mzi Khumalo said criminal gangs were robbing people of their money while disrupting housing projects. Madimetja Kekana of the Kekana Tribal Council – who’s also an adviser to the Kekana Royal Administration – said they sold the stands because the land belongs to them. He said they proved to the government over and over again the land belongs to them, but it went ahead and got an eviction order anyway. “The matter is due for court next week. I don’t understand how government went and demolished people’s homes when there’s a court case pending,” he said. He said they’re in communication with the people who were evicted.
