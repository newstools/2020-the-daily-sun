SHAIFUL Islam (43) from Bloemfontein was reported missing on 2 August, but on Friday, after investigations he was found in Springfontein, under guard not to escape. The suspects had been making calls to Shaiful’s family, demanding randsom money. Daily Sun could not get hold of the family but police said Shaiful’s bakkie was also recovered. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “On 2 August, a missing person file was registered at Parkweg cop shop after businessman Shaiful Islam was reported missing. His white Toyota Hilux bakkie was found at the parking bay outside Parkweg cop shop premises. The investigation started and it became clear that the 43-year-old foreigner was kidnapped, as the family received anonymous calls demanding ransom money. The police set up a multi disciplinary team and followed leads. “Amounts demanded varied and it was clear more than one suspect was involved. On Friday evening, our members arrested the first suspect, a 50-year-old foreigner in Hilton, Bloemfontein. His arrest led to the arrest of the second, 36-year-old suspect and a 39-year-old third suspect, all foreigners. “Information then led to Springfontein, where the victim was kept in captivity. The police found Shaiful guarded by two men. The 24-year-old and 29-year-old South Africans were also arrested as suspects. “A case of kidnapping and robbery was registered at Parkweg cop shop. Apparently during the kidnapping, the victim was also robbed of an undisclosed amount of cash that he collected after delivering stock in Dealesville. The investigation is continuing and all five suspects are expected to appear in court soon.” Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane applauded the team for working around the clock and making sure they reunited Shaiful with his family and he was still alive.
