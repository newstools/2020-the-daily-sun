THE moment of truth has arrived for GladAfrica Championship rookies JDR Stars. The Tshwane outfit have punched above their weight since the beginning of the season, taking many by surprise. They currently find themselves in fifth place on the log with a play-off position well within touching distance. But the final six matches of the league will make or break their season. All their hard work will have been for nothing should they fail to return with the same vigour and hunger from the lengthy coronavirus enforced break. And they resume their campaign with a massive encounter against fellow promotion chasers Uthongathi, where they will be looking at Thabang “Fifty” Mokoena to supply the important goals. The titanic battle, which has been described as a six pointer, will take place at UJ Soweto Campus at 3.30pm this afternoon. Uthongathi, who were perched atop the Championship standings at some point, will be eager to return to the summit. But Nditsheni Nemasisi’s Hammer Boys will be eager to ensure that it does not happen at their expense. “It’s a six-pointer that will determine our future,” Nemasisi told SunSport. “The play-offs position is in our hands.” This will not be the only fixture to look out for this afternoon as Absa Premiership-bound Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila also resume their campaign. Vhadau Vha Damani, as TTM are affectionately known, have bought the PSL status of Bidvest Wits and are guaranteed a spot in the top flight next season. They will still be pumped up to leave their mark in the Championship when they face struggling Jomo Cosmos at Wits Rugby Stadium. Ezenkosi are in all sorts of trouble at the bottom and can’t afford to drop any more points in this term. They currently sit second from bottom with 22 points from 24 matches. The other match will see Free State Stars, who are chasing a play-offs spot, host relegation favourites Royal Eagles at Sturrock Park.
