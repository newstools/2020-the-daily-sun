FILMMAKER and actress Nokukhanya Luthuli is happy she’s nailed the part of her new character on Generations: The Legacy. Nokukhanya from Durban’s Lamontville kasi is the heartless Thozamile, who abuses her niece Mbali. Her character began appearing on screens last week and annoyed many viewers. She’s happy she was able to nail the character, but insisted that she’s nothing like Thozamile. She realised she could act while attending Durban International Film Festival workshops in 2013. Nokukhanya released her debut film, Deep Wounds, last year. She told SunBuzz she hopes Generations: The Legacy character will open many doors for her in terms of film funding. “I love acting and my focus was on making and acting in films, but I realised that acting in a popular soapie can also open many doors for me,” she said. “I want to go far with my acting career and make many films while acting on the popular soapie. “I pray that Generations: The Legacy can give my character more time.” She said she’s just finished shooting her new Zulu film, Amehlo Ami Yini. She’s waiting for the editing team to give her the green light, after which the film will be released. “I’m planning to convert Deep Wounds into a series,” she said. “It received a warm welcome as it was also screened at the uMgungundlovu Film Festival. “I realised I gave it many limitations. I’m reworking it into a series, so I can give it more time and space.”
