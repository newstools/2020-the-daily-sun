Giving women some advice is a great way to celebrate them during their month. Women are by nature very strong and powerful. They tend to use their willpower to overcome difficulties. Women, too, shouldn’t compromise themselves for love anymore. You can’t be in an abusive relationship and act or pretend to be strong. There are so many women who silently get butchered by their heartless boyfriends and husbands. In love there should be no suffering. Women should look for signs that show their relationship is no longer healthy and leave. There’s also the issue of infidelity. If your man brings home his nyatsi and beds them in front of you, that’s the highest form of disrespect. A lot of women suffer silently and tolerate infidelity. It helps to speak about your situation because emotional abuse is as bad and painful as physical abuse. - Samuel Radebe Heilbron
