FORMER Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker Siphelele Mthembu is confident of finding a new team next season. Mthembu’s contract with Cape Town City expired at the end of June. But he couldn’t agree a short-term deal with the 10th placed City to finish their remaining seven Absa Premiership games. And the Citizens decided it was best they parted ways with the 32-year-old forward. Mthembu spent two years with City after joining them from Free State Stars in 2018. And now the experienced Mthembu is relaxing at home and spending some quality time with his family. But the Melmoth-born player yesterday told SunSport that he is not stressing about his future in the PSL. “I am training alone at home at the moment,” said Mthembu. “I am not thinking about a new team now. I have spent a lot of time away from home and I decided it’s time to be with my family until the end of the season. “I am positive that I will be playing in the top flight next season as there are teams that are looking for my services. “But I will make a decision about my future when this season ends.” The well-travelled Mthembu enjoyed his time at City last season when Bafana Bafana legend Benni McCarthy was still in charge. With McCarthy at the helm, Mthembu lifted the MTN8 trophy in 2018. But this season after the all-time Bafana leading goalscorer was sacked at City, Mthembu struggled for game time – played nine games, scoring only one goal. Despite featuring for the two Soweto giants and Stars, Mthembu has also played for the likes of Bloemfontein Celtic, Golden Arrows, Classic, Maritzburg United and Platinum Stars. Mthembu is also positive that he will regain his form when he joins a new team next season. “I am working hard while I am at home,” he said. “I always bounce back. I believe in God and as long I work hard, He will be on my side.”
