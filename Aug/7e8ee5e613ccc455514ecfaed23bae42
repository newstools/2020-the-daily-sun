SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter briefed the media on the 2020/21 tax filing season yesterday. He said for this year’s tax season, Sars chose the theme #YourTaxMatters due to Covid-19. A mass auto-assessment launch would see over three million SMSes sent out from yesterday to tell taxpayers what was being assessed. “This year, we want all taxpayers to fulfil their tax obligations from the comfort of their own home due to Covid-19,” he said. He said they’d assess a significant number of taxpayers automatically. If you accept the outcome, you don’t have to complete a return because Sars would have done it for you. “If you’re auto-assessed, you’ll be notified per SMS in August, so there will be no need for you to call or visit a branch. “The SMS will direct you to eFiling or the Sars MobiApp to either accept or edit the return. “Some taxpayers may receive communication indicating why they’ll not be auto-assessed, or alerting them to their 2019 return submission findings,” he said. He said the closing date for taxpayers who wanted to file at Sars offices would be on 22 October and would require an appointment. “The closing date for eFiling is 16 November. The final closing date for provisional taxpayers is 29 January,” he said. “We want to simplify it for South Africans, but make it hard for fraudsters to get away with crime.” He said between April and June, Sars and other organisations sei­zed cigarettes worth R77,7 million.
