DAYS of sleeping on a cold floor are over for 90-year-old gogo, Mapeu Motimele. Her horror story – about a spiteful son who’d kicked gogo out of her house and removed all the beds – was told in Daily Sun about two weeks ago. Social workers from Ekurhuleni Municipality came forward and donated a new bed, two foam sponges, food parcels, blankets and bed linen. They also helped her get the rent money her son had taken from the lodgers. Gogo Mapeu from Mashemong in Thembisa, Ekurhuleni, said her back no longer hurt. She said: “This bed massages me. I wake up full of energy. Thank you, Daily Sun, for telling my story!” Gogo, who’s asthmatic, said it was terribly cold on the floor. She’d often wait for the morning sun, so she could warm her body. Her daughter, Dinah Motimele (58), was grateful to the people who helped.  “We never thought the story would help shine a light on us,” she said. Gogo’s nightmare started when her son Alfonso and his family took over the house and forced gogo to sleep in the kitchen! The community heard about this and came to gogo’s rescue. Alfonso moved to one of the four backrooms he built behind gogo’s house and rented out two rooms – and he and his son occupied the other two rooms. Alfonso would pocket the rent money from the two tenants and never gave his mum a red cent. Gogo said she feared her son might sell the house just to spite her. When Daily Sun spoke to Alfonso at the time, he said he pocketed the rent money because it was he who built the rooms. He admitted to having the title deed in his possession. Naturally, the People’s Paper at the time informed Ekurhuleni Municipality about gogo Mapeu’s plight and Alfonso’s role in it.
