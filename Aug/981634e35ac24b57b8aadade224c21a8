BAFANA Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo have left Championship club Brentford. Mokotjo andÂ Greece forward Nikos Kareli has signed short term contract extensions in June in order to stay until the end of the season. The 29-year-old Mokotjo played 102 games in three seasons since moving to the Bees from FC Twente in 2017. Mokotjo made 26 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring in the win at Wigan Athletic. "It has been a pleasure to work with them and they have given their all for the club, on the pitch in the games they have played and in training, where their work has helped the group develop over the season," manager Thomas Frank told Brentford's website. "Kamo has been superb for us over three years and now has the opportunity to take on a new challenge. They are part of the Brentford FC story and I hope we see them again." Mokotjo who has 21 Bafana caps was part the SA national team during the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt last year.
