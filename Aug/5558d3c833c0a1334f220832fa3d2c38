THE Vodacom Bulls have signed Blitzbok Kurt-Lee Arendse on a short-term contract to play for them for the rest of the year. Arendse has starred for the Blitzboks in the HSBC World Series and is a keen attacking player with some deadly footwork at his disposal. Arendse was plucked from the University of Western Cape into the Blitzboks squad and made an immediate impression. He also represented Western Province and Boland at junior levels. He will join Springboks Gio Aplon, Cornal Hendricks and Travis Ismaiel as part of the Bulls' stocks out wide when the rugby campaign returns.
