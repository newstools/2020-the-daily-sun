MOROKA Swallows FC have made a sensational comeback to the top-flight. The Dube Birds were crowned GladAfrica Championship champions yesterday, clinching automatic promotion back to the land of milk and honey. They beat Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) 3-0 at Makhulong Stadium yesterday to pip Ajax Cape Town to the title on goal difference. Kagiso Malinga’s brace as well as Given Thibedi’s strike were enough to hand the Birds arguably their most important win this season. On the other hand, Ajax’s 3-0 win over Mbombela United was not enough to topple the Birds as they fly back to the money spinning Premiership after a five year absence. Swallows were relegated from the top flight in the 2014/15 season and subsequently fell as low as the amateur fourth-tier of Mzansi football. However, this will now be back among the big boys with Ajax forced to settle for a play-off spot. The Urban Warriors,  who were top of the log for the better part of the season only to be toppled by the Birds on the penultimate match of the campaign, only have themselves to blame. They squandered an eight point lead since the restart with their form in the Biologically Safe Environment (BSE) letting them down. Swallows, who headed into the match needing to better the Urban Warriors’ result, wasted little time taking the lead through Malinga early in the first half. Given Thibedi added the second in the 15th minute before Malinga completed his brace in the second to send the Birds flying back to the big time. Swallows coach, Brendon Truter, was over the moon having masterminded the stunning return.He found the Birds flirting with relegation in 13th spot earlier this season and worked his magic to transform them into champions.  My God, you never disappoint and for that I am grateful. Thank you so much ???? @Moroka_Swallows @robertmarawa pic.twitter.com/TPddqtywpZ
