A dumb thug
robbed a cash-in-transit van with a knife. He stabbed
the driver of the van in the back and grabbed three boxes. It turned out the boxes were empty. But that
was the beginning of the drama that happened on Monday in Daveyton, east of Joburg. The other guard
was inside the petrol station at the time to collect cash. He was
alerted by cashiers of what happening outside, he gave chase and fired a shot
which wounded the robber. But that
did not stop the bleeding robber who thought he hit a jackpot. Wounded as
he was, he hijacked a full taxi and threatened the driver to take him to Etwatwa. The taxi
driver drove a distance but when they reached Turton and Movie streets in
Daveyton, he decided to dump his taxi and flee. The taxi
driver alerted other motorists that there was a hijacker in his taxi. The robber
took the three boxes and tried to flee on foot. He was
arrested with the help of community and three cash boxes and the knife were
recovered. Cops came
to scene and when the box were opened, to everyone's shock they were empty. Residents
couldn't help but laugh. Sergeant
Connie Moalusi of Daveyton police station said 57-year-old suspect was arrested
following a cash-in-transit robbery. She said
the suspect attacked the driver while the cash van was parked at a petrol
station in Daveyton on Monday. Sergeant
Moalusi says the suspect is facing armed robbery, attempted murder and
hijacking charges. The suspect
is under police guard at the hospital and the injured driver of the cash van
was also taken to hospital. Moalusi
said the cash boxes and the knife used to stab the driver were recovered.
