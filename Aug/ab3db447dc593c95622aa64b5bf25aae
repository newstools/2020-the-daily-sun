STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker was left disappointed following his side's 1-1 draw with Chippa United on Friday. Waseem Isaacs was on target on just 16 minutes at Tuks Stadium only for Thokozani Sekotlong to pop up with a 94th minute equaliser. The result left Stellies in eighth place on 35 points with two games to play, and the Chilli Boys in 12th place with 31 points. After the match, a downbeat Barker explained his side need to learn how to finish off teams, after also letting a one-nil lead slip in their 1-1 draw with Kaizer Chiefs last Sunday. Barker told SuperSport TV: "I think firstly we were disappointed not to see out the game; we were leading against Chiefs. "I didn't really think they were threatening us. Yes, there were a lot of balls coming into the box, but it didn't look like they were going to break through, hence the disappointment." Barker continued: "It is two points lost at the end of the day, but it is testimony to how far we've come as a team to be as disappointed as we are to not win a match. "Reflecting on his side's performance, the ambitious coach added: "We started the game really well, we created the better opportunities, we weren't under too much pressure, but we need to find a way to get a second goal, to kill off games. "But we are still unbeaten in the bubble so it's a step in the right direction for us. We've got a couple of days break before we play AmaZulu. "We will rejuvenate and come back nice and strong." -TeamTalk
