Some drivers in our country have no right to be behind the wheel. They’ve bought the right to drive from some of our traffic departments. The selling of drivers’ licences is a dangerous practice that places innocent lives in danger. Can a man drive a bus full of innocent people if he was never trained to drive such a large vehicle? I’m just as horrified at the thought of an unqualified driver behind the steering wheel of a huge truck. Imagine how many lives are lost because of such drivers. Cops should work tirelessly to track down and catch those officials and agents who sell driver’s licences to the public. Until this evil of selling drivers’ licences is dealt with effectively, road accidents will keep rising dramatically. ) Aaron, the problem of corruption at traffic departments and driver’s licence centres dates back many years.    It’s one of those crimes that almost everyone knows about, but no one is willing to put a stop to it.     But we alw    ays see action from the authorities when a truck or bus driver kills innocent people.    Once the storm is over, life goes on again, and so does the vicious cycle.     Until we start looking at this as seriously as murder and robbery, innocent people will continue to die on our roads because of those who want to take shortcuts and enrich themselves from blood money.
