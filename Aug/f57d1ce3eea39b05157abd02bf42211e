WHAT happened to Khama Billiat? That has been the question on everyone's lips about the Kaizer Chiefs attacker this season. Not since Teko Modise spectacularly lost form has local football seen a star player gradually fade away from the spotlight, as Billiat has in recent months. Though he initially struggled to shrug off niggling injuries and poor form, the Covid-19 enforced PSL break would have afforded Billiat sufficient time to fully recover. Yet the Zimbabwean international doesn't look any different to the stuttering player he was before the five-month suspension, battling to inspire Amakhosi to victories. On the day he turned 30, Billiat huffed and puffed as Chiefs crashed 3-1 to Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday. Billiat last scored in September, his only goal so far in 20 appearances so far this season. Ernst Middendorp has admitted Billiat isn't having the best of times in the Amakhosi jersey. ”We know it's not a great season for Khama, but everybody knows he has a huge potential,” said Middendorp. ”We can only support him and expect that he will do better.”
