Bidvest Wits captain Thulani "Tyson" Hlatshwayo has been impressed by the 'attitude and character' shown by his side in their two matches since the resumption of the PSL. Wits have faced Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns and Absa Premiership leaders Kazier Chiefs in the space of four days. And their testing week will culminate with another tough clash against Soweto giants Orlando Pirates at Emirates Airline Stadium on Saturday (6pm). Although Wits have not won a match since the restart, Hlatshwayo believes results will come if the continue to play with the same energy. They managed to snatch a point when it looked like Chiefs would walk away with all three in their league clash with the leaders at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday. "Obviously we had a different team to the one that played against Sundowns but i thought the boys did well although we played in patches," said Hlatshwayo. "But what i would commend is the attitude and character from the guys. It doesn't really show too much that we haven't played in a long time. "And what i have noticed is that we pick up in the second half. Most importantly, what has worked well for us is the never say die attitude. We don't give up. Hlatswayo would like to see the same spirit against Pirates at the weekend. He has praised the impact of former Clever Boy Gabadinho Mhango, whom they will have the task of stopping. Mhango is currently the league's top scorer with 14 goals but Hlatshwayo believes he isn't the only Bucs star who could hurt them. "We have played with and against Gabba, we know what kind of a player he is," added Hlatshwayo. "He just plays, runs and shoots from anywhere. He has done well for himself in the league, he is the top scorer and he obviously wants to add to his tally. "But we have to also look out for Pule and Makaringe, they have a lot of quality going forward."
