THREE power transformers worth R3 million each have reportedly been bombed and had copper stolen since February. Yesterday, guards on patrol were greeted by a huge fire coming out of a giant transformer at a substation on the Selati railway line in Rolle outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. There was petrol abandoned there and the thugs had vanished. The guards swiftly alerted Transnet security and risk, who called in a team of firefighters from Bushbuckridge Municipality to put out the fire from 10am until 7pm. A few weeks ago criminals, who are still at large, bombed another transformer at the railway line substation in Ireagh near Mkhuhlu. Another had been bombed in Songeni outside Thulamahashe in February and copper was stolen. Bushbuckridge Municipality’s chief firefighter, officer Reckson Silinda, said: “We received a call from Transnet Freight Rail management about huge flames gutting the giant transformer at the railway line power substation in Rolle at around 10am. So we quickly dispatched our team who fought the fire until 7pm,” said Silinda. Transnet Freight Rail spokesman Mike Asefovitz said: “Selati line was decommissioned and electrical overhead is no longer in use. We are using diesel locomotives and therefore there is no need for electric wires. Although the overhead was removed, the substation is still operational which then attracts copper thieves. “There was no operational impact on the line. The only loss Transnet suffered is the loss of the transformers. Anyone with information which could lead to the arrest of the suspects can contact local police.”
