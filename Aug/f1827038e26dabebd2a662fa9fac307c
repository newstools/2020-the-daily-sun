UBUNTU Bethu Foundation from Samora Machel in Cape Town has been preparing soup for the elderly and people living with disabilities. Foundation member Nokubonga Mepeni said they started the soup kitchen at the beginning of April. “We saw a need to help our people after some lost their jobs because of lockdown,” said Nokubonga. She told Daily Sun that they have been struggling to get to elderly people. “We can’t expect older and people living with disabilities to come get their food here. We were delivering to them by walking but since we have got the bicycles, it will be much easier,” said Nokubonga. She said when lockdown started, most people didn’t think it will be something that will happen for a long time. “Most people depend on piece jobs but ever since lockdown started, piece jobs have dried up and some go to bed hungry.” Their foundation has 73 volunteers. They assist the sick and people living with disabilities. They also have an outreach programme. “We are doing a lot of things as our volunteers also assist in clinics and hospitals. But when we saw our people going to bed hungry, we knew we had to do something,” said Nokubonga. Another member Manelisi Mavuso (32) said the bicycles will help them reach their destinations quickly. “We are grateful to the donors because our job will be easy and quick, and we can feed more people than we usually do,” said Manelisi. Nwabisa Yuku (40) said they need more organisations like Ubuntu Bethu. “Lockdown has made things difficult for most of us. We lost our jobs and in most families, they go to bed on empty stomachs.”
