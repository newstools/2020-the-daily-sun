BAROKA FC coach Dylan Kerr is "scared out of his mind" as he awaits to receive his Covid-19 results on today. Bakgaga, Bloemfontein Celtic, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, are all preparing to go into the bio-bubble ahead of their Nedbank Cup assignments. And players, technical stuff and everyone else involved has had to be tested on numerous occasions before they can enter the bubble. Bakgaga mentor, Kerr, has revealed that it has not been easy during this time. He is anxiously awaiting the results of his latest test, as he prepares to lead his side into the biologically safe environment to complete the season. The Ga-Mphahlele outfit resume their season with the Ke Yona Cup semi-final against Celtic at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday (2pm) "I'm waiting for my results to come back, i'm scared to death at the moment," Kerr said. "No one knows where this virus is, you can get it pretty much everywhere." Nevertheless, Kerr is glad that football is back and is looking forward to finishing the season strong. "All our remaining matches are cup finals," added Kerr. "We are coming back from a long break and we've got a relatively small squad so it wont be easy. but we can't complain."
