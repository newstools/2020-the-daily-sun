IT’S not yet uhuru. These were the words of singer and United Nations goodwill ambassador Yvonne Chaka Chaka. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said the month of August was a reminder of women’s achievements. She said: “It’s also a painful reminder that women are still faced with hardships in many areas of life. “I say this because we’re still not equal to our male counterparts. “The equality we often speak of isn’t practised in most workplaces. It’s lacking both in communities and homes. “Constitutionally, we’re equal. But the reality is that there are jobs reserved for men. It’s high time we change this narrative. “In this day and age, we still have racial inequalities. “What’s saddening is that black women suffer the most – they’re at the bottom. “But I do appreciate that women are slowly getting recognition and we need to celebrate this.” Yvonne said she was also disheartened by gender-based violence in the country. “I’d like to call on the authorities to ensure that women are safe and are protected,”  she said. “We need to make sure our young girls are protected. “I will be doing online seminars and workshops this month, and the purpose is to rebuild strong women and start these conversations.”
