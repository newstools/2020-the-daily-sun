THESE guys were tired of covering their noses when passing the alley-turned illegal dumpsite, so they cleaned it. The three men from Lusaka extension 22 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, spent the whole Monday cleaning the passage between Rampsa and Gladstone Seti streets. Mafemani Mahori (48) said they were worried the rotting rubbish would make people ill and had become a crime hot spot.  He said they cleaned the passage because they were worried about the health of kids who often played there. “We’ll continue cleaning the place and monitor it because it’s part of us,” he said. Sonboy Mashilo (56) has urged residents to stop burning rubbish in the passage as will damage the electricity pole. Doctor Mahori (27) said: “We hope what we did will make people think twice before dumping.” They called on the municipality to hire them to clean other areas.
