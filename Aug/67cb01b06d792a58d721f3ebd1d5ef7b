YOU make the call and the kota and chips arrive at your doorstep. Nancy Temba (42) and her family’s kotas have taken Stinkwater in Hammanskraal by storm. They deliver kotas to their customers with a quad bike. They’ve been in business for more than 10 years. “This is a family business. We all depend on it. Everybody in our home works here,” said Nancy. “When the president announced lockdown we were stressed out. “Suddenly our business was without customers. There was no money coming in and we thought business was dead.” But the announcement came that they could open again, and they made good use of the opportunity. “We made sure we followed all regulations, and this is why we bought the quad bike,” she said. She said their customers relax at home and they make sure their food is delivered. She said: “This quad bike has really helped us a lot. We used bicycles before, but they were slow. We couldn’t get to customers on time. There are no problems now.” Nancy’s son Given (21) said their dream is to see their business growing bigger. “We want to have other shops in various areas getting bikes and employing people,” he said. Customers said the food is delicious. “Not only is the food delicious, the service is amazing,” said a happy customer. “When you place an order you can just sit and wait for the sound of the bike coming down the street, and when you get your food it’s still hot.”
