COMETH the hour, cometh Themba Zwane! Forget about his poor form, forget about the chances he has
missed before. Zwane could be the man to propel Mamelodi Sundowns in this
nail-biting league title race. Just as it looked like Sundowns will drop more points in the
title race, Zwane connected with an inch-perfect pass from Lebohang Maboe to
hand Downs a vital 1-0 victory over Golden Arrows at Dobsonville Stadium last
night. The winning move Sundowns to a 50-point mark, three less
than log leaders Kaizer Chiefs with four games to go. Zwane has admittedly battled with form since the league
restarted, looking nothing like a player who scored nine league goals before
yesterday’s game. Pitso Mosimane has had talks with Zwane and seemingly the
pep-talk paid off. But Zwane came on in the second half, and really came to the
party, scoring a goal which could help give Chiefs a run for their money. Frustrated by poor results, Mosimane again rang the changes
as he handed keeper Kennedy Mweene a rare start, restored Musa Lebusa to the
heart of the defence, Rivaldo Coetzee in midfield and paired Ali Meza with
Gaston Sirino upfront. But the changes didn’t make much of a difference as the
Brazilians huffed and puffed, creating nothing of consequence for the better
part of the match. In all honestly, the match was nothing but a glorified
training session, with both sides creating no clear chances. It looked more like two boxers, who didn’t want to hurt each
but expecting a result. Arrows, however, did the basics right but the likes of
Thabani Zuke will have to do more if the costal side are to qualify for the
top-eight. “If you keep trying you will get it right. You never give
up,” said Mosimane after the game.
