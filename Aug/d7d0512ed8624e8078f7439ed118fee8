 ROWAN Human has been a breath of fresh air in the Bidvest Wits team.The talented midfielder was promoted to Wits first team late last year after some interesting displays in the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC).The lad from the West of the Johannesburg CBD, Westbury, has made a couple of appearances for The Clever Boys mostly coming in as a sub and that has not gone unnoticed. On Saturday he was a substitute in their 3-2 Nedbank Cup semifinal defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns.Hunt who has been impressed by the 18-year-old predicts a bright future for Human as he believes he is the best player in South Africa at his age."He’s (Human) the best player in South Africa at his age," Hunt said."There’s no better player than him‚ I believe that I haven’t seen a better player at his age. And I think he’ll be a superstar.Before the season resumed, Hunt promoted eight young players from the club Multichoice Diski Challenge reserve team to help the club for the remainder of the season. The coach said he is planning on giving them game time in the remaining games but they will have to earn their place in the team/. Hunt added: We have a good mentality. We know what we are up against. They (youngsters) have to play but we are not going to give them free caps we will treat every game with respect. Hunt said: “I wanted to start Solly (Khunyedi) but with his Covid-19 testing I never trained him the whole week. I trained him this morning‚ and he looked a bit rusty. “He has been unbelievable in training the last three weeks scoring goals, certainly been a shining light for me. I didn’t start him because of the Covid testing." Khunyedi was promoted alongside Human last year.
