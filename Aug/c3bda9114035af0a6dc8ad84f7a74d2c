BAROKA FC coach Dylan Kerr has urged his charges to forget about their Nedbank Cup exit and focus on the Absa Premiership. Bakgaga have a huge mountain to climb in the league as they look to retain their top flight status. And Kerr reckon they need to go into that battle with a clear mind. Their return to action after four and a half months did not go according to plan as they lost 3-0 to Bloemfontein Celtic in the Ke Yona Cup semi-final at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. That match would have given Kerr and his charges much needed preparation ahead of their remaining six league matches . The former Black Leopards coach has described these encounters as 'cup finals." Baroka, who are in 13th spot on the log, get their league campaign up and running again next Saturday when they face AmaZulu at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. "The damage that this defeat has caused psychologically is big, but I've gone into the dressing room and told my players to forget all about it," said Kerr. "We will restart again with some recovery and then we'll start preparing for our game against AmaZulu, which another cup final for us. We have six cup finals." Kerr admitted that his charges were a little off the pace in what was their first match in a while. "We are off the pace but it isn't because the players haven't been training, it's just the amount of time that they haven't played competitively. "I felt in training we looked fresh and sharp in what we were doing but today we did not do it."
