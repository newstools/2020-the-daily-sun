GAUTENG Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko is happy about the progress brought by the Okae Molao operations. She said the focus for the day was on the Meadowlands policing precinct. “We haven’t been here for three hours, but there’s been suspects arrested for drug smuggling, so early in the morning,” said Mazibuko. She said there were also suspects arrested for transporting chickens. “Stock theft is high in the country, so these people were carrying receipts for chickens that didn’t match the description, so they had to be questioned,” said Mazibuko. The operations continued to Ndofaya mall, where they checked for compliance in stores.  Mazibuko told Daily Sun that although Women’s Month is coming to an end, she cannot stress enough the importance of protecting women and children all year round. “Starting from January to now, 790 suspects have been arrested for GBV. This is not something to be taken lightly. I also want to warn women who neglect their kids,” she said. Mazibuko said there’s a recent case of a mother living in an informal settlement who locked her kids inside the shack and they burnt inside. “She locked her shack with the kids inside and went to have a nice time. The shack burnt killing her children. We are not saying women shouldn’t drink, but when you have no one to babysit rather buy your alcohol and enjoy it home,” she said.
