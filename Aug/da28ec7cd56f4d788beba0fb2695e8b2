So here you are. Your relationship is thriving and not to say that everyday #LoveLivesHere. You really love this person and your'e having a deep and personal conversation about what the future holds for the both of you. Then, the word commitment begins to echo repetitively in your brain. Ring the alarm as Beyonce would sing it, but in this case the ring begins to ring like the alarm inside your brain. Then that five letter word beginning with an M becomes more apparent to you now. Yet you still ask: is it the right time to pop the question? Many psychologists have conflicting arguments on when is the right time to pop the question, but most of them have agreed on the following guides to look out for if your'e thinking of popping the question: It may seem like a small grammatical change, but it’s actually huge. You see you and your partner as a unit, not just as individuals and that’s an important step toward marriage. Notice that I is a single letter and we or us are two letters of the alphabet? Powerful. Wondering “should I propose?” The “should we have kids” discussion is pretty key. If you have had conversations about family, home and and building wealth together, then marriage is surely the next step. If your family loves your partner, it’s a great sign of a successful in-law relationship. If you have built that trust with your partner's family, you are definitely in the 18 area. If culture and religion is a big part of your lives, learning about each other’s cultural beliefs is an important step towards starting a life together. Can I get an amen to that. A long and healthy marriage is sure to have its ups and definitely its down. If you’ve supported your partner during difficult times such as an illness, job issues, or family drama, it means that you’re well-suited for wedded bliss.
