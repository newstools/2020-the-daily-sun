AND so the mind games begin! It is that time again, the squeaky bum time in the league title race. The stakes couldn't be any higher with the Absa Premiership looks set to go down to the wire. With three games remaining, the tight race between Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs is becoming increasingly hard for many to call. The rivals go head to head on Thursday, in a potential league title decider. But what would a championship race be without the psychological conflict? "The title is on Chiefs to lose, not on us,” said Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. "We are just chasing. They've scored the goals. They've got the points, they can't ask for more. I would have swapped my positions with them, to be honest. I think Middendorp (Ernst) is in a good position. The coming game against Chiefs is not in our favour.” Though there is truth to Mosimane’s statement, Middendorp knows better not to fall into a false sense of supremacy. The German has already claimed he is not concerned with results in the other matches, but only in his team. Amakhosi still holds the aces, sitting top with 53 points, three ahead of the Brazilians.
