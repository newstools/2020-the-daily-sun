BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt felt sympathy for his inconsolable Kaizer Chiefs counterpart Ernst Middendorp, who cut a forlorn figure after the Absa Premiership leaders were beaten 1-0 by the Students at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Middendorp cut a forlorn figure after the match after his side squandered numerous chances to have won this game comfortably. One of the biggest misses came from top striker Samir Nurkovic who missed a sitter from close range in the 90th minute. The wasteful Amakhosi were punished when Bienvenu Eva Nga scored the winner for Wits deep into injury time. Hunt, whose side have a mathematical chance of pipping Chiefs and second placed Mamelodi Sundowns for the title with two fixtures remaining was philosophical. “Professional football is a very lonely game if you don’t win. When you win, it is fine and everyone loves you,” said Hunt. When you don’t win, it’s bad.” But things could have been much worse for Middendorp and Chiefs. Their closest rivals Downs suffered a shock 1-0 loss to relegation threatened Baroka in their clash played at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday. Both teams are still level pegging at the top of the standings with 53 points each with two fixtures remaining. Chiefs head the standings on a superior goal difference. But added Hunt: “When you are so close, obviously to lose a game like that, it’s not easy to handle. On a personal level, you don’t want to see people, especially the way they (Chiefs) were on top of the log for some time, to lose it at the end. But we are in a cut-throat business.”
