JM Aviation director and former Swissport South Africa director Vuyisile Ndzeku has distanced himself from corruption at SAA Technical, claiming he was just used as a black face. He told the Zondo Commission yesterday that he only attended meetings when invited. “I was only called when they needed a black face,” said Ndzeku. “They would just say ‘come, let’s go’. And I was that person.” He was testifying about the sale of ground power units to JM Aviation. NOMVULA MOKONYANE LIED! The company, together with its US-based partner AAR Corp, was controversially awarded a R1,4 billion five-year components support and maintenance contract in 2015. SAAT bought each unit for R800 000, but sold them to JM Aviation for R248 000 each. SAAT paid about R11 million for units that were then sold to Swissport for R3 million. SAAT is now leasing them back at a cost of R450 to R550 per unit, per hour. Ndzeku told the commission he was not able to confirm if he was involved in the new ground power units agreement. “I can’t confirm. I don’t know, chair,” he said. COMEDIAN KILLED BY EVIL SNAKE! He said he didn’t see anything wrong with getting paid by Swissport, who he helped sell aviation parts, while still a JM Aviation director. He said he got between R50 000 and R100 000 for a good deal, on top of his R35 000 salary from JM Aviation. Ndzeku told the commission that he didn’t know what JM Aviation did before getting the Swissport contract. Ndzeku also failed to explain how his business account went from a balance of R1 000 to R28 million just after the agreement was signed. He could not even tell the commission when he got married.
