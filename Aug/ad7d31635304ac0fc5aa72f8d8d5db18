THE #ZimLivesmatter protested was cut shot after police dispersed the crowd using rubber bullets and stan-grenades this morning. The protest was held at Zimbabwe embassy near the Union Buildings in Tshwane. According to protesters they were disappointed by the  way their protest action was handled by police especially when they were shot at. Though the protesters wanted to to be brave and stand to their ground but they were not able to withstand rubber bullets and the smoke.  #ZimLivesmatter organiser Sostina Matina (30) said the protest was in solidarity with their brothers and sisters in Zimbabwe. "We are also concerned Zimbabweans who doesn't belong to any political parties. "We are pleading with Zimbabwean government to stop police brutality to innocent Zimbabweans and the government to improve our country's economy so that us as foreign nationals can return to our home country and be part of rebuilding process." Sostina said the organisation was against violations of human rights in Zimbabwe.  "There is no difference between the late former President Robert Mugabe and the current President Emmerson Mnangagwa as they are the same and from Zanu PF," she said. She said they are calling on Mnangagwa and his government to step down because they have failed people. Leader of Zapu Youth Front condemned the way police handled the protest and dispersing a peaceful protest. "Zimbabwe issue has been burning for a while and  we need a new Dawn as they," he said. Zapu's national people's council in South Africa, Cannicious Nkala said: "We need to revive the economy. We have tried all avenues people are still suffering." Nkala said they were disappointed that instead of being addressed by Zimbabwe officials, police addressed them.
