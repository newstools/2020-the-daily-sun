Dear MizzB I’m 23 years old and have a smelly, green discharge. I drank imbiza to clean my system, but nothing is changing. What can I take to clear it up? Please help! Dear Sistas A normal discharge is clear and has no smell. Any change in colour, such as yellow or green, shows the presence of infection. Please consult your clinic so they can check and confirm in case it’s a sexually transmitted infection, and give you the right treatment for it. Using antibiotics will easily clear up any infection. Don’t drink anything that hasn’t been prescribed by a medical professional to avoid more problems. All the best!
