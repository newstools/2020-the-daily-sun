BUSISIWE Mbombi’s family says her fallopian tubes were allegedly removed without her consent. The 35-year-old died last week after complications from the operation at Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Her family said Busisiwe gave birth to twins on 15 July and was discharged a day later. She was readmitted and died on the 2 July. They said her body was moved from the hospital without them being informed. Busisiwe’s sister, Basani, (40) suspected foul play. “We received a call informing us our sister passed on the day she was readmitted. “Minutes later I got a call saying her body had been moved from the hospital mortuary.” Basani asked why the body was moved and was told government mortuaries were full. “Why didn’t they call us to come to the hospital and move her ourselves?” Busisiwe’s sister-in-law, Service Ndlovu (39), said: “She was healthy. We don’t understand why her tubes were removed. “She never told anyone about removing them.” She was buried on Saturday. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “The suspicion of foul play is unfounded. A post-mortem was conducted on Wednesday. “The allegations that her fallopian tubes were removed without her consent are untrue. “We have it on record a consent form was signed by her for a bilateral tubal litigation.”
