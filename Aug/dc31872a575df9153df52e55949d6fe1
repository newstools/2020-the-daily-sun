LACK of aggression, complacent and an eye opener! These are some of the harsh words used by Maritzburg United head, Eric Tinkler, following their shock 3-2 loss to Black Leopards in their Absa Premiership clash on Sunday. Tinkler says these are some of the reasons why they lost to the bottom side, which showed that his played couldn't cope with the high intensity match.  Leopards started in goal with King Ndlovu who made his first appearance for the club this season after battling with injuries. On the same day on Sunday, SuperSport United drew 1-1 with Bloemfontein Celtic and both coaches - Kaitano Tembo and John Maduka - are satisfied with the performance shown by their players. Tembo was also full of praise for youngster Jesse Donn who was promoted from their MDC side, and he says he's the future of the club.
