Bongani Watu Phindela (24) will the rest of his life in
jail. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape and 15 years
imprisonment for robbery at the Kokstad Regional Court. The sentence came after the court heard how Bongani and his
accomplice raped the victim while she was on her way home in Shayamoya
location, Kokstad. “The victim was on her way home at Shayamoya location in
Kokstad when three men, one known to her, attacked her. The men grabbed and
pulled her to an open field between Shayamoya and Bambayi where she was raped
and stabbed to the back of her body. “The victim sustained injuries and was rushed to the
hospital for medical attention. She was also robbed of her takkies, belt, and
cellphone,” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. Mbele said a case of rape and robbery was opened at the
Kokstad police station and assigned to the Kokstad Family Violence, Child
Protection, and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. In a statement, Mbele added that after a thorough
investigation, the two accused were arrested and appeared before the Kokstad
Magistrate. The matter against one accused was not enrolled due to
insufficient evidence against him. An outstanding suspect is still sought by the police.
