PITSO Mosimane and his Mamelodi Sundowns side must forget about winning the Absa Premiership title this season, and focus on the Nedbank Cup where they have Bloemfontein Celtic in the final. This is the message from former Brazilians striker Ishmael Maluleke after the defending PSL champions suffered a shocking 3-2 defeat to Cape Town City in the league clash at Loftus Versfeld on Monday. Downs are many points behind leaders and rivals Kaizer Chiefs, and Maluleke does not see the Soweto giants dropping points in their remaining six games. “I think the PSL title belongs to Chiefs this season,” said the player who was well known during his playing days for colouring his hair blonde. “I have closely watched Sundowns since the league restarted this month and I have a serious problem with most of their experienced players who have not been in good form, or showing seniority. That is why Sundowns are struggling. The PSL title is for Chiefs.” So far Downs have gone three consecutive league matches without a win, drawing two and losing one. Downs’ next league game is against tricky Maritzburg United tomorrow. “Chiefs know that the league is now in their own hands,” said the 2001-02 season PSL leading goal scorer. “Chiefs are a big team with experienced players. “I don’t see them (Chiefs) losing this title after Sundowns lost to City on Monday. “Chiefs showed hunger to win the championship when they beat Polokwane City 3-2 coming from 2-0 down. That performance against Polokwane was for the champions.” The Giyani-born ex-player joined Downs after he had a good season with ex-PSL champs Manning Rangers. Maluleke retired in 2008 after a decade playing professional football.
