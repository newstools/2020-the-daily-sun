FINANCE Minister Tito Mboweni has landed himself in hot
water after making comments about the sacking of Zambia’s Reserve Bank governor
on Twitter. President Cyril Ramaphosa has moved quickly to distance the
government from Mboweni’s statements, saying they were unfortunate and didn’t
represent his administration’s views. The presidency released a statement saying Ramaphosa had
strongly reprimanded Mboweni for his careless statements. In a series of Tweets, Mboweni criticised the removal of
governor Denny Kalyalya by President Edgar Lungu and even threatened to
mobilise against the move. In a statement yesterday, the presidency said the matter was
receiving Ramaphosa’s attention to make sure it didn’t happen again. Over the weekend, Mboweni tweeted: “Presidents in Africa
must stop this nonsense of waking up in the morning and fire a central bank
governor! You cannot do that. This is not some fiefdom of yours! Your personal
property?! No!” He also wrote: “That governor was a good fella. Why do we do
these things as Africans? The president of Zambia must give us the reasons why
he dismissed the governor — or else hell is on its way. I will mobilise.” Ramaphosa said South Africa enjoyed a good relationship with
Zamabia and the statements were in bad taste. Mboweni has since removed the
tweets from his account. . “President Ramaphosa wishes to assure the government and
people of the Republic of Zambia that the unfortunate remarks do not reflect
the views of the South African government and its people,” a statement read. “The issue is being addressed to ensure that such an
incident does not occur again.” Mboweni’s tweets drew sharp criticism from MPs in Zambia but
he continued fighting. “Looks like I am in trouble about my statement on the
dismissal of the Bank of Zambia governor! I stand by my statement. Central bank
independence is key. Not negotiable. Let all central bankers speak out!” By
