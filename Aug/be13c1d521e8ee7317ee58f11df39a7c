 PAINTING the city red with Suzuki’s Swift Sport 1.4T manual was quite an experience. The fiery red Swift made heat of winter’s last cold days. This awesome-looking car turns heads but I’m here to tell you about its good handling and driving, as you wouldn’t believe its smoothness, comfort and suspension. Looking sharp in the front with a big grill and bumper, I love its rear design, which not only gives it a superb look, but big boot space and roominess inside. Behind the wheel, you have a three-spoke steering wheel with audio controls on the left, and cruise on the right. The good-looking dashboard has a colour LCD infotainment display with SLDA smartphone linkage display audio, Apple Carplay and Android auto, Bluetooth and reverse camera display. Suzuki has done an amazing job on the 1,4-litre engine with 103kW power and 230 Nm torque. The Sport responds very well when you put your foot down.  And f you’re tired of changing gears and have few obstacles, the cruise control is your friend. It is as efficient as when you drive manually. The Sport is light on fuel, and don’t let the double exhaust pipe put you off. We managed to average 6.5 litre fuel consumption per 100km without compromising speed. This sporty car should be a big seller. We give it 10 out of 10 as it ticked all the boxes. It comes with a five year/200 000km mechanical warranty and six year/unlimited body corrosion warranty.
