WORLD famous tourism attraction Manyeleti Game Reserve, near Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga, has been on fire for the past four days. Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency said the reserve was deliberately set alight by evil people. This reserve is one of those reserves claimed by Hlanganu clan, under the Mnisi Traditional Affairs. The land, which makes up the entire land of the national park, was dispossessed by the apartheid government before 1913. The huge flames ate almost 2 500 hectares to the southern and western of the reserves, which borders Welverdiend and Dixie Villages in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge. A helicopter had to be used to put out the blazing flames. Shocked Mpumalanga Tourism Parks Agency spokeswoman Kholofelo Nkambule told Daily Sun: “Our field rangers worked tirelessly to ensure that no animals were trapped by the fire, although the nature of wildlife is that they invariably burn quickly, and small slow moving animals do unfortunately get burnt. “We will be conducting an assessment of the fire as well as detection of any injured animals. If injured animals are detected, our game management and veteran Ian are on standby to treat any injured animals. The location and timing of the fires indicate that they were deliberately set by unknown people. An arson case has been opened,” Nkambule.
