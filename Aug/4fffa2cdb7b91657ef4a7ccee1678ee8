SIX
children had to be rushed to hospital on Monday after they were run over by
hijackers in a stolen car. Tragically,
13-year-old Okuhle Shonga later died in hospital while the other five, aged
between six and 18, were still being treated. The
children from Emaplanzini in Inanda, north of Durban, were on the side of the
road when a speeding Ford Figo run over all of them. The tracking device in the
vehicle was activated after it was hijacked in Newlands and signalled the car
was in the Inanda area. Reaction
Unit South Africa spokesman Prem Balram said its members, the tracker company
and the Inanda SAPS began following he signal. He said the suspects started
speeding after realising they were being followed by a Tracker car. “They lost
control of the hijacked car and ran over the six children who were standing on
the side of the road before plummeting down a steep embankment,” he said. He said the
car landed on its side in between two houses. “The
suspects managed to get out of the vehicle and fled the scene on foot. The
children were rushed to hospital privately,” he said. Resident
Nhlanhla Mkhize (45) said every week, thugs brought stolen cars into the area. “I think
they believe if they bring cars to Inanda, they will not be easily traced but
the tracking companies often find them here. We hope cops find the suspects
soon,” he said. KZN police
spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the cops were investigating cases of
culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving. She said the cops were still
looking for the suspects.
