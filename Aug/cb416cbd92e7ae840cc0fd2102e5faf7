THE investigation into an abortion scandal against three senior ANC members in KZN could be dropped next week. Former premier Willies Mchunu, who leads the investigation team, said yesterday the anonymous woman who accused the members of sexual abuse didn’t come forward to testify. The ANC set up the team to investigate claims that co-operative governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka, Newcastle Mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba and legislature member Jomo Sibiya allegedly tried to force Snokwanda Ndlovu, apparently impregnated by Sibiya, to abort the baby. The team was given until 25 August to present its findings. R15 MUTHI WRECKS PEOPLE'S MARRIAGES! Mchunu said although Sibiya and his apparent baby mama’s abuse allegation story was known, Snokwanda was not the complainant, but the woman who wrote to the ANC. He said it’s been weeks since the task team appealed to the woman or women who may have had similar experiences with Sibiya to come forward, but no one contacted them. “We appeal to the lady or whoever knows her to contact us. Without her it is difficult to continue the investigation.” Mchunu said his team hasn’t called Sibiya because the woman accusing him hasn’t come forward. The woman wrote a letter after Snokwanda fought with Sibiya on Facebook over the paternity of her child. She said he tried to get her to abort the child, which she refused. Sibiya got her bust and charged for defamation of character. She’s due in court next month.
