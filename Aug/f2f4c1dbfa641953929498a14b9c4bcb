SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has become the first coach to say he is impressed with his side’s performances after almost five months without any action. The Absa Premiership clubs resumed training mid-July after approval by the Minister of Sports Nathi Mthethwa. They then resumed with their league campaign early this month playing their first matches since March when the league was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Matsatsantsa a Pitori appear to be cruising as they are now among the chasing pack sitting third on the log with 44 points after 26 matches. They are yet to lose a game after playing three matches since the resumption of football. They won two, defeating Highlands Park and Polokwane City and drew 1-1 in the other clash against Bloemfontein Celtic. Tembo said he is satisfied with his side: “I am very happy with the overall performance of the guys. It looks like we are in good condition and we looking forward to playing Black Leopards in our next game.” Indeed their next clash is against a revitalised Leopards at FNB Stadium in the only PSL match tomorrow at 6pm. “In terms of performance, I am happy,’ he emphasised. “After four months of not playing we really did not struggle a lot in terms of fitness so far in all the games, we have stayed compact. “I am happy with the results. They will take us further, finishing higher than the last season.” Tembo added: “Clayton (Daniels) picked up a few knocks but we will have enough time for him to recover. We also had three other players who were suspended, and they will be back, we will have enough time to plan.”
