AFTER the circulation of a fake Facebook account on social media about eThekwini mayor, residents have been urged to report it. Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has warned residents against two fake Facebook accounts with his name and pictures doing the rounds on social media. One of the bogus accounts promises people jobs at the municipality’s Durban Solid Waste Unit. In one of the accounts, it’s written: “Sizoqasha maduzane kumasipala wetheku ngenxa yokushoda kwabasebenzi. Ngizofuna ozolekelela ekuqoqeni udoti ngoba mningi kakhulu kungaba one nkampani noma ozethembayo ukuthi angeke adlale ngomsebenzi aqoqe imfucuza lihlanzeke itheku nge mininingwane shayela lenombolo 081 742 0417.” (We will he hiring soon in eThekwini Municipality because there is a shortage of workers. We will need someone who will help with collecting waste. It can be one company or someone who believes that they won’t play around with work and collect all the rubbish so that the city can be clean. For information contact this number 081 742 3017). The SunTeam called the number but it wasn’t answered. It kept on ringing. Meanwhile, mayor Kaunda said he has no information about these fake accounts. He appealed to the residents not to fall prey to this act of criminality. “The municipality has a very sound and transparent recruitment process, therefore, I will never advertise jobs on Facebook. Municipal vacancies are advertised every second Friday in the municipality’s Staff Vacancy Circular, which is published in the Municipal publication Metro eZasegagasini,” said Kaunda. He urged residents who have seen the fake accounts to report it to the Ombudsperson and Head: Investigation on 0800 20 20 20, or 031 311 4002.
