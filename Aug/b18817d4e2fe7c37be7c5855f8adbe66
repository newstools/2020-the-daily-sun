ANGRY residents said people should stop poking if they don’t want babies, and women should stop complaining about gender-based violence if they kill babies. The residents of Mamelodi East, Tshwane said this after a dead newborn baby was found in a black bag dumped under Lusaka Bridge on Tuesday. Resident Tshepang Mulaudzi (37) said incidents like this were making him lose respect for women. “It’s bad to see our babies in such a state. We don’t make babies to be thrown away. “I love children and the person who killed this baby is a murderer,” he said. Kasi women said the baby’s mum didn’t deserve to live in the area. Ethel Mkhatshwa (32) told Daily Sun it was painful to see the dead baby, especially when people were protesting against the murder and abuse of women and children. WIFE AND PASTOR POKE IN CHURCH! She said the baby was discovered by a person going through bins for things to recycle. “As a mother and a woman, I think this should never happen again.” Ethel said she heard about the incident at about 2pm as she was passing a local salon. “When I heard the community saying there was a baby under the bridge, I was shocked and angry.” Ethel was brave enough to look into the bag and saw the dead baby. “The baby was naked and spices were sprinkled around it. The body was decomposing and there were flies around it,” she said. Josephine Lebese (24) said people should visit clinics and hospitals to get contraception, or not have sex if they didn’t want children. “I’m a mother of three and what I saw was terrible,” she told the People’s Paper. “The woman who did this should pay a heavy price because she took an innocent life.”
