IDOLS SA contestant Vhudi Mamphwe captured many hearts with his audition. The Venda-born singer had the judges singing along when he performed his song, Yoki Yoki. Speaking to Daily Sun, Vhudi said: “I couldn’t believe it when I got the golden ticket. It was such a priceless moment. “I’ve been longing for this moment to come. This is a dream come true for me. “I’ve always wanted to be on Idols. Now that it’s here I’ll grab the chance with both hands.” The 20-year-old said his song was about proposing.

I wrote the song to serenade someone. “I wanted to show her she’s my everything. “I decided to use my home language to impress the girl. I wanted the song to be relatable. She’s Venda. She was impressed.” Vhudi, who’s studying mechanical engineering at Tshwane South College, started singing in primary school. “I first discovered I could sing when I was in primary school. I learned to play the guitar in high school,” he said. Vhudi said he was humbled by all the people who’d expressed interest in working with him. “I’m yet to contact Tresor and Davido, but I’m still confused because people are saying the screenshot of Davido talking about me on social media isn’t real. “But I’m grateful people have taken notice of my talent and I’m planning to work hard to win Idols this year.”
