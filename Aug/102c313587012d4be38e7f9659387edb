MEC Mshengu said the company manufactures PPE locally. “This came in handy as the education department is already under pressure in terms of procurement of PPE. We will distribute them at schools across KZN,” he said. Mshengu said each school needs to have extra masks kept at school in case a pupil comes to school without a mask. “Then that pupil will not be sent back home but will be given the mask,” he said. Parent Nomkhosi Makhathini (37) said she believes that having extra masks at school is a great idea. “Some pupils are still young and they will forget their masks at home, or even lose them while at school. So as a parent I won’t worry because the child will be given a mask at school,” she said.
