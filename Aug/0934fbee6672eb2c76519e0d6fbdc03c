SUPERSPORT United defender Clayton Daniels is ready for battle. Matsatsansta face Black Leopards at the FNB Stadium on Tuesday (6pm) in an Absa Premiership clash. And Daniels is not expecting an easy day in the office against Lidoda Duvha. This as the Limpopo outfit are fighting tooth and nail to stave off relegation. They have been up for the fight since the restart, winning both their matches to ease relegation fears. But Daniels and Co are now ready to snap that winning run and burst Leopards' bubble "It's one of those games, they are playing to survive at the bottom and we want to finish as high as possible," said Daniels. "But we are excited. We know it's going to be a fight, it wont be an easy game but we showed in our last game that we can play a little bit ugly and get points. "The guys must show up on the day, give their all and take all three points."
