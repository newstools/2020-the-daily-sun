The coronavirus must be our society’s worst nightmare. We are in so much debt and workers are being retrenched everywhere, worsening the unemployment rate. The long-term effects are a horror to even think about. The economy is drowning and I agree with those who say lockdown should be completely lifted. All economic activities should resume, so we can end this bad situation. At least we know by now what we need to do as individuals to avoid the spread of the virus. The government and employers are now familiar with the coronavirus and how it is spread. So, with all the precautions being taken, I think we can safely open up the economy and try to salvage the little that’s left. All we can do for now is pray for better days and have faith in the vaccine trials. ) Letter by Wisani Kenny
