various hospitals. EWN reported that the department said that the reasons for
this ranged from teenage and unwanted pregnancies, lack of financial and
emotional support systems, undocumented mothers, and no support from the
fathers of the babies. In a statement, the department’s spokesperson Kwara Kekana
said that the department was looking at ways to reduce the numbers.
