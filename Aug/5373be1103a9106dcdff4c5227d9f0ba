In the bio-bubble The Citizens have managed to bag three victories out of four Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches where they have downed big guns such as Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates. Erasmus has caught the eye for his goals, with his three strikes since the resumption catapulting him into the frame for Golden Boot this season.His haul of 12 is two behind leaders Gabadinho Mhango (Pirates) and Peter Shalulile (Highlands Park), and with three games left he might fancy a tilt at the title as he looks to help City secure a top eight place. “The team performance has been good and we’ve been working hard during the lockdown to prepare for the resumption of the league,” Erasmus said.“We have shown a lot of character in a lot of games since the league resumed, and that is why the individual performance has been outstanding.“I have been standing out because I have been scoring in the games we have won and played in, that’s because of my teammates.“Without them, it wouldn’t be possible for me to stand where I am now and to score the goals I have scored. Credit must go to everybody and being together you know.“That’s what the team is about and I’m proud to call them my soldiers, they are my brothers. So, we are hoping and looking forward to the upcoming three games and we will see what happens.” Next up for City is a clash with Lamontville Golden Arrows on Saturday (6pm), before they close their season against Highlands and SuperSport United.
