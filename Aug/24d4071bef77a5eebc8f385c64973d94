REALITY TV star Lasizwe Dambuza set social media on fire last night when he took to Twitter to share that it’s high time we educate kids about homosexuality at a young age. “I believe we need to start educating kids from the age of seven about homosexuality and make them understand about same sex love,” he said. Lasizwe, who recently experienced homophobia from Zimbabweans when he tweeted that he stood with their country, got mixed reactions. ALSO READ | STAR GETS IT OF HER CHEST Many agreed with him but some weren’t open to the idea. One tweep said: “The fact that homosexuality has been legalised doesn’t mean everyone is happy about it. As for me, I’m not educating my kids about such, sorry.” Some went as far as to say Lasizwe must have his own kids so he could teach them. “Make one and teach them. Whose child do you want to teach about sex at the age of seven?” “ A seven-year-old should be taught to write their name, not about how their dad might have a boyfriend down the line. No!!” But some agreed with him. “Absolutely agree with you on that. We must normalise same sex relationships, so they know that it is natural, “ was one comment. Another tweep said it was weird that heterosexual people thought teaching children about homosexuality was trying to turn them gay. “We as homosexuals have been force-fed heteronormativity all our lives. Did we complain that we’re trying to be turned straight? Y’all need to think.” SEE POST BELOW: I believe we need to start educating kids from the ages of 7 about homosexuality and make them understand about same sex love. — Lasizwe (@lasizwe) August 23, 2020 Absolutely agree with you on that.
