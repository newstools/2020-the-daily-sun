KAIZER Chiefs showed champion mentality when they came from behind to defeat Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash at Loftus Versfeld Stadium. After 61 minutes, Amakhosi were 2-0 behind and it looked like three points were far from their reach as Clinton Larsenâ€™s charges were on top of their game with goals in both halves of the game through Lesiba Nku (17 minutes) and Jabu Maluleke (61 minutes). However, Chiefs substitutions in the second half where experienced players such as Willard Katsande, Bernard Parker and Ramahwle Mphahlele were thrown in, changed the complexion of the match. The changes saw Chiefs scoring three goals which saw them winning the match in a space of six minutes. Katsande who replaced Kearyn Baccus scored the first goal for Amakhosi on the 71st minute. Anthony Akumu levelled the matters with his first goal in the PSL on the 75 minutes. On form, Samir Nurkovic who provided Katsande and Akumu with assists scored the winning goal in the 76 minutes. It should have been 4-2 to Chiefs when Lazarous Kambole found himself in a one-on-one situation with Chibwe, but his effort was cleared off the goal-line by Edgar Manaka. Chiefs were awarded a late penalty after debutant youngster Keletso Sifama was fouled in the box, but Daniel Cardoso hit the woodwork from the spot-kick and the hosts cleared their lines. The result saw Amakhosi opening the gap to six points at the top of the PSL standings as they now have 52 points, one game ahead of Downs. Mamelodi Sundowns who were frustrated by Highlands Park on Friday and played to 1-1 draw remain second with 46 points. On Monday, Sundowns will tackle Cape Town City with hopes of returning to winning ways after dropping four points in their last two games where they draw with Orlando Pirates and Highlands.
