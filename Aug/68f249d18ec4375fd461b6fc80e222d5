COPS have welcome the sentencing of two parents. A 44-year-old Mpumalanga father, who was accused of raping his own two daughters, will spend the rest of his life behind bars while the mother will spend five years for failing to report the rape incident to police after keeping it a secret The two parents were sentenced by the Carolina Regional Court in Mpumalanga on Monday. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said on Thursday the crime reportedly happened under the watch of the children’s mother and at the time, she chose to remain mum while her kids endured this barbaric. He said the incident happened in August 2017. “One of the children’s teachers became concerned after the pupil’s performance dropped. “The girl, who was 11-year-old then, told her story to the teacher and also pointed out that her nine-year-old then young sister also suffered a similar experience. The matter was immediately reported to cops and investigations were conducted,” he said Hlathi said the two girls, who are now aged 10 and 13, were taken to a place of safety by social workers. “Both parents were arrested. The father was charged with two counts of rape and the mother was charged with concealing the whole saga,” said Hlathi. Handing down the sentencing, Magistrate Ricardo Cloete said the father was supposed to protect his children against harm but instead raped them, and mother she was also supposed to have protected her kids too by reporting the matter to the police, but she opted to sweep it under the carpet. He sentenced the father to double life imprisonment and the mother got five years. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said this sentence will serve as a deterrence, especially during this time when gender-based violence has become a pandemic in the country
