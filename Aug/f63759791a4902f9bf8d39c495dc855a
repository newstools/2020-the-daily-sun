RELEGATION threatened Baroka coach Dylan Kerr is optimistic that his side will bounce back from their Nedbank Cup exit when they face AmaZulu in their Absa Premiership clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow afternoon (1pm). Kerr’s lads come into this encounter after their shock 3-0 defeat to Bloemfontein Celtic in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. “I am impressed with the attitude and the mentality of the boys at training, and it gives me confidence that we will react positively against AmaZulu,” said Kerr. “To be straight, it is not like we had a bad game against Celtic. We were killed by a red card. But now our focus is on AmaZulu and to fight for three points and move further away from the danger zone.” Defender Ananias Gebhardt was sent off in the 32nd minute and that dismissal wrecked Kerr’s game plan. He added: “We know that AmaZulu are also fighting to move from the relegation zone and we are expecting a tough game. “But my players know that we have to react from the 3-0 defeat. The real battle starts on Saturday and we will be ready to fight.” Bakgaga are 13th on the log and have the same points 23 with second bottom Usuthu. They are both left with six league games to end the season. The last time Baroka and AmaZulu clashed in a league encounter, the Durban-based side beat the Limpopo outfit 1-0 with a goal from on-form striker Bongi Ntuli. But Baroka was then led by former coach Wedson Nyirenda. Kerr and his team need to be solid at the back if they are to stop Ntuli, who has been a nightmare for defenders this season. So far, Ntuli has scored 12 league goals. The 29-year-old is only two goals behind current leading goal scorer and Orlando Pirates striker, Gabadinho Mhango. And Baroka will be without their trusted Namibian international Gebhardt at the back, after the 31-year-old was sent off against Celtic last Saturday.
