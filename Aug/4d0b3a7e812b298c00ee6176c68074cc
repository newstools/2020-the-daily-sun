MOTSEKI Sejane is a 14-year-old boy who lives with his unemployed father, Simon (46), in a one-roomed shack in Marikana, Botshabelo section L. But the poverty that makes the father and son to sleep on empty stomachs doesn’t discourage Motseki, who is very good with pencil and paper. He can also draw a person using ash and soil if he doesn’t use pencil. The boy recently made a photo of President Cyril Ramaphosa using just ash. Now he wants the president to buy the art for R150 so he can buy food for him and his father. Simon said: “I only taught him how to draw simple face that any child can make. He was only five at the time but he showed me miracles. I was shocked when I realised that he could actually draw anything that he looked at. I don’t know how he did it, but my son managed to use ash and soil to make drawings. "My son is talented and I thank God for his gift. I struggle to raise him because I’m not working. I’m a builder and it’s hard to get a job. I used to drink heavily to try and distract myself from hunger and stress, but I have since stopped. I want to give my son moral support. He has to be better than me.” Motseki, who is in grade 7, said he was happy because during the week he could go and fetch food from the school feeling scheme. “Drawing makes me happy and sometimes I forget that there’s no food at home. I’ve drawn a picture of my president, ntate Ramaphosa. I hope he sees it and buy it for only R150. I will buy some food with R100 and with R50, I’ll lay-by school shoes. People often ask me to draw them, but they don’t want to pay me. Now I’m pinning my hopes on the president.” Neighbour Mampho Sefatsa (30) said Simon is a good father to Motseki. Mampho said: “I love his work and pray that he gets recognition. He deserves better living conditions. I just hope they hang in there because good things come to those who wait.” Motseki said his favourite artist is Boz Mugabe. “I want to be one of the greatest artist when I grow up.”
