 The suspects were charged with possession of counterfeit cigarettes, liquor and contravention of the Illegal Immigration Act as well as trespassing after they were found trying to smuggle illicit goods from Mozambique to South Africa at the Kruger National Park fence on Friday.  According to Mpumalanga police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the rangers were patrolling along the fence, which separates Mzansi and Mozambique, when they spotted a group of about 20 men from the side of Mozambique entering the park. “These men started running after being instructed by the rangers to stop. Only seven of them were apprehended but the others managed to flee. "The men were found in possession of illicit cigarettes, liquor as well as skin whitening creams wrapped in black plastic bags estimated to be worth about R 78 000,” said Hlathi,  Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has praised the rangers for arresting the seven suspects and recovering illicit goods. “Their vigilance has yielded positive results as they managed to recover illicit goods as well as apprehend the suspects. We’re delighted to have such men and women who are eager to fight crime. The illicit goods were stopped before they could reach the targeted market,” said Zuma.
