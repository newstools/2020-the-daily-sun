"What has become abundantly clear is that the allegations made against Take Off are patently and provably false. The claims and statements made regarding this lawsuit indicate that the plaintiffs’ representatives have not spoken with relevant witnesses or reviewed available evidence," he said. He continued to say that Take Off is being targeted: "Take Off is renowned for his artistic talent as well as his quiet, reserved and peaceful personality." "In this instance, those known personality traits have made him a target of an obvious exploitative money grab." "As his counsel, we are well aware and well versed on the importance of civil and criminal prosecution of true sexual assaults. This is not one of those situations." This is a continuing investigation, according to TMZ, law enforcement sources confirmed to them that the LAPD is investigating Takeoff for the incident.
