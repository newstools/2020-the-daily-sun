Eventually, #Jerusalema dancechallenged between countries was created. On Friday, a group of nine Metro police from Durban joined into the Jerusalema frenzy. According to Sbonelo Mchunu from Durban Metro police, the video was taken in celebration of Women’s Month as well as in celebration of promotions for female police. “This is to ensure that we care and support them. As a result, our priority is to ensure that they get promoted and fill in the senior ranks. As it is during the promotional phase, six females were promoted into the ranks of superintendents and twelve constables were promoted into the positions of captains. It’s the first time we did this in the Durban Metro police,” he explained. Mchunu added: “On Friday, we had allowed only female police to do the roadblocks around Durban. Thereafter, there was a celebration of Woman’s Month and this is when they decided to dance and take this video. The video was taken during their break.”
