THE testimony of former Free State head of human settlements, Nthimose Mokhesi, has been postponed. Appearing on his behalf yesterday, lawyers told the Zondo Commission he wasn’t ready to give evidence after the state attorney dumped him. Van Rhyn Fouche said Mokhesi received a letter of withdrawal on 20 July. “The current team simply doesn’t have legal knowledge to assist him sufficiently,” said Fouche. He said Mokhesi is an important witness and his evidence had to be heard by the commission. There were many documents involved and the witness hadn’t seen all of them. “Mokhesi is not in a position to testify today. However, he will co-operate. He’ll testify and we’re simply seeking an indulgence for two weeks, so he can scrutinise those documents,” said Fouche. Youth: Corona kills young people not us! Mokhesi is implicated in corruption related to a 2014 tender worth R255 million to remove asbestos in the province. He allegedly received money, luxury cars and property from joint venture company, Blackhead-Diamond Hill. According to asbestos expert Jacobus Roets, who gave evidence on Tuesday, the controversial audit tender awarded to Ignatius “Igo” Mpambani and Gauteng-based businessman Edwin Sodi was overinflated. “I have actually estimated a lower cost in terms of time and resources spent,” said Roets. “It came out to between R8m and R9m. The cost is definitely less than R255m.” Earlier, commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo dismissed former Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile’s application for leave to cross-examine Des van Rooyen. “I’ve reached the conclusion that it’s not in the best interests of the function of the commission to grant Fuzile leave to cross-examine Des van Rooyen,” said Zondo.
