LOSING Gospel singer M-Siya is more than losing just a brother for Bonganjalo Maawu. "We had a very good relationship, he was more than a brother to me, he was a friend," Bonganjalo told Daily Sun at the Memorial Service. Family, friends and industry colleagues descended to Booysen, Joburg where they gathered to remember and celebrate the life and times of the Gospel legend Siyabulela Maawu, affectionately known as M-Siya. Bonganjalo said there said between them there was a 10 year age gap but they grew up like we were peers. "He would make sure that when I want something, I get it. He said they would discuss almost everything they do in their lives and would keep each other updated. "We spoke everyday, he would drive from Durban to Joburg and we would speak for about 5 hours on the phone." He added, "As we're going to bury him on Saturday, I don't know what I'm going to do or say the next day. "It's really bad." At the time of his death, M-Siya had plans to also pus his brother to be in the music industry. "He believed in me, he wanted to put me in the studio before the end of this year. "He saw potential in me and said it can become a musician. " He said he was a pastor and a businessman and Siya would believe even when things were bad. " Artist Faith Khanyile of Glory Of The Last Days said M-Siya's death is a huge loss in their industry. "I got to know him personally when he was doing a programme on Soweto TV called According to The Bible. "I got to learn that he loved God so much and was someone who had a lot of jokes." She said she loved his music and was hoping that they would. work together one day.
