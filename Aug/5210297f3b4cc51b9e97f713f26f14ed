RECORD label Paradise Africa is calling all female artists, producers and managers to enter for their new competition, Women’s Month Competition. The competition is for independent artists who want to be global stars. One of the founders of the competition, Sarah Jane “SJ” Nicholson, who has managed big names such as Zakes Bantwini, MiCasa, Moonchild Sanelly, Yemi Alade and Sauti Sol, said this is a personal competition to her. “I am a woman in the music industry and it’s hard. This is a male dominated industry and it’s difficult for a woman, hence we started this competition. We want to amplify female artists in South Africa so their music goes global,” said SJ. SJ said they are not just looking for a great singer. “We are looking for someone who’s creative. Someone who can create online traction, even if they have 10 followers, as long as they are authentic. I usually say hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard. So we are looking for a hard worker,” she said. The artists can enter for the competition by filling in a form from https://armcollectiv.com/3336-2/ and tagging Paradise Africa in their social media posts. There will be five winners. Four of the winners will win the same thing and the fifth winner gets the big prize. The four winners will get a professional team from their Berlin, San Francisco and Joburg offices to work on their music. The big winner will get a recording deal with Paradise Africa. The competition closes on Sunday, 30 August and winners will be chosen next month.
