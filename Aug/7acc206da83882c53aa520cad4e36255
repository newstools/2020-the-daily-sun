RAPPER AKA has extended a helping hand to the family of Nateniel Julies. Nateniel (16) was allegedly shot by a cop in Eldorado Park last week. AKA, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, asked people on social media to help him find Nateniel’s family because he wanted to help them financially. Ninel Musson, one of the founders of Vth Season, the label AKA is signed to, found Nateniel’s family. “I was inspired to help when I saw that AKA was looking for the family. “AKA donated a very significant amount and other people at Vth Season also donated. “AKA also shared the banking details on Twitter that people can use to donate money. “We hope other people will also donate.” Ninel said they donated money for the funeral, but hoped it would help with other things, too. “We found out the family needs help with the funeral and Nateniel has three sisters aged 10, 11 and 14,” he said. They also need help with school equipment. “We hope the money will buy everything they need.” Family spokesman, Llewelyn Fortune said the money is helping a lot. He said dealing with Nateniel’s death had been difficult. Details of his funeral haven’t been confirmed yet. ) Check out page 4 for more on Nateniel
