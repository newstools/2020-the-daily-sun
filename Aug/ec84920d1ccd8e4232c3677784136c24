A video of
a VAZ Lada 2107 crashing into Volkswagen Golf 6 GTI has surfaced on social
media. In the video,
the Russian made VAZ Lada 2107 can be seen driving in the opposite direction of
the Golf when it suddenly turns left as though it has lost control. As the VAZ
Lada 2107 lost control, the Golf GTI wasnâ€™t able to swerve swift enough to
escape the crash.
