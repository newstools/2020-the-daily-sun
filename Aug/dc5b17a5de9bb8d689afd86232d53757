 A burnt body, covered in plastic, was found dumped near the road earlier today.  It is suspected that the person was killed somewhere else, burnt and covered in plastic before being dumped next to the road.  Five women Nelisiwe Dube (22), Nosipho Gumede (27), Akhona Gumede (16), Zama Chiliza (38) and a fifth woman, who hasn’t been identified, were found dead since March this year.  Two suspects were arrested following the discovery of the decomposed bodies of the women.  KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed the discovery of the burnt body today.  “It’s still not clear whether the body is of a woman or a man. Hibberdene police are investigating a murder case,” said Naicker.
