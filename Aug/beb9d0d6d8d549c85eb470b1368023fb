 ESKOM has implemented stage 2 load-shedding from Thursday morning. The power utility
cited an increase in generation unit breakdowns as the reason for implementing
load-shedding. The load-shedding
started at 08:00 this morning and will continue until 22:00. Eskom says the delay
of the return to service of two units at Duvha and Tutuka and the breakdowns of
four units at Kriel, Tutuka, and Kendal have resulted in the need for load
shedding today. “These units removed
more than 2 000MW of capacity from the system. Eskom is working hard to return
as many of these generation units to service. “The generating plant
continues to perform at low levels of reliability, any unexpected shift such as
an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in a change in the
load-shedding stage at short notice.” The power utility
warned of a high possibility that Stage 2 load-shedding may be escalated to
Stage 3 for the evening peak. This constrained
supply situation may persist throughout the weekend.
