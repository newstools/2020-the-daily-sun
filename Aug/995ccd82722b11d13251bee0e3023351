GOSPEL superstar Dumi Mkokstad's great year got even better
last night at the SAMAs. The singer won his very first South African Music Award in
the Best Traditional Faith Music
Album for Calvary. In his acceptance speech delivered
via video,Dumi said in his nearly twenty years in the industry he was excited
to finally win the golden award. He has had a great year with
the success of his latest single Ziphozenkosi and Ungayeki Ukuthandaza from
Calvary. Another big winner who has
also had a very successful year is singer Nandi Madida whose hit song with rapper
K.O won them the Best Collaboration award. Nandi is one of the big stars
of Beyonce’s Black is King and was watched by millions across the globe this
past weekend in the musical film where she appears alongside other local stars. Many expected either gospel
star Sbu Noah or singer Ami Faku to win Best Newcomer but it was Ndabo Zulu
& Umgidi Ensemble for Queen Nandi:The African Symphony who got the
nod. The 26th edition
of the awards is the first in years to air outside of SABC 1. They will air until in
Friday on Mzansi Magic styled to accommodate the coronavirus pandemic so there
