BARCELONA goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen has the chance to advance his claim for Germany's Number One shirt when he faces Bayern Munich and their veteran shot-stopper Manuel Neuer in Friday's Champions League quarterfinal. The 34-year-old Neuer has been Germany captain since Bastian Schweinsteiger retired in 2016. However, Ter Stegen is itching to usurp him as Germany goalkeeper, but there is not much to separate the pair. "In several areas that characterise modern goalkeepers, I consider them to be equal," said Bodo Illgner, Germany's goalkeeper thirty years ago when Lothar Matthaeus lifted the World Cup at Italy 1990. The 53-year-old says the pair are similar in their "play on the line, in one-on-ones, their charisma, and even in a penalty shoot-out". Illgner believes Neuer has a more commanding presence "as a boss in his own penalty area". After years as second choice for Germany, the 28-year-old Ter Stegen, who has made 24 international appearances, finally ran out of patience last September. He caused a stir by saying he could not understand why Neuer, Germany's goalkeeper since 2010, remains undisputed first-choice under head coach Joachim Loew. Bayern's outspoken former president Uli Hoeness waded into the ensuing debate saying that Ter Stegen had "no right" to claim the position. Neuer, voted the world's best goalkeeper for four years straight until 2016, is in the twilight of his career. Now Ter Stegen has the chance to show who is the best goalkeeper on the Champions League stage. -AFP
