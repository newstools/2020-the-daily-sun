ASPIRING actress and presenter, Anastasia Matjila, wants to use her talent and skills to help other people. The 31-year-old from Cyferskuil in North West said she’s working on a TV show for people from poor backgrounds. Speaking to SunBuzz, Anastasia said: “What I basically want to do is to show people that there are many opportunities in Mzansi. “Growing up, we didn’t even know about other careers. We only knew the basic ones: lawyers, doctors and teachers. “Many people don’t know there are opportunities until you put them on the table. I want to be the middleman between people and opportunities. “I’m currently approaching different productions for this show. But things are going slow because of the virus.” Anastasia is trying out acting and refers to it as her first love. “After matric I wanted to study acting. But my parents didn’t allow me to because they didn’t see it as a career. So instead I became a paramedic. “But two years ago I joined an acting agency. So far I’ve gotten extra roles on Mzansi Magic’s The Queen. “I haven’t been on other productions yet because I know there are some people who’re doing this for the money and need to put food on the table. “So I don’t want to take away such opportunities from other people. I’m currently also going to auditions.” She said she wants to star in big productions. She said: “My next goal after getting my TV talk show is to star in big productions. “The South African movie scene is growing really well and I’d love to be part of that.”
