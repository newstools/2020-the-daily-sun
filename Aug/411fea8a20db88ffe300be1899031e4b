BONANG MATHEBA’S reality series, A Very Bonang Year, has taken her to new heights. The two-part docufilm that started at the beginning of the month has broken viewership records. According to the SABC, part 1 of her show had about 1,86 million viewers, and then part 2 broke the records by going over two million viewers on 8 August. Media personality and businesswoman Bonang told Daily Sun she hoped and prayed the show would be a success. “You dream the piece of work you put out into the world will be well received, and that your efforts don’t go unnoticed, but the response to the show has been phenomenal.” She said the show was made as only a two-part series instead of the usual 13 episodes, because they never planned on having a reality show. “We knew we wanted to create a special about the incredible year I had last year. “I wanted it to serve as a shining light to inspire those around me and for those who allowed me to dream and encourage me to keep dreaming,” she said. “The idea behind taking it to the SABC was that as I ventured internationally, I wanted to share it with as many people as possible. “SABC1 has the highest viewership in the country, so for me it was an obvious choice. And in hindsight it was the right move!” She said in the later stages of the year she will launch projects that have been brewing over the last year. “I still have a few announcements to make for Women’s Month and in the Spring/Summer season, I have projects launching with Global Citizen, Miss SA and The House of BNG,” she said. “I don’t know where I would have been without my loyal fans. I thank them for being a part of my growth and my story and always believing in me. They support the vision. They see it and believe it!”
