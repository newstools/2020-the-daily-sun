A will is a legal document that explains how you want your assets to be distributed when you pass on. Your assets are your possessions, like your home or car, or money you have saved.

This means they are divided among certain beneficiaries in certain percentages, such as 50% to your spouse and 50% to your children. This can take months, if not years, to complete.
