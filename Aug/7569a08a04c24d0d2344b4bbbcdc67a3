Officers from the Organised Crime Unit in Limpopo, assisted by detectives in Thabazimbi and security officers from the Northam Platinum Mine, arrested 14 suspected illegal mineworkers – aged between 26 and 56 – during an operation in the early hours of Friday morning. "The suspects were arrested… at about 04:00, during an intelligence-driven operation that was conducted in the Thabazimbi area following the information that was received about the illegal mining activities," said Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Officers also confiscated trucks and trailers, laden with chrome. The seized items are worth an estimated R15 million, Mojapelo said.
