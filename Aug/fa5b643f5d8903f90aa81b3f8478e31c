IT goes without saying there will be many challenges, even pitfalls, for PSL teams as they return to the field under strict lockdown regulations. But nothing can quite prepare Baroka FC coach Dylan Kerr and his players for the time they will spend holed up in hotel rooms. As per the rules of the League’s biologically safe environment (BSE), teams will have to be holed up in hotels for the duration of the matches, and only go out for training and on match-days. ”That's my difficulty understanding this camp. We can only leave the hotel when we go to training and for the games, ” Kerr told the South African Football Journalist Association. ”You can imagine the players are going to be locked up in hotel for 22 hours a day. And the only escape they've got is to go to training for two hours and another two hours for the game. ”There is a big mentality problem, being in a hotel room for so long... with no interaction. I'm told we may eat alone in the rooms and not share with the other players. ”I’m going to have to check my players’ fingers nails because they'll be scratching on that door just to get outside.” Kerr, however, added there can be no excuses. ”It is what it is, ” he added. ”We've been given the directive by the PSL. Safa has also given the green light and we are excited to finish the season. ”So wherever we play we are going to make sure we come off the field with a point, if not three points. That is the mentality we've got have.”
