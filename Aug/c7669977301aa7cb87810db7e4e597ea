BAROKA coach Dylan Kerr says their 1-1 draw against Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership match on Tuesday will lift his players spirit in their battle to avoid relegation. Bakgaga are sitting in 13th spot with two points ahead of bottom club Black Leopards on 25 points from 26 matches. The Limpopo side will now take on Chippa United at Milpark’s Bidvest Stadium on Saturday (6pm). Said Kerr: “I am happy with our performances against Pirates. We could have registered three points against them as we had a couple of opportunities. They didn’t need any motivation to raise their game on Tuesday and we were also unlucky not to get a goal from set-piece. But I am satisfied with a point.” Kerr is aware that The Chilli Boys will throw everything at them in a bid to grab their first win under the guidance of new coach Lehlohonolo Seema who joined them in July on a three-year-deal. They lost their first league game since the resumption of season 1-0 to high flying Cape Town City and that was followed by a goalless draw with Highlands Park on Tuesday. Chipppa are two points ahead of Baroka with four games still to play. “We are looking forward to a six-pointer against Chippa. Their players will be highly motivated aiming to impress their new coach and we are expecting a tough match.”
