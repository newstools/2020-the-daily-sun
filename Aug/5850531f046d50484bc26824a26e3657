Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba has officially opened the refurbished state of the art oral health building complex at the Dr CN Phathudi Hospital outside Tzaneen on Saturday. The facility will assist a great deal in the mass awareness regarding the impact of Covid-19, helping those who are infected, people working in the Covid-19 response, and those in isolation and quarantine. The MEC said they took a decision to capacitate existing facilities rather than having fields hospitals. "We are a rural province and as such we can't compare ourselves with other resourceful provinces. We are excited to see progress in expanding and capacitating our facilities that will be utilised even post Covid-19," she said. She said they will not build field hospitals in stadiums and that more other hospitals which will be refurbished have been identified across the province. "The facility is equipped with high technology equipment that our dentist and oral healthcare workers are able to use to render quality services. The hospital is now ready for any eventualities," said Ramathuba. She also provided psychological support to the healthcare workers and addressed the adverse psychological effects, resultant burn-out and the possible psychological stressors that the healthcare workers go through.
