 WITH Bidvest Wits regular goalkeepers Ricardo Goss and Brandon Peterson out due to suspension and injury respectively, Brighton Mhlongo will get a rare run when football resume on Saturday. Mhlongo has struggled for game time with the Students with Hunt preferring Goss and Petersen between the sticks.The Soweto-born goalie has played a mere two matches for Wits this season, once in the Caf Confederation Cup and once in the Absa Premiership. With Clever Boys locking horns against Mamelodi Sundowns at an empty Orlando Stadium on Saturday night (7:15pm), the player will be between the sticks. Wits coach Gavin Hunt confirmed on Thursday during the Nedbank Cup online press conference that Peterson is out injured. Goss is still serving a suspension after he was found guilty of abusing referee Masixole Bambiso during their league game against Cape Town City on January 18 alongside teammate Sameehg Doutie. The pair were ordered to serve a four-game suspension, with the other four games conditionally suspended. “Goss is out because he's still suspended, Brandon (Petersen) is out as well,” Hunt said. “But, Brighton (Mhlongo) will play on Saturday and we have obviously brought our Diski goalkeeper up, which I haven't seen much but we've put him in as well.” Hunt also revealed there’s still uncertainty in some of the players who are niggling with injuries they picked up since they started preparing for the resumption of the PSL campaign. Hunt added: Elias Pelembe hasn't come back (from Mozambique), and obviously we had quite a few players that tested positive and they just came back this week. “Thabang Monare is struggling a little bit, Gift Motupa is struggling as well, meanwhile Mxolisi Macuphu got hijacked this week, so I don't know.”
