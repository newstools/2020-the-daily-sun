BLACK Leopards midfielder Thabiso Mokoena is impressed by the style and the atmosphere the new interim coach, Morgan Shivambu and his assistant Mongezi Bobe, have brought to Lidoda Duvha. Mokoena, who has been a key player for Leopards this season, believes Leopards chairman David Thidiela made the right decision to appoint two former Leopards captains to lead the team in their fight to move away from the relegation zone. Shivambu and Bobe replaced Allan Clark, who resigned two weeks ago. They have a tough task ahead to steer Leopards, who are bottom of the Absa Premiership, away from the relegation zone with six matches remaining. The duo played together at Leopards during the 2014 season before Bobe left the Venda-based side to join Free State Stars. But Bobe, who spent five seasons at Leopards, came back after he had a tough time at Stars and this season he has been working as Lidoda Duvha’s MultiChoice Diski team coach. “Everything is good at training since Morgan and Mongezi took over,” said Mokoena. “Everyone is feeling good and confident that we will save this team from relegation. “We believe in the coaches because they both played for this team.” Mokoena had a good first round for the club run, but struggled in the second. But the 28-year-old said he is feeling fit and ready to show his best form when they host Eric Tinkler’s Maritzburg United at FNB Stadium on 16 August (3.30pm).
