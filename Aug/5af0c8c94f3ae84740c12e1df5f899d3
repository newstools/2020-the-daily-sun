MURDER has increased by 10.6% in KZN. This was revealed by KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liason Bheki Ntuli during a media briefing at Inanda cop shop in Durban, north of Durban, earlier today. The briefing comes after Police Minister Bheki Cele released the national crime statistics, and it appeared that KZN was leading. Annual crime statistics presented by Cele late last month revealed that KZN is one of the leading provinces when it comes to crime and a hub of murder, car jacking and sexual offence. The MEC said the latest murder stats in KZN is 4 859. He said the problematic areas where the murders occur are places such as Inanda, KwaMashu, Esikhaleni, Verulam and Umlazi. “Most of these crimes happen on weekends and in liquor outlets. And they are committed with guns by the youth. This shows that there are a lot of people out there with guns,” said Ntuli. He said the province also recorded the highest number of police killings. “A total of 17 police officers have been killed in KZN. Ten were killed off duty while seven were murdered on duty. The cops are mostly targeted by criminals. But there have been 26 arrest made for the police killings,” he said. He said sexual offence rose by 5.4%, and common assault is up by 5.9%. “The problematic places for these sexual offences are areas such as Inanda, Umlazi, KwaMashu and Empangeni.” However, Ntuli said crimes in the property category have decreased. He said these crimes include burglaries, theft of cars and stock theft. “We have directed that wards, local municipalities up to the district level must have their district crime fighting strategy,”said MEC Ntuli.
