The Proteas men concluded a successful team culture camp over the weekend with renewed energy and an agreed new way forward. The squad of 32 players met in Skukuza from 18 to 22 August, it included the 16 contracted members of the national team as well as the High-Performance squad. The camp was aimed at bringing together players as well as the coaching and support staff of the national and High-Performance teams to align on objectives and plot the road ahead with a new cricket season not too far from beginning. Topics under discussion included the Proteas’ team identity in their capacity as representatives of our diverse nation, the team environment as well as its performance both on and off the field. After vigorous, open and honest conversations and consultation with the guidance of the camp’s facilitators, Mahlatse Mashua and Ruan Botha, the squad arrived at a 100 per cent synergized approach. The team’s identity or DNA is built on shared values, ground rules, philosophies and belief systems, with a heavy focus on the first two mentioned. -CRICKET SA
