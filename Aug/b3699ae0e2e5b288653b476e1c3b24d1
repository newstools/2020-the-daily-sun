A 36-year-old woman died after she was flung out of a bakkie, landed on the hard road and was hit by a taxi. This happened after the bakkie she was traveling in collided with another car on Dewetsdorp Road in Mangaung on Saturday evening. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, the road was closed and the woman's body was covered with foil, waiting to be taken by government hearse. Witness Sello Marena (32) from Freedom Square said he was crossing the road when he saw the crash. Sello said: "The woman was sitting at the back of the bakkie with no canopy. The bakkie collided with a VW Polo GTI and she was flung from it. "She hit the road hard and immediately tried to stand up but the speeding minibus taxi hit her so hard that she flew again and landed on the hard surface. "It was a terrible thing to witness and we all called for ambulances. Unfortunately she was pronounced dead by the paramedics." Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said Kopanong police are investigating a case of culpable homicide. Makhele told Daily Sun: "A 36-year-old woman was flung out of a white Bantam open bakkie when it collided with a black VW Polo GTIÂ  on the Dewetsdorp Road at about 6pm. She was seated at the back of the bakkie with three other women. A Toyota Quantum drove over her as she fell in the middle of the road. She was declared dead on the scene. No other person was injured."
