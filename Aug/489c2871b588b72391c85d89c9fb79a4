HIGHLANDS Park coach, Owen Da Gama, has backed his red-hot striker Peter Shalulile to win the Lesley Manyathela Golden boot award this season. The 27-year-old has raced to 14 goals this season, level with Orlando Pirates’ Gabadinho Mhango at the top of the scorer’s charts. The Namibian has hit the ground running following the lengthy coronavirus-enforced break, scoring both of Highlands’ goals since the restart. His latest strike helped the Tembisa-outfit salvage a point against Polokwane City on Saturday as they look to solidify their berth in the top eight. Da Gama, who has consistently described Shalulile as the best striker in the country, believes he will go on to score a few more and pip Mhango to the golden boot. “I’m so happy for him, I’m really happy for him for getting his 14th goal,” said Da Gama. “I hope he gets two or three more goals just to cement that situation (golden boot) because he deserves it. “The team will keep on fighting. We live to fight another day.” Da Gama, though, is hoping that his side will get their first win in the bubble having drawn all three of their matches so far. He says they will use the seven days bye to recover and prepare for their next match, which will make a huge difference as players are feeling the heavy schedule. Highlands next face Maritzburg United at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday (1.30pm). “This a difficult time for all the teams,” said Da Gama. “As coaches, we try to refresh players and keep them as strong as possible, but at the same time, we have to win games. “The changes always affect the momentum of the team but I think we have done well, this was always going to be a difficult period for everyone. “You can see the boys are tired, it’s 14 months since we started with our pre-season so it’s important that we manage these players well. “We have played three games in eight days and it takes its toll, but at least we have a week until our next game, which is good.”
