MURDER accused Polosho Molimi’s attempt to be released on bail has been denied. He will remain in jail until his cases are being finalised. The 25-year-old man from Marite trust outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Wednesday. He intended to plead not guilty during his bail hearing after he was charged for murder, kidnapping, car hijacking and defeating the ends of justice. The court heard that he was bust in February after police found him with a stolen Toyota Tazz. The car belonged to Given Shabangu (35), who at the time was reportedly missing in January. But Molimo confessed that he got the car from co-accused Bongani Ndlovu (17), who also pointed the scene were they murdered and dumped the body of the owner before burning it with petrol. When both accused appeared in court back in February, they abandoned their bail fearing for their lives from angry residents of Marite. But Molimi was still hoping to apply for bail when the court denied it. Sad Given’s mum, Rose Mametjie (54), told Daily Sun that she was disappointed because the case is being delayed and she wants to bury her son, who has been in the government mortuary since February. “I plead with the police to release my son’s body. I know it was him who was burnt and in our culture we should have concluded the mourning period,” said Rose. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the bail application for one of the accused has been denied, and he’ll remain in custody with the other accused, who earlier abandoned his bail. “We believe that we have a strong case against both accused and the state is waiting for forensic DNA results before trial can be arranged. Both accused will appear in court again on 26 October.” Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops haven’t completed their investigation due to outstanding forensic DNA results from the lab, after the suspected deceased body was found decomposed and burnt beyond recognition.
