MOKGOMA Johannes Ledwaba wants justice taken against a group of youths who allegedly moered him over work on a school project. Chief Andries Ledwaba’s trusted right-hand man didn’t hesitate to act on Monday, when he was called to a local school to reprimand a group of youth that had come in bakkies and allegedly disrupted the school project. The 64-year-old from Ga-Ledwaba, outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo, felt lucky to have survived the violent attack after one among the kids ordered them to stop. He said: “When I arrived at PEPPS school, where renovations are continuing, the gate was locked. “As I waited for the gate to open, a group came from the cars and started assaulting me with bare fists. There were women and young men there.  Ledwaba told Daily Sun he was worried his attackers had not been bust after he opened a case at Lebowakgomo cop shop on Monday. The renovation project at the school falls on Chief Andries Ledwaba’s land, where the royal authority was approached for employment on the project. Community liaison officer Tshepo Lamola said they used a database from the royal house that always guides them to have everyone benefiting from the projects for the employment of 16 people.  “We are shocked to see people unhappy with the employment for that project because the right procedure were followed. “This clearly shows there are people who aren’t happy with the new chief Ledwaba, who is yet to be inaugurated by government. Young people are being used to disrupt any project to hurt him,” said Lamola. He said it wasn’t the first time projects were disrupted but this time, they made a mistake by beating a royal council member. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed a case of assault had been opened and investigated, but no one has been arrested.
