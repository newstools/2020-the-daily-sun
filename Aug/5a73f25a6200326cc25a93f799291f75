ARTS, Sports and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa recently found himself under fire. This comes after media personality Bonang Matheba tweeted and revealed that the minister annoys her.  Me too. Very much. https://t.co/vdSOu9lAlZ  This may be due to the cries of many artists who have publicly shared they have been struggling to access the relief fund that’s been set aside for them. Shortly after Bonang’s tweet, many joined into the conversation.

You may share them on this platform, via DM’s or email. Whichever platform you prefer,” he said. He further said that 3 000 artists were funded on the first wave of the funding. “Over 3 000 beneficiaries have been funded with R65.7 million distributed. We’re going to open a second phase of funding.” But Twitter users were not impressed that the Minister via the Twitter account seemingly only responded to well known people such as Bonang and ignored the complaints and suggestions by ordinary South Africans. Hai hai hai NathiSo many people under your post are voicing out their concerns and you didn’t even respond to any of their query. Suddenly Bonang comments and you want to hear her out ? Only citizens that matter are celebrities? Your equality treatment is disgusting. https://t.co/HpPS9oP2rN  The Sun Team has been reporting on the unhappiness of various artists who have been complaining that the state's  relief programmes did not reach them.  Why don’t you invite us also Poor South Africans, our communities have no sports facilities,No Arts and culture programs , Our kids can’t maximize their full potential but you wanna talk to people who already made it while the youth talents dies from drugs and alcohol
