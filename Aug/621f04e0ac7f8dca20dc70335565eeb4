Krugersdorp residents have been blessed with free alcohol on the day booze sales were reopened in Mzansi. This after a SAB truck collided with a mini vehicle causing
the truck to overturn in the town located west of Joburg. Onlookers and passerbys didn't hold back from taking the
opportunity to avoid queues  at the
bottle stores and save money. Today the ban on alcohol and cigarette sales has been lifted
and free booze is the best way to mark this celebration. Head of communications in Mogale City, Adrian Amod, said the
SAB truck had “jackknifed” and crashed into three  cars. “People started looting the truck, but members of our
traffic department arrived on the scene. They brought everything under control
and managed to prevent the crowd from further looting.”  Truck loaded with beer crashes: Factoria Krugersdorp. Booze frenzy starts... pic.twitter.com/5DM3KLOJ5N
