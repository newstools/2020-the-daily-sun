IF ever you needed a big boy to face up to the neighbourhood bullies, look no further than Pitso Mosimane. Not one to shy away from confrontation, the Mamelodi Sundowns coach found himself in a spot of bother when his team faced Cape Town City at Loftus on Tuesday. Mosimane found himself at odds with his City counterpart, Jan Olde Riekerink, as the storm in the teacup in the tunnel spilled over to the technical benches. It appears Riekerink took issue with Mosimane talking to one of City technical staffers, leading to come heated exchange between the head coaches. ”It’s handbags on the bench. Even in the tunnel, but it's okay. I had to stand up to the Dutch coach,” said Mosimane. It wasn't the first time Mosimane stood up against his counterpart, as seen when he scuffled with the Sundowns coach Angel Cappa at the same spot 15 years ago. Sundowns lost 3-2 to the Citizens on Tuesday, defeat which may as well have dented their league title chances.
