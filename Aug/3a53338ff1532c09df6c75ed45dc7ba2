ONCE upon a time when we felt safe picking up strays at groove, the Golf GTI guys knew that their only competition was the V-Class. With Volkswagen recently launching the latest Golf 8 GTI, which hasn’t arrived in Mzansi yet, Mercedes-Benz has upped the ante and launched the V300d resulting in more power. I doubt many will care about the small details while being transported to the Durban July but for those who care, this new derivative of the V-Class comes packed with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel engine.

The 2.0-litre four-cylinder mill produces 176kW and 500Nm of torque, and the power is transferred to the wheels by a 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission that now available for the first time with V300d. There are different modes that can be select by using the DYNAMIC SELECT switch that includes “Comfort” and “Sport” and therefore influence the gearshifting characteristics.  Alternatively, the “Manual” mode allows the driver to shift manually using the DIRECT SELECT steering wheel paddles. To get the party going, the V300d models come with the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system as standard.  The buyers will get a 10.25-inch touch-screen, smartphone integration compatible with the Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. ALSO READ: WHICH 4-5 DOES THE PUNANI LOVE MOST?
