IT was a quiet day at the office for Bidvest Wits and Maritzburg United. The two sides played out to a dull goalless draw in their Absa Premiership clash at Tuks Stadium on Monday. There wasn't much to write home about for both sides as they settled for a share of the spoils. The point, however, was enough to see Wits climb to third on the standings, albeit for the time being. SuperSport United will have an opportunity to jump back into third when they face Black Leopards on Tuesday. The Team of Choice, on the other hand, will also welcome the point as they continue to solidify their spot in the top eight. It was their second draw in as many matches after they held Sundowns 2-2 last time out. Maritzburg are still searching for their first win since the restart having lost to Lidoda Duvha 3-2 prior to their last two draws. And Wits, who came into the match in high confidence having beaten AmaZulu 2-1 in their last match, could not ride that momentum. Nevertheless, they will be eager to get back to winning ways when they face Bloemfontein Celtic at the same venue on Thursday (3.30pm) Maritzburg turn their attention to Highlands Park on Saturday (1.30pm) at Dobsonville Stadium. Meanwhile, in the other match taking place on Monday, AmaZulu and Celtic had no problems in front of goal. They played out to an entertaining 2-2 draw at Lucas Moripe Stadium. AmaZulu twice took the lead, however, they could not hold on as Celtic kept fighting back. Lehlohonolo Majoro scored for Usuthu while the second was an own goal by Celtic's Wandisile Letlabika. And for Phunya Sele Sele, Motebang Sera and Ndumiso Mabena were the scorers.
