MUSICIAN and DJ Lutendo Kungoane, popularly know as DJ Sliqe, has been appointed as head of Hip Hop/R&B at Sony Music Entertainment Africa. This means the Do Like I Do hitmaker will be responsible for discovering new talent, as well as elevating careers of already signed artists. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said: “I thank God for the opportunity. “I give my sincere appreciation to Sean Watson for entrusting me with this new responsibility.” The talented musician said his main goal is to unearth new talent. “There’s not much that’s happening in terms of developing artists in our country. “I believe that there a lot of artist out there that have a lot to offer. “So I am going to open up doors for fresh new talent,” he said. Although the DJ had taken on this new role, he said that he’ll continue making music. “I’m definitely going to continue making music. I’m dropping another album this year. “I don’t see this job as a mammoth task. I have been doing this for myself over the years for my record label, as I have an eye for new talent.” “But now it means that I’ll be doing it for someone else and I’m very excited about this opportunity because I’ll be bringing a lot of changes,” he said. Managing director of Sony Music Entertainment Africa, Sean Watson, told the SunTeam that he’s very excited about Slique joining their stable. “It’s apparent he wants to invest his time and energy in making a difference for his music community out of a role in A&R. “It’s a sign of his selfless commitment to his peers and something we’re very excited about supporting,” he said.
