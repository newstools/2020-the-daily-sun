“When I saw my child crying, I wondered what had happened. I knew something had hurt her but could not have thought it was Bob,” Those are the words of a heart broken Ronny Mabena, Bob Mabena’s uncle. The 67-year-old from Atteridgeville in Tshwane said he raised Bob after his mother had passed on. Ronny said he found out the devastating news through his daughter. “I asked her what was going on and she said that she wanted to tell me something important. “She then started crying and said that Bob had left us,” he said. He said that he was shocked and could not believe what his daughter was telling him. “I didn’t know that Bob was sick, but we are yet to find out what had happened when we go to his house,” he said. He was an obedient boy growing up and you would send him anywhere.   “He liked crying so much when he was young but don’t tell people,” he joked. He said that Bob left home  home while he was a bit young and suddenly, he was on radio. “We heard him talking on Radio Bop and we didn’t know that he had started working there. “We were shocked but very happy we even forgot that we were mad at him for leaving us and that was nice. We didn’t expect that he would become such a legend one day,” he said. Ronny said that Bob loved music with all his heart. “He used to go and DJ while he was very young. He started driving with my car while he was 16 years before he could buy his first car,” he said. He said that they are hurt. “We don’t know what to do, this is too heavy for us We are going to meet with the family and discuss what will happen,” he said.
