A READER is troubled by a dream and sangoma Nzama Maluleke is here to interpret it for him. The reader from Mamelodi, Tshwane, wrote to Daily Sun saying he sees his grandmother offering him beads, but he doesn’t accept them. He said he’s been ignoring the dream and now he’s lost his job. His lover has also walked away from him. What does the dream mean? HELP FOR SUNLANDERS! Sangoma Nzama said beads have different meanings depending on colours. “Blue talks about good things, white means light in your life, red means danger and black means there’s a dark cloud,” said the sangoma. “Sangomas and traditional healers know how to get rid of a black cloud.” He said the reader must go to a traditional healer who wears beads and consult. “The ancestors might be seeing something bad that is about to happen and they want to communicate the message to the reader. “They’re directing him to a traditional healer who’ll be able to interpret the message.” He said if the reader doesn’t go and consult soon bad things will happen. “But these are things that can be prevented if he consults. “He’s lost his job and now and his lover is also gone. “This could have been prevented. The ancestors would have told him earlier there was danger coming and they’d have told him what to do to prevent it.”
