MTHOBISI Makhunga (36) told Daily Sungetting retrenched when lockdown started was a blessing in disguise.  “Today I’m working as a male magosha and make three times more than I made working in a shop,” he said. Mthobisi said he took home R2 600 a month and the hours were bad. He started his new trade after he lied to a woman in a kasi tavern that he was a male magosha. “I wasn’t serious, but the woman seemed interested. I sold myself as a porn star. “She took my numbers and later phoned me saying she needed my services. “I desperately needed cash as I wasn’t working. I went to her place and we poked. She gave me R700!” Mthobisi said he kept thinking about the money he could make if he took the business seriously. “Two days later I got a call from another woman. She said she’d heard about me and needed to be poked. I have about 15 clients,” he said. Mthobisi said he now has enough time to do a business management course. “I stay fit for poking by eating healthily and training.” He jogs in the morning and drinks a lot of water. He said his clients were married women whose men were no longer interested in sex and single women who hadn’t been lucky in relationships. A 53-year-old woman saidshe’d been married for 30 years and her husband could go for five months without touching her. “So I use Mthobisi’s services. There are no strings attached,” she said A 49-year-old client said she just wanted someone who wouldn’t call or text and cause trouble. “All I want is to be poked well and go home to my hubby,” she said. Nomusa Nxumalo (45) said: “When I divorced three years ago I decided I won’t get in a relationship again. But I was hungry for sex. Mthobisi is just what I was looking for.”
