YESTERDAY, 13 Metro police appeared in courts around Tshwane on charges of asking bribes from motorists. The cases were postponed to 13 October for further investigation and the cops were released on bail of R1 800 each. They were bust on Friday for allegedly demanding and receiving bribes from drivers of unroadworthy vehicles and those breaking traffic rules. Tshwane Metro police spokesman Isaac Mahamba said the arrests were the result of an ongoing investigation that started two years ago to root out corruption. “The Metro police also formed part of these operations and assisted in the arrest of these members. Other organisations involved included the Hawks, the police, Road Traffic Management Corporation and national road traffic cops.” He said Metro chief of police Johanna Nkomo would issue all the accused officers with letters of intention to suspend them. “She also warned they’ll continue to work very hard to root out corrupt members,” he said. The Road Traffic Management Corporation called on the City of the Tshwane to start its disciplinary processes without delay. “A strong message needs to be sent out indicating that corruption destroys lives and it will not be tolerated within the law enforcement fraternity,” the corporation said.
