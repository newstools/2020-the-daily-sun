 THE thugs pounced on the liquor depot, assembled all the security guards and forced them to get drunk! The thugs, who had broken into Distell in Springs in Ekurhuleni on Sunday, locked the guards in a room and fed them booze and zol until they were nice and high. Captain Mavela Masondo said suspects armed with rifles and smaller guns, allegedly jumped over the fence and found four security guards at the weigh bridge. “They asked them how many guards were on duty, but they knew the guards were lying. They started looking for the others.” They finally got 11 guards, nine men and two women, and took them to a backroom where they tied them up. The suspects took the victims’ security jackets and cellphones. The suspects took one guard with the tracking unit and made him show them the clocking points, so that they could not alert the security company’s control room. Other suspects were busy outside loading liquor into trucks. The thugs eventually left the premises at about 2am. “We estimate there were between 10 and 14 suspects. “We’ll get a better picture once the guards have sobered up,” said Mavelo. There were no serious injuries and no shots were fired. The value of the liquor will be established once a stock take has been done. Anyone with information is asked to contact 08600 10111.
