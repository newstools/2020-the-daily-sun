AFTER noticing that some people were not wearing masks and didn’t maintain social distance, he became worried. Lindelani Mbonambi said he was worried because it meant that Covid-19 will spread easily.  He decided to wear a red attire, carry a whistle and make a two-metre long stick covered in a red cloth and started going around telling people to wear masks and maintain social distance.   He said as from 19 June, they’ve been going to shopping centres and in the local CBDs’ streets, encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance.  Lindelani said they targeted places such as shopping centres and where people collect their social grants.  “When we arrive we separate the people with our sticks and encourage them to wear the masks. If they don’t have masks, we give them a red card. "We don’t leave until we see that everyone is wearing masks and they’re maintaining social distancing,” he said.
