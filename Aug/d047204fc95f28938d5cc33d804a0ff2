Banyana Banyana captain Janine Van Wyk is slowly getting to grips with her new surroundings and finding her feet in Scotland. The 33-year-old recently joinedÂ Scottish champions Glasgow City FC after a lengthy spell without a club. Van Wyk was forced to part ways with Danish side Fortuna Hjorring in January due to a knee injury she suffered during Banyana's Cosafa Cup campaign last year. The injury kept her out of action for a considerable amount of time and meant she could not debut for her Danish outfit. However, after spending over four months in lockdown recovering from her injury, Van Wyk is back on the field . She has been training with her new Scottish team over the past few weeks as she looks to get back in shape. Van Wyk has admitted that getting back to action after a lengthy spell on the sidelines has not been easy. But she believes she will be ready to compete at 100% soon. "After not being able to train/play football since lockdown in Flag of South Africa (4 months), my body feels like it usually does after completing a full season, and just after x4 training sessions here in Glasgow Woozy. Working hard to recover the best i can though to be ready to compete 100% again," she wrote on social media. After not being able to train/play football since lockdown in ????
