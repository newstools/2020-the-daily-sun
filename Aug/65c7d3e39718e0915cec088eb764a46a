THE Jouberton police are said to have acted swiftly on a video circulating on social media platforms showing what looks like more than 50 patrons breaking lockdown rules at a known tavern in Jouberton on Wednesday. And just before the event, there was also a placard that was inviting party-goers to attend for free and also having a DJs line-up on it. According to North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone, subsequently a 54-year-old owner of the place was issued with a notice to appear before the Klerksdorp Magistrates Court on 28 September for contravening Regulation 14(6) read with 5(2)(b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No. 57 of 2002). “He may also elect to pay an admission of guilt fine of R2 000, payable on or before 7 September 2020,” said Mokgwabone. Police said members of the public and business owners are urged to ensure strict compliance with the general measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, as stipulated in lockdown regulations, including mandatory wearing of cloth face masks and maintaining social distancing.
