The popular Kwaito and House Music Awards, which was set to take place on Saturday, has unfortunately been postponed until further notice. Spokesman Mondli Mlauza told Daily Sun that the nominated musicians, who were looking forward to the award ceremony that celebrates and honors the kwaito and House genres in South Africa, have been dealt another blow, which has forced MKHMA organisers to postpone the 5th annual music ceremony. Founder and CEO of the awards Perfecta Malinga said the theme for this year is to celebrate women and that's why he had planned to hold the awards in August. "We will continue celebrating women, even if the event is not happening in the month of August," said Malinga. He also said he wasn't planning to host the main event online, but sadly, due to the inter-provinces ban and Sun City still being non-operational, they might take that route again, as they did with the nomination announcement that was held on 1 May. The 2020 nominees, which include the likes of Master KG, AKA, Mshoza and Lerato Kganyago were announced earlier this year. Mlauza said these awards give the power back to musicians and their fans. “Unlike other music awards, we give credit where it’s due," he said. The date of the online awards will be announced soon.
