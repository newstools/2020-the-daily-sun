T he Durban International Film Festival has announced its opening and closing films. The event will be held at the University of KZN’s Centre for Creative Arts. The festival, a unique phenomenon on the African cultural calendar, will have drive-in cinema screenings. This year’s opening film will be This Is Not A Burial, It’s A Resurrection, a film by Lemohang Mosese with the late Mary Twala in the lead role.  The festival’s head of programming, Chipo Zhou, told SunBuzz the film is a co-production between South Africa, Lesotho and Italy, which features predominantly South African actors. “This film was specifically selected to open the festival because it sheds some light on land issues in Lesotho by telling a very personal story through the journey of one woman.” The Thriller Dust, a film directed by Pieter du Plessis with actress Shana Mans in the lead role, will wrap up the festival. The film tells the story of women oppression and emancipation. It’s a contemporary look at the current global discourse on women’s rights. Zhou shared with SunBuzz that this year’s opening and closing film selections are narratives that push boundaries and open up dialogue to contemporary challenges faced in society today. “Set in two very different worlds, and centred on seemingly unconnected issues, both films tackle loss and trauma delicately and uniquely,” he said. The event will take place from 10 September to 20 September. Tickets for the virtual screenings are free and available through a booking system.
