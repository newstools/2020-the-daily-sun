'HE'S ONE OF THE LUCKIEST COACHES' - those were famous words coming from Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane referring to Kaizer Chiefs mentor Ernst Middendorp. FLASHBACK: WATCH Samir Nurkovic's @KaizerChiefs goal that angered @Masandawana coach Pitso Mosimane on 27 October 2019 when they lost 2-0, and he again threw the sentence "benefits from referees" line. @dailysunsa @SunSportSA pic.twitter.com/crMPtLi9So  It was on 27 October 2019 when Samir Nurkovic pounced to score two goals against Mamelodi Sundowns when Kaizer Chiefs won this Absa Premiership first round clash 2-0. And there was the controversy surrounding another goal where it was speculated that the goal shouldn't have been allowed as it's believed Leo Castro's hair had a touch on the ball. A livid Pitso Mosimane was completely unhappy and said Ernst Middendorp is one of the "luckiest coaches". This is when the "benefits" word gained momentum in local football. It's round two today and Nurkovic is suspended, who will shine for Chiefs, or will Sundowns finally get a chance to pay their revenge against the log leaders?
