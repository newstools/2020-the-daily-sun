FORMER AmaZulu coach Jozef Vukusic has decided to take some time off from football. Vukusic’s three-year contract was terminated by Usuthu management last week. This after he was placed on “special leave” in March for reasons management refused to divulge to the public. Now that he is no longer with the Durban based outfit, Vukusic says he will return home to Slovakia to spend more time with his family. Said Vukusic: “I will fly home on Saturday and stay with my family in Slovakia until January. I will then decide whether to come back (to South Africa) or continue working that side. I think this is the best solution because I want to spend some time with my daughter.” Vukusic joined Usuthu is September last year to replace Cavin Johnson who was shown the door following a string of poor results. The club has now appointed Ayanda Dlamini as caretaker coach alongside veteran keeper Moeneeb Josephs who assist him. The duo made their debut with flying colours guiding AmaZulu to a 1-0 win over log leaders Kaizer Chiefs in March before the season was stopped due to the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. But since the resumption of the season wheels seems to be coming off in their battle to survive relegation having drawn goalless with Baroka FC, followed by a 2-1 defeat to Bidvest Wits last Friday. Usuthu are hoping to register maximum points at the expense of rejuvenated Bloemfontein Celtic at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Monday (3.30pm). Siwelele are high in confidence having beaten Chiefs 3-1 in their last league game.
