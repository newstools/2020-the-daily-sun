She told Daily Sun the suspect had been a tenant for two months, but they’ve known him for years before he moved into their yard. “He came and asked to watch TV. We trusted him and didn’t think he’d cause any harm.” She said while they were watching TV, he asked her daughter to bring him Vaseline. “My daughter went to get it and he raped her. She cried and screamed, but no one heard her.” The mum said there was blood all over when she returned home and the man was gone. “I’ll never recover from what he did to my baby. He left a very painful mark on my heart and a permanent scar on my child’s life.” The child’s aunt shared the man’s photo on social media, asking help to find him.
