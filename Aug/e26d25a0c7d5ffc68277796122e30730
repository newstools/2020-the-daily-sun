NEIGHBOURS from D14 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane are at war over a brick wall separating their homes. On Wednesday morning, Audrey Mahlangu (50) woke up to paint her side of the wall, but she never anticipated that her 71-year-old neighbour would not be happy. She said she painted the wall orange and when she was about to finish, the angry gogo splashed white paint all over the newly-painted wall. Audrey said when she asked her why she did that, the gogo asked her why they painted the wall without her approval.  Audrey said she needed help on how to deal with her neighbour. “I don’t know why she has a problem with us painting the wall. “Maybe the paint is disturbing her things from entering our yard,” she said.  The gogo, who didn’t want to be named, disputed the claims. She said she poured white paint on the wall as she was gatvol of the disrespect from her neighbours. She said they hadn’t been on speaking terms for eight years because the neighbours decided to build the wall without talking to her. “The wall took some parts of my yard, but they are not complaining about that,” she said. The gogo accused her neighbours of being ungrateful. She said she helped them get the house. “I took them with me when news came out that we should apply for RDPs. This is the thanks I get. They want to take advantage because I’m an old woman, but I won’t have that.”
