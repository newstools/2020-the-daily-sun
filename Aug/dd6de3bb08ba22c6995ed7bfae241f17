FOUR of the 11 suspects who were bust during the deadly after tears shootout with cops at Marite Trust near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Saturday, were remanded in police custody. The suspects, aged between 25 and 35, appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court today facing charges of attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearm, ammunition and malicious damage to property. But seven were released on warning, while four were kept in jail pending their bail hearing on Monday. Their arrest came after a funeral of gang member Fence Malandule, who was shot and killed, and his friends later held an after tears party and started firing shots randomly. Police were alerted and when they arrived, a shootout between the suspects and cops ensued. Two suspects were fatally wounded while two cops and one suspect sustained injuries. A resident told Daily Sun that police weren’t shot, but they killed innocent people who had come to the funeral. “We want the suspects to be released and the cops to be arrested. As residents of Marite Trust, we want justice. “The cops cannot just come here and shoot people, just like what happened in Marikana. We’re calling on Police Minister Bheki Cele to remove his TRT cops in our area,” said the resident. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa confirmed that 11 suspects appeared in court but seven were released on warnings. “Four were remanded in custody and they will appear again on Monday for formal bail application,” she said.
