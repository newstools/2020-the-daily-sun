TWO suspected gang members were killed during a hunt for suspects at a funeral on Saturday afternoon. It happened at Marite Trust, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, after the funeral of gang member Fence Maladule. He was shot by an unknown person last Sunday. During the funeral his friends fired shots in the air. Police later arrived, leading to a shoot-out. A bystander told Daily Sun the gangsters started shooting into the air during the service. “The celebrations caught the attention of the police, who arrived to look for the suspects firing into the air. “They approached the suspects’ vehicle, and we then heard gunshots on the street. “We ran for cover and saw four people had been shot while trying to flee from police. “We heard an illegal firearm was found in the suspects’ vehicle. “Marite is a crime hotspot where gang members kill each other. “We’re happy police are working to remove these illegal firearms which make this place dangerous.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police were responding to an aftertears party when the suspects started firing shots. Two of them were killed and another was wounded. Hlathi said two cops were injured during the shoot-out and taken to hospital. “One wounded suspect was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. “Police arrested 11 suspects and recovered ammunition. “Cases of attempted murder, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, and malicious damage to property were opened.” The suspects were expected to appear in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court today.
