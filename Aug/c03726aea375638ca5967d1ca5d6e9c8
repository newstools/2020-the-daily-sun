SUNSPORT has reliably informed that Orlando Stadium will host this season’s Nedbank Cup final on 8 September. Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic will battle for the whopping R7 million cheque, two days after the completion of the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship play-offs. This final of these two will be a repeat of the Telkom Knockout final of 2012-13 that was held at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium. On that Occasion, Celtic won 1-0 in what turned out to be a controversial goal scored by Joel Mogorosi. “The final of the Nedbank Cup will be at Orlando Stadium,” said the insider. This means Orlando will be hosting a cup final this season for the second time. The venue was the host when SuperSport United defeated Highlands Park 1-0 to claim the MTN8 trophy in September last year. Under Nedbank umbrella, Orlando Stadium will be hosting this cup final for the second time. The venue was the host when the same Sundowns lost 2-0 to SuperSport in 2011-12 edition. The Tshwane giants will be gunning for their third Nedbank Cup trophy having won it in 2007-08 and 2014-15. On the other hand, Celtic will appear for the first time in this competition under Nedbank. They last won this competition when it was known as Mainstay Cup when they defeated African Wanderers 2-1 in 1985.
