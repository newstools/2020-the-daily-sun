 FORMER president Jacob Zuma is expected to appear in Durban
Magistrate Court today over child maintenance charges. This after his estranged wife Thobeka Madiba dragged him to
court and demanded that he maintain their 11-year-old daughter Nqobile Zuma
through court after their apparent fallout. Sources with Zuma Nkandla kraal said the fall was sparked by
a missing cell phoneâ€™s sim card that belongs to the former president with
sensitive information. The source said Zuma suspected Madiba that she had stolen
the card to blackmail. Independent Media reported that Madiba hasn't been in
Inkandla for more than six months after she was sent to her maternal home in
the Eastern Cape. It is a traditional custom that makoti could be sent back to
her maternal family by her husband's family to be advised on how to behave. This happens after a makoti is accused of misbehaving or has
disrespected the husband in any form. The People's Paper has spotted protocol and officials from
protection services from the presidency at the chambers of the Durban
Maintenance Court section this morning. Zuma married Madiba in 2010 to be his third wife after
Makhumalo and Mantuli.
