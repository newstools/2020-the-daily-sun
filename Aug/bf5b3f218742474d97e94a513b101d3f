THERE was dancing, singing and tears for Nomvuzo Atoli (22) at the Christian Church Foundation Ministries Church in Philippi on Saturday. About 100 people gathered to celebrate the life of Nomvuzo Atoli, who was murdered on 19 August.  Family and friends shared their experiences with the late Nomvuzo. Nokwandisa Nyalela, Nomvuzo’s aunt, said she’d passed her matric two years ago. “She wanted to work for the community. She said she wanted to be a cop. “At the time of her death she’d already signed and submitted her application.” Reverend Zama Mfihlo said what the community had to do during this time was to comfort the family. “We’ll walk with you,” said Mfihlo. He said he’d approached iLitha Labantu NGO to establish a container office in Philippi, where a social worker and pastor will be stationed. “Many bad things are happening in Browns Farm and people need counselling,” he said. Nomvuzo was a singer who represented her school, Intsebenziswano High School, in a choral competition in Gauteng three years ago. Her former school and choir mates performed during the memorial service. Her best friend, Yolanda Njova, said: “We used to go to the Methodist Church together. “Together we did all crazy things girls do. I’ve still not accepted she’s dead,” said Yolanda. “Even with all the people gathered here, it’s still hard for me to believe it.”
