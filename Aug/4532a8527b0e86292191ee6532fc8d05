LIMPOPO Spiritual Chaplaincy Health and Community Care Chaplains believe going to bed on an empty stomach remains the reason behind many orphans failing in life. And to avoid that, they took a step to feed the Mabutla family. The Chaplaincy Chaplains donated food parcels and clothes to the family from Ga-Matlala outside Polokwane yesterday. The poor family is headed by five unemployed children who lost both their parents. Chaplain Albert Masingi told the People’s Paper that their mission as Chaplains was to help families who struggle due to the absence of their parents. “We believe by doing so we will be building a better society with a great future,” he said. Masingi said the donated groceries will last the family for two months. Glenda Mabutla (27) said they were grateful for the donations, especially because they’re facing difficult times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “This really means a lot to us and we believe that it’ll indeed boost us. “This will change our lives and we pray that this should not end with us because many people are in need of such parcels.”
