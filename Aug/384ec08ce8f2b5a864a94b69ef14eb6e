While majority of the audience loved the song others were not happy with me for teaming up with a man who has been accused of GBV. [THREAD] pic.twitter.com/NFT8rrmc43  Some of you vehemently expressed the opposition and disappointment. I’m grateful that as an artist I have fans who are able to caution me when I’m wrong and this is one of the case where looking back, working with Mampintsa could have offended some of my followers.  I would like to profusely and unreservedly apologize for my lack of judgment and insensitivity. I believe that best form of apology is changed behavior and making efforts to self correct by acting.  While this action will not reverse the pain and damage caused by Gender based violence, I’ve decided to donate 50% of the proceeds of my collaboration and Mampintsa to charities and organizations that are working hard to stop the scourge of violence against women??
