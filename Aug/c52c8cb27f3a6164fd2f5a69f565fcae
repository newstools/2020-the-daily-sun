POLOKWANE City coach Clinton Larsen cannot be blamed for having butterflies in his stomach as they get ready for their third Absa Premiership since the resumption of football. They face Highland Park on Saturday home away from home at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on the back of two defeats against Kaizer Chiefs (3-2) and SuperSport United (2-0). Will they turn the corner and move away from a dangerous 16th place on the log? Only Larsen and his lads can tell. “We have been having all of the ball and none of the points, even against Chiefs it was the same thing,” bemoaned Larsen. “I must say that we totally outplayed our opponents, like we did against Chiefs but again our Achilles heel has been our defending and we just get punished for that. “But we know our mistakes, we have worked on it, we have discussed it and unfortunately we haven’t defended better. “And again, there are so many positives to take from our two defeats. I have actually enjoyed watching my team play, such is the brand of football we’ve been displaying. “As far as that is concerned, I have been very pleased. We have been playing with such confidence and you would never say this was a team at the bottom of the log. That’s something we can take moving forward.” Larsen is confident that his side will get their act together in their remaining four matches, starting against Highlands who are hoping to finish in the top eight. He wants his side to treat all their remaining matches like cup finals and leave everything on the field as their future depends on it. “There’s still a long way to go and 12 points to play for but we keep saying it, we’ve got to win the next one,” added the 49-year-old Larsen. “We are running out of game now and the next one is do-or-die. “We’ve got to go there and try to dominate them, create plenty of chances and put them under pressure.” Rise and Shine are desperate to hang on to their top flight status, and have only four matches to try and find and way out of the relegation zone.
