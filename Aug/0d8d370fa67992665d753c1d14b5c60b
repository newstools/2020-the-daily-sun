Big Zulu has released a music video for his song, Vuma Dlozi. It was released last Friday. “The actual song was released last year and it’s in my previous album. “I could have released the song and the music video at the same time, but decided otherwise. “I wanted to give the song a chance to grow.” The music video was shot and directed by Slowman and shot over three days. “I used two locations: Joburg and Bergville. I chose these locations because I wanted to blend the urban and village life. “In the song I featured Mnqobi Yazo. I worked with him because I wanted this project to be as authentic as possible. “He then developed the song and shaped it in his own way. The chorus of the song was added by him. I then asked another artist known as Gray to assist with the beat.” ALSO READ | FOCALISTIC CELEBRATES A MILESTONE! He said he added some African elements such as traditional dance. “This is done by a group known as Amagugu Ezwe or Ezika Sadam. To complete this entire project I asked another artist, Craze, to play the part of isangoma,” he said. He said the music video is for his ancestors. “This is a prayer song dedicated to my ancestors. I’m actually trying to appease them,” said Big Zulu. “It’s my way of communicating with them, but at the same time I’m thanking them for my talent and taking this far. “When I started in the industry it wasn’t easy. Attacks came from all sides, but they protected me. “In this song I’m also pleading with them to keep protecting and guiding me, to cleanse me and shine the light on me.” The video is available on digital platforms.
