ACTING Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive, Jacques Faul, could leave his interim post when his current term ends in September, according to Sport24. Faul was asked to step in to fill the chief executive void following Thabang Moroe’s suspension last December, and has helped navigate the organisation through some seriously choppy waters in the seven months in charge. He ensured that cricket survived the Covid-19 impact cancelled tours and tournaments, securing full wage payments during the period in the sport, and bringing a new tournament, 3Team Cricket, which was well received. However, Sport24 received an anonymous tip-off yesterday that Faul had resigned from his post and that staff would be informed of the fact today, with Faul to return to his role at Northerns Cricket on 15 September. But CSA president Chris Nenzani rebuffed those rumours, saying Faul’s initial secondment agreement with the company had expired at the end of last month and that there was a “month-to-month” term in place. “Jacques has not resigned,” he said. “Remember, he’s on a secondment agreement that we have with Northerns Cricket, which came to an end at the end of June. “Now he’s on a month-to-month arrangement. “Eventually his term will expire and once it has, he will return to Northerns. “As of this point, we are working on this internally. He has definitely not resigned but we are preparing for his eventual exit. “We’re hoping to make an announcement once everything is in place. I can’t confirm nor deny the 15 September date being his last day.” Faul also denied rumours of his resignation. His September departure, however, now means CSA is in a race against the clock to wrap up the disciplinary process against its suspended full-time CEO, Moroe.
