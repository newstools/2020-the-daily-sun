AMAZULU caretaker coach Ayanda Dlamini has witnessed the improvement of Black Leopards since the league restarted. Dlamini acknowledged that Leopards, under Mongezi Bobe and Morgan Shivhambu as co-coaches, looked to have springs in their steps. Leopards have won two of their three league games in a bio-bubble as they are perched on position 13 on the table with 26 points from 27 matches. The former club’s striker, whose side are yet to win since shocking Kaizer Chiefs early March before the season was suspended, has cautioned his side to be on top of their game if they want to get the better of the Limpopo side. Usuthu will clash with Lidoda Duvha at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm), where the Durban-based side knows that a win will see them leapfrog the Limpopo side in the table. “We are playing against a team that has the same problem as we are,” said Dlamini. “The change in the technical team has boosted the players’ confidence and you can see they want to work for their new coaches.” These two sides, who played to a goalless draw in the reverse fixture in Thohoyandou, are separated by just one point in the table. Usuthu are second from bottom with 25 points from 27 games while Leopards are 13 on the table with 26 points from the same number of games. “It’s a big game for both teams,” added Dlamini. “We’ll come up with the plan to win the match.” Dlamini hopes Bongi Ntuli, who has scored 12 league goals this season, will finally add to his tally as he has yet to see the net bulges since the season restarted. At the same time, Dlamini has welcomed the discovery form of Lehlohonolo Majoro, who has scored twice since the season restarted. “Majoro has come up and has scored very important goals for us,” said Dlamini. “It’s good to have that. You need strikers to score goals. I hope Bongi will soon start scoring again because he has been scoring for us the whole season.”
