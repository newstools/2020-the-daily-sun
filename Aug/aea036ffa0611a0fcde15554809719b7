BIDVEST Wits are believed to be on the verge of merging with Highlands Park to rescue the club. Highlands boss Brad Kaftel said this could be a solution and revealed that the club has not been sold. He said what has been reported in the media is incorrect and he described the article as “reckless”. This follows reports that Highlands have been sold to TS Galaxy’s boss Tim Sukazi, who was previously linked with buying Bloemfontein Celtic. “We have been talking to different parties looking for options,” said Kaftel. “We are talking to Bidvest as a merger, you know things are tough in South Africa. All companies have to look at ways to solve their financial problems as the situation was made worse by the sudden outbreak of Covid-19.” Although Kaftel denied the club has been sold to former football agent Sukazi, he revealed there’s a “huge possibility” of that happening, but everything will be concluded before the end of the week. “Have we sold the club? No, we haven’t. Could we sell the club, well it is possible,” he said. “The stories that we sold the club and the numbers mentioned are completely wrong.” The Tembisa-based club saw sponsor Jonsson Work Wear, who pays them R7 million annually, stop funding when the PSL suspended their leagues in March. The club’s bosses also saw their other backers Hatfield VW stop operating after the country went under lockdown following the outbreak of Covid-19. Kaftel added if they sell the club, they won’t get any profit from it because they are in debt. “If we do sell the club, the money we’ll get will pay off what we owe. “The full purchase price will pay off our debts. There won’t be money for shareholders, not even one rand.”
