PIERRE-EMERICK Aubameyang poked fun at his FA Cup drop blunder by tying the Community Shield down with a SEAT BELT. The Gabon striker gave his Arsenal teammates a right laugh when he dropped the FA Cup trophy after scoring in the Wembley win over Chelsea earlier this month. But after scoring the decisive penalty in Saturday’s Community Shield shootout win against Liverpool, Aubameyang took measures to ensure there would be no repeats. Posting a video to social media, the Gunners captain showed the famous trophy strapped into a seat on the team coach with a seat belt. Unable to contain his laughter, Aubameyang quipped: “Very important, the seat belt. Very important. Then I can’t drop it!” The ace deserved all the plaudits yet again at Wembley yesterday as he scored the opener against Liverpool. Takumi Minamino levelled to send the game into penalties. And after Rhian Brewster fluffed his lines from the spot, Aubameyang kept his cool to fire Mikel Arteta to his second piece of silverware since taking charge at the Emirates. Meanwhile, the forward is expected to pen a new three-year contract worth £250,000-a-week (about R5.5 million). But Aubameyang kept tight-lipped at the final whistle when asked about his long-term Arsenal future. He said: “We’re going to see these coming days. Today we get the trophy and that’s it. “We are improving. There is still work to do but I’m really happy and it’s an exciting time to be an Arsenal player.” – THE SUN
