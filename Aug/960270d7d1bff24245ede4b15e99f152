RASTA was at it again. He came very early in the morning, set up his equipment and started painting the fallen broadcast veteran Bob Mabena at his home in Centurion, Tshwane. He started painting Bob’s portrait outside the family house, near the gate as the family inside the yard was busy preparing and setting up for the funeral service. The controversial painter, whose real name is Lebani Sereje, is known for painting late celebrities and public figures. And he didn’t disappoint on Saturday, he came and paid tribute with a painting. He has painted celebrities like Hugh Masekela, HHP, Winnie Mandela, Joe Mafela, Prokid, Beyonce, Jay-Z, President Cyril Ramaphosa and many more.  He said that it was fitting for him to paint Bob Mabena. "He played a huge role in my life with his music in the 90s and jamming to his songs in Joburg,” he said. Rasta said that it is a huge loss for him. “As an artist it’s a great loss and I am honouring  him with this painting,” he said. He said his painting is on point. “I think starting to paint earlier helps. I am 100 percent if not 90 with the work I did, as you can see this is him Bob Mabena,” he said.
