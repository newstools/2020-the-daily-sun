MINISTER in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite, Nkoana-Mashabane, launched Women’s Month on Thursday. The theme is “Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights for an Equal future”. The minister said the launch provided an opportunity to guide the national conversation and programmes aimed at ending inequality and women’s empowerment initiatives. She said the department continued to focus on intersectionality as women, youth and people living with disabilities continued to suffer. “The focus will be on mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on women, women’s access to economic justice and rights and the eradication of gender-based violence and femicide.” Nkoana-Mashabane said the month also brought into focus efforts towards ending gender discrimination,violence, femicide and to advance the rights of women and girls in politics, economics, socially and culturally. The Women’s Day event would be held virtually on 9 August. “We call on change makers of all ages and genders to tackle the unfinished business of empowering women.” Minister Bheki Cele called on police to treat women with dignity and respect. “I don’t want officers to act as fashion advisers and marriage councillors. “Their job is to effect arrests and work with the prosecution to ensure those who rape, kill and abuse women are given harsh sentences and life imprisonment,” he said.
