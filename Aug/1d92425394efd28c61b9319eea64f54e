Do you know what was my favourite game when I was growing up? The bull-riding game. The game where we would take turns in riding the raging bull, not the real one of course but the one that swings you around until you fall onto the mat. The objective of the game was to stay as long as you can on the bull, and the longer you lasted the crazier the bull would be. All this in the name of fun. So this crazy game weirdly shared sentiments around sex duration. When we competed in the game, the objective was to remain on the saddle the longest and the same can be said about sex. So, how long should we last during sex? According to Healthline magazine, vaginal sex typically lasts three to seven minutes, according to a 2005 Society for Sex Therapy and Research member survey. According to the survey, vaginal sex that lasts one to two minutes is “too short.” Vaginal sex that lasts 10 to 30 minutes is considered “too long.” So, if like me right now your'e thinking a quickie is the way to go then you are definitely on the right track. So how long should vaginal sex actually last? The sex therapists surveyed say that anywhere from 7 to 13 minutes is “desirable.” Interesting, right? Now obviously different strokes for different folks apply here because the above speaks to the generic outcome of sex. The information may differ in terms of age, because as you grow older issues such as sexual arousal and stimulation become a mountain to climb. However, the gist of the matter is that riding the bull as I stated in the beginning is all about FUN. Sex is all about pleasure and should time be a factor in this? I don't think so. Quality over quantity any day.
