MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has expressed his sadness that his side were playing against Bidvest Wits for the last time before the oldest club in the PSL era will cease to exist as of next season. Wits sold its PSL status to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila boss Masala Mulaudzi and will be relocated to Venda and be renamed as TTM as of next season. Mosimane spoke glowingly of the Clever Boys after his side were given a huge scare by Gavin Hunt’s side in the Nedbank Cup semi final at Orlando Stadium yesterday. Sundowns, who eventually won the game 3-2 to reach the Ke Yona Cup final where they’ll face Bloemfontein Celtic, took the lead twice but Wits showed nerves of steel to come from behind twice to draw level and almost take the game to extra time. “It is very sad because Wits got a big history, culture, 99 years since it was formed and you don’t want to lose a team like this,” said Mosimane. Mosimane and Hunt have become top competitors since the former Moroka Swallows coach took over the head coaching role of the Students in 2013. When Sundowns lost their league title in 2016-17 season to Hunt’s side - the club’s first league title in 96 years then - Mosimane said he knew the code and would climb Kilimanjaro to get it back the following season. In the same season, Wits not only took the league title from Mosimane’s grasp, but they also blew nine times league champions away when they defeated the Tshwane giants 3-0 in the MTN8 final at Mbombela Stadium. However, the following season, as Jingles had promised, Sundowns managed to get the league title back. “You know I used to jab them. You know I used to say they have only won one major (league) trophy in 100 years just to put a humour,” he added. “But what a good team, they have won cups. Gavin Hunt is an incredible coach.”
