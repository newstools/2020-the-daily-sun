REGGAE artist Botanist, whose real name is Mohlomi Motlhaodi, is a happy man after scoring his second Sama nomination. Reggae isn’t as popular as hip hip or house, but Botanist told SunBuzz the nomination showed that Mzansi accepted it. ”Being nominated twice for the best reggae album is exciting,” said the 29-old from the Vaal. “It means that my genre, as unique as it is, is actually being recognised.” Botanist said his musical journey started when he was only eight, but he fell in love with reggae when he turned 12. “I fell in love with reggae and dancehall music. “It was a unique genre that not a lot of people tapped into. “Three years ago I signed with Maximum Stylez Records, and I haven’t looked back since then.” Botanist said his nomination validated his genre in Mzansi, and it encouraged other reggae artists to keep pushing. He said: “It obviously takes a lot of work to be in a genre that’s not commercial. I guess this means God has plans for me and my music. “I’d like to encourage other reggae artists not to give up because, in the end, hard work pays off.” “This nomination also speaks to the quality of my content, and I’ll always work hard to deliver the best.”
