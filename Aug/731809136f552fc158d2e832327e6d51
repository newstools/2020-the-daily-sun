KAIZER Chiefs leading top goalscorer Samir Nurkovic says he was disappointed by their late draw against Bidvest Wits on Wednesday night. Amakhosi were held to a 1-1 draw by The Clever Boys in a match that was played at Orlando Stadium. It was Chiefs first match since the resumption of the Absa Premiership campaign which had been suspended since March due to coronavirus. On the other hand, it was Wits second match as they played a Nedbank Cup game on the weekend. Nurkovic scored in the first half to increase his goals tally to 12 on his first season playing in the PSL. He could have doubled the lead on the second half but his efforts were denied by the crossbar. Plucky Wits who showed a never die attitude managed to get an equaliser through Alaxendar Cole as the two sides shared a point each. During his post-match interview on SuperSport TV, Nurkovic said he was not happy with the result. “My job as a striker is to score as many goals as possible to help the team because we are all fighting for the same goal (to win the league),” he said. "Me personally, I am not happy with one point, but this is football. “Sometimes you win, lose, draw. it doesn't really matter. All we have to do is focus on the next game." Chiefs remain at the top of the PSL standings with 49 points from 23 matches. They are four points ahead of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns.On Saturday they visit Polokwane City at Loftus Versfeld at 3.30pm. They will be hoping to return to winning ways as they have now played two games without a win having also lost 1-0 to AmaZulu FC in March.
