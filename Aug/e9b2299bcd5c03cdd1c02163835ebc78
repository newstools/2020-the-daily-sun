THERE are still 11 days to go, but relegation threatened Polokwane City cannot wait to face Absa Premiership giants Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on 15 August (3.30pm). Third from bottom Rise and Shine host log leaders Amakhosi in a must-win league clash for both teams. Chiefs are chasing the title which they last won in the 2014-15 season under ex-Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter. And Amakhosi coach Ernst Middendorp knows that the Soweto giants cannot afford to lose any of their eight remaining league matches, as defending champions and second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns are breathing down their necks. But City assistant coach Bernard Molekwa believes they will spoil Chiefs’ bid to lift the PSL title and boost the Limpopo-based side’s chances of survival. “We cannot afford to lose any games if we are to move away from the relegation zone,” said Molekwa. “The good thing about playing Chiefs is that the players get motivated on their own. So the players are excited and can’t wait for this game. I am impressed by the team’s attitude and positive mood at training. Everyone is working hard for coach Clinton Larsen. Every game is a final to us and we have to fight for three points, starting with Chiefs. “We are aware Chiefs are fighting for the top spot, but we are fighting for our status too, and to finish the league in a good position.” The the last time these two teams clashed in the league on 14 September last year, City beat Chiefs 1-0, with veteran midfielder Jabu Maluleke scoring the only goal of the match. Molekwa said it was a nice feeling to get three points from Amakhosi in the first round. He vowed that lighting will strike twice. Chiefs are leading the standings with 48 points, while City are on 23 points. A bit scary is fact that Larsen’s lads are only three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards, who both have six games remaining to save their PSL status.
