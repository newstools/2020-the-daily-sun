MANCHESTER United were made to pay for their profligacy in front of goal as Sevilla enjoyed another special night in the Europa League by coming from behind to reach Friday's final with a 2-1 win in Cologne. Bruno Fernandes's early penalty was cancelled out by Suso's strike for Sevilla before United wasted a host of glorious chances and were hit by a sucker punch when Luuk De Jong turned home the winner 12 minutes from time.
