Mpumalanga female law enforcement officials are urging men to respect them while they are executing their duties. They said this while conducting a Basadi road operation as part of celebrating women's month on the R40 road between Mbombela and White River on Friday. They were joined by Mpumalanga community safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala.Â A traffic officer, Tears Bekwa told Daily Sun that women are still faced with challenges in their line of duty. She said men continues to overlook and disrespect them.  "There are challenges we are experiencing especially as women from male drivers. We request that we be respected, male drivers have a tendency of disrespecting us, they sometimes become physically and it sometimes become difficult for us to handle them but we eventually do. We request that we be respected and execute our duties as we were appointed to do so. They must bare with us," she said. Meanwhile, Shabalala said gender-based-violence remains a huge challenge in the province especially in the Nkalanga region. "Cases of femicide are growing in numbers, we need women to be in the forefront and support each other. We want women to fight this fight, speak and report these cases to our police stations and not withdraw these cases. We are still experiencing such in the province especially in the region of Nkangala, we have seen more cases of violence," she said. She added that the department is taking different programmes that are going to empower women and ensure that they report such cases. "We are encouraging our women in the work place, government departments, in the law enforcement structures, communities and NGOs they must report even if they are harassed by their bosses or colleagues, they need to speak out," she said.
