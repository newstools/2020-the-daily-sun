KAIZER Chiefs striker Keletso Sifama became the latest young player to make Absa premiership debut this season. Sifama made his debut at just 17 years, 7 months, and 14 days old when he was introduced on Sunday against Polokwane City. With the few minutes in the game, his presence was felt as he earned his side a penalty, which Daniel Cardoso fluffed against the crossbar. “I was very happy to make my debut for Kaizer Chiefs,” the player was quoted by the clubs’ website. “Coach Ernst Middendorp informed me on Friday before match day that I would be in the team. “It was a moment of truth for me since I joined the Kaizer Chiefs Development Academy. I called coach Wanda Mtshali at my former development team, Kathorous Hyper Academy. "He was happy and advised me to do what I know and not panic if I get a chance to play. He also reminded me to remain calm and play my normal game if I get a run. He added: “After the game coach Shaun Bartlett congratulated me for my effort. He told me to stay focused from here on. I look forward to getting more chances in the future and will continue to work hard.” Before Sifama, the youngest player to have played a league game this season was Ally Msengi of Stellenbosch FC. Msengi made his maiden PSL appearance at the age of 18 years 2 months on 20 in March. This season has seen a lot of young players who are featured in the league.
