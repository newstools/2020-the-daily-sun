ORLANDO Pirates striker Tshegofatso Mabasa says they must utilise chances they create to end their winless run. Pirates have been going through a bad patch having failed to register a win in five league games. Although, Mabasa gave Bucs fans hope when he scored early on against Baroka FC at Emirates Park on Tuesday, it was not enough to grab maximum points as his counterpart Evidence Makgopa ensured that the game end in a stalemate. The 24-year-old is aware that working hard alone is not enough to win matches without more support of his team-mates. He was given a rare chance to start by coach Josef Zinnbauer alongside the Absa Premiership current top goalscorer Gabadinho Mhango. He went on: “I thank coach for the opportunity he gave me. I have been working very hard recently and even during the lockdown. I am honestly grateful for the opportunity that I got today. You can see the amount of work that I put on (the pitch) today. I think I helped the team somehow, but honestly we need to do better to get better results.” Mabasa, who has scored six goals so far this season will need more supply from his teammates to end the scoring crisis that started in February  in order to increase their chances of competing in the Caf Champions League. Bucs have now collected 43 points and are nine points behind log leaders Kaizer Chiefs and three behind second placed Mamelodi Sundowns. ”“We need to utilise chances that we create and score more goals definitely.”
