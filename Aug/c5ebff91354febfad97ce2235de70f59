HE always dreamt of being a lawyer, but destiny had different plans. Moses Galetshitse is now making waves in the entertainment industry. The founder of Moses and Friends from Lichtenburg said he started singing in church. “I realised I could sing at the age of 14. That’s when I started taking my music seriously. I also focused on being an artist. I worked as a solo artist for a couple of years.” Moses started his Afro jazz/pop band in 2005, made up of six members in Rustenburg. “With the group having realised five albums, we look forward to producing more music. The band allows me to live my dream of speaking to the masses through music.” Moses said they have faced many challenges getting into the industry. “We faced challenges with funding, publishing and distribution among others. But the love and passion for what we do is our source of strength.” He said Lucky Dube was his inspiration. “I look up to him. “His authenticity speaks volumes. “I developed a love for writing songs in African languages because of Lucky’s music,” said Moses. “I enjoy seeing my music reaching places I have never been to. It is always exciting when I get to perform. I just want to look back on my life and ask myself, did I live a meaningful life?” Moses said he also wanted to open a music academy to help gifted youngsters.
