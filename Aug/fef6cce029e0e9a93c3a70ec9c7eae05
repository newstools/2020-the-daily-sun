THE office of the public protector has announced that it’s focusing on Gauteng hospitals this week. Spokesman Oupa Segwale said the inspection was to see first-hand the challenges that staff and the public have over services. “Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka and a team of investigators inspected Uitenhage, Livingstone, Mthatha General and Nessie Knight hospitals in the Eastern Cape earlier this month. They found challenges which appeared to be undermining the provision of healthcare services,” said Segwale. “Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will join Gcaleka to inspect hospitals reserved, upgraded or changed to specifically treat Covid-19 patients.” He said they’d visit AngloGold Ashanti in the West Wits, Lenasia South District, Kopanong, Lillian Ngoyi, Jubilee and George Mukhari hospitals. “We’ll also visit Tembisa Hospital to see if conditions are geared towards the effective provision of services. “Through the inspection, Mkhwebane and Gcaleka, who’ll be accompanied by investigators from the Gauteng office, will examine the infrastructure that has been developed specifically for the fight against corona.” Segwale said they’d also look closely at the capacity of facilities to see if they were coping with demand for services and whether frontline workers had sufficient PPE. “In July, Gauteng leapfrogged the Western Cape as the country’s Covid-19 hot spot. “In recent weeks, the provincial government’s efforts to contain the spread of the virus have been marred by allegations of tender irregularities in respect of PPE procurement. “This is why the Gauteng office of the public protector has launched its own investigation.”
