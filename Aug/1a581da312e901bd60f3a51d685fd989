LYLE Foster might want to get some tips from Bongani Zungu as he joins Vitoria Guimaraes. Foster is leaving the French side AS Monaco for the Portuguese first division side. The 19-year-old is among the overseas-based who are making moves across European league, in search of permanent contracts, loan deals, and some for better game-time. According to reports in France, the former Orlando Pirates striker will travel to Portugal next week after the two clubs agreed on an 18 million fee for his transfer. Should he pass a medical, Foster will pen a five-year deal with Guimaraes. Zungu, who is also expected to leave the French side Amiens for Glasgow Rangers, began his overseas career with Guimaraes three years ago. He earned a move to the Ligue side, on the back of a fairly successful stint. He is on the verge of joining the Scottish Premier League side, his third European club in the coming weeks. Also in France, Lebogang Phiri is mulling over his future with a year left on his contract with Ligue 2 side Guingamp. Phiri has attracted interest from Strasbourg, Nimes as well as from the Turkish club, Trabzonpor. Meanwhile, Kamohelo Mokotjo is likely to stay in England where he has attracted interests. Mokotjo is out of contract at Championship Brentford and is currently a free agent. But reports suggest he won’t be short of suitors. Elsewhere, Percy Tau is settling in well at Belgian Pro League side Anderlecht where he will spend a season on loan from English Premiership side Brighton Albion & Hove. “RSCA has a style of football. We are made for each other. I will do everything I can to contribute to this team and guide the club back to where it belongs, to the top of Belgian football,” Tau said.
