NYANGA cops from Cape Town and their partners held an awareness campaign in Ramaphosa squatter camp this morning. Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi said they wanted to teach residents about crimes against women and children, iquor abuse, and other serious crimes. “We were encouraging them to be agents of change into their areas.” She said the kasi was a hijacking hotspot in Browns Farm. “We provided them with safety hints and would like people to be vigilant at all times when driving in the hotspots in Philippi.” Cops handed out pamphlets to motorists before walking around and speaking to residents. Zodumo Ngunze (34) said: “They can talk to residents, instead of giving them pamphlets because most people don’t like to read. There are a lot of residents who want to share their challenges and it will be better if we can all have the discussion.” Reverend Anitha Palma from Answered Prayers Foundation said these campaigns help communities a lot. “We told them if they need to speak about anything they can contact us.” She told Daily Sun their contact details were on the pamphlets. She said a lot of bad things have been happening in the kasi. Programme co-ordinator Moses Motsie Thito said they were raising awareness in the Cape Town Metro. “As Love Life, they want to reach all squatter camps and formal dwellings on GBV and health information.” Lusindiso Msindo said what cops and the organisations did was good. “Women are being killed almost every day. We need these campaigns just to remind us and also help us where to go if we need help.”
