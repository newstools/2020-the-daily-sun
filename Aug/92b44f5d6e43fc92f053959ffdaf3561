The Presidency has assured South Africa that Deputy President David 'The Cat' Mabuza is well and alive. This after rumours made rounds on social media claiming the Deputy President was dead. Matshepo Seedat, Media Liaison Officer in the Office of the Deputy President, said Deputy President Mabuza is well. "The Office of the Deputy President has received numerous calls from concerned South Africans regarding the health status of Deputy President David Mabuza. "We would like to assure South Africans that the Deputy President is at home and well," She said: She said anything contrary to this is a malicious and unfortunate rumour. This is the second time the deputy has been mistaken to have died. In 2018, the SABC News wrongly reported that deputy president David Mabuza had died after erroneously using his name instead of that of Joseph Mabuza, the Mpumalanga community safety spokesperson who died in a motorbike accident.
