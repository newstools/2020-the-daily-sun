THE residents of Du Noon in Cape Town are tired of thugs who
attack ambulances in their area. On Tuesday morning, residents in the area were awoken by
screams of an ambulance driver who was under attack and they came out it
numbers to assist him. The incident happened at about 1am on Tuesday morning after
two EMS officials were attending to a patient in Usasaza Street. According to Emergency Medical Services spokeswoman Dianne
Bessick, the two were approached by a knife-wielding man. The incident happened
after the medics had just stabilised the patient and were about to leave. “Once the patient was loaded to the ambulance, the officials
stabilised the patient and made their way to the front of the vehicle so that
they could take the patient to the nearest health facility. As the male
official approached the driver’s side, he was confronted by a male suspect who
began swearing and threatening him with a knife. The male official immediately
turned around, yelled and ran towards the passenger side of the vehicle. The
suspect then opened the driver’s door and took an unknown object from the
vehicle,” said Bessick. Residents came out in numbers to rescue the medics but when
the thug saw the crowd, he ran away. “Members of the community chased the suspect but he,
unfortunately, managed to escape. The EMS officials then proceeded to the Du
Noon Community Health Centre and the patient was taken into the facility for
treatment,” said Bessick. A woman who lives close to where the incident occurred told
Daily Sun that they were tired of robberies. “These robbers make life difficult for everyone in this
community. It’s not fair because when ambulances are attacked, next time they
won’t come to the area for emergencies. We are calling for more police patrols
in the area,” she said.
