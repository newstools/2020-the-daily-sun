PROPHET Godfrey Ngomane says he may have a solution for the coronavirus. Ngomane told Daily Sun he consulted the ancestors. “They showed me the way,” said Godfrey from Crystal Park in Benoni, Gauteng. He’s also an inyanga and a bishop at Saint Amos Apostolic Church. “I had a vision of what I must put together. I use about 15 herbs and Western products.” When his 34-year-old son was infected, Ngomane gave him the mixture. “Seven days later he tested negative.”  His nephew tested positive, and after using the mixture he also tested negative. The prophet said about 30 people in Ekurhuleni who tested positive used the remedy and tested negative after seven days. He wants to share his remedy with traditional healers and doctors. Government Sithole (53), who tested positive on 20 July, told Daily Sun the prophet’s imbiza helped. “If it wasn’t for his medicine I wouldn’t be here,” said Government. He showed the SunTeam test results before and after he took the medicine. Some of the things Ngomane uses are cayenne pepper, turmeric, black pepper, mnungumabele, msuzwana, aloe, dagga, nsukumbili, pineapple and more. Mondli Ngubane (59) said: “On my first day of using the herb I felt the difference.” After seven days he tested negative. Mzungezwa Dlamini (60) said: “I was sure I was dying. After using this mixture I tested negative.”
