GOGO Catherine Nkwana (83) told Daily Sun her electricity
bill has caused her blood to rise sky-high. According to the gogo from White City in Mamelodi East,
Tshwane the municipality said she owes them R 2 795. Catherine said she receives R 2 100 in grant money and has
been paying no more than R100 a month for utilities and sometimes it i as low
as R20. “I don’t owe anyone money. That high bill doesn’t belong to
me,” she said “I sometimes wake up at night thinking about the bill. I
need clarity from the municipality because the bill is hurting me and affecting
my weak body. This is bad for my health.” Catherine said she has no problem paying her bills but she
has never experienced such a statement before. “I will not starve to death while paying a debt which I
don’t understand,” she said. “When my children told me about the massive bill I am
expected to pay I thought it was a joke.” She said the municipality has no right to that to her
especially her being a pensioner. Catherine said she would love to continue to be a
law-abiding citizen and pay her bills. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said: “The
customer is advised to visit the nearest City of Tshwane walk-in customer care
centre where she will be assisted with any queries she has on her municipal
account.”
