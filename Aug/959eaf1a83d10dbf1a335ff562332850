THE madala, believed to be one of the oldest people in the world, is no more. Freddie Blom from Cape Town died on Saturday, aged 116. His devastated wife Jeannette (86) said she’d lost the love of her life. “I’m devastated. But on the other hand I’m glad he’s in a better place. “It hurt me a lot when he was sick because he couldn’t share the pain.” The couple were together for 51 years. Makhulu Jeannette praised her husband as someone who loved his family. “I’ll miss him a lot and his position as the head of the family. I’ll miss his love and kindness,” she said. The couple didn’t have children together. Jeannette had two of her own, who madala Freddie raised as his own. Jeannette said madala Freddie liked to work in the garden during his last days, and spent time by the fire. Senior Citizens Forum member Gadija Francis was devastated. “He used to call us his queens whenever we visited him,” said Gadija. “I went to his house on Thursday after I heard he didn’t feel well. “I saw him in his blankets and he waved at me. I didn’t know that was goodbye.” Madala had been unwell since last week. He was taken to Eerste River Hospital and then to Tygerberg Hospital. Gadija said madala was a hero when it came to the well-being of young children and the youth. “He always wanted to see children protected. He encouraged young people to be productive and respect their elders.” Madala Freddie celebrated his 116th birthday in May. When the SunTeam visited him he attributed his long life to God.
