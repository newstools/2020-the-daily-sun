THE opening of alcohol may have given racists the courage to carry out a gruesome attack on gogo Khabonina Mkhonza. That was according to Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina who paid the 64-year-old from Tsakane a visit to give her support and assistance. Gogo Mkhonza was allegedly brutally attacked by her employers' son simply for being "black" early this week. She said the young man, who she raised as her own, attacked her after consistently complaining about the alleged corruption by politicians and government officials. Masina said, "When she explained to me, it was very clear that the opening of alcohol gave them the courage to do things that they've been wanting to do over time." Masina committed to taking over gogo Mkhonza's medical and legal bills. "I want to call on law enforcement to work with us as we want to send a message about racism in South Africa because we cannot tolerate this. "Black people are a majority, this is our country. We are prepared to live with white counterparts, we can't allow individuals white continue to perpetuate such behaviour." The 28-year-old accused will appear again at the Springs Magistrates Court for bail application. Masina said, "I can't believe that it is father and son, who conspired against the old woman.Â "It is very bad, we'll make sure that we work harder to ensure that justice is served on her behalf."
