SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo says his side won’t fall into a trap set by Bloemfontein Celtic when they meet at Bidvest Stadium on Sunday (6pm). Tembo insisted that they won’t be fooled by Siwelele, who have now made financial difficulties part of their vocabulary while they continue doing well on the pitch. He told the SA Football Journalists Association (Safja) that Celtic players are high in confidence, having beaten Baroka FC 3-0 to reach the Nedbank Cup final. Said Tembo: “They have 90 minutes under their belt and are at an advantage. This (financial difficulties) is their trap for the past 10 years and have been talking about it, but they are still standing. “Celtic are going strong and reaching the Nedbank Cup final is a huge success for them. We are ready for the game. We need to take positives and ensure they outweigh the negatives.” Tembo said his charges are mentally strong for the match, having prepared during lockdown without supervision. The last time Matsatsantsa a Pitori were in action was on 8 March when they beat Highlands Park 2-0 at Makhulong Stadium. SuperSport occupy fourth spot on the table with 40 points from 24 matches, and Celtic are sitting in ninth spot on 28 points from 23 games. “The games are a bit difficult for all teams. We have had three to four months without playing. The tempo is not the same because we haven’t really played any friendlies except for 11 v 11 among ourselves. We are playing a team that is high in spirit,” Tembo said. The Zimbabwean-born mentor is expected to give more youngsters, promoted from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge, a chance to prove their worth in the remaining six games. This is part of management’s plan for the future as a result of financial strain due to Covid-19. Explained Tembo: “We will give ourselves time to build and still be expected to win.”
