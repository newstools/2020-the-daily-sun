A FAMILY has accused King Edward VIII Hospital in Durban of negligence. They’ve appealed to the KZN Department of Health to intervene. A member of the family from Umlazi, south of Durban, told Daily Sun his niece (21) was admitted to the hospital on 24 July as she had Covid-19 symptoms. “My sister died from Covid-19 in April,” said the family member (35). “So we suspected my niece might also have it. “We first took her to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in April, where she tested negative. “We took her to King Edward VIII Hospital last month when we saw she wasn’t recovering.” It was only then that she tested positive! “After a short while we got a message she was negative. We asked nurses to recheck her file and she was negative,” he said. But the hospital allegedly refused to move her from a ward for Covid-19 positive patients. “She was eventually removed on Saturday, but we aren’t happy with the way they dealt with this.” The health department did not respond to an enquiry by the time of going to print.
