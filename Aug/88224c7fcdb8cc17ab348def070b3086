HIGHLANDS Park coach Owen Da Gama has confirmed interest in one of his strikers Peter Shalulile, who is believed to be wanted by an unnamed Egyptian club. Da Gama, says there is nothing he can do if management decides to sell some of his key players, suggesting that it’s all about business. “I’m not so sure about the sale of players, nothing has been communicated to me regarding the sale of the players, nothing has been spoken to me and nobody has even mentioned anything of that kind to me,” Da Gama told the South African Football Journalists' Association (SAFJA) in a Zoom press conference on Thursday.“I just heard there was an Egyptian club that was interested in Shalulile. But apart from that, nothing has come to the fore. Nobody has ever come to me and said to me there are teams interested in this or in that player.“So, you know I can only cross that bridge when I get to that. If I’m told or the management decides if they want to sell a player there’s absolutely nothing I can do, I’m just employed like anybody else."I’ll give my pennies worth (two pennies worth) but at the end of the day if it’s a financial thing, then there’s nothing I can do about it.” Shalulile has been one of the most instrumental player in the Lions of the North setup since the club was promoted from First Division. Highlands will resume their Absa Premiership campaign with a clash against Mamelodi Sundowns on Friday at Dobsonville Stadium (6pm).
