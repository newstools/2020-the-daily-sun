Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer admits that he is "not 100 percent unhappy" with the performance of his charges after their goalless draw against Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday evening. The Buccaneers played their first match in four months at Dobsonville Stadium following the lengthy pause on football in South Africa due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Brazilians, however, seemed fatigued as it was their second match in three days after their exhilarating 3-2 win over Bidvest Wits on Saturday. Zinnbauer says Pirates' first match was enough evidence to see that it has been a while since his outfit played a competitive match. "First time, you could see it's [been] a long time since we last played but we came more and more in the game. In the first half, a 0-0 was okay. The second-half was much better, we had chances to win the game but Sundowns always had a chance," Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV. "It was a very difficult game for us, top players against us. Yes, in the end of the time we hit the post, with a little luck you win the game. "I'm not 100 percent unhappy, I'm not 100 percent [feeling] bad. We have the next game in three days, that's the focus now." The Sea Robbers also had to make do without star forward Thembinkosi Lorch and Justin Shonga as the pair breached the club's protocols before heading into the Biologically Safe Environment (BSE) as created by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) "It was a decision from us, the staff, from the coaches," he said. "We have to see the next game; we need a lot of players. You know this difficult time, after three days you have a game, we need the whole squad, so ja, all the players have a chance."
