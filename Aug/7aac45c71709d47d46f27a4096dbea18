 Residents of Eldorado Park held a candlelight ceremony to support Nateniël Julies's family. On Friday evening, hundreds of residents gathered at the scene where Nateniël was allegedly shot by the police not far from his home. "We want justice," chanted residents at the scene. The 16-year-old teenager was killed on Wednesday evening.   Nateniël, who had Down syndrome, has been described as a bubbly teenager who enjoyed laughing. A resident, Pathma Shembe said: "The police failed to protect an innocent child and killed him. We want the police station shut down or change in management," she said. Residents said they have had enough of the bad treatment they receive from the police. Earlier in the day Police Minister, Bheki Cele visited the family. The family said they were grateful of his visit and confident that justice will be served.
