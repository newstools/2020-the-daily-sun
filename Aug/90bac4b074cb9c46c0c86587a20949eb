 The government said it came up with the multi-million rand Human Settlements Project to improve proper shelter to the destitute households during the global Covid-19 pandemic. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has been criticised for personally going to Talana on Friday, accompanied by CoGHSTA MEC Basikopo Makamu, to officially handover the new low-cost housing units to the people.  Addressing the people at the event, Mathabatha said: “This is just an immediate temporary solution in a fight against Covid-19, because when we assessed the situation at this hostel, it was really not helping us as it was difficult for people to practise social distancing here. We are still going to build houses for you.  MEC Makamu said the provincial government is in a process of transforming the Talana hostel, and will be building community residential units.   But Twitter handlers responded to this multi-million rand project as a wasteful expenditure and could have been avoided by just building RDP houses for the people. EFF leader Julius Malema retweeted on the Limpopo government Twitter page, saying: “You must be ashamed of yourself Chief.” Seshego sa MajaTladi also retweeted: “You have the audacity to even lie and call those shacks a temporary shelter when your pamphlet says otherwise.” You even cut the ribbon premier. ???????? pic.twitter.com/i1N2Fkmii6  This is a joke  What a disgrace
