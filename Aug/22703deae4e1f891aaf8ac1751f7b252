THE bail hearing for murder accused Angeline Seanego has been postponed to Tuesday. Seanego made a brief appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday to hear if she would get bail. The 22-year-old was bust in June after the naked body of her 36-year-old Ugandan boyfriend, Dennis Kyazze, was found under their bed at the flat they shared in the Tshwane CBD. Seanego is facing a charge of murder. Yesterday, her bail hearing was postponed for the fourth time. Her lawyer told the magistrate she could afford R5 000 bail, but the prosecution opposed bail, saying she had no permanent home address. The investigating officer said her parents had said she couldn’t stay with them because of her violent behaviour. Dennis’ brother, Ivan Namalala, said he hoped she would not get bail. “She was always violent towards my brother. Their relationship was volatile and it’s unfortunate he died before he could flee from her,” he said. Ivan said Seanego brutally murdered his brother and he hoped there would be justice. “She must rot in jail. People like her don’t deserve to live among humans,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said Seanego was arrested after she couldn’t explain what had happened to Dennis.
