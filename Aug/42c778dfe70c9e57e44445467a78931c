BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic are not about to let their financial difficulties disadvantage them in their quest for cup glory and a top-eight league finish! Celtic are among the four teams going into the PSL's bio-bubble, along with Baroka FC, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits for the Nedbank Cup semifinals. Celtic will kick -off the proceedings with a lash against Baroka FC at 2 pm on Saturday at Orlando Stadium. In the other semifinal, Sundowns will lock horns with Wits at 7:15pm. Given that clubs are expected to stay in hotels for about a month‚ the accommodation costs may rise up to a R1m or more, an astronomical figure for financially-stricken teams such as Siwelele. Clubs have to foot the bill for their stay in the bio-bubble. However, the PSL would help those who can’t afford with an agreement that the monies will be recovered through monthly grants at a later stage. Celtic have battled to keep the wolves off their door in recent years, owing to the much-publicised financial difficulties. Siwelele, though, are not limiting their chances of success. They have taken a sufficient squad for the rigours of both the Cup and Absa Premiership, according to coach John Maduka. “As much as there are challenges, we've got enough in our squad to complete the season,” Maduka said during online Nedbank Cup Press Conference. “We are going to the bubble with enough players and thanks we have to go out to the management who tried their best to ensure that we have a big squad because games will be close to each other. Ware taking more than 30 players to the bio bubble camp." This will be Maduka's first assignment as head coach, and he is excited about it as he is looking to impress Siwelele fans. He said: "I am looking forward to this challenge. “I am very excited to be in this position. We have prepared well. We know there would be injuries, but the five substitutions that should make things a bit easier.”
