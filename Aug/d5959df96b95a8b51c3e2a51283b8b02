MORE than 300 stranded backyarders share a tent in Mfuleni, Cape Town. Community leader Luvuyo Hebe said the backyarders couldn’t afford to pay rent during lockdown. “Lockdown has brought nothing but pain. We started living here about three months ago. “We built shacks, but the city destroyed them and took our material.” Luvuyo said they rented the tent. “But the owner will take it back soon because we don’t have money anymore. “We were helped by those who got piece jobs, but lockdown is making things difficult for us.” Samson Siko (34) told Daily Sun they were afraid of the coronavirus, but didn’t have any options. “We don’t know if we have corona or not, but what other choice do we have?” said Samson.  Residents said they relieved themselves in the bushes and asked neighbours for water. “There are days when we sleep on empty stomachs,” said Samson. Thabisa Feni (38), who makes food for everyone, said there’s no social distancing. They create partitions when bathing and can’t sleep when it rains.  “All we want is for the city to allow us to build shacks here. We’ll move when corona is over,” said Thabisa. Human settlements MMC Malusi Booi said the city removed many structures to prevent illegal land occupation. “Illegal land invasions pose a serious threat,” said Booi. “The tent appears to be erected on privately owned land and the city is unable to provide services there.” He added that the city would look into the matter.
