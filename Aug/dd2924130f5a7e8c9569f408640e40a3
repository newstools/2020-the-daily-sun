GOBELA Sokalezangoma Manzini (42) has six wives and 32 kids and says it’s because of isithembu. The inyanga from Manguzi, KZN, said he couldn’t ignore his ancestral calling. On Saturday, he walked down the aisle of the local church with five different women, then the function moved to his home where the celebration continued with less than 50 close friends as required by lockdown rules.  Manzini married Philile Ngwenya (32), Nana Mlambo (34), Khethiwe Mtshali (34), Sphiwe Ngwenya (21) and Alice Mthembu (29). The sixth wife Katherine Mlambo was married in absentia as she died in 2018. Manzini told Daily Sun he’s not done yet as he will take four more wives in December. “I don’t know how many I’ll have in total,” Manzini said. “Isithembu is a calling like ukuthwasa which no one can ignore. Each wife belongs to one ancestor.”  Speaking on behalf of the wives, Philile said: “Isithembu is not a problem for women if the man is honest. We are all happy here and grateful to be called Manzini’s wives.” In February, gobela Faniyakhe Mthembu married six women on the same day and said eight more were on the way. Manzini has 32 kids. Khethiwe has four, Sphiwe has one, while the other women have three kids each. Others were born from other women out of wedlock.
