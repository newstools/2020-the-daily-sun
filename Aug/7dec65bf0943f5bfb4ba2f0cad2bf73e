LEGENDARY Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Vusi Lamola is looking forward to watching his former club playing at the Orlando Stadium when football resumes in South Africa. The Soweto giants are set to play their remaining home matches at the venue dubbed the Mecca of South African football when the 2019-20 season resume on 11 August. Lamola, who was on the books of Chiefs in the 1970s, compared Orlando Stadium with the famous All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London, England which hosts the annual Wimbledon Tennis Championships. Orlando Stadium is like Wimbledon in England,” Lamola told the club's official website. “Orlando Stadium is our home, it’s part of Kaizer Chiefs’ rich history and it holds so many great memories. "Every tennis player wants to play at Wimbledon, because of its fabulous history. The same is true for Orlando Stadium when it comes to football." Chiefs’ first league (National Professional Soccer League) title was won at Orlando Stadium in 1974, when they beat their arch-rivals Orlando Pirates 3-0 in the final match of the season. Amakhosi also won further league titles in 1977, 1979 and 1981 with Orlando Stadium as their home.Chiefs are celebrating their 50th anniversary during this year as the club was founded on 7 January 1970. Lamola added: “To revisit Orlando Stadium now in our 50th anniversary year, is special for a club like Chiefs with such a very rich history. ”The Absa Premiership leaders will resume their campaign on Wednesday, 12 August when they host Bidvest Wits at Orlando Stadium (6pm). Chiefs are leading the PSL standings with 48 points, after 22 matches. They are two points ahead of Mamelodi Sundowns who have gathered 44 points in 21 outings.
