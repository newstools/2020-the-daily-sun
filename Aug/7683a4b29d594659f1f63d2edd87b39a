THE case against a Mhala cop accused of murder has been set for trial on 2 October. The cop (46) briefly appeared in the Mhala Regional Court again today. But the matter was postponed after his lawyer was not available due to other engagement. The cop was not asked to plead to the charges of murdering Comfort Kubayi (27). Kubayi was gunned down during a raid by police at his home in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, in March 2010. The heavily armed police ransacked his house saying they were looking for stolen things, but couldn’t find anything. Instead, he was allegedly shot dead and his body was found lying in a pool of blood. Kubayi’s family was again not in court today after saying in March that they were not happy with the justice system for dragging its feet in finalising the matter. This was after a number of prosecutors and magistrates recused themselves from the matter. The cop was on a loose after the bloody killing, but was only brought to book when Kubayis engaged the highest authorities for justice to be done. The cop is still out on a warning.
