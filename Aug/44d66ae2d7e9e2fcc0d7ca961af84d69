FORMER Inkatha Freedom Party president inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi has defeated the coronavirus. Buthelezi, who is turning 92 years old next week, tested negative for Covid-19 yesterday. His brother Bhekuyise Buthelezi said in a statement that inkosi has fully recovered. He said after he completed a mandatory quarantine period, inkosi went to do a test which came back negative. “We want to thank the Almighty Lord that inkosi has fully recovered from the virus. Although he remained asymptomatic since he tested positive on 8 August, we made sure he followed all the government guidelines,” said Buthelezi. Inkosi was forced to quarantine at his KwaPhindamgene residence in Mahlabathini outside Ulundi, northern KZN, after testing positive for the coronavirus. He had contact with a positive person and was advised to go and test, which he did. His family released a statement after he tested positive. His then results raised fears because of his age. Medical experts have been warning that old people are at high risk of being killed by the virus. After a week of testing positive, the ageing leader released a video clip warning people to stop spreading rumours that he was sick, and confirmed that he was still asymptomatic and well.
