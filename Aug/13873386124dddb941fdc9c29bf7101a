FOLLOWING residents’ complaints about their cop shop, changes are expected to be made soon. Police Minister Bheki Cele yesterday visited Hibberdene Police Station in Mthwalume, southern KZN. This follows his earlier visit to discuss the discovery of five murdered women’s bodies when residents complained cops didn’t help them when they needed it, took too long to respond to calls and of the lack of police visibility. Cele promised them he would make sure they received the help they needed. He said changes would be made very soon. NOMVULA MOKONYANE LIED! The minister said a satellite station had been placed in Thuthwini and a building handed over by Umzumbe Municipality would soon be used by police to assist residents in the Qoloholo area. He said he received a report confirming that the man suspected of murdering the five women had committed suicide in his cell before appearing in court. “Investigations are continuing regarding this case.” The minister later visited three road blocks set up in the area, where cars were stopped and searched. He said they were set up on Tuesday night. “Since the road blocks began, a total of nine people have been arrested for cases such as theft, robbery and rape.” At the second road block the minister visited, a man was caught with copper and a knife in his bag. He was bust after being caught on a taxi travelling from Bizana in the Eastern Cape to Durban, KZN.
