BOXING South Africa (BSA) chief executive officer Tsholofelo Lejaka has resigned. Lejaka, who was seen by many as visionary leader to steer the sinking BSA out of the muddy waters and lead it in the right direction, called it a day without finishing his five-year term. The youthful administrator from Thaba Nchu in the Free State was brought in to the local boxing regulatory body by then Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula four years ago and left the year before end of his term. Reasons for his surprise departure are still unknown. This Boxing SA position has proved to be a hot-seat none of the previous CEO's - Mava Malla, Krish Naidoo, Dumile Mateza, Bongani Khumalo, Moffat Qithi - finished their terms.
