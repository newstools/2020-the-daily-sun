She’s my soulmate. She’s been with me through thick and thin and no matter what happens, we stick together. This is why I paid lobola for her. She’s everything I’ve ever dreamed of.” Ernest said he met Nana four years ago at a gig in KZN. “When the day ended we went our separate ways, but we met again the next day. We’ve been together since then and we’re inseparable. We do everything together,” he said. He said hosting the lobola negotiations was hard because of lockdown regulations. “We only had about 20 people invited. That included family and friends. Although we had wanted more, it didn’t matter because it was about our union.” Ernest said: “We haven’t decided on a date yet. I don’t want to rush it and make promises I can’t keep. “I want to build us a good home first and then we can focus on the wedding. The wedding will be done when we’re ready.”
