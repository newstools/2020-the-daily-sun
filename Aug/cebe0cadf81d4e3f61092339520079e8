Gavin Hunt says he will do what he can to make sure the current Bidvest Wits players are employed next season. The Clever Boys will cease to exist next season following their sale to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Massive uncertainty surrounds the future of their players, while Hunt himself will be out of a job after being told he will not be retained by the club. Speaking to the media, Hunt revealed that after speaking to new owner Masala Mulaudzi, he will do what he can to help his staff. Hunt said: "On Monday the new owners and existing came down and spoke to the players. "A lot of things were aired and a lot was spoken about and I think it pretty much came to an agreement on a few things but I think on these type of things it's got to be done individually which is the biggest concern so individual cases will be handled with the new owner and the agents and obviously take it from there; what they want to do, are they keeping them, are they selling, so I think there is a lot of uncertainty around those type of things and a lot were cleared up on Monday. "I spoke to a lot of the players, most of the players individually as well, trying to give him the best guidance because I am trying to help get them football clubs to play and make the right decisions, not just for money but to make the right decisions. That's important." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
