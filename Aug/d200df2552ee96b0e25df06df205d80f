YET another mum is mourning a murdered daughter. The last time Motekoa Mailane saw her 10-year-old daughter Moipone Khoele alive, she was arguing with her mum’s boyfriend. The 37-year-old mum from Phahameng in Bultfontein, Free State, said the boyfriend, who was not Moipone’s dad, accused the child of making him look like a bad father to her five-month-old brother. Last Tuesday was the last time she was seen alive. Her body was found on Thursday. She was tied up and had a bloody face. Motekoa said she suspected her boyfriend was responsible. “My boyfriend was accusing Moipone of roaming around with his baby asking for food. She swore back at him, so I sent her to ask our relatives for food. That was the last time I saw her,” she said. “When she didn’t come home, I was scared to call the police because I’m from Lesotho. On Wednesday, my relative called the cops and they promised to come. “They only arrived the next day after they found my daughter’s body.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed the girl’s murder and said cops had launched a manhunt for the killer. “The girl died after visiting her grandmother. Her body was found on Thursday next to the R708 at about 10am,” she said. “It is currently not clear whether she arrived at her grandmother’s house or not, but she never returned home.” Makhele said the girl was found with her hands and legs tied with wire, which appeared had been used to strangle her. She also had blood stains on her face. It was not clear whether or not she had been raped. Anyone with information about the case should contact Constable Donald Kumalo on 071 470 8303 or Sergeant Oupa Tshabalala on 083 594 7168.
