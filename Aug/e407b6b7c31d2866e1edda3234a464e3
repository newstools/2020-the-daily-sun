FOLLOWING a public outcry over the alleged personal protective equipments (PPE) corruption in the Limpopo Health Department and calls to suspend authorities involved in the procurement of PPE, Premier Stanley Mathabatha has hit back that he will not run the government with emotions, but will use brains. Mathabatha broke his silence today at Lebowakgomo Hospital, where he was handing over 49 new ambulances to the health sector. Mathabatha said currently he has no reason to act against the suspected authorities, because there is no proof delivered to him on wrongdoings regarding the procurement of PPE. “The Department of Treasury has done the investigations and it has reported that proper procedures were followed, hence we have also called the SIU to come and conduct their investigations on the PPE matter.” “I can assure you and I have no doubt that SIU will still come back with a clean report on procurement of PPE. I’m now making a public appeal that anyone suspecting that there was wrongdoing, give such information to SIU if you are unable to bring it to us,” Mathabatha said. The premier said that as a leader, he has learnt to avoid his emotions whenever he faces any challenges. “We must learn to differentiate between corruption and factionalism, because now it’s hard to deal with corruption when there is a certain group that wants to eliminate particular leaders,” said the premier.  Mathabatha was accompanied by Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba, Capricorn District Mayor John Mpe and Lepelle-Nkupi Mayor Mariam Molala when he officially handed over the new fleet. Mpe said they are grateful to the government for its effort to improve the service delivery. The health department has received 49 EMS fleet, including 14 planned patient transportation and one bus, 15 advance life support response cars, 15 intermediate ambulances and five obstetric ambulances.
