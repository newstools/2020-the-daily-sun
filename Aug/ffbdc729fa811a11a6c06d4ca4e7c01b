Following the drama between socialite Zodwa Wabantu and Vusi Ngubeni that grabbed headlines and set tongues wagging after Zodwa accused him of stealing R20 000 from her, Tweeps have started a #VusiAndZodwaReconcile, which has sparked confusion among Tweeps. Although Vusi has made it clear that he's moved on in a tweet, it seems Tweeps think they'll get back together. Read: ‘ZODWA CALLED ME A B**CH AND SHOVED ME AROUND’ Apparently there's a video on Instagram of Vusi apologising to Zodwa... The two are back together! I knew I should have minded my own business yazi. #VusiReconcileWithZodwa pic.twitter.com/GKLLl9SMeD  #VusiReconcileWithZodwa It was all a publicity stunt for Vusi's new company.
