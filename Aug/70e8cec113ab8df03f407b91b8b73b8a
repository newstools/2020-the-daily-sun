CARLING Black label Cup has been cancelled. The pre-season one day tournament which is played by kaizer Chiefs and orlando Pirates has seen fans at the forefront of innovation by giving them unprecedented control and access to the game will not be happening this year. Following the South African government’s decision to ban all public gatherings and the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak globally, Carling Black Label in conjunction with their partners convened a meeting where all parties concluded that the 2020 Carling Black Label Cup and all related activities should be cancelled.“As Carling Black Label, we share the disappointment of our Champion Fans as they will not experience the pre-season Cup which they anticipate each year," said Carling Black Label Brand Director, Arné Rust. "As we are currently experiencing the effects caused by the coronavirus outbreak, we are concerned that hosting the Carling Black Label Cup will not align with the true essence of the campaign.“However, staying true to Carling Black Label’s purpose of empowering our champion fans, the brand is planning activities that will still afford football fans an opportunity to engage with their Champion Beer in a truly novel and exciting way.Rust added: "Details will be communicated in due course."Since 2011, Carling Black Label has been at the forefront of football sponsorship through this world’s first pre-season tournament which gave football fans the opportunity to select their starting line-up. Over the years, the sponsorship has given fans more power over the game i.e selection of match-day formation, selection of captains, control over player substitutions, selection of the Man-of-the-Match and the opportunity of a lifetime – to be The Champion Coach.Over and above the Carling Black Label Cup, in 2018, Carling Black Label announced their partnership with the Premier Soccer League (PSL), taking over from Castle Lager as the Official Beer Partner.“Despite challenges surrounding contact sport, as a football-loving brand, we will work closely with our partners at Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates to seek innovative ways of bringing fans closer to the game of football. "We call on all Champion fans to be Responsible Together and to look out on our brand pages for an upcoming announcement.” Rust concluded.
