THE families have demanded justice for their brutal murders last Monday. Matshidiso Ndlovu (19), who was eight months pregnant, her boyfriend and a friend of the boyfriend were shot and burnt in Lufhereng, Soweto. Aunt Gabisile (31) said Matshidiso left home that day saying she needed to visit someone and never came back.  A man who lived in the same yard as the boyfriend where the attack happened told them he heard knocks. “This happened at about 10pm. The knocks were followed by five gunshots,” said Gabisile. The man had said he saw flames and ran outside to get help, but the attackers had fled. “There were police nearby, but by the time neighbours came to help it was too late and everyone had died.” She said the attackers wore masks and the witness couldn’t see their faces.  “We don’t know of anyone who hated Matshidiso enough to want to do this to her,” she said. Matshidiso’s mum, Lindiwe, (39) said she wanted justice. “She left behind a two-year-old baby girl. How must I explain her mother’s death to her?” Gogo Elizabeth Kaoa (77) described Matshidiso as a shy, respectful person. “My heart is broken and I pray the police find the perpetrators.” Gift Mkhwanazi (45), father to Matshidiso’s lover Njabulo (28), won’t rest until the killers are found. Njabulo left behind a four-month-old baby and six-year-old child. “He didn’t have beef with anyone. I won’t stop digging.” Njabulo was buried on Saturday in the Free State. Matshadiso’s family is planning her funeral. The friend hasn’t been identified. Captain Mavela Masondo said murder and arson cases were opened.
