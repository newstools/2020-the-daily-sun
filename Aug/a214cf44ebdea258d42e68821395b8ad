 PAPA PENNY has added his angry voice to the people who’re demanding that President Cyril Ramaphosa act on corruption.I n a short video, he made his feelings clear for all the nation to see and didn’t hold back as he fingered the Limpopo premier. “MATHABATHA MUST F**K **F!” HE SAID. In a three-minute video, musician Eric “Papa Penny” Nkovani called for the removal of ANC leaders implicated in Covid-19 corruption. He lashed out: “People who have money don’t care about the community. They have money only for their girlfriends and families.” He called out Human Settlements MEC Basikopo Makamu. A video showing Mathabatha and Makamu unveiling 40 shacks valued at R2,4 million has been widely condemned. In his video, Papa Penny said: “Look what’s happening today in Limpopo. I told the people of Limpopo the premier is out of order. “How can people build shacks, today? We’ve never seen any advertisement for any tender. Someone doesn’t have fear for or any shame about Covid-19.” He said he’d given more than 20 000 people food parcels without any tender from government. “President Ramaphosa, remove Stan Mathabatha today and MEC Basikopo Makamu. They must f**k **f. They must be deleted,” he said. Mathabatha said concerns raised regarding costs and type of units could best be addressed and responded to by counterparts at national level, in particular the Department of Human Settlements. He said the province prioritised Talana Hostel as one of the squatter camps where the density of the population had to be reduced to adhere to social distancing regulations. He said the hostel was overcrowded because of the need for affordable accommodation close to Tzaneen. And informal structures were built around it. Talana had been submitted to the Housing Development Agency for the establishment of residential areas as mandated by the national department. He acknowledged that reference to a multimillion-rand project in the statement, before their visit to Talana, had contributed to some of the concerns. He said he’d repeat what he’d said to the media at Talana. “This I’ll repeat on any platform,” he said. “I said it in not so many words that Covid-19 hasn’t given us an opportunity to pillage the public coffers. “Any person found to have stolen funds meant for saving the lives of our people will be dealt with.”
