Deputy Minister of Sports, Nocawe Mafu, said law enforcement must do their job in the case of Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung who allegedly broke the lockdown regulations. Motaung allegedly broke the lockdown rules when he was seen partying along with his friends in a private house. It was not clear whether it was his house or not. While alcohol is prohibited and is not allowed to be sold during this period of national lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, alcohol, including champagne, were seen on the table at the house party. Nocawe, speaking at Relief Fund media briefing in Pretoria on Monday, said, whatever position you hold, no one should be exempt from the law. “If you break the law, whether you are Bobby or whoever, the law must take its course. It is now an issue of law enforcement,” Mafu said. Lockdown is for poor people. Bo Bobby ba bethile di party. pic.twitter.com/vbOye9bbjU
