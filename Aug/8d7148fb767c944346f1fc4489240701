GUARDS from a security company owned by Chippa United Football Club chairman Chippa Mpengesi, allegedly haven’t been paid for three months. More than 40 of the guards occupied the company’s Cape Town offices, demanding their money. They told Daily Sun they have been struggling to look after their families. They said Mpengesi has been silent despite all their efforts. “We have been in this office since last Thursday. We cannot pay rent because the company has not paid us since May. Our children are suffering hence we are here demanding our money,” said Siphokazi Ntshakaza. Thobile Mbiko said: “I can’t even cater for my family’s basic needs, which makes me a failure. It takes away my dignity as the head of the house. We are demanding our money!” There was no social distancing while the group slept at the office, but they said they did everything to ensure they didn’t get infected with Covid-19. Another security guard said: “We’re aware of the virus and will do our best to stay safe. What we can’t do is leave this place without our money.” Chippa Security manager Themba Yawa said the company was going through tough times after it did not get money from a certain company for which they render services. “We are litigating against the company because invoices were not paid. Employees will be paid as soon as we get paid. The workers are fully informed about these developments, but at this point, the matter is sub judice and we will not comment further,” said Yawa.
