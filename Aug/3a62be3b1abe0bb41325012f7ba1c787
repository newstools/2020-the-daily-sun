HIGHLANDS Park coach Owen da Gama says his players are still trying to get used to an unfamiliar bio bubble in Gauteng where they are based for the remainder of PSL season. Da Gama revealed via a South African Football Journalists Association Zoom meeting that it’s not easy for players not to interact with each other in the bubble. Highlands host Mamelodi Sundowns in an Absa Premiership match at Dobsonville Stadium, Soweto on Friday (6pm). Said Da Gama: “The bubble is strange because there is no freedom. Even when players are bored they can’t cross over to others rooms. They must stay in their rooms, even snacks are brought in there. We are allowed to have dinner together, but there is social distancing required. Some players are friends, even though they can’t share a room, they are taking this well. They are professionals and need to follow protocols.  They need to do is because it’s their job and have to do their best on the pitch.” Da Gama says his players kills time by watching movies in their hotel rooms. “I have encouraged players to take laptops so that they can watch movies. We normally have conference call and help individual improve their games. It helps to buy time and keep each other motivated.”
