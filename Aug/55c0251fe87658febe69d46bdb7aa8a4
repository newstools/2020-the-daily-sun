STELLENBOSCH FC have suffered a big blow as midfielder Mpho Matsi has been ruled out for the remainder of PSL season due to a knee injury. According to Stellies coach Steve Barker, Matsi, whom he also worked with at University of Pretoria when they won the National First Division title in 2011-12 season, tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) few days ago. It’s not clear whether he sustained the injury when Stellies beat Golden Arrows 1-0 at Tuks Stadium on Saturday where he came on in the 88th minute to replace Granwald Scott. “Mpho Matsi picked up a serious ACL injury two days ago,” said Barker. “Unfortunately, he won’t be available for the rest of this bubble.” The 30-year-old, who has also played for Cape Town City, whom Stellies will meet at Orlando Stadium on Thursday (6pm), had featured in 19 games in all competitions. Matsi joined the club at the beginning of the season after he was released by The Citizens. This came after City loaned him in the second half of last season to Maritzburg United.
