A MAN who was accused of stabbing his girlfriend to death has been sentenced to life in prison.Bheki Mkhwethane (34) from Wesselton pleaded not guilty when he appeared before acting Judge Takalani Ratshibvumo in the Mpumalanga High Court, Breyten, on Friday. The court heard that the accused allegedly stabbed his girlfriend Phumzile Mazibuko (41) in 2016 with a knife in the chest and she died on the scene. It happened during an argument between the couple after the boyfriend was served with a protection order. He fled the scene after stabbing her, but was later bust at his hideout in January 2016. State prosecutor Advocate Ashwin Poodhun told the court that the deceased’s sisters, who gave the evidence that she found Mkhwethane pulling the knife from the dead woman’s chest on the day of the incident and the accused’s brother, had assisted cops to find the accused at his hideout. “Post mortem report confirmed that the victim died of stab wounds and had a protection order. We plea that he be convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment,” said Poodhum. Acting Judge Ratshibvumo said the boyfriend was mindful of the fact that the complainant had initially approached the court to be protected from him, but this did not stop him from stabbing her. “Women in this country have a legitimate claim to walk peacefully on the streets to enjoy their shopping and entertainment, to go and come back from work, and to enjoy the peace of their homes without fear and insecurity which constantly diminishes the quality of their lives. But you violated her right and as such you’re sentenced to life imprisonment,” said Ratshibvumo.
