MAKIE is relieved that the shack fire that ate all her belongings didn’t kill her two kids and three grandchildren, who were inside at the time of the incident. Her five roomed shack burnt into ashes on Wednesday morning at Transist Camp in Extension 18, Mamelodi East, Tshwane. The sad woman said she was at work in Boardwalk Manor, east Tshwane, when it happened. Makie Noko (54) said her two sons, aged 19 and 15, suffered burn wounds and were admitted to hospital. She said she doesn’t know what caused the fire, even though she suspects that the little kids might have lit a candle while her two sons were still asleep. “I’m powerless and don’t know where to touch. The fire made me weak. “This is painful, especially to lose everything that I have worked so hard for,” she said Makie said she was relieved that no one died in the shack, even though she lost everything, including her title deed. She said this will remain in her mind for many years.  “Look, everything is in ashes. We are left with nothing. Now I have to start all over again,” she said Makie said with lockdown, her life will be difficult. She said she lost R2 000 in cash, clothes, furniture, grocery worth about R1 500, birth certificates, ID, fridge and many other things in the fire. Makie said that she needs any kind of help because they don’t have a shack, clothes, food and the kids’ school uniform. Community leader and neighbour Thembi Lubisi (41) said what happened to Makie is painful. “This is the result of living in the shacks because if it was an RDP house, this might have been avoided,” she said. Thembi said that they tried their best to kill the fire, but it was too strong. Thembi is appealing to people to help the family. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Deputy Chief Charles Mabaso said: “Unfortunately, there was no case of reported incident of a shack that burnt in Mamelodi on Wednesday.”
