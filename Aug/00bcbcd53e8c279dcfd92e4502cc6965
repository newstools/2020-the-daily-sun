MAMELODI Sundowns missed out on an opportunity of closing gap to one point at the top of Absa Premiership standings when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Highlands Park at Dobsonville Stadium. The Brazilians went into this game with hopes of collecting maximum points to close the chasm between them and log leaders Kaizer Chiefs, but they were left frustrated by Highlands who were playing their first match since the season resumed. On the other hand, Sundowns who were playing their third match were expected to do much better than they did. This was Sundowns second draw in a row after they were held to a goalless draw by Orlando Pirates on Tuesday evening. Peter Shalulile was the first to find the back of the net for the Lions of The North on the 6th minute of the match. However, the recovered toward the end of the first round when Siphelele Mkhulise found an equaliser. Mkhulise powered a header past Tapuwa Kapini into the back of the net after Gaston Sirino's pin-point cross into the danger area. Downs very nearly claimed the lead with three minutes remaining in the half but the chance came to nothing as Kapini did well to get down low to deny another Nascimento header.Sundowns made three changes, as they were boosted by the return of Gaston Sirino from suspension alongside Tebogo Langerman and Sibusiso Vilakazi, who were both recalled. With Downs failing to secure three points, Mosimane's team will turn their attention to the next match against Cape Town City on Monday (6 pm) at Loftus Versveld. Despite a renewed push from both sides in the final stretch of the match, the legs just weren't there as they were forced to settle for a share of the points. Downs remain second in the log standings with 46 points after 23 games. They are three points adrift of leaders Kaizer Chiefs who will be hoping to extend the lead when they visit Polokwane City on Saturday.
