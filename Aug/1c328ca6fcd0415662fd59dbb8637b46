Her trainer and manager Colin “Nomakanjani” Nathan said he is happy with the move, and it will launch Wolmarans’ international boxing career. “I’m very excited with this move,” said Nathan. “MTK Global has talented female boxer Natasha Jonas from the UK, and she has done wonders for the company. “I think it is a great acquisition for MTK Global to have Wolmarans on their books. “The success of female boxing is growing globally. I just felt that the timing is right for her to move. “I don’t think enough has been done in South Africa and African continent with women boxing.” Nathan, who is also heading MTK Africa division, said bringing the female sensation to the group was a natural transition. “Bringing Hedda to the company was a natural transition for me. “The world is now an oyster for her. We obviously need to move her internationally now. She has cleaned up the local market and I’m really excited about the move for her boxing career.” Nathan, the Boxing South Africa (BSA) Trainer of the Year, said he is looking to signing more local and African boxing talent as he grows MTK Africa. The hard-hitting Wolmarans has joined local fighters such Lerato Dlamini, Hekkie Budler and Moruti Mthalane, who are part of MTK Global. The national female champion is unbeaten out five outings and it remains to be seen how she will fare globally.
