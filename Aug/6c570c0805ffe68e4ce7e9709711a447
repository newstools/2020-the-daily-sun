Major League DJz have a new amapiano album out, Pianochella. This is a new high for twin bothers Bandile and Banele Mbere. The duo first gained prominence in 2006 by hosting concert after-parties for prominent musicians such as 50 Cent, Akon and Fat Joe. Bandile told SunBuzz: “Pianochella is a beautifully produced dance album that speaks to Africa. “Since we’re moving into the dance scene, we’ve decided to make an album that represents where we are as Africans and what we represent.” Bandile said the name of the album, Pianochella, is a combination of the music genre they’re tapping into and their love of hosting festivals. They’re inspired by Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The 29-year-old DJs said working on the album was amazing and that they worked with up-and-coming artists. “We recorded the album before the pandemic broke out. Lockdown didn’t affect us that much,” said Banele. “We enjoyed making this album. It was amazing. “Working with different artists is so inspiring because everyone works differently, so it’s a different experience on its own. “With this album we hope we can be seen differently as dance music DJs. “We’re basically building a brand from scratch. Although it has not been easy, we’re willing to put in the work.” The talented duo said starting their own record label, Major League Music, was the best decision they ever made. “Managing artists isn’t the easiest thing to do, especially if you’re an artist yourself, as we’re in a competitive space. “But it’s not been all that bad. We have also learnt a lot about the business side of the music, and we’re also glad that through the label we’re giving other artists a platform to grow themselves and their careers,” said Banele. Pianochella is available on all digital platforms.
