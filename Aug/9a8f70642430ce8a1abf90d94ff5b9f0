THE Absa Premiership resumed last week and it has been a tepid comeback with teams lacking that killer instinct. Nearly 15 matches, before Orlando Pirates v Baroka FC clash, which took place at Ellis Park Stadium, there has been only three entertaining, emphatic victories. The likes of Kaizer Chiefs, Black Leopards and Cape Town City defeating Polokwane City, Maritzburg United and Mamelodi Sundowns respectively with the same 3-2 scoreline has been the stand-out matches. On Tuesday afternoon, two matches between Bidvest Wits and Golden Arrows, as well as Chippa United, who hosted Highlands Park at Orlando Stadium, ended in dull goalless draws. Wits hosted Arrows at FNB Stadium. They shared the spoils as none of them found the back of the net in 90 minutes. Both Wits and Arrows remain win-less since the football resumed after 100 days break due to the coronavirus. Both sides created chances in a match-up that would have been considered flat in other circumstances. But with players still trying to get their level best in terms of fitness after five months of being inactive, the match could be regarded as a fairly competitive encounter. Wits were the better side, creating couple of scoring chances with Mxolisi Macuphu hitting the post on two occasions, but could not find the back of the net. In the second half, there was nothing much to write home about. Both coaches made their changes but none of them was able to break the deadlock. Wits remain fifth-placed on the log with 41 points from 24 matches, while Steve Komphela’s Arrows are out of the top eight, as they sit in position nine with 33 points.
