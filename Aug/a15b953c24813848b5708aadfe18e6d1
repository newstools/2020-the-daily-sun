REALITY TV star and comedian Lasizwe Dambuza has been left shattered by recent homophobic comments made to him by some Zimbabweans. This came after Lasizwe tweeted in support of Zimbabwean people. Shortly after he wrote, “I stand in solidarity with Zimbabwe,” a number of people responded that they didn’t need support from gay people. One user wrote: “Unfortunately, we don’t stand with gays.” Another one said: “No gays please. We are Christians.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Lasizwe said: “The homophobia that I got from my fellow African brothers and sisters really broke my heart because at the end of the day, we are all Africans. I did not mean anything bad when I tweeted that I stand with Zimbabwe. They are our brothers and sisters, and we need to support them in such situations like these ones.” Lasizwe said people needed to be educate about homosexuality. “We still have a long way to go as Africans. Many people are misinformed about homosexuality. It’s about time we start teaching them that it’s not what they think it is. But while educating them, we need to fight for gay rights because we all need to be driven in unity,” he said. The youngster, who just made a comeback with a third season of his MTV reality show, said South Africans were more welcoming to gay community. “Because of the laws that governs us in South Africa, the community has rights. South Africans have learnt to understand and embrace us as gays and lesbians.”
