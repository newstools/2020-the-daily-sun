GAUTENG MEC Mbali Hlophe has come under the spotlight for what appears to be an attempt to implicate her in a PPE supply tender worth millions. Allegations circulating on Twitter claimed Hlophe, MEC for sport, arts, culture and recreation, had been a director of a company that won a tender. The allegations were supposedly supported by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission through documents which indicated Mbali’s details. The claims state she resigned a few days before a tender was awarded, questioning if she had something to hide. Hlophe has since condemned the claim, calling it fake. On Tuesday, she opened cases of fraud, defamation of character, and spreading fake news. This was after the department released a statement saying accusations linking Hlophe were false and circulating CIPC screenshot with her misspelt name were forged. Youth: Corona kills old people not us! Speaking to SAfm yesterday morning, Hlophe said she was never a part of any company. “There’s an account on Twitter that falsely accuses me,” she said. “I apparently resigned from some company 10 days before it was given a tender worth R130 million to supply PPEs.” Hlophe said the CIPC documents were fodged. “They took those document and inserted my information into them,” she said. “There are many things that get written and we overlook many of them. “But I think the gravity of this one isn’t just something you can overlook.” She said it was a sensitive issue. “And understandably so, this pandemic has been extremely harsh on society and our economy. “So for someone to implicate me in something this serious, I thought they needed to be given the same level of a serious response.”
