GOSPEL star Hlengiwe Mhlaba says the coronavirus has caused many people to become depressed, especially artists. “We couldn’t make money during this time and that has depressed many of us,” she said. Hlengiwe said many artists had no income and couldn’t afford to pay their rent and car instalments. “When times are tough and no one can help you, you might end up thinking of ending your life. That’s not an option. Never kill yourself,” she said. “I went through some difficulty in my life and thought of killing myself twice,” she said. Hlengiwe said she nearly committed suicide before she became famous. She said talking to someone helped her. Hlengiwe is involved in the Ungazibulali Depression and Suicide Campaign, which was started by motivational speaker Nkululeko Khanyi. Nkululeko also attempted suicide in the past. He started the campaign to educate the public about the dangers of depression. “No one will just come and help you. You need to leave your corner and approach them. Someone might help,” he said.
