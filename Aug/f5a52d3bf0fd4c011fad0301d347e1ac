A man was found hanging from a high voltage electrical pylon in Brakpan. This comes after he allegedly tempered with the cables, attempting to cut them off. This is according to the Ekurhuleni EMS spokesperson, William Ntladi. Ntladi said the rescue team from the City of Ekurhuleni recovered a charred body of a male found hanging down from high voltage electrical Eskom pylon in Withok west agricultural holdings in Brakpan. "A charred body was hanging head down on an 88Kv electrical cables, about 25m above the ground," said Ntladi. He further stated that the body was found hanging head down from one of the high voltage electrical cables about 25 metres from the ground on a steel pylon. "A hacksaw and screwdriver tools were found on the ground directly underneath where the body was hanging," he said.  Ntladi also told Daily Sun that a specialised vehicle with a hydraulic platform was on scene with others and was used to lift the rescuers to the correct height in reaching the patient. "Before this, the operation had to be halted till safety signal was given by electricians who had to isolate the power supply from the power lines," he said. "Two female rescuers in attendance, volunteered to take the responsibilities on their shoulders because of August being Women's Month. They were accompanied by only one male colleague inside the hydraulic platform's cage to recover the patient," he added. The scene was handed over to the police for investigations and Forensic Pathology officials for the removal of the body to an appropriate facility.
