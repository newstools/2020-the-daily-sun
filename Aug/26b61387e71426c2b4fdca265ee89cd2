Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp was again critical of his side’s finishing as he accepted that he would have to shoulder the blame for the 1-0 Absa Premiership loss to BidVest Wits on Sunday. The defeat left Chiefs with just a single win in seven matches, but with those behind them also faltering, they remain top of the league on goal-difference from Mamelodi Sundowns, who suffered a shock loss to Baroka FC by the same scoreline later in the evening. Chiefs only had themselves to blame as they wasted a number of chances, not least leading scorer Samir Nurkovic, who somehow missed with the goal at his mercy. "If you see the 90 minutes, the effort brought in by the players, by the team,” Middendorp said. “I don't know actually, of course, that one will be again the coach is in charge [and it is his fault], but the number of possibilities ... good, if it has to be, it's my fault, I take it. "But I think the mentality of the players was very good, they were really fighting the full 98 minutes. The chances were there to make it 1-0, 2-0, 3-0, and of course, that's a bit of ... I don't know how at the end of the day, through the centre, that's something we have to face, it’s not really acceptable.” Chiefs are next in action against Chippa United in their penultimate fixture on Wednesday before they meet Baroka in their final game at the weekend. "I personally hope we can put the players into the right mentality towards the next game, in particular Chippa. We will try again, we will go again all out, try to score, try to win this game.” - SuperSport
