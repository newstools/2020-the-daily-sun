MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane believes that Thursday’s Absa Premiership top of the table clash against Kaizer Chiefs will not decide the league title. The highly anticipated encounter is scheduled for Orlando Stadium at 6pm. Chiefs who have been leading the standing for a while now and Sundowns are in a two-horse race for the league title. They go into Thursday highly anticipated game with only three points separating them. “Thursday is not a title decider, the way I know this thing, sometimes the title is decided on the last day,” Mosimane said. “Mathematically the title will not be won on Thursday but we would love to win on Thursday. The fat lady hasn’t sung yet and we are still going.” Since the return of football early this month, both teams have struggled to be consistent in the bio-bubble. Chiefs have won only one‚ played two draws and two defeats, while Sundowns lost once, won once and drew three times. Mosimane added: “Since we have been in the bubble we have scored nine, how can you score nine and not get a chance to win one match. “It’s about time, it’s not luck we fought for it, we’ve been fighting. It’s just that we haven’t kept zero at the back but the goals have been there. “It’s good for us, good for the confidence we move on. For us it’s more about the break, we have been fighting and scoring, we don’t give up. “When you fight and get nothing you stress and there is pressure, and we have been getting that. So, we celebrate the win because we have been under a lot of pressure. It is about time we celebrate.”
