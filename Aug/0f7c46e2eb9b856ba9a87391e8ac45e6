I’ve lost jobs, money would disappear and my beautiful wife died. “When I consulted prophets and izangoma, they told me there was nothing wrong with me and that I needed to heed my calling. “It was no secret I had mental problems and everyone in the village is shocked that I’m now a healer.” Villager Fatima Mathye (57) said they couldn’t believe James was now okay. “His life was miserable. He had mental problems and was uncontrollable,” she said. Gobela Thembi from Shortie Village said she still remembered the day James arrived at her home two years ago. “He was sick and out of his senses. He didn’t eat, but had a strong power. James is now a healthy man. He can read bones and heal others,” she said. ALSO READ: COMEDIAN UNDLOVU WASEBHAYI KILLED BY EVIL SNAKE!
