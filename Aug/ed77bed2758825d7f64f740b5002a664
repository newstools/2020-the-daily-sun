  Red ants and the JMPD are evicting people who occupied houses illegally in Fleurhof, near Florida in Joburg. Not only is the community angry that they are being evicted, but they are gatvol that a life has been lost. Speaking to Daily Sun, one of 10 community leaders claimed that the man who died was walking towards the hostel from Fleurhof coming back from work. "He was innocent and had nothing to do with whatever is happening. He was taking a short cut and got killed. We want to see him, but the police are stopping us, they claim that he died in the early hours of the morning and that's a blunt lie," he said. Hostel dwellers from Meadowlands in Soweto are watching from a distance, wanting to see who has died. The situation is tense as people watch their belongings being thrown from the windows of the flats they've occupied since last Saturday.
