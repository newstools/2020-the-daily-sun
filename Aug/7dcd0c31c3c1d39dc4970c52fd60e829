IT’S a SIX-POINTER! That is the GladAfrica Championship match between warring sides – JDR Stars and Uthongathi FC – at the UJ Soweto Campus grounds on 11 August. JDR Stars boss and coach, Nditsheni Nemasisi, has made it clear victory against Uthongathi will secure their berth in the promotion play-offs. Based on their position on the Championship log, JDR would move to 40 points should they beat Uthongathi and look to Tshakuma’s result against Jomo Cosmos at Wits Rugby ground, which is played on the same day. “The play-offs position is in our hands,” said Nemasisi. “It is us who will decide what to do. We have the whole complement of the team for this one. It’s a six-pointer that will determine our future. We are number five on the log behind Tshakuma, whom we know have already bought (Bidvest) Wits status and might not be too serious. “We are three points behind Uthongathi and we’re playing them. This is what we did with Steenberg FC, whom we jumped after playing against them. Chances are there that if we play well against them, then we will leapfrog them to a better position.” He said they are ready for any eventuality: “We are ready for action. Our preparations are at an advanced stage. We started training earlier, immediately after we got our Covid-19 test results and permission of return to training.” JDR will undergo their second Covid-19 tests either today or tomorrow, according to Nemasisi, before they go into their identified mini-bubble “before we get into the main bubble once we get all the test results”. He said they got a clean bill of health in their first Covid-19 tests on 22 June before they started training. “The players are looking great and looking forward to the games,” he said. “They are also motivated by fact that two of our matches will be broadcast live on SuperSportTV. “Some of them will be appearing on TV for the first time, and it’s motivating them.”
