Kaizer Chiefs’ grip on the Absa Premiership title is getting looser with every match. This after they dropped three more points following a 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits in a crunch match against Bidvest Wits at FNB Stadium on Sunday. Bienvenu Eva Nga scored the solitary goal of the match, breaking Amakhosi hearts in the closing stages. Amakhosi, who had a 13 point lead at some point, have seen that lead cut down by rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. Chiefs have struggled to win matches of late with the title quickly slipping away from them. They came into the match under pressure to return to winning ways having lost to rivals Sundowns 1-0 midweek. However, Wits piled more misery on the Glamour Boys who now have a mountain to climb if they are to end their five season trophy drought. They have now lost two matches in a row with as their poor form continues. The Clever Boys, who saw their slim chances take a huge dent during their 1-1 draw with Celtic last time out, are now back in the hunt. They have an outside chance to win their second title in what is their final season of existence. This is despite some of their results being somewhat inconsistent since the resumption of football. But their opponents, Chiefs, have been poor form themselves inside the Biologically Safe Environment (BSE). They have managed win just once since the restart. Amakhosi have picked up a mere five points from a possible 15 points inside the bubble. The two sides played out to a 1-1 draw in their first meeting in the ‘bio-bubble’ a few weeks ago. This time, however, Wits managed to walk away victorious with Eva Nga stealing it late. Chiefs star Samir Nurkovic could have ensured Chiefs walk away with at least a point, however, he missed a clear goal scoring chance unmarked. Chiefs next face Chippa United at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday (6pm) as they look to end their three match winless run. Wits on the other hand, next face relegation threatened Black Leopards at the FNB Stadium on the same day.
