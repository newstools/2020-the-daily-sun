THE bail application for Angeline Seanego has been postponed for the fourth time. But this time it was due to Covid-19! The Pretoria Magistrates Court was closed for decontamination after a staff member tested positive for the virus. And this meant all court proceedings have been postponed to later dates. This includes Seanego’s bail application. The 22-year-old was accused of murdering her boyfriend Dennis Kyazze and hiding his body under the bed in their flat in the Tshwane CBD. Her hearing was postponed to 11 August. During her last court appearance, Seanego failed to provide the correct residential address. The magistrate had remanded the hearing to yesterday, and had said the matter would be heard with or without the correct address. But now they will have to postpone because of the pandemic. According to police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela, the relatives went to the dead man’s flat. He said they found his girlfriend, while the body of the man was found under the bed with injuries on the upper body. “The woman was arrested and charged with murder after she couldn’t explain what had happened to the deceased,” said Makhubela.
