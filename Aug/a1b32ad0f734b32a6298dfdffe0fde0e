ANC KZN provincial media liaison Mduduzi Mvubu has died. Mvubu died on Sunday morning at King Edward hospital after complaining of stomach pains last night. The news of his death was confirmed to the Daily Sun by his family and ANC provincial spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela. His brother Mandla Mvubu (49) who lived with him at Chesterville in Durban said the deceased called him around 1pm yesterday and asked him to bring some tables because he had a running stomach. Mvubu said he brought tablets at around 4 pm after knocking off from work but he was surprised when he found him naked at home. He said he told him he was having running stomach and was getting weaker. Mvubu said while he was moving his car to rush him to hospital, Mdu collapsed. "It was when I realized my brother's illness was serious. I tried to lift him up but he couldn't lift himself up and was no longer responding to me. I called an ambulance and I went with him to King Edward hospital," said Mvubu. He said he left him with doctors at 12 midnight but at 5 am today hospital called him to come to hospital as his life was deteriorating. Mvubu said he found his brother on respiratory support machine and lost hope. He said doctors told him they have done all they could do to keep him alive and at 8am this morning doctors told him he has passed on.
