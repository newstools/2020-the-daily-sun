SHE fought in the struggle and was tortured in jail. She’s Pauline Mohale, one of hundreds of unsung heroes who freed Mzansi. Daily Sun visited the 70-year-old, soft-spoken gogo at the house where she grew up in Dube, Soweto. Pauline, a member of the Student Christian Movement in Soweto, was among the pupils who marched on 16 June 1976. Pauline lost many of her friends and schoolmates. She was bust months later with Tokyo Sexwale, the former Gauteng premier and cabinet minister, while trying to cross the border to Eswatini. She spent over a year in prison at the mercy of apartheid cops. She said: “I was held in solitary confinement. I was electrocuted, blindfolded and kicked by the police. I couldn’t walk.  She knew she’d get out of prison alive. “I refused to surrender or lose hope,” she said. Pauline was saddened that many who fought for liberation are still without houses and jobs.  “The South Africa we’re living in today isn’t what we fought for. “The country has been taken over by corruption and theft. “This wasn’t our mission. We fought for equal education, jobs, houses and opportunities.” Pauline said the nation doesn’t owe her anything. “All I want is for leaders to be accountable and take responsibility.” In her soft voice she called for women to unite and empower each other, especially during Women’s Month. “Don’t betray each other over a man. Vote for a woman instead of a man. “I’m ashamed of women who defend rape accused. Women need to love, support and empower each other.” She said in her youth, women used to take care of each other’s children. “I see kids barefoot while a neighbour has many shoes in the closet.” The ex-school financial administrator is studying fashion design.
