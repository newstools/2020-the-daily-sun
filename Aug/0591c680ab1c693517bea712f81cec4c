FOR Pertunia Zulu, comedy is the remedy. When life knocks her down, she finds comfort and healing in jokes. The YouTuber said her mum, Nomusa Zulu, died when she was seven years old. “Life was not good and that led me to be depressed for a very long time until two years ago when I started recording comical videos,” said the comedian, known as Samuperty Zulu to her YouTube followers. Samuperty said after recording a few videos, she found a reason to live. “I closed the dark space and chose happiness. The feedback was overwhelming, and that gave me courage to do more.” She said she was always known for making jokes and her friends would record her. “In 2018 I recorded myself and posted my videos on social media. Today I have a strong following with the highest being five million views and the lowest is 6 000.” Her content is based on relationships. One of her popular videos was when she punished her ex-boyfriend, who dumped her after receiving inheritance money. He later came back to her after being disabled through a car crash. Samuperty would transfer him to bed and pretend she’s going out to see other men. She was born in Sibongile kasi in Dundee, KZN but grew up in Olievenhoutbosch, Centurion. Samuperty is a third-year food technology student at the University of Joburg. “I chose the course because I love food.” She’s also known for tlof tlof and using broken language when she presents her material. “I want people to focus on the message instead of the grammar. My intention is to teach through comedy. For tlof tlof, I want to put a stop to the taboo. I teach my viewers to have pleasurable and protected tlof tlof,” she said.
