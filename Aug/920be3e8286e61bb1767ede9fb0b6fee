Comedian Tiffany Haddish has confirmed that she's in a relationship with Common. During an interview on talk show, Steve-O's Wild Ride, she was asked about cutting her hair bold and she said she was now twins with her boyfriend. When Steve asked if she was talking about Common, she said: "Yes, we're twins now."Tiffany and Common went on a date via Bumble, a dating site a few months back and Tiffany said that's where their relationship started. "I joined Bumble last year because I wanted to start dating. Bumble approached me about working with them. And I had been talking to Common at that time. At this point, our friendship was getting a little more than friendship, but not quite. We were face timing all the time and I was like you should check out Bumble, why don't we do this on Bumble. Like we can do charity, do stuff for the frontline workers and kids too. We made money and donations and it was cool," she said. The Girls' Trip actress said she's happy with Common."I feel more confident in me and it’s not him that’s doing it. I’m just way happier and it’s like knowing I got somebody who cares about me, that really has my back. It seems like he does anyways, and I love it," said Tiffany. Read: DUMI MKOKSTAD'S BIG WIN!
