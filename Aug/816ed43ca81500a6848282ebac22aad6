LOCAL Paralympian Ntando Mahlangu has been featured on Netflix’s new documentary, Rising Phoenix. The documentary tells the story of the Paralympic Games. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ntando said: “It was such an honour to be part of this amazing project because I wasn’t only representing South Africa, but the whole of Africa. “I decided to be a part of this project because I stand for what it represents – disability and the Paralympic movement.” ALSO READ |VUTHA COMES TO SABC 2! Ntando was born with hemimelia, a condition that stopped his legs from fully developing. He said he hoped the film would raise awareness. “I hope it changes people’s perceptions and shows them being disabled doesn’t mean you’re unable. “If you’re given the right opportunities you can achieve a lot.” The Mpumalanga-born athlete, who enjoys playing soccer, said everyone featured on the film was a rising Phoenix. “I’d like to consider everyone who’s featured on the documentary as a rising Phoenix. We’ve risen against the odds and achieved big.” Rising Phoenix premiered yesterday on Netflix. It’s here!!
