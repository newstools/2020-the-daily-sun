 The bakkie was found upside down on the side of the road. Several men were found lying scattered around the vehicle,
and two men were killed and seven others injured when the bakkie rolled over on
barrage road in Vanderbijlpark. ER24 said paramedics assessed the patients and found that
two men had sustained numerous fatal injuries. “Nothing could be done for them, and they were declared
dead. Seven other men were assessed, and it was found one was in a
critical condition while six others had sustained minor to moderate injuries,”
ER24 said in a statement. The patients were treated for their injuries and the
critically injured provided with advanced life support interventions before
they were transported to a nearby hospital for further care.
