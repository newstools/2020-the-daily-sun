THERE was no electricity that day and in the evening some residents were forced to use candles. But in one of the rooms at Godibe Village in Mtubatuba northern KZN, where a candle was used, tragedy struck. The entire room burnt down and three-year-old boy Singothandiwe Vermeulem, who was left alone sleeping, tragically burnt to death. A resident told Daily Sun that there was no electricity that day and Singothandiwe’s mother used a candle. “The entire rooms that we rent didn’t have electricity. So late in the evening we called each other to a meeting to try and put some money together so that we could buy electricity in the morning,” said the resident. He said the mother went outside the room, left the child alone to speak to other residents regarding the electricity matter and within a few minutes, they saw flames coming from the room that Singothandiwe was sleeping in. “The flames were too strong, so we could save the child. He sadly burnt to death, ” said the resident. The resident said they tried to put out the fire with buckets of water, but it was too late. Another resident said what happened was sad because the meeting they had outside their rooms was short. “We took about five minutes. Then in those few minutes, the fire broke out in the room. We are not sure whether the candle fell or what. But the child’s mother said she had left it on the table,” she said. When Singothandiwe’s mother Bongiwe Khanyile (33) was contacted, she said: “I cant talk to you now. I’m busy with my child’s funeral preparations. But all I can tell you is that I’m not well,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that KwaMsane cops have opened an inquest docket. Gwala said it’s alleged that a room where a three-year-old boy was asleep caught fire. “The child was burnt and declared dead at the scene. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.
