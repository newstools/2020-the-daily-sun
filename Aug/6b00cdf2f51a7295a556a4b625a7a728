A BIG week lies ahead for the PSL. According to league chairman Irvin Khoza, along with his executive committee, they will be locked in meetings this week as they are in the hunt for a new sponsor to take over from Absa for the flagship Premiership. The bank will cease their association with PSL at the end of this delayed season after 13 years. Getting a new partner for the Premiership has been made more difficult by the coronavirus pandemic which has resulted in a number of economies around the world, including South Africa, facing a meltdown. However, Khoza previously said that he had four companies who are keen to take over from Absa. Bidvest, who ended its association with Bidvest Wits, are among the favourites to take over. “It is a difficult time, a difficult period and it’s not easy to get sponsors,” said Khoza. “We must be patient because the market is not easy (due to Covid-19 pandemic). But let’s hope what happens in the executive meeting this week might give us an indication of what is the way forward.” This is not the only pressing matter that will be discussed by the executive. The league is also in discussion about this year’s PSL Awards on how they’ll be held and attended in line with the Covid-19 regulations. The GladAfrica Championship ended yesterday with Swallows FC gaining automatic promotion. The delayed season ends on 5 September, and the Nedbank Cup final will take place at Orlando Stadium on 12 September. Normally the PSL awards are staged the day after the Ke Yona cup final. “I’m told the acting CEO (Mato Madlala) was asked to go and check to give us more information for the executive to make a determination,” said Khoza.
