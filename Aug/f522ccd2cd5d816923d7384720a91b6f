NORTHERN Cape Education MEC Macollen Jack has died. Jack died on Wednesday afternoon after he was admitted to hospital a week ago after he allegedly contracted Covid-19. Northern Cape education spokesman Geoffrey van der Merwe confirmed the MEC’s death by sending a message from Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul. The premier’s message read: “It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of a dear comrade and colleague, Ntsikelelo Maccollen Jack, who was the MEC for Education. Jack passed on earlier this evening at the hospital. He was admitted to hospital last week and he was as always in good spirits and confident of a full recovery. Unfortunately he took a bad turn and was declared deceased on Wednesday. He was a seasoned cadre of the movement and an outstanding public servant. He had warrior spirit and extraordinary energy. We extend our condolences to his wife, children, family, friends, colleagues and comrades. We are in deep shock at the loss of such a remarkable and capable leader. The provincial executive, the ANC and our alliance partners will meet the whole family tomorrow and further details will then be released.” Among the people who sent condolences was Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who wrote on Twitter: “The departure of the MEC for Education, MacCollen Jack, is a major setback to the education sector and the people of Northern Cape. I share your grief. Comrade Jack loved your province and cared for your pupils, teachers and staff. My condolences to his family and friends.”
