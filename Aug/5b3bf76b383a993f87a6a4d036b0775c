Tithes help pay the pastor’s salary, keep the lights on and meet the community’s needs. Regular tithing gives you spiritual power to attract what you need, when you need it. Dr John Tibane scolds those who give emotionally in church, left with nothing but conflict with their spouses, because they end up using what belongs to the family unit. But much blame also lies with false and lazy preachers who misinterpret Bible verses. READ: MONEY RAT CHASED MY GIRLFRIENDS! One pastor I know used to preach: “O lekana le monehelo wa hao.” (God blesses you according to how much you tithe.) What blasphemy! Distorting Bible verses turns off even dedicated Christians. Dr Myles Munroe said tithing has nothing to do with giving God money because He does not need our pennies. Everything on earth already belongs to Him. What God needs is for us to set aside just 10%of everything we possess for the glory of His Kingdom. Tithing and offering is God’s management training programme for mankind. If you have 10 pairs of shoes, one doesn’t belong to you. If you buy 10 oranges, give one to the poor. From the 24 hours you have per day, 2hours and 40minutes must be dedicated to God’s service. You are a thief if you fail to give Him part of your time. - Samuel Radebe,Heilbron
