THE dead should be respected and allowed to rest in peace. That’s the plea from the residents of Tweefontein near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. They want livestock owners to look after their cattle as they often graze in the graveyard. The angry residents said allowing animals to step on the graves was disrespectful to their ancestors. They said the municipality erected a fence at the graveyard, but people kept ruining it. Joseph Kabini (49), who lives near the graveyard, said he was tired of chasing out the cattle. The cattle are attracted by the tall grass. “Cattle owners must look after their animals and they should not be allowed inside the graveside,” he said. Another resident, Geeilbooi Msiza (37), said residents should learn to clean their loved ones’ graves. “The animals are attracted by the tall grass in the graveyard. But the biggest mistake was made by people who poked holes in the fence. “The cattle also destroy the gravestones. We don’t know whether the municipality will erect another fence to protect the graves,” said Geeilbooi. Sangoma Madlinyoka Nkambule said the dead should be respected and allowed to rest in peace. “This is a taboo and will anger the ancestors. “Grave owners must also be respected as they do their best to put stones for their loves ones,” he said. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane Mokoka said many graveyards still needed to get fenced. “Residents must guard their property. The municipality will not erect a new fence. The only thing we do is maintenance,” she said.
