AMAZULU striker Bonginkosi Ntuli is ready to pick up from where he left off when the Absa Premiership season resumes next week. The bulky centre forward was one of the players who were setting the league alight before the coronavirus pandemic halted the season. His contribution to Usuthu’s battle for survival has been immense, with his goals the only thing still keeping them in the division so far. The former Mamelodi Sundowns striker has scored all but two of AmaZulu’s goals in the league, such is his importance to the team. He has found the back of the net on 12 occasions this campaign as he shares third place on the top scorers charts with Bradley Grobler and Peter Shalulile. Only Orlando Pirates’ Gabadinho Mhango has scored more goals than the 29-year-old who is eager to help Usuthu stave off relegation. The Kwa-Zulu Natal outfit resume their campaign with a clash against Baroka at the Lucas Moripe Stadium next Saturday (1.30pm). Ntuli is confident that Usuthu can manage to turn their fortunes around in their six remaining league matches and hang on to their place in the land of milk and honey. “I think we’re ready as a team. We have the belief that we can come out of the position we’re currently in,” he told his club’s website. “Our hopes are still quite high, everyone has been pushing at training even though it has been a long and difficult wait. We have to go into our game against Baroka with everything we’ve got.” AmaZulu are currently sitting second from bottom of the standings with 23 points from 24 matches, just three points clear of bottom team Black Leopards. Their over reliance on Ntuli has been their biggest problems as they have been unable to find goals from elsewhere in the team. Siyethemba Sithebe and Butholezwe Ncube are the only other Usuthu players to have found the net in the league for the KZN side.
