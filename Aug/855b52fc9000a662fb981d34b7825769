RELEGATION haunted Baroka FC and AmaZulu shared the spoils when they played to a goalless draw in the Absa Premiership clash on Saturday afternoon. The result means Baroka remain in position 14, ahead of AmaZulu who are 15 on the log. They are separated by a superior goal difference as both teams have managed to accumulate 24 points in 25 matches this season. It was AmaZulu's first match since the resumption of football which was halted by the coronavirus breakthrough in March. The KwaZulu-Natal based outfit made two changes from their line-up that defeated Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 when they last played in March with goalkeeper Neil Boshoff and Samuel Darpoh starting the game. On the other end, Baroka made five changes from the team that was trashed 3-0 by Bloemfontein Cceltic in the Nedbank Cup semifinal last weekend. Bakgaga coach Dylan Kerr gave debut to young Thuso Mogale, new signing Lungelo Nguse and Bonginkosi Makume, while Vusi Sibiya and Ivan Mahangwahaya were recalled. This was a crucial match for both encounters as it was going to put less pressure on the winner as the league is edging closer to the wire. Both sides created numerous goalscoring chances by their could not convert. In the end, neither side could find the back of the net as a bottom-of-the-table scrap ended goalless. Goals drought has been the issue since the season resumed in the past weekend. In five league matches that have been played before the Kaizer Chiefs on Polokwane City clash, only five goals have been scored in five matches.
