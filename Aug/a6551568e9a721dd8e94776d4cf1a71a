The heatwave usually causes a number of
problems for people across the world, but apparently it's having one positive
effect for men. Some will
become rather sweaty and tired, others may break out in a heat rash. But men will
see an interesting change during summer. Some men
have previously claimed they've experienced a phenomenon known as 'summer
penis', which is where high temperatures cause the 4-5s to appear bigger. This is of
course, not to be confused with summer penile syndrome, where men suffer with
itchy, painful bites on their genitals. Daily Mail
report that the term 'summer penis' was coined by Tracy Moore of MEL Magazine
back in 2018 and experts have  since agreed it is a real thing.Moore spoke
to Orlando-based urologist Jamin Brahmbhatt about the phenomenon. He confirmed
that temperature can cause a change - but said it isn't a ctually a
seasonal one. He said: "Summer or winter, your penis size should remain
the same."When it’s cold outside, your body does try to maintain its
internal heat, and therefore things may appear to be more contracted. Blood
vessels near the skin contract to maintain the internal heat. However, this
type of body heat regulation should not affect the overall size of your penis. "When
it’s hot outside, your body does try to evaporate the heat through sweat." Doctor
explains why sleeping in the heat gives you 'unpleasant' nightmares He
added: "Also when it’s hot outside, you may take in more water, which may
in combination with the sweating make it appear like your body or skin is
bloated. And that may give you the perception that things are larger." So
your penis isn't actually growing, the only thing changing in the heat is the
way it looks to you. Dr
Dudley Danoff, author of The Ultimate Guide To Male Sexual Health, also has his
own theory on summer penis. He
claims that it is all to do with Vasodilation, which is the widening of blood
vessels.
