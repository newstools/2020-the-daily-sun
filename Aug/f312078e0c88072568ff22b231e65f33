ORLANDO Pirates have now gone four Absa premiership games without scoring a goal. On Saturday evening Pirates played to another goalless draw against Bidvest Wits in a match that was played at Emirates Airline Park (Ellis Park) stadium. The Buccaneers last scored a goal in February when they played to a 3-3 draw against Wits in the Nedbank Cup last-32 clash before defeating Black Leopards 1-0 through Thabiso Mokoena own goal. The draw leaves the Buccaneers and their opponents in third and fifth place on the log standings respectively. Both teams had a catalogue of early chances to break the deadlock in the first-half, the best of which fell to Vincent Pule in the 33rd minute. The ball fell at the winger's feet following a mix-up between Lorenzo Gordinho and Ricardo Goss, but with an open goal to aim at he could only manage to drive his attempt into the side-netting.The Clever Boys came within inches of breaking the deadlock after the interval with Haashim Domingo unlucky to see his attempt canon off the woodwork before Keegan Ritchie had his follow-up attempt cleared off the line.Bidvest Wits dominated play thereafter with Pirates forced to defend deep inside their own half and when they finally got an opportunity at the other end, Gabadinho Mhango squandered a glorious chance to give his side the lead.The Malawi international broke through the heart of the Clever Boys defence in the 69th minute but Goss pulled off a superb save to deny his former teammate.Both teams had chances to win the game following Mhango's chance, but neither were able to find the back of the net as the game ultimately ended with a share of the spoils.
