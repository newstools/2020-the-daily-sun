SunSport reported on Wednesday that Lejaka has quit the boxing organisation without any reasons being furnished. "To ensure continuity and sustenance of institutional memory, the board resolved to appoint Nkomo," BSA said in a statement on Thursday. Nkomo will work with the existing team of staff within BSA until a new CEO has been appointed by Minister of Sports Nathi Mthethwa. "Nkomo and team will work under the overall strategic leadership of the board, drive the execution of the proximate tasks outlined in the foregoing," continued the statement while confirming Lejaka's departure with immediate effect. Lejaka joined BSA four years ago where he helped herald administrative stability, within and beyond the boxing fraternity. "BSA at its previous three board meetings had reflected on the immediate, short-term and long-term implications of Covid-19 to the sport of boxing. In appreciating the current conditions, it resolved that our response to Covid-19 must lay a solid cornerstone for the long term sustainability of the peopleâ€™s sport. We had therefore committed to use this difficult period to reconnect with the fraternity, prepare the fraternity for the resumption of safe training through the re-opening of gymnasia, re-calibrate the women in Boxing programme, heighten the modernization of the administration of boxing as a sport obtaining in a world connected by technology."
