RESIDENTS of North West have vowed to create another Marikana scene after their R350 social relief grants were not paid. Locals and people from surrounding areas threatened to torch the post office, where grants were to have been paid out. They said they’d been told there was no money at the post office. Angry RDP resident, Sibongile Masina (50), said she’d been going to the post office since 13 July, but hadn’t received her grant.  “I live with two kids and two grandchildren. I need this money,” she said. “I’ve wasted money every day coming here. But we’re told there’s no money. “The response has been the same for two weeks and no one has come to us to explain what’s happening.” Another woman had spent R30 a day, more than the meagre R350 grant, in the past week. She said the department made the needy and elderly look stupid! Sassa spokeswoman Nthabiseng Mosieleng told the People’s Paper: “The agency is experiencing high Covid-19 relief fund applications and verification depends on third parties. “Although we understand the impact of lockdown, we call on communities to exercise patience.” She insisted the agency was addresseing the payments delay.
