MWAPE Musonda scored twice as Black Leopards defeated Golden Arrows 2-1 in the Absa Premiership clash played at Ellis Park Stadium today to move out at the bottom two. Musonda, who has been a shadow self this season having claimed the PSL golden shoe after scoring 16 league goals last term, firstly scored when he converted a penalty spot in the 27th minute. The penalty from the former Orlando Pirates striker was to cancel out that of Knox Mutizwa who tucked his in the 17th minute. Musonda's second goal, he reacted the quickest in the 92nd minute after Lifa Hlongwane’s free-kick came off the crossbar and the Zambia hitman bundled the ball home to see Leopards win their second league game since the season resumed in the bio-bubble. It is also two wins out of two for Leopards under caretaker coaches Morgan Shivhangu and Mongezi Bobe, who were given the role after the shock departure of Alan Clark. The victory moved the Venda-based club, who were positioned 15 before the game, to 13 with 26 points from 26 matches, one ahead of Baroka FC, two over AmaZulu and three over bottom side Polokwane City. It also means Leopards also did the double over Abafana Bes’Thende as they defeated them with the same scoreline in Durban in the first round. For Arrows, things don’t look good. This was their second loss in the bubble. They lost 1-0 to Stellenbosch FC when the season resumed and then drew 0-0 against Bidvest Wits in their previous game. This has seen the team from Durban completely slipped out the top eight. They are now 10th on the table with 33 points from 26 games.  It doesn’t get any easier for Steve Komphela's side in the next match. They visit title-chasing Mamelodi Sundowns at Dobsonville Stadium on Monday looking to get their first victory in the bubble. On the hand, Leopards will host SuperSport United at FNB Stadium the following day.
