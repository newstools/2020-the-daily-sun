Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has lavished praise on RSC Anderlecht striker Percy Tau after the 26-year old scored the club’s third goal on his debut in the Belgium powerhouse’s 3-1 win over Sint-Truidense on Sunday. Tau was introduced as a second-half substitute and netted Anderlecht’s third goal deep inside stoppage time as the hosts climbed to third position on the log standings with 4 points from two games in the Belgium top league.“It is every South African wish to see their idol doing well in Europe and for me I am really happy for Percy,” said Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki.Ntseki said it would be nicer if more and more of South Africans can make a mark in top European leagues but for now South Africans must relish Tau’s exploits.“Mentally, he is a fighter, he is a strong character and a focussed individual. I know most people want to see him in England but his time will definitely come.“I like Tau’s unwavering commitment and I am glad he has hit the ground running with his new club,” added Ntseki.The Bafana Bafana leading striker is on a season loan spell with the Belgium outfit from the English Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion.In Sunday’s match, he was introduced as a 64th-minute substitute with Anderlecht leading 2-0. However, Sint-Truidense pulled one back but the Witbank-born Tau had the last say as he completed a 3-1 win with a stoppage time goal.Anderlecht is coached by former Manchester City defender and captain Vincent Kompany and are gunning for their first league title in 4 years. - SAFA
