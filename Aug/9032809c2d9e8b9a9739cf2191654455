 PROTESTERS block roads with stones, trees, burning tyres and filth whenever there’s a protest ekasi. But they never remove their rubbish when they’re done. And this inconveniences motorists. But friends Bongani Khoza (29) and Tebogo Thuwe (30) from Naledi in Soweto have found a solution. They clean the streets after protests by removing stones and tyre ashes and sweep the streets clean. “We started doing this after we saw an accident caused by rubbish and stones left by protesters,” said Bongani. Motorists began paying them when they started with their cleaning initiative. “It helps us make money for ourselves,” said Bongani. Lerato said they listened to the radio and watched the news to hear if there were any protests in Soweto. He said they’ve been doing this since winter started. “People protest a lot in winter because of power cuts, and that’s when we make a killing,” he said. “We’ll continue with this until we find better jobs. “It’s better than doing nothing. It’s better than doing crime.  Motorist Lumka Zwane (35) from Naledi said: “I use this road every day and get frustrated when it’s blocked. “I appreciate what the guys are doing, and for that I don’t mind giving them my R20.” Another motorist, Nzuzo Ngwenya (27) from Protea Glen, said: “I love what these guys are doing. They’re our saviours.”
