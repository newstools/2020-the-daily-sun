THE case against an alleged hitman in the Umlazi ANC councillor’s murder has been moved to the high court. This was announced by Magistrate Judy Gurie in the Umlazi Magistrates Court today, where alleged hitman Nkosingiphile Gumede appeared. He is accused of killing councillor Sbusiso Maphumulo, who was gunned down in 2018 outside his home in Umlazi, south of Durban. The case was postponed to 14 September and the court told Gumede he will have to appear in the Durban High Court. The court also revealed that the accused is facing two other counts of murder and eight other charges, including attempted murders and armed robberies. State prosecutor Lawrence Gcaba said all 11 charges have been combined in one docket because it was disturbing that the accused was appearing in different courts, which sometime clashed with other appearances. The dead councillor’s brother, Bongani Maphumulo, said the family was happy that the case has been moved because it shows that the state was treating it as high profile case. He said the family was waiting for the alleged hitman to reveal who hired him to kill his brother. Police Minister Bheki Cele was expected to attend the case, but cancelled in the last minute due to other commitments. Few councillor’s family members and local ANC leaders attended. Gumede was arrested in June and was positively identified by witnesses. He was found with a gun that was allegedly used to kill the councillor. He was bust at his home in Mandini, northern KZN, but he is originally from KwaMaphumulo in the same region. Maphumulo was ward 88 councillor and branch secretary at the time of his death. He was sitting in his car when unknown men sprayed his car with bullets, killing him on the scene. Cops arrested ANC councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza and his brothers Phumlani Nojiyeza and Nkosinathi Mbambo, but charges were withdrawn in May last year after state witnesses who had implicated the three disappeared and refused to come and testify.
