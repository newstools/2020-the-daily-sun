 Since the
beginning of 2020 118 babies have been abandoned in various public hospitals. The Gauteng
Health Department raised concern over the abandoning of babies, some of the
reasons cited were teenage mothers being fearful of their parents. The
department also cited unwanted, unplanned pregnancies, lack of immediate basic
supplies of clothes and toiletries. “The time
spent in hospital by abandoned babies ranges from a week to a month or longer,”
the department said in a statement. To reduce
the number of abandoned babies, hospital social workers conduct educational
awareness programmes with expectant mothers on care options such as adoption,
temporal care, and foster care. The
department further said this provides the mother with some immediate means to
care for herself and the baby until she can make an informed decision. Hospitals
that were highlighted as those with a high rate of child abandonment so far are
Carletonville, Leratong, Far East Rand, Tembisa, and Chris Hani Baragwanath
Academic Hospital.
