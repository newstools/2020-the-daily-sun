ORLANDO Pirates ended a six-match run without a victory on Saturday when they defeated SuperSport United 2-1 in an Absa Premiership clash. Vincent Pule and Zakhele Lepasa scored the goals that saw The Buccaneers collecting their first maximum points since the resumption of the season. Pule was the first to find the back of the net in the 29th minute‚ before Luke Fleurs equalised in the 41st for Matsatsantsa a Pitori. Lepasa who came in as a sub scored Pirates second goal on the 58th minute of the clash. SuperSport head coach Kaitano Tembo was left to reflect on key penalties incidents as they lost their seventh match of the season. Referee Siyabonga Nkomo awarded two of what looked to be soft penalties, but strikers Bradley Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza’s kicks were both saved by Wayne Sandilands. SuperSport’s first penalty came when Ghampani Lungu‚ went down in the box after he was challenged by Innocent Maela‚. The second came from Ntsikelelo Nyauza clipping at the ankles of Modiba. SuperSport remain third on the Absa Premiership standings with 47 points after 28 league matches that they have played this season.
