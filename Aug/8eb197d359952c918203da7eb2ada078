MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has rued referee's decisions of not awarding his side a penalty. On Friday evening, Sundowns were held to a 2-2 draw by Maritzburg United at Lucas Moripe Stadium and coach Mosimane felt his side have been 'unfortunate' with some refereeing decisions since the restart of the campaign. "We've had a lot of unfortunate situations,” Mosimane said after the match. “Last time (Peter) Shalulile controlled the ball with a hand and he finished the goal, he scored. Last time (against Orlando Pirates), Happy Jele, went out with the ball in his hand in the box, we didn't get a penalty." "Tonight, Promise was pushed from behind, we didn't get a penalty, we deserved another penalty. "It doesn't mean if you gave us one, then you can't give the next one. Those things work a little bit against us. "And the red card also but you have to focus on what does the game say? What is happening? If you want to focus on the results, yes, you're right but football is not about results, football is a game and the game yields results. "It's unfortunate, very sad." Sundowns remain second in the Absa Premiership standings with five points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Sundowns took the lead twice on the night, but Maritzburg fought back to ensure that the game ended in a draw and Mosimane felt that it was their best match since the current season resumed. “We allowed them to come back to us. It's the first time I see them play much better since the restart, we played much better than all the games," he added."
