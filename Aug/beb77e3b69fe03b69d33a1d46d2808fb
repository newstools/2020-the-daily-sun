FOOTBALL strikers go through spells without scoring goals. Economies, inevitably at times, go through economic recessions. The point is, life is not always a bed of roses and like the biblical verse found in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 puts it: “There is a time for everything under the sun.” Without taking you to church, the verse further explains that there are seasons in life we have to go through, including sex. There comes a time when the only morning glory you have is reading your Bible, and your only afternoon snack is found in a vending machine. Yes, we sadly at times go through a dry sex season and according to experts, the consumption of pornography can be what we resort to. So the question is: why are you going through a dry sex season? A few psychosexual therapists helped narrow it down as follows: 1.Age A lot of us think that we’re too old for sex. According to research from the University of Michigan, it found that 40% of people aged between 60-80 are sexually active. The research proved that the elderly have a greater appreciation of sex more than their younger counterparts, and that is the problem. 2.Stress Let’s face it, we live in a demanding world and stress is inevitable. A recent survey conducted by Coop Pharmacy found that 40% of men who suffer with erectile problems in their 30s attribute it to stress. 3.Self-esteem You are what you think, and this is often overlooked when it comes to dealing with life’s challenges. Self-esteem plays an important role in sex. From how you present yourself in your birthday suit, to how you perform during sex. Self-esteem plays an important role and maybe that’s the reason you haven’t been getting some action satisfaction.
