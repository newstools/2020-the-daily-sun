BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic are determined to win the Nedbank Cup that has eluded them since inception in 2008. Celtic coach John Maduka said his charges are ready to overcome all obstacles to ensure they lay their hands on the Ke Yona trophy. This will be the first PSL match since the season was suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Said Maduka: “The Nedbank is one cup that we never won and we will go all out to win it. We have to beat Baroka, even though we haven’t seen them (in action) in four months.” Maduka expects the game not to be fast-paced due to a lack of fitness, as both teams haven’t played competitively in four months. Ironically, Baroka last played a competitive match on 1 March when they lost 2-1 to Siwelele via goals from Ndumiso Mabena and Tebogo Potsane, in a match played at Dr Molemela Stadium. But Celtic last had action on 8 March when they lost 2-0 to Cape Town City, in a league match away. Celtic will play without key defenders – Tshepo Rikhotso (injured) and Ronald Pfumbidzai (stuck in Zimbabwe). However, Siwelele will pin their hopes on veteran striker Mabena and midfielder Potsane. On the other hand, Baroka will rely on Mozambican midfielder Manuel Kambala and Tshidiso Patjie, the club’s top scorer, to upset Celtic.
