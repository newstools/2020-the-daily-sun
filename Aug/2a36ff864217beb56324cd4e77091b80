The vandalising of water infrastructure is a tremendous
setback for service delivery. This is according to the Department of Water and Sanitation,
which seeks to ensure that water is supplied to communities without fail. The department’s spokesman Sputnik Ratau said the
vandalising of their infrastructure affected the financial well-being of the
Department as well the relevant stakeholders in the water sector, particularly
municipalities. “Acts of vandalism of infrastructure are as a result of the
theft of such property which is prevalent both in urban and rural settings,
such as is happening in Buffalo City. “These acts include vandalism and theft of valuable metal
pipes, fittings and manhole covers, leading to an increase in the maintenance
costs by the relevant Water Services Authorities,” he said. ALSO READ: PPE FOUND FLOATING IN RIVER! Ratau said the bypassing of meters and illegal connections
were also a serious challenge, especially for downstream water users. “Destruction of water infrastructure generally results in
reduced access to a suitable quantity and quality of water to users broadly. “This, in turn, affects the sanitation services, with
associated impacts on public health and personal dignity,” Ratau added. The department has called on communities to refrain from
destroying water infrastructure but to protect it.
