A MPUMALANGA police constable, who is accused of rape, has been denied bail and will remain in jail. The 27-year-old, who is attached to Sakhile cop shop, pleaded not guilty to rape and assault charges when he appeared in the Standerton Magistrates Court on Friday. The court heard that he allegedly raped an 18-year-old girl after he visited the victim’s place but later lured her to his place, where the incident took place. The victim managed to escape and was assisted by a resident who took her to the police station, where a case of rape and assault was opened. The incident happened on 9 August and the accused was bust the following day. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa told Daily Sun that the accused was denied bail after the state learnt that he had pending cases of assault and malicious damage to property. “The state opposed his bail application, and he will remain in police custody while police continue with their investigation of the rape charges. The case was postponed to 18 September,” said Nyuswa. Meanwhile, Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said an internal investigation against the suspect is underway. “It’s disappointing that the incident occurred during Women’s Month and was allegedly committed by a police officer,” said Zuma
