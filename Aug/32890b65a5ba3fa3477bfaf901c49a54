SOWETO TV will host a memorial service for M-Siya Maawu tomorrow. The late gospel star was previously a presenter on the channel for a show called According To The Bible. M-Siya died last Friday at the Tambo Memorial Hospital after being diagnosed with coronavirus. His death was followed by controversy after he asked people to fetch him from the hospital. M-Siya, known for his many gospel hits such as Amanxeba and Ayolikhothamela, said at the time he felt like he was going to die and later that day, he died. The service will be held at 44 Maxwell Street, Orphirton in Booysens, Joburg at 4pm.
