More information regarding Covid19 keeps emerging and researchers explain that contraceptive pills contain oestrogen which can narrow blood vessels. Individuals who are pregnant or on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) face the same danger. A studyÂ in the journal Endocrinology found that women who take birth control are already at an increased risk of blood clots due to estrogen in the pill, and doctors are warning that they will be particularly at risk if they catch coronavirus, which can also trigger clots. Contraceptive pills contain estrogen which can narrow vessels. Individuals who are pregnant or on HRT face the same danger. Oestrogen fuels potentially deadly deep vein thrombosis in some mothers-to-be - and in women using the pill or HRT. The blockages usually start in the legs. They can move up, triggering a heart attack or stroke. Dr Spratt, of Maine Medical Centre in Portland, told Daily Mail that research that help them understand how the coronavirus causes blood clots may also provide them with new knowledge regarding how they form in other settings, and how to prevent them. "As more information emerges regarding the effects of Covid-19, questions arise as to whether infection aggravates blood clots and strokes associated with combined oral contraceptives and other oestrogen therapies, as well as pregnancy-associated risk," said Dr Spratt. "In pregnancy, the risk of blood clots increases four to fivefold. The mechanisms for these and the duration of the effect after discontinuing therapy remain unclear."
