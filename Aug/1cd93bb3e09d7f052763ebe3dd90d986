ONE more win and Chippa United will be safe from relegation. That is the firm belief of coach Lehlohonolo Seema after taking a cursory glance at the bottom half of the table, following this weekend’s results. The narrow, hard-earned 1-0 victory over Baroka FC has moved Chippa to 12th spot with 30 points – six away from automatic relegation, with three matches remaining. Defeat has left Bakgaga knee-deep in trouble, as they are a point above bottom-placed AmaZulu, who are tied on 24 points with Polokwane City. Baroka and Black Leopards are also facing danger, sitting on 25 and 26 points respectively. Seema, however, reckons three more points will ensure the Port Elizabeth-based outfit don’t get sucked into the relegation whirlpool, but maintains their place in the money-spinning Premiership next season. “What’s important is that even if we go on and draw the remaining three games, we will be fine,” he declared. “We will be okay. That is why the weekend win was so crucial. There are no easy games. All teams are fighting, are battling and grinding. We are no different, but are also trying to grind and hang in there so we can start to ensure our safety and focus on the new season.” Chippa will enjoy a five-day, their longest since football returned under Covid-19 lockdown regulations, before they take a short trip to Tuks Stadium for a date with Stellenbosch on Friday. Four days later, they will then travel to Orlando Stadium to face Kaizer Chiefs and complete their season with a home fixture against Golden Arrows. On the other hand, Baroka sit on the foothills of the Kilimanjaro mountain where they have to climb to safety. Their fixture list from hell includes a visit to Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United, and a home game against Kaizer Chiefs. Things are not really not looking good for coach Dylan Kerr, whose side have only picked up two points from a possible nine. “We’ve got to do better, especially in and around the penalty area. We to have improve,” said Kerr.
