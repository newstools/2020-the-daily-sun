THE Absa Premiership is set for a nail-biting finish after Mamelodi Sundowns matches Kaizer Chiefs 53 points at the top of the table. This comes after the defending champions recorded a 1-0 victory over Ernst Middendorp charges on Thursday night in a match that took place at an empty Orlando Stadium. Despite both teams having 53 points after 23 matches of the 2019-20 season, Chiefs remain at the top with a better goal difference. Gaston Sirino first half goal was the difference between the two sides in the match that was believed will give an insight of what will happen in the league title race as if had Chiefs won, they were going to open a six points lead. Seventeen-year-old Keletso Sifama was handed his first Chiefs start replacing Leonardo Castro, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the season due to an injury. On the other hand, Sundowns started with Kennedy Mweene as Denis Onyango failed a late fitness test.
