After appearing on Robert Marawa's Sport Worldwide on Tuesday, former Proteas wicked keeper Thami Tsolekile, who was suspended for 12 years from the game for his role in the 2015 match-fixing, has launched a scathing attack on the the former Proteas captain Graeme Smith. He said Smith often left him out of social activities when on tour, and that he facilitated a culture of division in the national set-up. However, Smith has released a statement, in which he pours cold water on the claims. He said he doesn't recall anything of that nature and that he was not in charge of decision making.
