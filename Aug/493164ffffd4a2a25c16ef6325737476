PARENTS are worried about kids going back to school on Monday. They told Daily Sun it was too late to catch up with the curriculum and that the coronavirus was still spreading. Naftal Tivana (45), the father of children in grade 2, grade 7 and matric, said he was not comfortable with the youngest going back to school. “I’m still battling with the older two, who’d already gone back, and now I have to send the little one too. This is too risky for their health and their studies,” he said. “My kids are battling to catch up. I’d have preferred for the government to completely scratch out this year and start afresh next year.” Nthabeleng Rashaga (35), the mum of a grade 1 pupil Ovayi said kids were not ready to go back to school. “The government should have considered starting again next year once the coronavirus deaths had gone down. “People’s behaviour hasn’t changed and now kids have to return to school. “The decision to reopen schools was rushed. Even though it’s hard for me, my child is happy to go back. I pray teachers are well-trained to look after our kids.” Her daughter Ovayi said: “I miss school very much. I miss my friends and my teacher.” Grade 10 pupil Dineo Sefefe (16) said she was happy to go back to school but she was worried she might not pass. “We’re behind and I wonder if we will be able to catch up. “The virus is something that we must all get used to and learn to accept.”
