MZANSI was left stunned on Sunday night when the sister of tombstone tycoon Lebohang Khitsane spilled the beans on his personal life during his televised memorial service. Lebohang was known for designing the tombstones of a number of celebrities including Joe Mafela, Mandoza and Baby Jake Matlala. Everyone was shocked when his sister Semati Moedi alleged her brother’s wife brought another man into his house. Lebohang’s daughter even threw a water bottle at her to get her to stop talking. As the topic was trending, 42-year-old Lesiba Langa from Roodepoort took advantage of the buzz to promote his mobile bar. He created a kwaai cocktail to celebrate Semati and said he wanted Mzansi to taste it. The ingredients of the cocktail, which he has named Rakgadi, are 50ml vodka, 25ml Blue Curacao, 25ml bitters, egg white and a blue sweet fibre garnish.   He said he owned a mobile bar which catered to events like weddings and parties. “We also have a mixer box with cocktail ingredients in it. We sell it for R290 and teach you to make cocktails. “We’re excited to announce the Rakgadi will be in the next mixer box.” Cocktail fan Vicky Mzolo said she’d been trying new drinks and the Rakgadi was a new favourite. “It looks exactly like her: a strong woman who refuses to be told what to do. I love it.” Lebohang’s funeral will take place today.
