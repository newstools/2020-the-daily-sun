THEY are a whopping 10 points behind Absa Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs and with their poor scoring rate, Orlando Pirates are unlikely to collect any trophy this season. Perhaps it is the effects of the long break, as a result of the Covid-19 the outbreak, or weak momentum. But the goal drought is threatening their top-three spot, with the Buccaneers ship now at the risk of running aground. Bucs are yet to score in four matches, including the weekend’s goalless draw against Bidvest Wits, their second match since the league’s restart. In fact, it is five matches, if you consider the fact they won through an own-goal against Black Leopards, in what was their last victory in February. They could drop down to the fourth spot this morning, depending on results in the other weekend fixtures. In truth, the Soweto giants have grappled with the goal-scoring problem so far this season, even under Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic and Rhulani Mokwena. Many thought Josef Zinnbauer had finally solved the problem as he guided Bucs to six consecutive victories as soon as he arrived in December. But it seems not, as they let Wits off the hook at Ellis Park on Saturday. Although he initially downplayed the malaise, Zinnbauer may be changing his tune. “It’s true (four-match goal drought). I’ve said it before that when you have a chance and you don’t score, then it is a problem for me as a coach, ” said Zinnbauer. “We played against one of the top teams in the league. Results like these are normal against top teams,” said Zinnbauer. “But now we have to see what comes with the smaller teams. We do all the things right. You can see with the performance but the results are not good for us.” Goal-poacher Gabadinho Mhango is still stuck on 14 goals, followed closely in the charts by Chiefs’ Samir Nurkovic, whose ever-improving form appears to make him a safe bet for the top-scorers award. Zinnbauer will be hoping for a change of fortunes when they host Baroka FC at Ellis Park tomorrow (6pm).
