  Three Golden Arrow buses have been torched during a protest in Cape Town this morning. The incident happened between the R300 and N2, where protesters had blocked the roads with burning tyres. City of Cape Town's Traffic Services spokesman Richard Coleman said protesters have blocked the road with burning tyres, which has resulted in road closures. "Due to protest action, we've got the N2 outgoing at the R300 blocked by tyres that are burning in that roadway. There were also two buses that were set alight on the outgoing lane, and offramp to the R300 North are obstructed. The N2 outgoing is closed at Borchards Quarry Road," said Coleman. Golden Arrow Buses spokeswoman Bronwen Dyke-Beyer confirmed the incident. “Golden Arrow can confirm that three of our buses came under attack this morning in the vicinity of the Symphony Way bridge. Two buses were completely gutted and a third was salvageable. Fortunately, no injuries were reported and the passengers were transferred safely,” she said. The company condemned the continued attack on its buses and commuters. Another bus was burnt in Philippi last week and drivers were assaulted and robbed. “This is completely unacceptable. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. We once again call on the South African Police Services and the authorities to intervene and keep our drivers and passengers safe. People must be able to travel safely without fear of random attacks,” added Dyke-Beyer. She said each bus will cost the company about R2.4 million to replace. “Ultimately some of these costs will, unfortunately, have to be passed on to our passengers,” she said. In last week's incident, the bus was attacked by people who were protesting over electricity. It has not yet established what is the reasons for today’s protest that led to the burning of three buses.
