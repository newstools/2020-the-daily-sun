A SENIOR dietician at Khayelitsha District Hospital in Cape Town has survived Covid-19. Frontline health worker Megan Marais told Daily Sun she got tested in April and her results came back negative. “My husband is also an essential worker, but not in health. We noted he had Covid-19 symptoms: high fever, body pains, slight chest pains, but no shortness of breath. “We went to a public clinic, where he was screened and tested,” said Megan. She said she got tested again in May and tested positive. “I stopped watching the news and listening to the radio as soon as I tested positive because all they talked about was the death rate. “I don’t know where I got it, but I’m a frontline worker. So it’s difficult to know where I was infected, but I am glad I survived.” Megan said she drank lemon with ginger and zinc supplements to boost her immune system. “Media houses should report more on recoveries than the death rate to give people hope. It’s stressful when you are affected and all you hear about is how people are dying.” Megan advised people not to blame themselves when they tested positive, as anyone could be infected with the coronavirus. “Don’t beat yourself up if you get Covid-19. Be transparent about it and help others who’re going through the same struggle. “Check in with colleagues who’ve tested positive. Motivational messages and positive affirmations help a lot,” she said. Sithembiso Magubane of Western Cape Health said Megan received the warmest welcome back at the office in Khayelitsha after she self-isolated at home for weeks. “She and her husband both tested positive and had to go into isolation at home. She encourages emotional support to those who test positive as it goes a long way in easing the recovery process,” he said.
