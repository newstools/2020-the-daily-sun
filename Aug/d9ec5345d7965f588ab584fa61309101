Will Smith has faced his fears and swam in the open ocean, with fish and predators. In an exclusive video with People, Will said he is facing his fears. The 51-year old actor said fear limits you from living. "After working on After Earth, I got introduced to that fear. I'm always running from that fear. And then I started to realise how poisonous fear can be. It steals your ability to be able to enjoy life." Last year, for his 50th birthday, he also took part in two other adrenaline-rushing activities. He skydived with his family and bungee jumped from a helicopter at the Grand Canyon. There is a full episode of his journey called Will Smith: Off The Deep End and it will be broadcast tonight. Also read:Â ANTONIO BANDERAS TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19!
