SCORING an international goal is always an honour, netting on debut even a career highlight. Bafana Bafana have seen a selected few players bag their maiden goals on debut. Here is a list of five internationals who have achieved the rare feat. DOCTOR KHUMALO Arguably the most significant goal of his international career, Khumalo tucked away a penalty in Bafana’s first-ever match, against Cameroon back in 1992. South Africa had just been readmitted back into the international arena and they couldn’t have asked for a better start. JOHN “SHOES” MOSHOEU The late Bafana legend has left a mark so indelible that it is hard to recall the triumphant 1996 team without Moshoeu coming to mind. A key figure in South Africa’s achievements, Shoes got off the mark with a goal on debut, against Botswana in early 1993. JABU MAHLANGU As he was bidding Bafana farewell on their way to the 2002 Fifa World Cup, then President Thabo Mbeki made it a point to warn Jabu to “behave himself”. But that wasn’t the defining moment in Mahlangu’s career. Jabu scored on debut, in a World Cup qualifier, against Lesotho back in 2002. The national team call-up had come just six months after his first appearance for Kaizer Chiefs. KATLEGO MPHELA Goals against Egypt and Spain rank among the best for Mphela’s Bafana career. But it all started with a brace he netted on international debut against Seychelles in 2005. He went on to score 23 international goals. MPHO MAKOLA He may not have gone on to enjoy a stellar international career, but Makola added his name to the list of the select few when he scored on his Bafana debut, in the Nelson Mandela Challenge friendly against Senegal five years ago.
