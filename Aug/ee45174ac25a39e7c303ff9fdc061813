The late veteran actress Mary Twala who passed away last month made her posthumous appearance on Beyonce's Black Is King last night on M-Net. The film follows a young African king who is cast out from his family into an unforgiving world. He subsequently undergoes a journey to reclaim his throne, utilizing the guidance of his ancestors and childhood love. The story is told through the voices of present-day black artists. Mary who plays the role of a sangoma did not get a chance to see her much-anticipated performance. She died last month following a short illness.Â Her son, Somizi Mhlongo, revealed on Twitter that he could not stop crying after seeing her mother's part in the film. Other local entertainers featured include Nandi Madida, Moonchild Sanelly, Busiswa Gqulu, and Warren Masemola. I can't stop crying......with pride pic.twitter.com/IPtFKRQHZq
