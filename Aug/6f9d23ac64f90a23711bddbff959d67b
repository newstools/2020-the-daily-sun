FORMER International Boxing Federation (IBF) heavyweight champion Francios “White Buffalo” Botha has taken his fight outside the ring. The boxing legend’s new opponent is crime. Botha, who has locked horns with formidable opponents in his boxing career, said crime is the toughest opposition he has ever faced. The veteran fighter said he lost millions of rands through crime.  His aim is to prevent it from happening to other people. Botha has joined forces with prominent role players in the security industry. “I lost about R11 million through thieves in business, so I don’t wish that to happen to anyone. That is why I have embarked on this journey of crime prevention. “I’m joined by a prominent security team, PRSS Group of Companies, who have expertise at every level. We pride ourselves with good service. We are currently engaging in Africa and in South Africa, with a big presence and growing rapidly,” said Botha. “The fight against crime is a multi-faceted approach. In order to be successful, you need to be able to offer the client a total solution. By this I mean, understand the clients risk profile, then categorise the risks and offer cost effective solutions that address the risks.” Apart from shifting his attention to fighting crime, the 51-year-old former champion has not retired from the ring. According to the seasoned fighter, because of the performance he display inside the ring, boxing promoters around the world still want to feature him on their bills. Botha spent the better part of his boxing career in America. He has fought some big names in the boxing business such as Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Wladimir Klitschko. He has a film about his life coming up.
