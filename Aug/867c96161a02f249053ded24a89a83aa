CHIPPA United have been dealt a severe blow ahead of the resumption of the Absa Premiership after top scorer, William Twala, was ruled out of contention for the remaining games because of injury. The 30-year-old winger, one of coach Lehlohonolo Seema’s senior lads, is carrying an ankle problem. The Chilli Boys had in recent weeks, since the resumption of training under the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown, been hoping the attacker would pass a fitness test. “He is out of the six remaining games,” Seema said of the Soweto-born player. Incessant injury has curtailed the progress of Twala, who is in his fourth stint with Chippa. He has suffered similar setbacks at previous sides, including Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs. The winger has also been at Free State Stars, Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United. Before his injury, he was enjoying a new lease of life back in Port Elizabeth. He is Chippa’s leading scorer with four goals, which were managed from 21 league appearances and a single outing in the Telkom Knockout to eventual winners, Mamelodi Sundowns, who prevailed 6-5 on penalties in a quarter-final fixture that ended two-all in regulation time. Twala’s last match was a goalless draw away to Bidvest Wits on 7 March. That was also the last for Chippa before the lockdown and the only match Rhulani Mokwena was in the dugout. Seema has since assumed the reins and leads the Eastern Cape-based side against fellow coastal side, Cape Town City, at Orlando Stadium on Friday (3.30pm). Chippa’s last encounter of the 2019-20 campaign is against Golden Arrows at the same venue on 5 September 5. Seema said the 12th-placed Chippa’s mission is to retain the top flight status. – CAJ News
