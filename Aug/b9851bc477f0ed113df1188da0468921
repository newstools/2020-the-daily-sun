A PORT Elizabeth-based Malawian was found guilty yesterday of swindling a former teacher of all his pension. The Port Elizabeth Specialised Commercial Crimes Court found Bashir Lauw Kasenjera guilty of defrauding teacher Mlungisi Booi (44) of R669 000. Kasenjera, who’s in the country illegally, was found guilty of corruption and breaking the Consumer Protection Act. NPA spokesman Anelisa Ngcakani said in June 2017, Booi saw an advertisement where a Professor Anadkat promised to work miracles with money. Booi called him, and Kasenjera visited him in Motherwell. “Kasenjera introduced himself as ‘Professor Anadkat’. For four months Kasenjera subjected the victim to spiritual rituals which led Booi to believe Kasenjera could establish contact between the complainant and his ancestors. “He convinced him to resign as a high school teacher and promised he would cleanse the money so the ancestors would multiply it to R30 million.” Ngcakani said Booi resigned in October 2017 and received a pension of just over R1 042 million in March. “Kasenjera swindled R669 000 from the victim. He convinced Booi to make withdrawals and hand over the money so he would cleanse it for Booi’s ancestors to multiply it. Booi never received his money back.” She said Kasenjera was bust during April 2018 by Motherwell detectives, during when Kasenjera tried to bribe them with R100 000 for his release. “Advocate Lise Keech said a minimum sentence of 15 years is applicable to the fraud count and 18 years for the corruption count. She said citizens were daily scammed by syndicates, especially the ancestral and black dollar scams and it was difficult for police to find the suspects as they have forged passports, are in the country illegally and use false names and cellphones Rica’d in others’ names.” Sentencing will be on 21 August.
