FORMER International Boxing Organisation (IBO) welterweight champion, Thulani “Tulz Evolution” Mbenge, has tipped Shawn Porter to dethrone his conqueror when they lock horns on 22 August. After losing the WBC crown in a unification battle against IBF champion Errol Spencer Jr, Porter has turned to the less recognised IBO belt held by Sebastian Formella. The former two-time world welterweight champion will oppose the unbeaten German fighter in America. Mbenge, who lost the IBO welterweight belt to Formella with a controversial decision, does not think the champion will have enough firepower against more experienced Porter. The local boxer believes he was the victim of a hometown decision against the unbeaten Formella. “I have nothing against the champion and wish him luck in his contest, but I don’t see Formella beating Porter,” said Mbenge. “Even in our clash, he did not deserve victory because it was in his backyard and the judges gave the fight to him. “Porter is a big name and has fought the best in the boxing business while his counterpart has not been engaged in tough battles, this would be a test of character for Formella. He is going to hand over his title to Porter.” The hard-hitting pugilist from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape has not fought since the Formella defeat. He was expected to make his ring return in March against Congolese boxer Kuvesa Katembo but the showdown was cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The talented fighter said he is working to step up to the next level. The Boxing SA 2018 Fighter of the Year is two contests away from returning to the top. “I have been out of action for quite some time so I need two warm-up fight so I can swim with the sharks. I’m hoping to fight top guys like Porter and Keith Thurman in the near future. Formella’s camp did not want to exercise the rematch clause in their fight contract instead chose to defend against Roberto Arriaza in January,” he said.
