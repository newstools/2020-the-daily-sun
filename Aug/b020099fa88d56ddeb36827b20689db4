UKHOZI FM DJ, Nonhlanhla “Mdonso” Ngcobo-Pottier, is spreading her wings. She recorded songs with scathamiya group Colenso Abafana Benkokhelo to break the genre’s male stereotype. The Nkandla-born DJ said women should be given an opportunity to show their talent in the genre. Mdonso, who presents Kwasa Okungaliyo on Mondays, told SunBuzz:“I grew up listening to Colenso Abafana Benkokhelo. “My brothers used to play their music and I had a big wish to meet and sing with them one day.

When their leader gave me an opportunity to sing with them I didn’t hesitate. “It’s a big history for me and for women to get this opportunity.” At Ukhozi FM she first co-presented maskandi show Sigiya Ngengoma with Zimdollar Biyela, and before that did Zululand FM’s Ivume Wethu for over 10 years. She said the songs, Izinto Zabantu and Umfanomemezayo, will be featured on the group’s album Impolompolo coming out next month. Group leader Victor “Mfoka Schithamthombo” Mkhize said they featured Mdonso to celebrate Women’s Month. “I believe I should give anyone a chance if I see talent. Last year she told me about her love for my group.”
