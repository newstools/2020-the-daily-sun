MZANSI’s up and coming boxing trainer Damien Durandt has made a plea to the authorities, asking for the resumption of the sport in South Africa. His desperate request came after other boxing nations such Britain, America, Thailand and Nicaragua have returned to the ring. Durandt, the son of the late legendary boxing trainer and manager Nick Durandt, wants Mzansi boxing to also follow in those countries footsteps. “This coronavirus is indefinite, we need to find a way around it, follow strict safety protocols and slowly return to the ring. “There is no point in waiting for a miracle to happen as we don’t know how long the virus will be with us, it can take two years or more, we really don’t know,” said Durandt. The young boxing mentor said the local promoters could also adopt a similar strategy used by British promoter Eddie Hearn. On his upcoming events, Hearn will provide testing for Covid-19 and a camp where fighters can self-isolate until test results are out. Also, the boxers on the fight card will train at the same camp and the entire event will adhere to lockdown regulations. Durandt believes with all the safety measures adhered to, the return to competitive boxing can be a success. “I know that can be an expensive exercise but a worthwhile one. We cannot afford to miss a year, we have fighters like Moruti Mthalane and Nkosinathi Joyi who are in the last days of their careers and cannot afford to lose a year. “Others such as Hekkie Budler have not fought for a while and we all know what ring rust does to a boxer,” he said. Durandt adds with the global economy knocked out by the pandemic, boxers must also be prepared to take a purse cut. Durandt rewrote boxing history by being the youngest trainer to guide a fighter to World Boxing Council (WBC) world championship glory. His charge Ilunga Makabu Jr outpointed Michael Cieslak to capture the much sought after green and gold belt in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo in January.
