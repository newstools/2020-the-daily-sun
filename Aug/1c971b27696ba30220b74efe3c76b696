PHETOLO Lebepe is a record producer of note. He’s well known in the music industry as Drum Pope. His winning formula has earned him recognition in dance music. The 26-year-old from Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, has worked on projects such as the hit song Collide by Lady Zamar in 2017. He also worked on Akhiwe, Oskido’s single last year, and Nay Lento by Mzekezeke in 2018. “I did the beat and Mjakes Thebe did the recording,” said Drum Pope about Mzekezeke’s track. He’s also worked with Bongo Maffin on Vuma. Drum Pope said his job is to bring all the elements together. “Record producing is what I know best. It makes me happy. I’m alive when I’m recording a song. “That’s why a studio is my sacred place. This is where I pour my heart out and it’s my home.” He has released two singles, Party Robbery featuring Emza, Rea and Yv, and Andizi featuring Moneoa. They are both available on all digital platforms. Drum Pope is working on a full album, Son of a Drum (Inkedama). “It will be my first album,” he said..
