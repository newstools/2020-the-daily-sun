EAT or be eaten! This is the attitude in the GladAfrica Championship. With five games remaining before the curtain comes down on the longest season ever, there’s a lot at stake and it’s every one for himself. All have somehow been affected by coronavirus, then there’s excuse for any club except to dust themselves and move on. Ajax Cape Town are currently leading the pack with 51 points, followed by the ambitious Swallows FC who have gathered 42 points in 25 outings. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Uthongathi remain third and fourth on 41 points, respectively. Tomorrow Ajax are at Sturrock Park where they will be tested by TTM, who have vowed to fight until the end as they chase a rare title victory. Ajax coach Calvin Marlin said they need to score goals. “We have conceded a lot of goals,”said Marlin. “Now we need to be more aggressive upfront while keeping a clean sheet.” At the bottom of the table, there’s also a dogfight where Jomo Cosmos are haunted by possibilities of a drop to the ABC Motsepe League. Teams that finish in position 15 and 16 will be relegated, and Cosmos, who are frequently dropping points, could return to the lower ranks. They are currently 15th on the log with 22 points from 25 matches. TS Galaxy, TS Sporting, Mbombela United (all from Mpumalanga), Cape Umoya and Royal Eagles are the other sides who will be fighting for survival. This weekend the GladAfrica will continue with all 16 teams in action.
