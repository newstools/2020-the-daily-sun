PEPUBLIC Works Minister Patricia de Lille and head of infrastructure development in the presidency, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, held a virtual media briefing yesterday. Speaking about the Infrastructure Investment Plan, De Lille said during Covid-19 there was an even greater need to invest in infrastructure to drive social and economic growth. This was critical in achieving economic justice by connecting people and bringing people closer to work opportunities. She said with the infrastructure backlog, it was clear government couldn’t do it alone. “Once we pulled all the infrastructure projects in the country together, the public and private sector worked together to see how we can improve on the implementation of infrastructure projects from the onset,” she said. She said they had gazetted the first projects. The minister said investment, delivery and implementation had to be accountable and data driven, ensuring communities were engaged and involved. “The construction industry is also a sector which is significantly plagued by corruption, and we are working on systems to prevent and detect corruption,” she said. “Corruption steals from the poor, and that is something we can ill afford. “Corruption in this crucial job creation industry must come to an end.” She said infrastructure was about people having water to drink, decent roads and bridges to cross to go to school, work or to access government clinics.
