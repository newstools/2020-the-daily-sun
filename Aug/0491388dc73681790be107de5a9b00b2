THE live events and technical production sector is threatening to shut down the media industry. This is to force Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa to open live events.  The movement’s spokesman, Kagiso Moima Wa Masimini, said: “We want a specific relief fund for business in the live events and technical production sector and a relaxation of fund application requirements for freelancers in the sector. “We demand recognition of the sector and a seat at the table, so we can partake in decision-making processes.” The sector is preparing for a march themed, #Flightcasemovement against Mthethwa on 8 September.
