 Cape Town will play host to the Miss South Africa finale for the first time in the history of the pageant. Miss South Africa 2020 will be crowned at a spectacular and entertainment-packed event, which takes place on Saturday, October 24, from 17:00 and which will be screened live on M-Net, Mzansi Magic and streamed for an international audience.   CEO of the Miss South Africa Organisation, Stephanie Weil, echoed his sentiments: "We are delighted that Miss South Africa will come to the homes of thousands of South Africans, as well as people from around the world, from Cape Town. The city is the 11th contestant this year. We will be announcing the venue in the Mother City at a later date."  For the first time in the history of the Miss South Africa pageant, the contestants who make the top 3 will represent the country at the world's three most prestigious pageants. Previously, the Miss South Africa Organisation sent a representative to both Miss Universe and Miss World, but will also now be fielding a candidate at Miss Supranational.
