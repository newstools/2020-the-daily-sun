GOAL drought remains cause for concern since the resumption of Premier Soccer League (PSL). Both in the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship clubs are lacking killer instinct. And Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt says even before lockdown his side has not been clinical. On Tuesday Wits were held to another goalless draw by Golden Arrows in a league match at FNB Stadium. Wits dominated the play for much of the match, but could not find the final ball to score as their run of three successive draws continued to leave the side two points off third-placed Orlando Pirates, albeit with two games in hand. “It has been the story of our season in front of goal, even before lockdown,” Hunt said. “I thought we played some very good stuff against a competitive team, I mean they (Golden Arrows) were biting in midfield and really pressing us.“They had the chance, they hit the post in the first minute, and then we hit the crossbar twice. We had some great opportunities around the box we just didn’t get the final ball and the final pass.“The (FNB Stadium) pitch left a lot to be desired, it looks nice from far but very bumpy. But all-in-all I thought it was a good game. We pegged them back and then they hit you on the counter-attack, they are very quick.“You can’t fault the effort, the heart and the desire was there. We are playing to win but it is not to be at the moment.”Wits' next game is against relegation-threatened AmaZulu on Friday (3pm) at FNB Stadium.Hunt said: “We play all the teams that are fighting down the bottom now, and those games are not easy. "They are fighting their own corner, and we are fighting to climb the table.“It is certainly still do-able to finish in the top two or three, but we have not made our games in hand count, because we certainly are lacking up front.”
