THE Premier Soccer League made its return after a 147-day absence as Bloemfontein Celtic cruised to the finals of the Nedbank Cup. The action resumed behind closed doors at Orlando Stadium on Saturday which gave a sense of relief that domestic football was finally up and running once more. Celtic scored three goals which ensured their spot in the Nedbank Cup final as they thumped depleted Baroka FC 3-0 at the dry and woeful pitch of Orlando Stadium. Ndumiso Mabena opened the score sheet in the first-half injury time making sure his side go to the break leading. Victor Letsoalo from extended the lead on the 83rd-minute from a spot kick and nailed the final nail on the 90th minute. From the first minute, Celtic were on the front foot early on as Mabena had a chance to open the scoring early as the eighth minute but his strike went wide. Baroka were struggling for rhythm from the onset and things became worse on the 32 minutes when they were reduced to 10 men after Gebhardt was shown a straight red card after tackling Lucky Baloyi. The Limpopo based outfit seemed to lack fitness as their coach did mention it ahead of the game that they did not have much time to prepare and be at their best level, however, he did say that will not be an excuse. Before kick-off, there was a minute's silence in memory of those who have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The silence enforced on this occasion by circumstances, with barely 250 people inside the venue. Celtic will now face the winner between Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns who will lock horns at the same venue this evening 7;15pm.
