Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane admits that playing two matches in a space of three days took its toll on his players as they were held to goalless draw against Orlando Pirates. The two Absa Premiership giants met in the Buccaneers' first match in four months following the lengthy pause on football in South Africa. Having bagged a 3-2 win over Bidvest Wits on Saturday, the Brazilians showed glimpses of fatigue but held on against a much fresher-looking Pirates outfit. "Yes, a game of two halves for us, we were much better in the first-half, second-half we have to give it to Orlando Pirates, let's be honest and they missed two chances to be honest. Okay, we had one [chance] but not really convincing," Mosimane told SuperSport TV. "The second-half they took it, you could see they were much stronger, much fresher than us in the second-half. We survived a bit, Mosa (Lebusa) calf [injury], you know. But it's okay, it's a good point, we'll take a point. We're playing Orlando Pirates remember..." Mosimane then went on to explain his reasons for choosing Jose Ali Meza and Andile Jali to replace Keletso Makgalwa and Themba Zwane. "We put Ali (Meza) there to put more fresh legs, I think Keletso (Makgalwa) ran enough, 'Mshishi' (Themba Zwane) also, we put Andile (Jali) to help us in midfield because we could see that they were going through, to make sure that we strengthen the midfield because we had a problem there,” Mosimane said. "They were going through, and I played a three-man midfield. But it's football, we're going for the long haul, it's a good point, don't undermine a point against Orlando Pirates. It's a big point, two tough games, Wits and Orlando Pirates. Yes, not bad. It's still a long haul, we're still going," he said. SOURCE: SPORT24
