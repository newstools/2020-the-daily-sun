Ford’s newest bakkie the Ranger Thunder was officially launched in Mzansi today. The entertaining virtual launch was presented by DJ Angie Khumalo and funny man Jason Goliath. The Ranger Thunder slots in between the WildTrak and Raptor. The newest addition is a looker and a limited-edition model. The Ranger Thunder has a tweaked honeycomb-style front grille incorporating red accents for the side “nostrils”. The Ranger Thunder has a nice new touch in terms of practicality – the lockable “Mountain Top” black roller shutter to safely secure your goods while the bed divider also securely holds different-sized items. Inside the cabin the Thunder is kitted out with black leather on the dash, steering wheel, gear lever and handbrake, and black leather seats with red stitching. Under the hood the 2.0 litre bi-turbo engine generates 157 kW and decent torque of 500 Nm. The engine is mated to a 10-speed auto transmission.  The Ranger Thunder models are exclusively available in Sea Grey, Frozen White, Absolute Black and Moondust Silver. The Ranger’s towing capacity of up to 3 500kg remains unchanged in the Thunder.  The Thunder also has the same ground clearance of 230 mm. Additional features available on the Ranger Thunder include Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Forward Collision Alert.
