SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is happy to call Bidvest Wits stadium their home until the end of the season. All Premiership teams were allocated a new home stadium in Gauteng to complete the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season after a four month hiatus because of the coronavirus. Matsatsantsa a PitoriÂ will return to action next Sunday (16 August) against Bloemfontein Celtic at their new venue. Tembo is confident his side will adjust to their new surroundings. "We will be playing our home matches at Bidvest Stadium and we are happy about it," Tembo told the club website. "It's a compact stadium and has a very good playing surface that suits our style of play, and we have always played well there. "The players are also looking good at training but we will have a clear understanding of where they are in terms of match fitness after our first game. "Because we haven't had an opportunity to play friendly matches during our preparations due to strict health regulations which we have to adhere to." Tembo added that so far his players have not suffered any injuries. "The team has been doing well and coping with the load in terms of training and it's good that we haven't had serious muscle injuries. "We would also like to thank everyone who played a role in the resumption of the league so that we can all go back to do what we love which is playing football," he concluded.
