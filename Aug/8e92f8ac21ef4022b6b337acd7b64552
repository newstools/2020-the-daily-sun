Isipingo cops arrested a 44-year-old suspect murder and
attempted murder. Cops managed to make a breakthrough when he was traced and
arrested in Umlazi where he was hiding and evading police. According to police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala, the
suspect was found in possession of a firearm suspected to be used in the
commission of the crime. “The firearm will be subjected to ballistic testing to
ascertain if it was linked to the case as well as any other serious crimes
reported in the country.” Gwala added that his arrest came after an incident on 27
June 2020 at Malukazi, where Mzwandile Jwara (28) was shot and killed when he
was with his girlfriend. “The suspect fired shots at the deceased’s girlfriend but
the bullet missed her. She managed to grab the firearm and the magazine came
out and a round of ammunition fell on the ground. The suspect fled the scene
and was on the run since then. “The investigation revealed that the suspect was the
ex-boyfriend of the woman who survived. He is expected to appear before the
Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 31 August 2020 on charges of murder and
attempted murder,” Gwala said.
