CAPE Town City FC have finally registered their first away win of the season. The Citizens defeated Chippa United 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match that was played at Orlando Stadium on Friday afternoon. Kermit Erasmus who just returned from a long term injury scored the solitary goal in the first half of the match which saw them collecting maximum points. Erasmus capped his return in style on 17 minutes after leaping unmarked in the area to nod home Fagrie Lakay’s cross after possession turnover from the Chilli Boys. The result saw the Capetonians becoming the first club in the PSL to win a match since the football resumed under the safe ‘bio-bubble’ camp. The Premier Soccer League season was halted by the coronavirus in March. Jan Olde Riekerink City, moved up to ninth position with the victory and are now just one point behind eight-placed Highlands Park. After an almost five months layoff due to the pandemic, the clubs continued to struggled against injuries. City were forced to make changes straight after halftime as captain Thamsanqa Mkhize was removed after picking up an injury and replaced by Ebrahim Seedat. The Chilli Boys reduced to ten players in the final ten minutes when defender Kelvin Moyo saw red for a second bookable offence. After the baptism of fire, new Chili Boys coach, Lehlohonolo Seema will now be hoping to get back the club to winning ways on Tuesday when they host Highlands Park at the same venue at 3.30 pm. Seema took over from Rhulani Mokwena whose contract with the Chilli Boys wasn't renewed at the end of June.
