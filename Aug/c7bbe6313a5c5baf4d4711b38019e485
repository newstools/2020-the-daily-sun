There’s a heartbreaking trend of fathers who abandon their children after breaking up with the mothers. Children who grow up without a balance of both mother and father figure are easily influenced by their peers to do drugs and gangsterism. The need for both parents guidance is essential as children go through various stages of life. Without downplaying the brilliant job single mothers are doing in raising responsible kids, a traditional family structure is needed for stability. Irrespective of the separation between two parents, there’s no law that prohibits the father to be in the life of his child. Today’s fathers run away from the responsibility of supporting their children financially and spiritually. Co-parenting makes raising a child more exciting and easier to carry out. Some fathers leave the responsibility of raising their kids to the mothers alone, only to return later wondering why their children are straying. That you were never ready to be a father isn’t an excuse to be absent in your child’s life. Mothers need fathers support to raise happy and well-developed children.
