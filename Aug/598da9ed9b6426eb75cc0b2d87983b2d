IT WAS like witnessing the failure of justice, said the family of the late Prince Manzini (45). The family from KaBokweni, Mpumalanga, said Prince (45) was one of hundreds who attended an ANC branch general meeting to nominate candidates for the 13th Mpumalanga ANC Provincial General Conference when he was killed on 15 March. Five suspects were bust last month and received R1 000 bail in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court last Thursday. The family, presented by Mabuza Attorneys, has taken legal action against the ANC, claiming R10 million in compensation. Prince’s uncle, Jabulani Mathumbu (56), told Daily Sun the family believes the ANC should’ve made sure there was adequate security. “Knowing very well there were two factions who’re fighting, the ANC should’ve prepared for the chaos,” he said. In a letter sent to the ANC, Mabuza Attorneys said Prince was killed due to negligent conduct.  They said the organisation failed to make sure only accredited members of the ANC attended the meeting, and people who killed the deceased were its members, or people who attended the meeting at the request of members. Mathumbu said Prince dedicated his life to the ANC and had missed important family meetings. Prince’s daughter, Princess Manzini, said: “The way things are carrying on, it seems like nobody died. “My father’s life was worth a thousand. Nothing can bring back my father’s life.” ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said they’re speaking to their legal team.
