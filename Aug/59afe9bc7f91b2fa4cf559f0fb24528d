Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development’s R14,4 billion revised budget is welcome, given the fallout from the coronavirus. The department now needs to balance its act towards financing its obligations. Minister Thoko Didiza’s stance that it’s sticking to its mandate to address land redistribution, agricultural and security of tenure issues is encouraging. Rapid release of state land, acceleration and resolution of old order claims, development of communal tenure legislation and post-settlement support to farmers who receive land through reform are some budget speech highlights. Budget cuts on food security, land restitution, redistribution and tenure reform are worrying. These programmes are key to achieving food stability and economic transformation. But I was happy to hear the minister calling for an improvement in market access and prioritisation of the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area. This will go a long way in assisting local farmers gain access to big markets. According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the free trade area is a market space of all 55 African countries. Combined in a free trade area, it covers over 1,2 billion people with a combined GDP of about R42 trillion. By Themba Mzula Hleko, Rosslyn Gardens.
