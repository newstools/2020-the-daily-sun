DA leadership contender Mbali Ntuli has challenged interim leader John Steenhuisen to at least four televised debates. Ntuli said it was time for the party to stop bombarding voters with how bad the ANC was and start having real conversations. The party’s former youth leader also raised concerns about the planned virtual elective conference, which she said could be rigged. She said she’d raised her concern with the federal council. “The system will not allow for any verification of who’s actually voting and cannot be audited on this basis,” she said. Ntuli said she couldn’t find any reason why Steenhuisen couldn’t accept her challenge, which was important as they had notably different manifestoes. “Do they vote for John, a candidate who’s part of the existing establishment, or do they vote for a candidate that wishes to re-imagine what South Africa could look like.” She said members had the opportunity to choose between Steenhuisen, who never had a constituency in the party, and one who’d established branches and grown the party in rural KZN. Ntuli said her vision for the party was to form coalitions with other small parties, which the DA had struggled with in the past. Steenhuisen said he’d accept the challenge if it was supported by the party. He didn’t share Ntuli’s concerns about virtual voting. “The party committed to ensuring every delegate is able to cast a vote fairly and such votes are recorded correctly and verified.”
