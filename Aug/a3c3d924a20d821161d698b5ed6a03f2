SIX boreholes meant to boost running water in Thulamahashe kasi near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga have been trashed and have become a hot spot for thugs and drug abusers. The SunTeam visited some of the holes behind nearby Thulamahashe Plaza and was greeted by a gang of smokers who had locked themselves inside, as some were still asleep. One of the youth said: “This is a nice corner for us to eat the drugs without any disturbance, so we use this shelter because the municipality abandoned it”. A worried PAC regional chairman Henny Ndlovu said: “This is a waste of taxpayers’ money by the struggling municipality. We tracked down one of the suspects involved in the stealing of borehole equipment in October last year and reported the matter to the municipality. “But nothing came forth. The municipality erected these six boreholes last July, but they abandoned them for no reason. All we see here is vandalism and a hot spot for drugs and criminals.” Resident Sbongile Nyambi (57) said: “We haven’t had water for a couple of months. If it were not for Good Samaritan foreign traders who offer us water from their boreholes, we would have died of thirst. The municipality does not care about us.” Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said they were investigating.
