ROYAL Eagles have touched down at the biologically safety environment (BSE) in Gauteng. Eagles were in danger of being thrown out of the bubble by the PSL following talks that they were struggling financially to comply with the NSL Covid-19 regulations. However, an excited club chairman Sbu Mpisane said everything is now in order to fight and remain in the GladAfrica Championship next season. Eagles, who Mpisane was co-owning last season along with his ex-wife, Shauwn until the bitter split, are at the bottom of the Championship table with 18 points from 24 matches. They have been at the foot of the table for the majority of the season. “Eagles have landed, bow down. Bubble it is, fake news must fall,” Mpisane told SunSport. Mpisane didn’t end things there. He lashed out at people assuming that his club was struggling financially to meet the new regulations, saying he was okay to be written off. “People are saying 'I don’t have money and its over for me', it’s okay,” added Mpisane. Mpisane has a surprise in store to those who have doubted him and his team. “Royal Eagles will probably be the only club who will have its own ambulance written the names of the club. We’ll also have two club vehicles and those vehicles will drive to Joburg,” he said. “Even if those buses are not allowed to enter the bubble, it’s okay. This is just to show the world that we are ready. When we are going to train, we are going to have our own medical team and add security personnel who will be fully armed.” The KwaZulu-Natal side will resume their campaign against Free State Stars at Sturrock Park Stadium tomorrow (3.30 pm).
