BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt does not feel as though his players have been rewarded for their performances since the resumption of football following a 1-1 Absa Premiership draw against Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday. That result follows a 3-2 Nedbank Cup semifinal defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns last weekend, and Hunt feels in both instances Wits deserved more from the game. They did rally late on to draw level with Chiefs via a Cole Alexander goal, with the midfielder also spurning a chance to grab a dramatic winner. "We're very disappointed," Hunt said. "I thought we should have won the game. With everything that's gone in our lives, the football club, the players, myself, it looks like it was against us again. "I felt we really had them, similar to Saturday, you know, you've got to score, we had great chances tonight, certainly the better ones and that one at the end, from our pressing we hit the post, but you know it's been the story of our season. If we had a 15-goal striker, we would have won the league by now. "I just feel for the players. They deserve much more than Saturday and tonight. But that's football. That's life. But we've got to be strong here and keep it together for the next three weeks and plug away." Wits are next in action against Orlando Pirates on Saturday at Ellis Park in what is a tough start to the resumption for The Clever Boys.
