A UNIVERSITY has told its students to
wear masks during sex and opt for masturbation where possible to help stop the
spread of coronavirus. "You are your safest sex
partner", a pamphlet of "COVID-19 Considerations" distributed by
the University of Georgia advises. The advice continues: "Avoid
kissing and be creative with sexual positions that reduce close face-to-face
contact. "Consider wearing a face mask
during sex." The advice echoes that of the New York
City Health Department, which issued guidance earlier this year suggesting
people get "creative with sexual positions". The Sun reports that British Columbia's
department of health also issued similar advice, advocating the use of glory
holes. "Use barriers, like walls, (eg
glory holes), that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face
contact," guidance reads. The University of Georgia's advice was,
somewhat unsurprisingly, mocked on social media. "People are mocking them because it
seems ridiculous to take measures to prevent the spread of covid during sex,
and these are precautions that realistically nobody is actually going to
take," one Twitter user wrote. Another added: "I mean, if ever
there was a need to get creative it would be now."
