CHAOS erupted on the wet streets of Cape Town on Saturday. This after an anti-violence protest turned violent outside Parliament. Over 900 people including bikers, took to the streets to protest against government’s failure to contain gender-based violence. They arrived at Parliament around 11am, but cops wanted them to disperse after an hour. Protesters didn’t want to leave without handing over a memorandum of grievances.

You don’t know how to protect women, but are good at chasing people calling for the attack on women to end,” shouted one woman. Anti-GBV Movement’s Jesse Brand condemned cops for their “heavy-handedness” in dealing with the protesters. “It’s unfair that the women of South Africa have to put themselves in more danger by coming to a protest. This is a men’s fight, women shouldn’t be fighting this fight,” said Brand. Cops and protesters spent over 30 minutes running after each other on Roeland and Plein streets. This is when several protesters were bust. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. “Cape Town police are investigating cases of public violence, malicious damage to property, transgressions relating to the Disaster Management Act and attempted murder following a protest on the corner of Roeland and Buitenkant streets on Saturday. “According to reports, a group of about 500 bikers and 400 people participated in a gender-based violence and femicide protest. Cops took action to disperse the crowd and arrested 18 people. They are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrates Court today. He said cops and other law enforcement agencies continued to monitor the situation.
