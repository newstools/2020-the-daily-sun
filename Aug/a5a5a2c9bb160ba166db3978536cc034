MYSTERY surrounding the disappearance of Nomvuzo  Atoli (22) on Wednesday night was solved
yesterday morning. Her body was found at a dumpsite in Nyanga, Cape Town! She’d gone out for drinks the previous night at Siyanyanzela
squatter camp. Her boyfriend Babalo Funda said Nomvuzo was having drinks
with friends when he left her. He said: “She didn’t drink a lot, but decided to have drinks
yesterday. I received the call this morning. I’m shocked.” Aunt Nokwandisa Nyalelo (54) said when Nomvuzo didn’t come
home they assumed she was sleeping over somewhere.   Said Nokwandisa: “We’re devastated. Nomvuzo was a good
child. She didn’t deserve to die like this.” Residents apparently discovered Nomvuzo’s body while looking
for bottles to recycle. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A murder case has been
opened for investigation by Nyanga police after the body of a 22-year-old woman
was found this morning at Siyanyanzela squatter camp in Nyanga. “Cops were alerted to the discovery of the body and, on
arrival, found it at the dumpsite with head injuries.” No one had been arrested and investigations were under way.
