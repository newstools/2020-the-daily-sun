Since then, Tshonono Buyeye was the acting mayor. Bobani was also a deputy mayor during the DA-led coalition tenure in the City Hall. ANC regional task team co-ordinator Luyolo Nqakula said: “We wish to state clearly that we outright reject Bobani’s appointment. We will never support any decisions taken by the ‘Black Caucus’ which is not born out of engagement and consultation, especially in a position which was occupied by the ANC as an organisation. “As such, the ANC views the action of the Black Caucus as undermining to the ANC as an organisation,” he said.
