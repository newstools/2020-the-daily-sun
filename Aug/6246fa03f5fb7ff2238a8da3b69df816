DUMA kaNdlovu, creator of Muvhango, has instructed senior staff to deal with sexual harassment claims urgently before it harms his company’s reputation. This comes after a female staff member at Word of Mouth Pictures, the production company for the SABC2 soapie, lodged a complaint against a male colleague. According to insiders, both the man and woman are crew members.
