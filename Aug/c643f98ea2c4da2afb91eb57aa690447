NTWENHLE has gone into labour and her child is arriving at any moment. Her water broke while having dinner with family and Jabu, who passed out. This after Ntwenhle’s father Mandla invited Jabu for pre-dinner drinks at his tavern. But this is where things went wrong. After trying to force Jabu to drink alcohol, he drugged him and poured a substance into his cold drink before serving it to him. The effects of the drug took over while Jabu was having dinner and he passed out, minutes before Ntwenhle’s contractions. Mandla and Samson really messed things up this time around. One wonders if they’ll confess. On Skeem Saam, Noah is facing jail time after the police found evidence against him from the fire at the factory that resulted in a death. The camera pinned him there moments before the fire broke out. Now they’ve also found his socks at the scene. But his mum Mokgadi is trying to cover up for him and they’ve lied to the cops. His trial is about to start and he’d better tell the truth, or else he’ll be spending the rest of his life behind bars.
