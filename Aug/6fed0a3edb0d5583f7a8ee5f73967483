A HEATED argument ensued between Zondo Commission chairman, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, and witness Judge Tintswalo Makhubele yesterday over the recusal of the evidence leader. Makhubele didn’t want to be led by Advocate Vas Soni. She cited conflict of interest after allegedly having done some work for Prasa. She also wanted her evidence to be postponed as she didn’t have senior counsel to represent her. Zondo dismissed the postponement application, saying the judge had enough time to get counsel to represent her. Makhubele accused Zondo of not reading her whole affidavit, where she gives reasons why she seeks that relief. She said there was a specific prayer in her affidavit that dealt with Soni’s conduct. “There’s a prayer specifically seeking the recusal of Advocate Soni,” said Makhubele. “He’s the reason I pulled out of the consultations with the legal team. “You can’t expect me to be led by him without you first hearing why I say he shouldn’t lead me. “You can call any person from the legal team to lead me, but not Advocate Soni.” She said she needed more time to brief her attorneys. “You’re effectively denying me legal representation if I have to present this application myself. “If you say I must proceed today, the question is: ‘Who’s going to be leading me?’” she said. When Zondo asked Soni to respond to the allegations, Makhubele wasn’t happy that Soni responded from the bar. She wanted him to file a sworn affidavit. “But a judge has filed an affidavit under oath. Why can’t he file his under oath,” she protested. Makhubele was ordered to file her written submission on the recusal by Friday, while the legal team will file theirs later.
