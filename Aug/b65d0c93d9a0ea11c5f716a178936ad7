TRIBUTES continue to pour in for the late PowerFM Programmes Manager, Bob "The Jammer" Mabena, across the entertainment industry. But the sporting fraternity cannot be left left behind as the well-travelled entertainment veteran was also attached to sport, especially his favourite club Mamelodi Sundowns. The late broadcaster used every second that he can get on air to voice his views of football and gave courage to Sundowns to continue winning trophies. As a personal friend, Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane saw the importance of also paying tribute to the 51-year-old broadcaster who doubled up as musician, and TV show host. Mosimane says he could not believe it when he heard that "The Jammer" passed on following a cardiac arrest on Monday. "Our heartfelt condolences to Bob's family. They should know that not only they have lost, not only Sundowns, but the whole country, the entertainment industry has lost a giant, I saw even the President has send his message too," Mosimane said. Listen to what the Sundowns coach said before their PSL game against Orlando Pirates at Dobsonville Stadium on Tuesday night. The President, Dr Patrice Motsepe, the Board of Directors, Technical Team, Players, Management, Staff, Supporters of Mamelodi Sundowns FC & the entire Masandawana Family express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the late Bob Mabena. pic.twitter.com/zexT1J8GJD Tonight I join the many South Africans, the media fraternity, and the family & friends of Bob Mabena in mourning the loss of one of our greatest icons. #RIPBobMabena pic.twitter.com/hQcyBBP0zy
