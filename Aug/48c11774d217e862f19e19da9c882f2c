THE long wait is almost over, Premier Soccer League (PSL) action beckons! The Nedbank Cup will kick things off this weekend with two mouth-watering semi-final fixtures to be played at the Orlando Stadium. Baroka FC will lock horns with Bloemfontein Celtic at 2pm while Mamelodi Sundowns will tackle Bidvest Wits at 7pm. Sundowns, who already have a trophy in the bag having won the Telkom Knockout, will be hoping to take one step towards adding another piece of silverware. The Brazilians spent the last few weeks in camp in Rustenburg, working hard as they prepare to wrap up the season in style. Their hopes of completing a treble this season are still alive as they are also in contention for the Absa Premiership title. Their captain, Hlompho Kekana, said they are determined to get back to action having had an unusually long break. The 35-year-old has promised the adoring Masandawana supporters more silverware this season as the Tshwane giants chase the treble. “We are going to find it difficult to cope without our fans but we just have to try and represent them very well,” Kekana said in a live video on Instagram. “We know that they are not with us and their absence will be felt but we have to give performances that they will be proud to watch.” Wits, meanwhile, are looking to bring the curtain down on their existence in style following the sale of their PSL status to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. The Ke Yona Cup is the only piece of silverware the Clever Boys have a realistic chance of winning before they go defunct. Meanwhile, Celtic, who made history by reaching the semi-final for the first time in the 12 years of the competition, will hope to go one step further. But standing in their way is a tricky Baroka side who are capable of pulling off an upset as they proved when they won the Telkom Knockout in 2018.
