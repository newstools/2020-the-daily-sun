A MAN got moered after allegedly robbing a woman of her cellphone at KwaMashu J section north of Durban yesterday. When she screamed for help, residents heard her and when they came out, they saw the man running away. They gave chase and caught Nhlanhla Chonco (23) from J section, who was badly beaten with stones and sticks, allegedly by his neighbours and was rushed to hospital, where he died. A resident told Daily Sun the woman was going past a passage when Nhlanhla demanded her cellphone. “She was an old lady and panicked and gave the cellphone to him. Nearby residents saw Nhlanhla running away and chased him. They then caught him and then beat him.” Another resident said what Nhlanhla did was wrong. “This wasn't the first time he robbed someone here. So residents were angry for this.” Aunt Bandi Chonco (49) said she was informed by a resident that Nhlanhla was being beaten down the road. She rushed to the scene and found him terribly injured. “I asked a neighbour with a car to help me rush him to hospital. But sadly, he died on arrival. I heard they beat him for robbing a woman off her cellphone, but I don’t think they took the right decision. They should’ve gone to the police.” She said this was the first time they heard about him robbing someone. “These people who beat him are our neighbours. They know us and they should’ve reported Nhlanhla to us and not kill him.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder has been opened by KwaMashu SAPS for investigation after a 23-year-old was allegedly assaulted by residents at J section after being suspected of robbing a woman. Gwala said he was taken to hospital for medical attention, where he later died. “A case of robbery was also opened by a woman who was robbed,” said Gwala.
