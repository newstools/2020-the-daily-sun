Character is set to release a song titled Ngiyesaba. Earlier this week, DJ Tira posted a snippet of the song on his Facebook page and fans could not get over it. The song is a mix of maskandi, hip hop, house and a bit of gqom. “This is a love song and it accommodates all ages. On this song, I’ve worked with Ntencane and Q-Twins,” said Character. “I composed the song, but we all wrote our choruses. Ntencane added his maskandi beats, while the Qwabe twins added the vocals and I did the hip-hop part. I have no doubt that it’s going to be on high rotation during this festive season.” He said he always wanted to work with Ntencane and Q-Twins. “I’ve always prayed for an opportunity like this and when it finally happened, it was a dream come true for me. Working with them was a great and an exciting experience.” Character said the song is just a taste of his upcoming album. “It will be released on August 21, then available on all digital platforms. I’ll be releasing a full album. I haven’t decided on the number of songs, but I am hoping to collaborate with as many artists as possible. The aim is to make a lasting and mature album,” he said. Last week Tira played a snippet of the song. Speaking to SunBuzz, Tira said: “We’re actually trying to make use of lockdown by making good music. “We’ve always wanted to do a collaboration, but due to our hectic schedules, this was not doable. We’re releasing this song this month as a present to women. “We’re offering it as an early Christmas present to them.”
