THE family lawyers of Eunicent Delibo (36), who was allegedly gunned down by soldiers on the street of his home village in Dingleydale near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, yesterday served Police Minister Bheki Cele with legal papers demanding that he pays R1 million for damages caused. On the night of 4 July, Delibo was shot dead and his pregnant lover Ntombifuthi Mlambo (32) severely assaulted, allegedly by soldiers in the company of cops. The incident happened after the soldiers and the police found him sitting with Mlambo in his Toyota Corolla. They were watching a crowd of residents who had apprehended a suspect with a gun. The suspect was allegedly involved in a local business robbery. The other suspect managed to slip off and ran away. But Delibo’s family raised eyebrows when senior police officers later issued statements and granted interviews on different days, to the effect that Delibo was killed by soldiers because he had a gun and it was retrieved from his body. “The press statement issued by the senior police officers over my son Eunicent’s brutal murder by soldiers are malicious, reckless and defamatory. The impugned statements format are not only defamatory to the deceased and us, but potentially damaging to the investigation and would compromise the investigation of the criminal case. "So we have instructed our lawyers to demand retractions of the statements within 72 hours of receipt hereof, and apologies to us and the nation as whole for the misleading remarks, and pay damages in the total amount of R1million,” said Eunicent’s mum Ethah Delibo (58). Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said: “Should the papers be delivered to the SAPS, response will be made directly to the lawyers or in court which is deemed necessary.” Minister Cele’s spokeswoman Lirandzu Themba said: “I have checked with our legal desk. They are yet to receive it. We will update you when that changes.”
