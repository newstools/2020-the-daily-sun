Muvhango actress Regina Nesengani will never leave the SABC2 soapie. The actress, who plays Vho-Masindi, told SunBuzz: “I’ve been asked if I have plans outside of Muvhango, I don’t. It’s my home. “They made me a household name and I’ll forever be grateful. That’s why I’ll die there. People should expect to see me on Muvhango until I take my last breath.” The actress used to be a teacher and did both at once when she started acting. “I started teaching in 1975 and retired in 2014. I discovered my love for acting in 1974. In 1980, I started doing adverts and stories on radio. “ In 2002, I started performing at the Market Theatre. I joined Muvhango in 2008. “While doing this I was also a teacher because I also loved teaching. I only retired in 2014 because I was 60. I then started acting full time.” ALSO READ | MIXED REVIEWS FOR VOLUME 2 Regina, who plays Chief Azwindini’s mum, said being on the soapie has been a great journey. “Old women I bump into praise my character and say she must continue protecting her son. Young ladies call Vho-Masindi mean.” Expect to keep seeing the Vho-Masindi we know. “Everyone knows how she loves her son and the coming months will show her doing exactly that. “Someone is going to try to take Azwindini’s throne. Keep watching.” Catch Regina on Muvhango on SABC2 Monday to Friday at 9pm
