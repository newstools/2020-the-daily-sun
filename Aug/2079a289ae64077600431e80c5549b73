FORMER IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi has tested positive for Covid-19. The news was broken today by his family in a statement issued to the media. Family spokesman prince Bhekuyise Buthelezi said inkosi Buthelezi was advised earlier this week that one of his recent contacts had tested positive for the coronavirus, so he must also go and test, which he did. The prince said the results came back positive and inkosi has gone into isolation at his KwaPhindangene residence in Mahlabathini, outside Ulundi, northern KZN. “At this point we are pleased to say that he remains asymptomatic and he is in good spirits. We’ve assembled a capable team to watch him during his isolation,” said the statement. Buthelezi will turn 92 on 27 August. In August last year, he stepped step down as the party leader after he has been at the helm since he founded it in 1975. He remained its leader in parliament, while president Velenkosini Hlabisa leads the party caucus in the KZN legislature. Buthelezi continues with his positions as inkosi of the Buthelezi clan as well as Zulu prime minister. P Prince Bhekuyise, who is the brother to inkosi Buthelezi, told Daily Sun today that the family has asked for privacy during this time and promised to keep the public up to date about inkosi’s health. IFP national spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the party has received the news that its former leader has tested positive. He said the party wishes Prince Buthelezi a speedy recovery and trust the team that has been assembled by family will do a good job.
