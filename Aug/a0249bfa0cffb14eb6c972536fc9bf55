KVEE will touch your heart. When she speaks she makes sure she moves you into a good emotional space. Kvee, whose real name is Kgopotso Mashego, has been on radio for 24 years as an actor and presenter for Thobela FM. She presents Gosele Gosagaletse from 5am to 6am from Wednesday to Friday. “I motivate those who have broken hearts, souls and dreams,” she said. “We have features like Active Wednesday that support and encourage listeners about healthy living and fitness and soul.” Some of the topics they deal with are anger management and losing weight. “We call on experts such as dieticians, fitness coaches and psychologists to help with these challenges,” she said. Kvee played Vera in the radio drama Mothohlapi for 10 years. She also presented Moshito wa Thobela on Fridays and Saturday afternoons for eight years from 2006. “I gave several artists their big break in hip hop and house, such as Showcase who’s now a popular Pedi hip-hop rapper,” said Kvee. She’s produced shows like Teen Zone, which she’s been working on since 2006. “I encourage kids to love Pedi and build their confidence when they speak their mother tongue,” she said. The show is aired on Saturday mornings and presented by Laelo Mahlo and Fentse Mojapelo. When Kvee isn’t on radio she’s an estate agent. “I sell properties. I started the job this year before lockdown,” said Kvee. Kvee draws positive energy from a Maya Angelou quote: “If your eyes are positive you’ll love the world. “If your tongue is positive the world will love you.”
