THE Zola extension CPF from outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, has bravely seized a giant pot. The pot, with meat for the school feeding scheme, was reportedly stolen from a local school on Saturday and hours later, a man was seen going around houses, trying to sell it for R500. CPF secretary Sboniso Sithole said they quickly arranged a set-up with the informer. But realising he was in trouble as forum members surrounded the scene, the suspect dashed off, leaving the pot behind, later identified by the school guard and principal as the one stolen from Eric Nxumalo High School in Thulamahashe. Worried school SGB chairman Willias Mthethwa said: “The guard (53) discovered this pot with meat was missing on Saturday. This suspect is one of the notorious criminals involved in the attack of the other guard (55) at the school in June. The guard was hit with iron bars and a hammer as they stole feeding scheme food, compressor machines and grass cutters. They have been terrorising the school since 2018, damaged safes and stole 20 computers, 14 laptops and more to the value of R500 000.” SGB chairman Richman Mbungele from nearby Ezrom Primary School said: “We lost so many computers to criminals. This gang is directly involved. Police must do their job, otherwise the community will take the law into their own hands.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “A man was taken in for questioning regarding thefts at schools after he was found in possession of a stolen pot from a local school.” He said the pot was worth R1 600. “Yesterday, police received information that there was someone selling a pot at Zola extension. They responded swiftly and the man was taken in.”
