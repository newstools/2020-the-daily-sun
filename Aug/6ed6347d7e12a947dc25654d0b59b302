ORLANDO Pirates captain Happy Jele has explained why Bucs weren't sharp against Bidvest Wits on Saturday compared to their match against Mamelodi Sundowns last Tuesday. Pirates were better against Pitso Mosimane’s coached side at Dobsonville Stadium and were unlucky not to come away with maximum points after Fortune Makaringe hit the upright. It was the game they could have won especially in the second half as the PSL resumed after being halted in March due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. However, this past weekend against Wits, the Soweto giants couldn’t replicate the same form and neither side entered the second gear in a game that ended in a goalless draw. It was the fourth game in the row Pirates have failed to win and their third consecutive draw. Interestingly, their last win against Black Leopards in February was won after Thabiso Mokoena netted an own goal. Jele said the course of displaying two different performances was due to individual players not being motivated. “The first game the guys were ready in terms of fitness and everything,” said Jele in Monday’s  Pirates’ Zoom press conference. “In the second match, I think Wits saw how well we played against Sundowns and they closed us down.” Pirates will be hoping to put the setback behind them when they host Baroka FC at Emirates Arline Park Stadium on Tuesday (6pm). Jele is determined to make sure they win this time. “It is very important to go and win the game because we want to finish higher,” he said The reverse fixture Jele won’t forget after Pirates dropped a two goal cushion when he scored an own goal in the 83rd minute, while Gerald Phiri netted the equaliser for Baroka to salvage a 2-2 draw This was the last game for former Pirates caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena as he was replaced by Josef Zinnbauer. Jele has warned his teammates not to take Baroka lightly. “They are good team and I know that it’ll be a difficult game on Tuesday,” he said.
