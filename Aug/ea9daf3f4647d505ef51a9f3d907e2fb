AMAZULU have confirmed that they have terminated the contract of coach Jozef Vukusic. This doesn't come as a surprise as Vukusic was suspended by the club in February following a 1-0 loss to Chippa United in Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The players weren't happy about his tactics on the day and they reported him to the management. In turn, the management decided to suspend the former Polokwane City indefinitely. “On behalf of the AmaZulu Football Club family, we would like to thank Mr Vukusic for his effort and wish him the best of luck in future,” the club general manager Lunga Sokhela said. Vukusic, who has also coached FC Cape Town, was appointed as Usuthu coach in September last year on a two-year contract as a replacement of Cavin Johnson. The former Platnum Stars coach was sacked after AmaZulu lost three and drawn two of their opening five games of the delayed season. However, Vukusic couldn't get also his desired results. The Slovak-born coach lost 12, won five and drew three of 20 games in charge in competitions. Vukusic has since been replaced by Ayanda Dlamini on a caretaker role. The club said that they’ll continue to support the former striker, who is assisted by Moeneb Josephs. Dlamini and Moeneb have been in charge of two games, beating Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in March before the season was suspended and the goalless draw against Baroka FC when the season resumed last week “The club will continue to support Ayanda Dlamini as a caretaker coach until further notice,” Sokhela added.
