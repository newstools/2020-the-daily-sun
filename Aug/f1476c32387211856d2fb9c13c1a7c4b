Kaizer Chiefs star Lebogang Manyama’s stunning strike in the Soweto derby has been voted goal of the month of February. The former Cape Town City star struck the solitary goal that earned Kaizer Chiefs a 1-0 win in the Soweto Derby a few months ago. His individual brilliance in the build-up to the goal saw him evade a couple of Pirates players before unleashing a powerful low drive from the edge of the 18-yard area into the net. Manyama’s strike got the nod from fans who voted it as the best goal scored in the month of February, handing the Chiefs man his first goal of the month accolade. He follows in the footsteps of teammates Dumisani Zuma and Samir Nurkovic who are the only other Chiefs players to win the award.
