Someone once said: "The heart wants what it wants." Admittedly, there is some truth to the statement. Choice has created the perception that everything in life can be dictated by our own strength, but the heart brings about a different spanner to the works. According to recent stats, many people spend as much as 70% at work or in the office and with that amount time invested there, it's inevitable that one will find love or experience romance in the workplace. According to experts, human beings who spend a lot time together end up developing a bound or connection and one of it is love. However, according to balancingcareer.com, this can also take a nasty turn and affect the entire workforce. Besides the Human Resource policies that have been put in place by companies, how can you personally deal with office romance? We are often quick to look at how much we will be earning in our work contracts but often ignore other important matters, including relationships in the office. Always make sure that you are on the right side of the contract. Great employers and employees are able to leave their personal life outside the office. It is important to maintain a great deal of professionalism. Knowing your partner is very important, and this can save a lot of conflict that may arise at the workplace. You're able to keep each other in check whenever an issue arises. By definition, it is the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. Always apply this with office romance.
