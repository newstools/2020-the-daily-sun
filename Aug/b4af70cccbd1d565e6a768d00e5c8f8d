IS not just about telling the truth, either. “You want answers? I think I’m entitled to the truth. You want answers? I want the truth! You can’t handle the truth!” This powerful quote is taken from one of the greatest movies ever shot. Taken from the award winning 1992 film, A few Good Men. The backdrop of this film is centred on fighting for the truth. The same truth that is non-existent in today’s relationships. So why are we struggling with honesty? Well, according to Psychology.com, there is more to honesty than we envision. “Honesty is not just about telling the truth, either. It is also about telling the truth in a way that your partner will hear it and benefit from it.” So why do we lack honesty in our relationships? 1. There is a lack of trust If you are a TV fan, then you would know that the most watched show on television in Mzansi is Uyajola 99. The show seeks to highlight the poisonous effects of infidelity. The common thread of everyone writing to the show is the issue of trust and honesty. 2. Lack of problem-solving abilities Our biggest problem is that we cannot solve the problem, which then results to dishonesty and conflict which has seen a surge in gender-based violent incidents. 3. Love is non-existent Love goes hand and glove with honesty. If you are not honest towards your partner, then you don’t love or respect your partner. Honesty is the best policy, right? 4. Self-esteem According to experts, a great self-awareness is built on being honest and comfortable with yourself. Once you become self-aware or self-conscious about your identity, it’s easier to love, show honesty and respect another human being.
