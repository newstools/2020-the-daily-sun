The PSL swung back into action. Here, Kgomotso Sethusha looks back at the FIVE things we learned as football returned at the weekend. 1. WHAT FITNESS WORRIES? Tons of injuries were expected, a crisis of sorts anticipated as players returned to the field for the first time in nearly five months. But one couldn’t tell players were walking fitness tightrope as the four Nedbank Cup semifinals took to the Orlando Stadium pitch. 2. MABENA’S REIGN CONTINUES Mabena hasn’t lost his form one bit. The Celtic captain picked up where he left off before the break as he spearheaded Siwelele to the Cup final. Like Zlatan, he seems to mature with age. 3. VARANE REALLY INSPIRES MADISHA Either Motjeka Madisha suffered the effects of the lengthy Covid-19 break or he is just error-prone.The Mamelodi Sundowns centre-back is a fairly decent defender, but he looked more like a Thabang Molefe than an OJ Mabizela with his blunders against Wits. No wonder he calls himself Raphael Varane. 4. RHULANI IS TRULY BACK Not so long, he was a persona non-grata among the Downs fans. But Rhulani is back and he didn’t look out of place on the Sundowns bench. In fact, he hasn’t lost any of his mojo, seen as he barked instructions, working well alongside his general Pitso Mosimane as they plotted and executed Wits’ Nedbank Cup downfall. 5. NO FANS, NO PROBLEM The atmosphere is not quite the same without the fans in the stands. But there was hardly the eerie silence at Orlando Stadium, thanks to some creativity from the Cup organisers.
