THERE was always laughter whenever Mandla “Mgijimi” Sindane was around. This was said by mourners at his funeral service in Empumulweni in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, on Sunday. His brother, Johannes, said: “I will miss him and his jokes.” Mgijimi died in his sleep last Monday. Johannes told Daily Sun Mgijimi had been struggling to breathe properly. “We thought it would pass. We were shocked when we went to his place and found he’d died,” he said. He said it looked as if Mgijimi had just taken a bath when death arrived. There was backlash after pictures and videos of the funeral service emerged on social media. Mourners at the funeral were without masks, didn’t maintain social distancing and there was more people than the required maximum number of 50. In one of the videos, mourners wearing Orlando Pirates attire could be seen dancing and singing close to each other while others were carrying the coffin. Social media users criticised the videos. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun: “We’re investigating. There will be consequences if we find that the videos were indeed taken there.”
