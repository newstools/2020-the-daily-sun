BACK in the 1980s when Johanna Mokwalakwala was at school, most girls played netball. And although competition was tough, she started excelling in the sport after joining the team at Sekgopo Primary School, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo. When she went to Mohumi High School, she was selected captain of a squad with girls from her school and Motsheudi and Kgola Ka Leleme high schools. She’d select players for matches and she soon realised she had a talent. The 42-year-old told Daily Sun she moved to Polokwane in 1998 and continued playing netball for various clubs until she joined the Mekopa club, which falls under the municipality, in 2007. “To date, I’m still playing for the team,” she said. “I’m an energetic person and I love sports. “I’ll not stop playing netball as I love it with my whole heart.” Johanna’s passion for netball has taken her all over Mzansi and to Botswana, e­Swatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Mozambique. She said: “From all the tournaments I’ve played, I’ve received more than 40 medals, certificates and trophies. “I managed to get these because of my passion for netball. “When I think I will one day be a gogo and stop playing, my heart aches because I want to play netball until I die.” Johanna recently started her own netball club to train talented girls in the sport. “I want to develop girls aged between nine and 15,” she said. “Maybe one day, one of them will play for the national team.”
