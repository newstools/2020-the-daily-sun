SOUTH African boxing promotion company, TLB Promotions, has partnered with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)) and the Gauteng Department of Sports to provide much needed support to female boxers. The three partners will distribute essential food hampers to more than 25 women involved in boxing including boxers, ring officials, managers and promoters in Soweto tomorrow. According to TLB promotions boss Joyce Kungwane, this is in support of the women in boxing who have been financially affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are obliged to do this in support of women in boxing who have been financially affected by the coronavirus outbreak. “Most, if not all, female boxers depend on boxing for their income. They only get money if they have fought, unlike with other sporting codes,” she said. “As per tradition, local promoters across the country stage tournaments in celebration of the women’s month every August and that guarantees an income for many boxers. “However, having gone five months with no competitive fights has dealt a huge financial blow to the boxers, prompting TLB to lend a helping hand. Under normal circumstances, most of our female boxers fight in August in celebration of women’s month which didn’t happen this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak.” Cosatu president Zingiswa Losi is expected to attend the event tomorrow.
