provincial spokesman, Loyiso Magqashela, said: “Lungisa will remain an ordinary
councillor. He resigned as MMC. His decision is welcomed.” Lungisa also took to Twitter
to confirm his resignation. He tweeted: “Comrades, I’ve
stepped down as a member of the mayoral committee. Thank you very much for your
support.” Lungisa is out on R10 000
