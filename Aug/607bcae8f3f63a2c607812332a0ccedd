Nonsikelelo’s brother, Lungani Mbili (42), told Daily Sun today that his sister was taken to the river to officially accept idlozi. He said the report the family received was that she slipped in the rocks and fell into the deep side of the river. He said gobela Molefe rushed to rescue her, but she disappeared into the water. Mbili said gobela Hadebe too sprung to the river to help them, but was also swallowed by the river. “We are devastated. My sister has had this calling for a long time but when she just accepted and gone through the process to officially accept idlozi, she died. We are confused now whether she shouldn’t have accepted the calling or not,” said Mbili. Gobela Molefe’s son, who is also sangoma, refused to talk to the SunTeam.
