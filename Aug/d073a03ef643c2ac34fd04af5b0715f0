IZANGOMA were accused – at Latiefa Salim’s memorial service yesterday – of helping thugs get away with crime. The mum of three, the fifth woman to be murdered in the Northern Areas since the start of Women’s Month, died on Saturday at Aloes Valley in Port Elizabeth Community members laid wreaths, lit candles and put a cross where she was killed. Latiefa was remembered, alongside Sharnice Jonathan and Melissa Marlow, who were raped and killed; Carmen Jacobs, who was killed and her body dumped; as well as Ayanda Mnyaka, who was killed by her boyfriend.  Community leader Teslin Booysen said: “Parents of these kids take them to izangoma to get away with crime. “Two druglords in Smartie Town and Missionvale brag about being taken to izangoma for protective belts to help them from cops.” Northbay Hope Foundation CEO, Morne du Plessis, blamed conditions in the Northern Areas for the killings. “Our youth have no economic freedom. They don’t have money to print CVs and buy data to look for jobs. There are a lot of dropouts here,” he said.  DA Women’s Network chairwoman in the Northern Areas, Pearl Daniels, said: “It’s time for men to do something. They must start community patrols.” Captain Sandra van Rensburg said a murder case was opened after cops responded to a complaint in Kerk Street, Missionvale, on Saturday. “The body of Latiefa Salim (27) was found by members of the public with one stab wound to the neck and an open wound on the forehead,” she said. “The motive was unknown and investigations were still ongoing.
