A video
showing a bakkie spinning around a cop van has gone viral! People can
be heard cheering as the Nissan NP200 bakkie with two passengers at the back
spinning around a cop van at an intersection. The video
was taken apparently at Malamulele in Limpopo. Sowetan Live reports that Limpopo
police are looking for the car spinners. Provincial cop spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela
Mojapelo allegedly saw the video for the first time when contacted by the news
site today. He told them that cops are
looking for anyone with information on the drivers to come forward.  Meanwhile in Malamulele, so much disrespect ???? pic.twitter.com/Nn932EnKEh  There is a second video also
said to be taken at the same intersection in Malamulele. In that video a white BMW 3
series is seen spinning while the traffic light is red and turns green. A Toyota Quantum is seen
approaching the intersection and having to wait for the BMW to move away.  Ka malamulele town pic.twitter.com/vZtZbC6EsH
