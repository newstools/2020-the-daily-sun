They used to bully me at school,” she said. “They called me names. They did shameful things to kill my self-esteem.  “To you ladies, I’d like to say thank you for being the young girls you were back then. Had you been nice to me, I wouldn’t have learned to fight, and I wouldn’t have learned to love myself.” She said somehow, their hurtful words encouraged her. “The more you insulted me, calling me ‘Kiss Madolo’, the more I made sure that I walked as fast as possible with my Kiss Madolo. This was to avoid your insults. ALSO READ: MOTSHEKGA: PUPILS ARE BETTER OFF AT SCHOOL! “Sometimes the hurtful words you say to a person become their strength,” said Nomsa.
