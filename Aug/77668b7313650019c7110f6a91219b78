TWO men were towed to a petrol station after they got stuck with petrol on 14 August. But they allegedly sped off before paying R650 worth of 95 unleaded petrol in Winburg filling station. A few minutes later they collided with a truck, and their Volkswagen Golf 1 burnt with them inside. This after a petrol attendant said he was protected by his God and ancestors. Last week, Daily Sun published a story headlined “Don’t mess with Lekhu’s ancestors”. The cops say the two men were a Nigerian Nicolas Yusuf and his friend Bright Walker, who was the driver. The cops say they need Nicolas’ family to come forward so he can be laid to rest. Bright’s family from Gauteng has already identified and claimed his body. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said they were still looking for Nicolas’ family. Makhele told Daily Sun: “Winburg police are looking for Nicolas Yusuf’s next of kin. They should avail themselves to claim the remains so he can be laid to rest. Nicolas, a foreign national allegedly from Nigeria, died after a motor car collided with a truck on the N5 road in Winburg on Friday, 14 August. It is alleged that Yusuf was with his friend Bright, who was the driver when their car allegedly failed to stop at the Winburg N5 T-junction and collided with an oncoming truck that was headed to the N1. The two men’s car burnt and their bodies were charred beyond recognition. Winburg police opened a case of culpable homicide and preliminary investigation led them to Bright’s family in Joburg, who identified and claimed his body. Yusuf’s family has not yet come forward and police are appealing to anyone who might know Yusuf or his family to contact Detective Constable Liezel Van Der Westhuizen at 082 301 9668 or 051 881 8300.”
