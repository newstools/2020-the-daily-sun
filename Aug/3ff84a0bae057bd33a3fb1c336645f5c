MPUMALANGA police in Calcutta near Bushbuckridge need the residents’ help to trace the relatives of an unknown woman, whose decomposed body was found buried in a shallow grave near the river in Mkhuhlu township on Friday. According to provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, cops received information that next to a small river that divides Mkhuhlu township and Malubane village, cattle herders found suspected human bones. “On arrival at the scene, cops found some bones resembling those of humans which were already decomposed behind recognition. But it looks like a woman’s body that might have been raped before being killed.  The body was naked and a cloth was found next to it. We are appealing to residents who might have information about the family of the deceased, or if they have someone who went missing a few months ago and hasn’t been found, to visit the Calcutta cops,” said Hlathi. “The bones were taken to Mapulaneng Medico legal laboratory in Bushbuckridge for storage, while an inquest docket has been opened further investigation. Anyone with information should contact Calcutta police on 013 7086 005 or 072 8052 197.”
