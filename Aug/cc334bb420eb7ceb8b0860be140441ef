SAPS and Tshwane Metro cops are behind bars for corruption. This comes after a three-year investigation by the Hawks Corruption Investigation and Crime Intelligence on allegations of corruption-related offences at the OR Tambo International Airport. Colonel Katlego Mogale said the arrested officers include two warrant officers, six sergeants and four constables. The National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, has welcomed the arrest of 12 SAPS members, aged between 30 and 51, on Friday. Mogale said about R1 million in cash was seized from the house of one of the suspects.  "Five members are still outstanding, one is on quarantine, three are expected to hand themselves over soon, while one is at large," said Mogale. He also stated that these suspects will be facing several charges ranging from theft, dealing in drugs, defeating the ends of justice and racketeering. "These suspects are reported to have been involved in the stealing of drugs at ORTIA during the confiscation from identified drug mules," he said. "So far, a total of 20 corruption case dockets have been registered to address the said criminal activities." They are expected to appear in the Kempton Park Regional Court on Tuesday.
