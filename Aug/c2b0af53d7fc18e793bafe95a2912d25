THE Presidency has rubbished as fake news a social media
audio that has been circulating about a booze ban from Tuesday night. The audio has sent many boozers in a panic mode as long
queues were reported in some quarters where people were rushing to stock up on
booze. The audio claimed that President Cyril Ramaphosa would be addressing the
nation at 8pm to announce the ban on booze because of wild parties and
accidents which also led to cops being killed. Over the weekend videos emerged of wild parties in pubs and taverns
where some were gathered without wearing masks and in large numbers in
violation of regulations. This stoked fears that the government might again ban
alcohol because of the behaviour of boozers. This could have led to lots of people believing the audio. “It’s not a bull shit story, I am just letting you know that
the bottle store will be closing tonight. It’s gonna be the last time tonight.
Just letting you know,” said the audio. Now Minister in The Presidency has come out to dismiss this
as fake news.  It’s not true that President @CyrilRamaphosa will address the nation tonight . It equally not true that the NCCC/Cabinet has taken a decision to disallow the sale of alcohol . This is all #fakenews .  “It’s not true that President @CyrilRamaphosa will address
the nation tonight . It equally not true that the NCCC/Cabinet has taken a
decision to disallow the sale of alcohol . This is all #fakenews,” twitted
Mthembu. But the news might be too late for those who are already in
queues stocking up before the 5pm cut off time as per the regulations of alert
level 2 announced by Ramaphosa on August 15.
