Bay FM presenter DJ Sebz has found another love outside of radio. The radio personality, whose real name is Sebenzile Zalabe, will release his second single Anyway next week. DJ Sebz started ghostwriting years back, but only began performing last year. He told SunBuzz: “I used to write songs for other artists until I saw one of them performing my song.” That’s when he fell in love with performing. “So I decided to stop ghostwriting and started singing my own music,” he said. He’s focusing on that and doing radio on the side. DJ Sebz said: “Because I work in radio, I understand the importance of radio-friendly music. “So my music can be listened to by kids.” His radio career started in 2004 when he was doing his first year in varsity. “I loved radio, but couldn’t study it because my parents wanted me to study law. “Six months into studying it I couldn’t continue. I really wasn’t passionate about it. “I took a break from school and worked for Nkqubela FM in Port Elizabeth. “The next year I studied journalism at the Nelson Mandela University, which was the University of Port Elizabeth back then. “I started working at campus radio station, Campus Wave.” DJ Sebz now hosts a hip-hop show, Lekkamos, from 8pm to 12am every Saturday. “I grew up being a fan of hip hop,” he said. “When I joined radio I made it my mission to give hip-hop artists a platform. “We also teach them about the business side of music. “It’s an entertainment hub for hip-hop musicians.”
