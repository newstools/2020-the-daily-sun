BELGIUM club, Anderlecht have confirmed the signing of Bafana Bafana forward Percy Tau on a season-long loan from Brighton & Hove Albion. The Bafana star joined the biggest teams in Belgium‚ and a club who are hungry to turn around their poor eighth placing last season under former Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany as player-manager and Franky Vercauteren as head coach. After he was annouced on Wednesday, Tau met the legendary Kompany who said the club will look to develop Tau for the Premier League after securing his services for the 2020-21 season. With Tau struggling to get his work permit which is preventing him from being registered in the English top-flight with parent club Brighton and Hove Albion, Kompany issued some promising words to the Bafana forward upon his arrival. "I hope this is going to be an amazing journey," Kompany told Tau on Wednesday."You said you've come here for the next step so we are going to push you to become the best player you can be. I know they are looking back to you in the Premier League so it's our role to bring you there." Talking to the club website Tau said: “I am part of a team that always wants to play good and attacking football. That suits me perfectly."
