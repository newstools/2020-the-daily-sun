THE race for the GladAfrica Championship and automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership looks set to go down to the wire. This after Swallows FC reduced the Urban Warriors' gap at the top to three points following a 2-1 win overÂ Steenberg United at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday. Strikers Kagiso Malinga and Phumele Bhengu were on the score-sheet for Swallows. The Birds continue to pile the pressure on the leaders, ensuring the race for the title is a rather tight one. And with two matches remaining, the title can still go anywhere. However, Swallows have to cross fingers for an Ajax defeat. They also need to ensure that they win their remaining matches against Richards Bay and TTM to stand any chance of toppling Ajax. But they will be pleased by the fact that they have now secured a play-off spot following their win against Steenberg. The Birds cannot finish lower that third, guaranteeing them a spot in the play-offs at the very least.
