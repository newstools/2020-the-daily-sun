 The PPE boost came as the health department in the province continues to battle the Covid-19 infection spike.  Two months ago, St Barnabas health workers took to the streets complaining about what they were calling a shortage of PPE.  In April, one of the doctors at the hospital had to drive a patient by himself to Mthatha General Hospital after ambulance workers refused to treat coronavirus patients.   The MEC once again warned of a possible peak this month and next month, and alerted people to be conscious.  She said for now, hospitals in the province had enough beds for Covid-19 patients.  “It’s not true that we are planning to take patients to other provinces. You must recall that people in the eastern part of the province do have homes in different places, and they choose to go outside the border when they want facilities. Those issues are normal issues. "There is no arrangement for that. The intention of that was taken out of context. It doesn’t mean the Eastern Cape and its facilities are overwhelmed, but people close to borders choose to travel less the one kilometre to get help than travelling a long distance. "It’s an issue we appreciated, but not an issue made specifically by government. It is made by people’s choices and how far they are to facilities,” said Gomba.
