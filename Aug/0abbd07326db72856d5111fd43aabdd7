Government business Also on Friday, the DA called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint another Cabinet member as leader of government business. While the Constitution allows any Cabinet member to be appointed to this role, South African presidents have typically appointed their deputies to fulfil this role. The leader of government business represents the national executive in Parliament and is, among other things, responsible for ensuring that Cabinet members attend to their parliamentary responsibilities. "Given that the deputy president's ill health is of great concern to the nation and is continuing to prevent Parliament from holding government and the presidency to account, especially during the national state of disaster and in light of the Covid-19 corruption, it is important that someone be appointed to fulfil the role of leader of government business," DA MP and spokesperson Solly Malatsi said in a statement.
