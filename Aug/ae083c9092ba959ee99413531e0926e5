FOR more than 15 years, gogo Francina Monyamane has been struggling to care for her grandson, who can’t stand, walk or talk. The 69-year-old from Mokwadi RDP section in Dendron, Limpopo, told Daily Sun she couldn’t afford to buy a wheelchair for her grandson Mahlatse (21), which would make life much easier. The gogo said many people had promised to help over the years, but she was still forced to carry Mahlatse around, although she didn’t have the energy for it any more. She said she had to carry him to the toilet and move him outside the house to get some fresh air. “Sometimes I’m forced to carry him on my back to the clinic as its expensive to hire a car. I struggle with him every day and it’s so painful,” she said. “Local councillors and other people kept promising to help with a wheelchair without delivering. It hurts to see him suffering.” But this week, everything changed when Mahlatse was finally given a new wheelchair and groceries by the Solly Malatsi Legacy Foundation. Chairman Solly Malatsi said they decided to help after a resident contacted his logistics manager Irad Mamaregane. “This was after seeing our work on social media. “We are humbled to assist Mahlatse and his gogo, who continues to look after him against all the odds,” he said. Mahlatse shed tears of joy as he was lowered onto his new wheels. The gogo said she was very happy that he could finally enjoy freedom of movement. “I won’t have to carry him on my back wherever I go,” she said.
