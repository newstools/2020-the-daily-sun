THE absence of Itumeleng Khune from the Kaizer Chiefs starting line-up or on the bench will always raise eyebrows. And it was no different when the second-most capped Amakhosi goalkeeper was omitted from the team that played out a 1-1 draw against Bidvest Wits on Wednesday. But coach Ernst Middendorp has explained his absence, just as he has become accustomed to ever since Khune regained fitness. ”I can put it in the same way as my colleague (Gavin Hunt) reflected on the absence of Monare (Thabang). It's the same. He missed some training sessions for different reasons in terms of having a challenge, ” said Middendorp. ”I don't want to put too much in, you know. We are not discussing any injuries. During the entire time we haven't spoken about any injury. "It is simple and easy, there were a number of training days where he couldn't make it and good, you decide and today it was Daniel Akpeyi and Bruce (Bvuma) and let's move forward now to the next game.” Middendorp revealed in December that Khune was no longer the number one goalkeeper, having relinquished his position to Akpeyi, who has performed consistently. But the assumption for many would have been that Khune has gained full fitness during the four-month period of no football action due to the Covid-19 outbreak.
