GASTON Sirino could make his return in Mamelodi Sundowns line-up when they host Highlands Park on Friday evening. The diminutive midfielder missed the semifinal clash against Bidvest Wits and the Absa Premiership encounter against Orlando Pirates as he was suspended for his actions in the MTN8 semi-finals against SuperSport United in September last year. The talented midfielder was handed a two-match ban after being found guilty of assaulting SuperSport duo, Clayton Daniels and Dean Furman. Sirino has been in one of valuable players for Downs this season playing 32 games in all competitions and scoring 11 goals and making seven assists. “Look I served my suspension and I missed two crucial games, I am happy that we managed to book ourselves a spot in the final," the player told the club website. "It will be the second final this season and we are going to make sure that we win another Cup competition.”“It’s been a couple of months with no football due to the lockdown and when football returned I had to sit out. "t was not easy watching from the stands but now I am available for selection and if I am selected I will do my best and make sure the supporters are happy at home as they cannot be with us at the stadium.” Sundowns will be looking at closing the gap between them and log leaders Kaizer Chiefs when they host the Lion of The North at Dobsonville Stadium on Friday (6pm).
