Chiefs have confirmed that star goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi will be out for the
last two games of the season. Akpeyi was
substituted just before half time in yesterday’s game against Wits University. The Nigerian
international collided with Wits midfielder Mxolisi Macuphu as he was punching away
the ball but never got up from the ground. He was
removed on a stretcher and Bruce Bvuma took his place as
Chiefs would lose the game at the last minutes after a lapse in its defence
allowed Wits to steal the three points.  The Amakhosi released an update on
Akpeyi’s condition this evening. “ Daniel
Akpeyi suffered a concussion on Sunday against Wits. He is ruled out for the
next two matches. The medical team will continue monitoring his recovery
process.” Chiefs are
left with just two games after their rivals Mamelodi Sundowns also suffered a shock
defeat yesterday to Baroka FC. Both teams remain
tied on 53 points with Chiefs leading on goal difference.  Injury UpdateDaniel Akpeyi suffered a concussion on Sunday against Wits. He is ruled out for the next two matches.
