The Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC,
Sipho Hlomuka has expressed his shock at the brutal killing of a traditional
leader. Inkosi Nkanyiso
Mncube(35) who was shot and killed together with his uncle Moses Mncube(40)
last night Inkosi was a leader of Mbokodwebomvu traditional council
from Nquthu northern KZN. Their  car was
ambushed by unknown gunmen who sprayed the 4x4 with hail of bullets killing both
instantly. Sources in Nquthu told Daily Sun today that the inkosi may
have not been the target of the attack and that Moses was a well know taxi boss
in the area. Hlomuka has
condemned  murder  and said it has robbed  Mbokodwebomvu Traditional Community and the
institution of traditional leadership in the province of a leader and community
builder. He  has called upon law enforcement agencies to
leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators of this act of
cowardice. “We are appealing to
communities to come forward with information which will lead to the arrest of
the cowards who have done this disgraceful deed,” said Hlomuka. He sent his condolences family of Inkosi Mncube, the
Traditional Council, and to his fellow amakhosi in uMzinyathi Local House of
Traditional leaders, where Inkosi served as a committed member, working in the
interest of his community. Cop provincial spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the
Babanango SAPS is investigating two charges of murder where a 40-year-old
driver and a 35-year-old passenger sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the
body and were declared dead at the scene.
