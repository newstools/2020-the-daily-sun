BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coach,John Maduka, revealed that the club have decided against signing former Mamelodi Sundowns striker Tokelo Rantie. However, Maduka was quick to say "the door is still open" as the player would still be allowed to train with the club until end of the season. Rantie has been training with the Free State-based outfit before football was halted in March due to Covid-19, subsequently lockdown in South Africa. “Tokelo is still training with us, he is still with the team,” Maduka said as they prepare for the Nedbank Cup semi-final against Baroka FC on Saturday at 2pm. “He has been working hard at training but we are not going to sign him for the remaining games of this season. A decision will be made in the coming season. “We have not had any friendly matches lately, and when you are assessing a player you make sure you also see them in a game situation. Unfortunately, in a situation we are in right now we don’t have any friendlies.” Celtic, Baroka, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits were the first four teams to report into the bio-bubble camp as they kick-off the return to football this weekend, and the Absa Premiership campaign continues from Tuesday next week. Maduka added:  “We are going into the bubble with enough players, and thanks we have to go out to management who tried their best to ensure we have a big squad as games will be coming thick and fast.”
