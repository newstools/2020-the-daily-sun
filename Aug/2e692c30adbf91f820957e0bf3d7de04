Mzansi actresses have managed to fill the gaps in acting, but are still facing many challenges. Young women had an opportunity to be trained and motivated by legendary female actresses at a three-day Ishashalazi Women Festival seminar. The seminar was held at K-Cap in KwaMashu, north of Durban, from Thursday to Saturday. Imbewu: The Seed actresses Brenda Mhlongo and Jailoshini Naidoo, Ifalakhe actress Ntokozo Ngcobo and Between Friends movie star Lihle Dhlomo spoke to the aspiring actresses about life in the acting industry. They focused on challenges that women face in acting and how they can protect themselves from industry vultures who target women. ALSO READ: AKA TO THE RESCUE! Mhlongo, former Lion King and Generations: The Legacy actress, said acting is about love and passion and not all about money and fame. “It took me about 20 years before I appeared on soapies. “I nearly lost my self-confidence and started to doubt my acting talent. “In this industry patience is key. It’s difficult to be a woman in this industry. As a woman you must protect yourself from the male vultures in production teams. “They want sex from women and promise them leading roles. Women must stand up and not sell themselves to producers.” Ngcobo warned young actresses to not set unrealistic goals and compare themselves to other people in the industry. Event organiser Edmund Mhlongo told SunBuzz he believed the young women learned a lot from the experienced actresses.
