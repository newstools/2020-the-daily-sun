TWO months ago, Nompumelelo Sibeko didn’t want to leave her house and even avoided going to the shops. This was after she lost her two front teeth, allegedly at the hands of her then boyfriend who she caught in bed with another woman. But now the 25-year-old from Zola, Soweto has a reason to smile again. A Good Samaritan has helped her replace the teeth. Nompumelelo said not having teeth took away her confidence and she once tried to kill herself. “When I looked in the mirror, I just felt there was nothing left for me in the world. But after I got temporary artificial teeth everything started getting better. When I got permanent teeth, I was very happy,” she said. Ex-editor, now marketer Sbu Mpungose came to her rescue after seeing her story on social media platforms. She said she asked her brother Sandile to help, as he’s a dental specialist. “My brother spoke to another dentist, Dr Noland Naidoo in Morningside, Joburg.” Sbu said it was emotional seeing Nompumelelo looking in the mirror for the first time after getting new teeth. “You could see she was full of life again.” she said. Although Nompumelelo was happy with her new smile, she said she felt let down by the law as the case against her ex-lover was dismissed in court. Daily Sun contacted the Gauteng NPA division for comment on the dismissal of the case. Spokeswoman Phindi Mjonodwane said they were waiting for cops to take the docket to court, so they’d have proper details as to what happened with the case. At the time of going to print, the NPA was waiting for cops to bring the docket.
