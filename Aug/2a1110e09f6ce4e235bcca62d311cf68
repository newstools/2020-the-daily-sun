SIZOBUSHAYA strong on Sunday. Those were the words of Pope Tsietsi Makiti, founder and leader of Gabola Church of All Nations. This after the sale of alcohol and cigarettes resumed yesterday when Mzansi moved to level 2 of lockdown. Makiti told Daily Sun his flock had been thirsty for quite some time. “We couldn’t have church services because our church isn’t a church without alcohol. “We’re about to connect with our Lord now that alcohol and cigarettes are back.” Alcohol plays an important role in their church. “It gives us the energy we need to pray. It feels as if our prayers are going nowhere when we’re sober, but we feel they’ll be answered when we’re drunk,” he said. Makiti said all Gabolas should observe level 2 regulations. “We want to move to level 1 soon, so it’s important to stay safe,” he said. “As much as the alcohol ban has been lifted, our safety still comes first.” He said Gabolas should fill taverns, bottle stores and pubs on Sunday to celebrate the lifting of the ban. But they had to make sure not more than 50 people gathered in one place. Asked what they taught each other during Sunday services, the pope said: “We teach each other to be responsible when drunk. We hate incidents where people get drunk and abuse women and kids. “We hate cases of drunk driving because they cause horrible accidents. We want a country of responsible drunkards.” Their vision was to have responsible drunks. Church members told Daily Sun the resumption of the sale of alcohol was great news. “I was sick when I couldn’t find alcohol. I couldn’t drink the home-made stuff because it made me sick,” said Xola Mbatha (46). “Life is going to be better now that the alcohol ban has been lifted.” Nhlanhla Sbiya (39) said: “I missed church. I tried to pray, but couldn’t connect with the Lord. “The connection will be back starting this Sunday and my prayers will be heard. Maybe my life will get back to normal.”
