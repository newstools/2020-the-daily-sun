THE Seiphemo family is still shocked after their house was petrol-bombed. The incident allegedly happened in the early hours of Monday morning when Maria Seiphemo (52) and her grandkids were asleep in their Finetown home, south of Joburg. “Whoever did this knew what they were doing because they threw the petrol bomb towards our heads. My youngest grandchild (2) fell in the blaze when we tried to escape,” said Maria. She said the child’s hair and arm caught fire and she tried to put out the blaze with her hands.  Maria told Daily Sun she knew some people didn’t like her family, but didn’t understand why. “I don’t have anything. I’m poor. I really don’t know what people have against us. The little we had, a home, they made sure they destroy it. I’m weak because my grandchild burnt in front of my eyes. She didn’t deserve that,” said Maria.  Residents expressed their pain and vowed to help the family get justice. The women in the area helped with food, clothes and blankets. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele advised the family to open a case.
