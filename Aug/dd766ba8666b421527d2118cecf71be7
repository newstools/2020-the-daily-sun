ACTRESS Fundiswa Zwane has launched her own fragrance range, Camagu. The former Imbewu actress said her brand as Fundiswa already has a prominent space on the continent. “To put Camagu by Fundi Zwane out onto the market is an extension on my creativity and art and has been a joy,” she said. Fundiswa said she decided to name the fragrance Camagu because it encompasses the journey she’s travelled. “Camagu means a unanimous agreement, it means let it be so,” she said. “I’ve taken up space in a unanimous agreement with audiences who’ve enjoyed my art.” The actress said the fragrance range, for both men and women, took time to complete. “Covid-19 has affected us, but we’ve managed to pull through. “Because I understand the power of meaningful collaboration, I was patient.” She told the People’s Paper public reception has been phenomenal. “Messages of love and support have just been a testament that people love what I have to offer and I love it too,” she said. Camagu by Fundi Zwane is available on her website.
