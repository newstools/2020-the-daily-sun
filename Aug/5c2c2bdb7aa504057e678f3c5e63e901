Our education system is structured in a way that frees the ruling class, political and economic structure from our sufferings and injustices. It hides the link between whiteness, patriarchy and capitalism, as well as other forms of imperialism. Those who try to question this practice are then socially murdered by the media, which is largely the by-product of the same education system. Black conservatives and white liberals have played a key role in this system. In cultural spaces, the idea of rags-to-riches stories have also been emphasised to prove that poverty is produced by personality flaws and behaviour, rather than being the direct outcome of the economic and political system, which continues to benefit whites and a few black elites. Deprived of the means to communicate their “unfreedom”, the black majority is unable to identify its enemies. In the past and to this day, it’s been recruited to kill heroes because white oppressors and new black masters have teamed up to convince the masses they’re the solution.
