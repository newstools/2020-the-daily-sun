US rapper and businessman Kanye West is proposing a new version of popular social networking service Tik Tok. Tik Tok is an entertainment platform that is used to create short music videos, lip sync, comedy and talent videos. The I Love It hitmaker recently took to Twitter and shared that he wants to create a Christian version, because he was disturbed by some of the things he saw on the platform. “A vision just came to me. I was watching Tik Tok with my daughter and as a Christian father, I was disturbed by a lot of the content but I completely loved the technology,” he said. ALSO READ | YOKI YOKI: VHUDI WOWS ON IDOLS!
