SPECIAL Olympics South Africa (Sosa) is bringing the fourth edition of the Polar Plunge. This year, 150 people, including Mzansi celebs such as Gigi Lamayne, Eric Macheru, Riky Rick, Pasi Koetle, Christopher Jafta, Nomuzi Mabena, Nina Hastie, Clint Brink, Paledi Segapo and many more will take the plunge. The event will be held on 5 September and will not have spectators this year because of the lockdown. However, it will be broadcast live on their Instagram page from 10am to 1pm. Sosa, which provides training for athletes with disabilities, hosts the Polar Plunge every year. Celebs, businesspeople and other well-known people in the country take a plunge in an ice cold pool for charity. The initiative this year aims to give the people of Mzansi food parcels. The participants will be asked to donate R250 for a food parcel for different families. People who want to assist are allowed to donate R250.
