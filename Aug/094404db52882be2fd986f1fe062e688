THE Hawks bust two women on Wednesday for allegedly dealing in steroids. According to Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale, serious organised crime investigators and other police agencies in Mpumalanga conducted a search-and-seizure operation on three premises in Pretoria East. She said steroids, labels and other packaging material worth almost R3 million were confiscated. “The operation centred around a drug investigation that led to the arrest of at least two female suspects,” said Mogale.  Mogale said the second place the team visited was a storage facility in Meerlust Street in Equestria, where steroids in different stages of packaging were discovered, and at Willow Acres Estate more steroids and enhancers were found. “A 35-year-old woman was also arrested,” she said.  According to Mogale, other agencies involved included the Pretoria Hawks, crime intelligence, the Digital Forensic Laboratory, the Priority Crime Specialised Investigation, police Forensic Science Laboratory and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority. Steroids are used mostly by athletes to improve performance or to develop muscles, but they have many dangerous side effects.
