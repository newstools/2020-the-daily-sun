Mzansi's biggest talent search competition is back and it promises to be more than just a show. The talent show will start with the airing of mass auditions on Sunday, 02 August 2020 at 17:30. This year’s auditions were filmed before lockdown in March in four cities - Pretoria, Durban, Jo’burg and Cape Town. The shows executive producer and Director of SIC entertainment, Gavin Wratten in a statement told the SunTeam that they are going to transform our living rooms into front row seats of the biggest entertainment spectacle, enough to make you forget about your lockdown woes. "This is because Idols SA is back and we are really excited about the show – from the wooden mic, right up to the live shows. This year’s Idols will be more than just a show,”  he said. The return of Mzansi’s most loved talent search show comes after Luyolo Yiba dropped the wooden mic to get the golden ticket, made it past theatre week, past live shows, before he won the hearts of the majority of South Africans to win the grand prize of the 15th edition of the competition. Luyolo’s talent stood out, so much that he remained standing despite being put on the audition spot by the show’s returning judges. He survived the nerve-wrecking critique of Randall Abrahams, the compliments and tears of Unathi Nkayi. Luyolo even got Somgaga to blow everyone away with entertaining phrases that viewers have become accustomed to. All the judges will make their return this season and viewers will once again get to see their favourite stars being invited on to the show as guest judges. Director of Local Entertainment Channels at M-Net Nomsa Philiso said they are proud to continue to provide a platform for new stars to be discovered and for talent to be unearthed. "I am told this year’s Idols, dubbed sweet 16, will be ‘more than just a show’. This should set the stage for our contestants and the show to reach new highs,” she said.
