FEAR has risen among residents at Morena-Seaka View in Dalmada outside Polokwane, Limpopo. They’re worried their mansions might be demolished after six people who sold the stands to them were bust over a week ago. As part of the bail conditions, the suspects – Maditaboge Maphanga (59), Francina Sebati, Botany Mojapelo (52), Nelson Tsebe (54), William Maphanga (43) and Charles Mojapelo (44) – were barred from visiting the farm and threatening the complainants. The stands were allegedly sold at R2 500 to R100 000, depending on the size. Resident Seemole Raophala said they lived in the area for six years without any problems until the property company, Blue Dot, recently gave them letters stating they’d be evicted soon. “We are scared. We were told the land was sold to us illegally. They company brought a security company not to let people into their houses. It’s sad that our representatives were arrested,” she said. “Now residents don’t know what to do because the property company says they’re going to demolish our houses and evict us when lockdown ends.” Mafalo Phasha of Sanco said they were disappointed that the royal representatives were bust. “They were arrested on allegations that they sold their own land and when they questioned the title deed of that land, they were called criminals and corrupt. “That land belonged to the Mojapelos before apartheid and they were robbed of it. “Now people are refused access to their own houses, which they built with their money,” he said. Blue Dot spokesman Ike Kekana said the people living on the land were illegal occupants and not residents, hence a criminal case was opened. “Although we have an eviction order, our priority is to regularise the land use rights first. “Illegal occupants will be given an opportunity to buy the sites at market value and demolition will be a last resort,” he said.
