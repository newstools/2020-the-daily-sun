THE mayor of Ditlobotla Municipality in the North West has pleaded with residents to remain calm following a violent protest. Daniel Buthelezi expressed shock after a truck was set alight and a cop injured on Thursday night, allegedly by angry former employees and local business people. Buthelezi said the group only wanted to disrupted peace within the municipality. A group of people took to the street on Thursday night demanding that the municipal manager and the mayor step down. They claimed that the municipality was not doing enough when it came to service delivery. Buthelezi dismissed the allegations and said the protest was politically motivated. He said services have improved in the municipality.“Street sewer due to blockages has been drastically reduced, water leaks are eradicated, and pipe bursts are speedily attended to and resolved successfully,” he said. He said the people who were behind the protest were groupings organised to cause instability in the municipality. “If you look into this, there is a lot of political interference. This is done deliberately with the intention to tarnish the image and the leadership of the municipality. It is done intentionally and political,” Buthelezi said. He said the group wanted to paint a picture that there was instability in the municipality. “They have realised that the taps are no longer flowing. They have been using all municipality resources for their personal matters. “They feel aggrieved in a sense that they are not been given the opportunity because they used to do that when there was instability in the institution. Now because there is stability, they are unable to push their own personal agenda,” said Buthelezi.
