  JMPD patrol vehicles raise alarms. Videos circulating on social media suggested that these cars were cloned by criminals, but that's not the case. According to JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar the vehicles had to be recalled because of an error that occurred. "Yesterday the JMPD management had to issue an instruction for twenty-seven patrol cars to be recalled. This after it was observed that these patrol cars were fitted with number plates from Free State and Cape Town, and these patrol cars were silver and orange in colour instead of white and orange," explained Minnaar. He said the fault was caused by the fleet management company which issued the cars in error. These cars are currently being reregistered, and are being issued with GP number plates and are being resprayed with the JMPD colours.  Minnaar said there is no criminal act in this, but an error that is being rectified.
