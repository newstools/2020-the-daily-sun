Dear MizzB I’m a 35-year-old guy and have been in a relationship for four years. I proposed and she refused, saying she’s not marriage material. Her mother also doesn’t want her to get married. What should I do? READ: 'DARK CLOUD IS COMING ZODWA'S WAY' Dear Brother Most people get into relationships for marriage and stability. Every person has the right to choose what works for them and, in this case, not being married is what your girlfriend wants. You can’t just force her to marry you, so you need to either accept you guys will never get married and accept dating. Alternatively, leave the relationship and find someone who’ll be willing to get married. Good luck!
