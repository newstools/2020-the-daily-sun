BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic are not about to let their financial difficulties disadvantage them. For the past couple of seasons, the financially stricken club have been in the news for all the wrong reasons, which include players and coaches not being paid their monthly salaries and bonus on time, or not at all at worst. But despite the challenges, Phunya Sele Sele have made it to the Nedbank Cup final where they will face Mamelodi Sundowns next month. And this season they have targeted a top eight finish. Coach John Maduka, who took over from Lehlohonolo Seema, has applauded the players’ mental strength. Maduka said: “One good thing that we are doing is to make sure we focus on our job. We try as much as we can, there are so many problems that are happening (around us). There are many things that have been said about Celtic, but at the end of the day whenever we go into the field of play, we must do our job and that is exactly what we are doing. “And again, in life, there’s always going to be a problem but what do you do? Do you sit and not do anything? No, we try and make sure life goes on and be strong mentally hoping that one day everything will go the way you want.” On Wednesday night Celtic shocked leaders Kaizer Chiefs defeating them 3-1 at Tuks Stadium. Maduka said he is satisfied with their performance as they are yet to lose a game since the resumption of the campaign early this month. “It is very important to keep the team united, you are very strong when you are united. He added: We are continuing the job that we started with coach Seema. And again, we believe for us to get the results the players must enjoy the game, when you enjoy the game, the results come.” This afternoon Celtic (3.30pm) will be hoping to continue with their improved performance when they face AmaZulu at Lucas Moripe Stadium.
