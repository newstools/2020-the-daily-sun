THE unexpected death of Power FM breakfast host Bob Mabena
has left a void in many people’s lives. But the station yesterday announced legendary broadcaster
Iman Rappetti would be taking on the show. She hosted Power Talk for five years
and will now be joining Faith Mangope as the show’s co-host.  This makes them the first female duo to host
a talk show in Africa. The announcement was made by MSG Africa chairman Given
Mkhari. Iman will officially join Faith from next week, but Mkhari said no one
was trying to replace Bob. “We would not try to replace him as that would be
impossible. “We reached out to one of the family members people have not
heard in a while and she has agreed to come and support Faith. It’s going to be
a ladies’ gig until next year.” Iman said the news was bittersweet to her. “There’s a kind of duality in our feelings – still a deep
sense of loss, grief and mourning and yet the prospect for something new
happening in quite an unexpected way and that’s what I’m quite excited for.”
