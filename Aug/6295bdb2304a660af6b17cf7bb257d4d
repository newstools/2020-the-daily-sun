 FORMER world boxing champion Masibulelo “Hawk” Makepula knocked out many opponents during his heydays as a pugilist. But in the ring of love, Makepula has been KOd by former 999 first lady Queen “Iyaya” Sesoko. The beauty Queen has caused the former WBO and WBU champion turned pastor to fall on his knees and ask for her hand in marriage, which she duly accepted. According to sources close to the situation, the two have been dating for months now. But last week, he decided to seal the union by putting a ring on it. The couple got married in a low-key ceremony attended by a few friends and family members on Saturday. The source said the wedding was supposed to have happened early this year but due to the outbreak of coronavirus, they postponed it. “The weekend ceremony was a small thing because they wanted to comply with the lockdown regulations of not having too many people,” said the source. When asked for a comment about his second bite of the cherry in marriage, the retired boxer confirmed the news but did not want to go into details.  “I am not ready to talk about my marriage in public at the moment. The only thing I can talk about is my boxing channel,” he said. Sources close to the couple say the two met at God’s Will International Ministries church in Midrand where Makepula is a pastor.  The family member told the SunTeam that the two started as friends before taking their relationship to the next level. “The Hawk has always admired Queen from the days she was a singer. After his marriage to his then-wife collapsed, he prayed to God to deliver him his wish and it finally happened,” said the source. Queen, a former member of popular 90s kwaito band Abashante, has a child with 999 Music boss Arthur Mafokate. She was not available for comment.
