HE remains one of South Africa's best export currently, and it is not hard to figure out the reasons Percy Tau continues to be revered by all. The sizzling midfielder has taken to his career at Anderlecht like a duck to water that it is a matter of time before he starts matches for Belgium Pro League side. While some overseas-based local players are yet to get into gear, Tau is already enjoying his loan spell with his third European club. The Bafana Bafana midfielder won a penalty for Anderlecht which was converted to earn his side a 1-1 league draw against Excel Mouscron on Sunday. In France, Lebogang Mothiba has begun rehabilitation on his recurring knee injury, and watched as Strasbourg went down 3-1 to Lorient. Mothiba has battled for form last season and he will certainly face an uphill battle winning back his place in the starting line-up once he returns. Lebogang Phiri is also out with a long-term injury and he may be some time before many see him be back in the Guingamp starting line-up. Bongani Zungu, on the other hand, is facing an uncertain future as he continues to be sidelined at Ligue 2 side Amiens SC. Zungu had been hankering for a move to the Scottish club, Rangers, which sadly couldn't materialise.
