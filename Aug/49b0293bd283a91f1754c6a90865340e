GAGASI FM’s The Icon was saved by radio when he was at his lowest. The presenter – whose real name is Njinga Mpanza – had quit his job and was lost, until he realised radio was the breakthrough he needed. The 30-year-old from Durban in KZN told SunBuzz: “In 2014, I quit my job. I started an events planning company, but it failed. “I stayed without work for a long time. One day, in 2016, I was listening to Durban Youth Radio, which plays music most of the time. “But on this particular day a radio host spoke. I was fascinated and thought I, too, could do that. “So I looked up their offices and asked for a job, and I got it.” Two years later he joined Gagasi FM and has been hosting two shows – Stay Woke, from 1am and 4am on weekdays, and The Urban Top 30 on Saturdays at 10am to 1pm. “Stay Woke has to be one of the most exciting shows on radio at the moment,” he said. “It’s controversial as we talk about things that aren’t talked about on radio. “It’s easy because it’s early in the morning, so we’re free to do whatever.” The Icon will release his debut single in October. “I’ve wanted to do music for the past 10 years. I’m working on an R&B song,” he said. “I don’t have a name for it yet, but it’ll definitely be followed by many singles.”
