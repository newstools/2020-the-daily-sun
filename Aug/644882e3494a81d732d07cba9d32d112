A Honda Civic Si, preserved from the year 2000, sold for $50 000 (R870 000) on a US auction. The Honda Civic is in excellent nick and was listed on the US car auction website Bring a Trailer. The Honda was sold on June 5 and the Si trim is sportier than the normal Civics.  The 1.6 litre VTEC inline-four doesn't know tar too well as it has only 5 644 miles (slightly more than 9 000km) on the clock.  According to Bring a Trailer the Honda Civic was delivered new to Pompano Honda of Pompano Beach, Florida and was acquired from its original owner in 2004 by the seller, who moved the car to Washington.  The Civic is finished in Electron Blue over a patterned gray cloth interior, and is mated with a five-speed manual transmission. It's pimped out 2000s style, it includes a sunroof, air conditioning, cruise control, as well as a Pioneer stereo and a DC Sports lower tie bar.  The Honda Civic was last serviced by the seller in 2017, at which point the coolant and oil were changed.
