POLICE in Nyanga, Cape Town, are urging people who advertise their Plasma TVs for sale on Facebook to stop entertaining callers who pretend to have an interest in buying the items. Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi of Nyanga cops said cases of hijacking, which involved people selling their Plasma TVs, were opened at the station. Sitshitshi told Daily Sun that most of the victims were people who had advertised what they were selling. “The suspect would then call the seller and pretend to be interested in buying the item. But when the seller arrives at the agreed meeting point, the suspect would either rob them of the Plasma TV or tell the seller to drive with him to drop the TV and get money from his house, then he will rob or hijack the seller,” said Sitshitshi. She said they are urging people not to engage or sell to people from Philippi (Browns Farm) because all the reported incidents occurred in the area of Browns Farm. She warned the drivers of delivery vehicles and general motorists to be alert at all times when driving in Monwood Drive, Link Road, as well as Sheffield, Amsterdam (Ngulube) and Bristol roads. “These are some of the hot spot areas where most hijackings occur. All these roads have bad potholes and in most reported incidents, drivers are hijacked while avoiding the potholes,” said Sitshitshi. Monwabisi Zokufa (45) said he has been stopping people from advertising anything on social media. “Maybe they will stop after reading the story because I’ve been warning people about the dangers of advertising on social media,” said Zokufa. He said there are a lot of criminals out there who would not let this pass them. “We are grateful to the police for advising us and we’ll spread the word because in the end, residents are the ones who are suffering,” said Zokufa.
