FIFA president Gianni Infantino will continue in his post, world football's governing body insisted Sunday, as they blasted the launch of Swiss criminal proceedings against him. "There was and is absolutely no reason to open any investigation because nothing remotely criminal has happened and there is nothing at all to suggest any form of criminal wrongdoing," Fifa said in a media release. "The Fifa president will continue to fully assume his functions within Fifa and fulfil his duties and will continue to cooperate with the authorities in Switzerland and around the world." Special prosecutor Stefan Keller started proceedings on Thursday as part of an investigation into suspected collusion between Infantino and Switzerland's attorney general Michael Lauber, the country's top prosecutor. Lauber, who offered his resignation on 24 July, was in charge of Switzerland's probe into the towering corruption scandal that exploded at the heart of Zurich-based Fifa in 2015. But he was forced to recuse himself from the investigation in June 2019, following media revelations that he had held several undeclared meetings with Infantino during the probe. Swiss authorities said Keller "reached the conclusion that... there are indications of criminal conduct" in relation to meetings between Infantino, Lauber and another official, Rinaldo Arnold, in 2016 and 2017. "This concerns abuse of public office, breach of official secrecy, assisting offenders and incitement to these acts," the authorities said. -AFP
