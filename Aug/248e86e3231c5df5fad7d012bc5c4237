UP-AND-COMING maskandi artist Siyabonga “Shalaza” Zulu (33) is set to release his single, Ngithathe. The song is an appeal to reach the highest level in music. “I am originally from Eshowe, northern KZN but I grew up in Ndlangubo, Empangeni. I learnt all about maskandi while at Gcininhliziyo Primary School,” he told SunBuzz. “As a young boy I joined the school choir, including scathamiya, gospel and traditional dance to name a few.” After passing his matric, he didn’t have money to study further. “I moved to Durban to look for work. I got a job at a company specialising in carpentry. At the same time I was also looking for a recording company.” Unfortunately the company closed down, leaving him jobless. “Despite this I never lost hope. I continued living in Durban and in 2017, I released my debut album, Sebekhulile. “But that album didn’t do well. It failed because I was new in the music industry,” he said. Now he’s making a comeback with his single, Ngithathe. “I’ve learnt my lessons and I’m trying to make as much collaborations as possible,” he said. “This single talks to me. It is meant to encourage me in this journey. I have no money, no academic background or resources to take me places. I know with my talent I can go places and grow in the industry.” He said the song will be released before the end of this month and it will be available on all digital stores.
