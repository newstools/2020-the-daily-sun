THERE is no telling who holds all the aces in tonight’s PSL blockbuster fixture between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates. Sundowns, the supposed home team, are away from home in Soweto while Orlando Pirates are yet to taste football under the Covid-19 conditions. The big guns face off at Dobsonville Stadium (6pm) in a keenly awaited match, which has the potential to give a hint to the league title direction. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane reckons they have a slight edge, his players had already shaken off the cobwebs in the cup win over Bidvest Wits. But in the same breath, he explained the Buccaneers have had enough rest. “It’s advantage because we’ve played, a disadvantage because we are playing a well-rested team when we have players with hamstrings,” said Mosimane. “Yes, we have a little bit of info ahead. We can say a little bit of advantage because we know all about the substitutions and all that. “It’s going to be tough. It’s a big game on Tuesday, but nothing like what you’ve seen before.” On 44 points, the Brazilians cannot afford to slip up, trailing Kaizer Chiefs by four points, though with a game in hand over the latter. But it may come down to how teams manage players under unusual circumstances. The 3-2 cup win has given Sundowns a clearer idea of what to expect, and how to manage a game. Mosimane further explained the challenge teams face, counting on the bit of experience from the Saturday victory to navigate his way through in the remaining matches. He continued: “You can’t comment about football under Covid-19 until you’ve been in it. It is a difficult space. You might know the rules but once you are under pressure, everything goes out of the mind. “We had to substitute important players, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Themba Zwane, thinking of this game. Keletso Makgalwa has done well for us. But I’m not sure Rivaldo will play. That’s football under Covid.”
