METRO cops who were on patrol in the Joburg CBD received a complaint about three females who were scamming money from individuals for fake jobs. Metro police spokesman Wayne Minnaar said a man complained that his wife paid the suspects R450 after they promised to get her a job. “But the three suspects’ phones were switched off, and they weren’t seen or heard of again.” Officers went to the seventh floor of a building on the corner of Von Wielligh and Nugget streets, where the three were operating from. When officers arrived, there was a female suspect who tried to run away, but she was arrested along with two more suspects. There were dozens of CVs and fake application forms found, as well as R7 140 in cash. “Officers seized a computer printer as well as four cellphones, which will form part of the investigation,” Minnaar said.
