Mzansi motorcycle racer Brad Binder is delighted to be a source of inspiration for a number of youngsters in the country. Binder, who won his maiden race in the MotoGP premier class this past weekend, hopes this will go a long way in growing the sport in Mzansi. He is the first South African to win a premier class world championship motorcycle race after his triumph in the Czech MotoGP at Brno on Sunday.  In addition, Binder is the first rookie to win a race in MotoGP since six-time world champion Marc Marquez back in 2013. Speaking to SunSport, Binder said he hopes to contribute towards making the sport of motorcycle racing in Mzansi as big as it is in Europe. “It was amazing to see how much South Africa enjoyed the win, I’ve received tons of messages from back home and it’s incredible,” said Binder. “I need to say a huge thank you to absolutely everyone for all their support I hope to give everyone more moments like this to enjoy. “It was a fanstastic day for myself and my team. It’s been a long time and a lot of hard work that has finally paid off. “I really hope that this will have a good impact in South Africa, I’d love to see more youngsters come through the ranks and I’d definitely like to play a part in helping to grow the sport.” Yesterday was a Dream come true... Hard to believe we are Grand Prix winners?? Thank you to everyone for all the support over the years. The feeling to stand on top of the podium in MotoGP was unreal. I’m for ever… https://t.co/sK9XB1iU1J
