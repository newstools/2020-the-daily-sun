Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer believes a red card for opponents Cape Town City did not help his side in their 1-0 Absa Premiership loss on Sunday. The German coach says all the sending off for former Pirates star Mpho Makola after 30 minutes served to do was make City more compact and difficult to break down, as The Buccaneers woeful form since the restart continued. Bucs have taken three points from a possible 12 and netted only once in four games, as their hopes of qualifying for CAF club competition football next season fade rapidly. They were ultimately undone by another former Pirates player as Kermit Erasmus headed in a winner late in the first half. "We were good in the game, one or two chances [we had] to score, then we don't score. The big [turning] point for me was the red card. Normally you have the advantage but for us in this time that advantage maybe [did not help]," Zinnbauer said. "We gave the players the message, 'come on, don't be soft', give one step more, but it's always easy to say, in the field this is the other way. "The second half we fought, we had the penetration inside the box a lot of times but we don't score. If you don't score then it's not possible you can win the game. "I have to say the opponent made this very good, they made it a good defending. It's the structure in the system and it's not easy to find the solution. I can’t say to my team now that it was bad but it's football. "All the guys now say against 10 men or against nine on-field players you have to win but we know football. It's football, it's the reason for football. Normally you score one, you get a penalty and then you score, maybe you get the next, the next and the next. “But you have no time, you play against the time. Compliments to the other team, they made good defensive work today." Pirates are next in action on Saturday against SuperSport United. - SuperSport
