AHEAD of the resumption of the season, captain Tapuwa Kapini says recurring rumours of the club being on sale are not distracting Highlands Park players. These reports first surfaced in June and re-emerged in recent days in a league where the buying and selling of statuses is somewhat trendy. The rumour mill even disclosed first division club boss, Tim Sukazi, had put an offer to buy the Lions of the North. But SunSport has heard it on good authority that Sukazi’s proposed deal has failed. The latest round of reports come slightly over a week before the team host defending league champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, home-away-from-home at Dobsonville Stadium. Long-serving goalkeeper Kapini disclosed the players were focusing on the job at hand, which is to finish the campaign higher than the satisfactory seventh spot secured last season. “We are committed 100%. We are doing our work as usual,” said the Zimbabwean international. He conceded such reports naturally could sidetrack any player’s focus, but that was not the case with them. “I wouldn’t want this thing to be in our minds. All we have to do is to work hard as usual. We need to be committed to our work, regardless of the rumours. We must focus on the job.” According to the veteran goalkeeper (36), Highlands’ objective is to finish higher than last season’s credible finish. They won nine in the last campaign, but were undone by an excess of draws (14), which was the highest number of stalemates by any team in the top division. Highlands currently occupy eighth spot with 31 points from 24 matches. They are one win away of matching last season’s overall wins tally, with six games remaining. “We have established ourselves and shown that we can compete with the big guns,” Kapini said. “It will be good to finish better than we did last season. That is the objective. If we finish fifth or sixth, it will be a great achievement for the club. Remember, we also went into the final of the MTN8.” – CAJ News
