RELEGATION threatened Polokwane City received a huge boost ahead of their must-win PSL game against SuperSport United at Bidvest Stadium on Wednesday afternoon (3.30pm). The return of their star midfielder Kabelo Mahlasela is a welcomed addition to their team. The 29-year-old star missed the two Rise and Shine league defeats against Maritzburg United and Kaizer Chiefs over the weekend. City coach Clinton Larsen admitted that he is pleased with the former Chiefs player coming back, as they need him in their fight to move away from relegation zone. “It is good news for us to have him back,” Larsen said. “We need his experience and talent. We are not in a good position and to move from it you need all your players available.” Larsen has already made it clear to City management that he would love to keep the Sebokeng-born player. On their clash with Matsatsantsa a Pitori, Larsen admitted they cannot afford to lose to Kaitano Tembo’s lads.
