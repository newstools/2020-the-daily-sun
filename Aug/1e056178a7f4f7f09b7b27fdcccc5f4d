WHEN the call came Paseka Makgalaborwa (19) took it upon himself to create awareness about Covid-19. Since lockdown started Paseka has been educating people in his kasi, Mphanama outside Burgersfort in Limpopo. He tells people about the virus and sanitises them at Sassa pay points, shopping complexes and funerals. The grade 10 pupil from Dithothwaneng High School said he spoke to a local attorney, who decided to sponsor him. He said elderly people, especially those with other conditions, were most vulnerable and along with his friends they decided to educate people in the community. “I was motivated by my parents, who said the biggest contribution I can make is to start where I am.  He did the campaign every day, but after returning to school he only does it on weekends. “We’re proud that we’re on the front line fighting Covid-19 because we care about our people,” he said. “I want to make a difference. I want to be a businessman and I love journalism.” He said the elderly love the work they’re doing. “When we don’t come to pay points, they ask us where we’ve been the next day,” he said. “Our community is proud of us and we are going to continue to make them proud and safe.”
