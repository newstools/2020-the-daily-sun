NOMSA Sibisi says she is living in fear. The 32-year-old from Standerton, Mpumalanga, said at the beginning of the month, she went to visit her family and when she returned, she was accused of cheating. “He punched me and I fell. He picked up a braai stand and threw it at my face. I tried to stand up, but he punched and kicked me,” she said. Nomsa said when she tried to flee, the man picked up a brick and threw it at her head. She then called the cops and was taken to hospital. A few days later, she opened a case. “On the same day, my aunt told me she had seen him braaing outside his place. “I was shocked because the police had assured me he would be arrested,” she said. Nomsa said she felt like the police had failed her and put her safety at risk. She said she wanted to see the man in prison as he could have killed her. “I wish the court could reverse the bail that the police claimed he got. “He must face the law. I’m now the one who’s scared to move around while he’s enjoying his life,” she said. Nomsa’s aunt, Nelisiwe Shongwe, (39) said: “We are now scared for her life. We don’t know what he is planning for her,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an internal investigation has started against the officer handling Nomsa’s case. “It’s unfortunate that we can’t take him back to the cells as the officer under investigation granted him bail,” he said. Hlathi said a new investigating officer was assigned to the case and had already taken statements.
