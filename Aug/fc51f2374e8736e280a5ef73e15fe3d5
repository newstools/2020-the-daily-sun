AS most women get older, they start looking for ways to stay younger and one Australian women is taking it to the extreme. Gina Stewart is dubbed the world’s hottest gran and she claims that she keeps young by freezing herself. The 49-year-old woman says the unusual three-minute treatments in the freezer helps to maintain and “rejuvenate” her youthful looks. Speaking to the Daily Star Online, Gina said: “Something I’m doing and have done for a while now to keep myself looking youthful is cryotherapy. “It’s three minutes a session and I literally freeze myself to -110C for three minutes a session.”  Gina says that she stays clear of Botox because she is terrified of needles. Gina claims that the treatment is good for skin collagen and health, and says that the effects are like rejuvenation for the whole body and each session burns up to 800 calories. Gina also adds that she follows a strict diet. “When I was younger, I could eat as much as I wanted and never gained a pound. Much harder at this age for sure,” she told Daily Star.  Another aim for Gina is to avoid plastic in her life, including drinking from plastic water bottles. “There’s chemicals in the plastic that leak into your body and have an ongoing effect on your hormones, that’s why so many young couples struggle to fall pregnant naturally.”
