FASTEN your seatbelts and prepare for a really exciting end to the Premiership title race! The last two rounds of matches will be the most nerve-wracking for Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs. With the door wide open for Sundowns to go top of the log, Pitso Mosimane’s men squandered the opportunity as they lost 1-0 to Baroka at Dobsonville Stadium last night. Handed back the initiative by log leaders Chiefs who lost 1-0 to Bidvest Wits in the other match earlier yesterday, the Tshwane giants could not break down the relegation-haunted Bakgaga. The results leave the two sides still tied on 53 points with two matches left. The Soweto giants still enjoying advantage courtesy of a superior goal difference and would have sighed relief seeing as their closest rivals also drop vital points. Like Wits, it felt as a cup final win for Baroka, who moved slightly out of the relegation mire. Amakhosi were undone by a stoppage-time goal from Eva Nga to complete one of the worst results in the club’s turbulent recent history. But the Brazilians suffered a huge setback as they couldn’t reply to Ananias Gebhardt’s first-half goal, which revived Baroka’s hopes of surviving relegation. Both Chiefs and Sundowns were left feeling they have let the title slip out of their hands. Amakhosi gave it their all against the Students but couldn’t get a result and their hang at the top is anything but secure. Sundowns also felt they could have done more, given the chances they created. Gerhardt headed in from a corner kick to put Baroka ahead and eventually into the 13th spot with 28 points. It is not only interesting at the top, but it is equally a squeaky bum time at the bottom as four teams face the spectre of relegation. While it was a performance of bewildering indifference from Sundowns, Baroka deserved credit for their display. As Man of the Match Vusi Sibiya said afterwards, it was a tough win. Had they lost, their fate would be practically sealed.
