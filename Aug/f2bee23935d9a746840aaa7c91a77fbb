CAPE Umoya boss Roger de Sa has a five-year plan to ensure his Cape Town-based club gain promotion to the Premier Soccer League (PSL). De Sa is part of a consortium that bought the Platinum Stars status when the club was relegated from the PSL in 2018. Although Umoya are not anywhere near a promotion spot in the GladAfrica Championship this season, De Sa told the SA Football Journalist Association (Safja) that he is not losing any sleep since they have a sound financial backing to achieve their target in the long run. Umoya occupied 11th spot with 28 points from 23 matches in the Championship table when the season was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We have always given ourselves a five-year plan to gain promotion. We could have spent millions of rands to buy a PSL franchise, but that is an easy fix to it. We need a five-year plan to be ready because we don’t want to be a yo-yo club,” he emphasised. The ex-Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates coach said that he has built a strong foundation to ensure they are a successful. “We have a club house, youth structures, ladies team that we built around to ensure the club doesn’t fall off,” said De Sa. “This is our second year and the club is coming up nicely. The youth is also coming through appearing in the Castle League. We have proper structures.” Even though United have a sound financial backing, De Sa revealed that the last four months have been tough without action due to the lockdown in a bid to combat Covid-19. “The last few months have been frustrating, but we are getting on with whatever is thrown at us. It has been challenging, everybody cut down a bit to focus on basics. “The juniors have come to a stand still and coaches as well. We have a strong financial muscle, a group of companies and it was more about life after football. There has been massive challenges, but we found our feet a bit,” De Sa added.
