IT appears the thugs murdered him for body parts as they took his ear, nose and maybe even his private parts! Residents followed a blood trail near the river in Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, on Saturday, and found the body of a man. According to residents, the man’s one ear was cut off, as well as his nose. Residents also claimed his penis was cut off, but police are disputing this.  Residents asked if the thugs were robbing the man, why were his body parts removed? Others asked if indeed he was murdered for body parts, why did the murderers take only three parts? Residents suspect the man was murdered on Friday night during an electricity outage. Resident Lina Sebola (53) told Daily Sun the people who did this should be found and put away. “The people who did this will not enter the Kingdom of God,” she said.     Anna Mokwena (35) asked for more police visibility. Meanwhile, Samuel Ngomane (56) said he was shocked to see the dead man lying there. “He died for nothing,” he said.  Police spokesman Captain Johannes Maheso said Mamelodi East police attended a murder scene at extension 22 Lusaka squatter camp on Saturday at about 9am. Cops called on anyone with info to contact Captain Maseko at 082 4919678 or 08600 10111.
