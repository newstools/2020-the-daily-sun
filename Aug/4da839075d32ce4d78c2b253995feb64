JOBURG Metro cops arrested a suspect who was allegedly
selling land illegally in Kaalfontein on Wednesday for R40 000 per stand. Metro police spokesman Wayne Minnaar said they received a
complaint about a man who was advertising the sale of the land on Facebook. “The officers established that the land was municipal
owned land through the City of Johannesburg's Group Forensic Unit, and they
then approached the Hawks for assistance, to help to get the suspect arrested. ALSO READ: WATCH: TAVERN OWNER IN TROUBLE! “An arrangement was made with the suspect to meet at

immediately. “The man who appears to be in his early forties will soon
