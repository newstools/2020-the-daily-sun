MHALA Magistrates Court has postponed the bail application of a suspect (30) until 21 August for the presiding officer to be available. He was not asked to plead to the charges of murder when he appeared before Magistrate Robert Mokone on Friday. Last week the same court remanded the suspect in custody in order for the state to confirm his alternative address. This was after the investigation officer in the matter, Detective Sergeant Daniel Khoza, opposed bail and told the court that the suspect would not be safe if he was released back home as he lives near the deceasedâ€™s family and the community members were still angry. The suspect, who is originally from Mozambique, is accused of stabbing his ex-lover to death. The lover (28) was originally from Mozambique and had two kids with the suspect. The incident happened when the deceased was on her way to work in Dwarsloop, Mpumalanga, on 14 April at about 6am. She was a domestic worker. She was attacked on the street and stabbed several times in the chest, neck and the back. Khoza told the court that when he arrived on the scene that day, the deceased had 20 stab wounds. He said police arrested the accused fleeing in a taxi outside Dwarsloop after he told cops that he was on his way to Bushbuckridge Police Station. His lawyer Peter Malibe argued that his client was not a flight risk because on the day in question he was heading to the police station.
