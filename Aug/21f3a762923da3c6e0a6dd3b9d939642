BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has revealed that striker Mxolisi Macuphu was a victim of a hijacking in Johannesburg this week. The player managed to survive the ordeal, but is now a doubt for the Clever Boys’ Nedbank Cup semi-final against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday. Hunt was speaking to the media ahead of his side’s crunch Ke Yona Cup match, their first outing in over four and a half months. “Machupu got hijacked this week so I don’t know. They stole his car, everything so he has got a problem,” said Hunt. This is not ideal for Wits who have one of the smallest squads in the PSL heading into what is going to be a tough schedule. They have had to promote a number of youngsters to help with the load as they prepare to play after every three days. “Thabang Monare is struggling a little bit, Gift Motupa is struggling a little bit. So yah if you go through the team. Pelembe has not come back, who else? You obviously got players who tested positive two weeks ago and they have just come back this week. It’s quite a few of them,” added Hunt. “I’m one of the coaches who likes to play a lot of games, but this is an unusual situation. We have Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates in one week.”
