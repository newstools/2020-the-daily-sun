Football is back! Nedbank Cup will open up proceedings this weekend with a double header at Orlando Stadium. Bloemfontein Celtic v Baroka FC at 2pm followed by Mamelodi Sundowns v Bidvest Wits at 7.15pm. All teams are acclimatising to the new normal, where players have been training on their own at home and now they're back in camps, but under strict Covid-19 protocols.  Remember no fans will be allowed at the stadium, but played behind closed doors.
