Bafana Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo has joined Major League Soccer side FC Cincinnati after leaving Brentford at the end of last season. Mokotjo, 29, left the SkyBet Championship side after their play-off final defeat at the hands of Fulham and he has since joined the MLS side. The club confirmed on Thursday. “We are pleased to add a player in Kamo who will be a strong fit for what we are looking to do at FC Cincinnati,” FC Cincinnati General Manager Gerard Nijkamp said. “He is an intelligent player that will be an asset for our club on both sides of the pitch. We look forward to welcoming Kamo to Cincinnati and having him integrate within our locker room.” Mokotjo’s professional career began in 2008 when he was 16 years old. He was to promoted South African club SuperSport United’s first team after spending more than five years in the club’s academy. The midfielder went on to make just one substitute appearance with the club during the 2008-09 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season. Talking to his new club website Mokotjo said: “I felt like now is the right moment for a new challenge at a club that has big potential and is willing to challenge itself,” “I think in a way this is a perfect match. I’m honored and ready to relish this opportunity and challenge.”
