IT’S been 64 years since the women of Mzansi rose up and took a stand against apartheid pass laws. Former public service and administration minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi believes government has a good plan to get more women into leadership roles. But she said it’s struggling to put plans into action. She said while in former president Nelson Mandela’s cabinet, she dreamt of more women leading government. “The only hurdle was to implement that dream. Even now that plan is still part of our constitution,” she said.  Meanwhile, Sisanda Qwabe-Coutaud is proof that not everything is gloomy for women. The 32-year-old is co-founder, CEO and chief editor of Galaxy Universal Network, a news channel on StarSat. She said the channel gave her the opportunity to uplift people with good news. She said: “But we’re not ignoring the ongoing injustice and continued marginalisation of the previously oppressed. “These are the people whose stories we must tell.”
