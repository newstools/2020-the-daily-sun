CITY of Joburg MMC for housing, Mlungisi Mabaso, visited Fleurhof flats in Joburg yesterday to check on their state of readiness for allocations. This follows evictions from the flats last week. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mabaso said he was aware of the housing backlog, but that didn’t permit criminality. Said Mabaso: “I understand people are frustrated and claim we’ve just kept the flats empty. “That’s not the case. These flats were incomplete. They didn’t have electricity.” He said the correct process should be followed as the department was trying to deal with the backlog.

We’ve all agreed on this.” Mabaso said a criteria was used to identify people who were deserving of the units. “There are veterans, people living in the nearby hostel, as well as pensioners who’ve been waiting for their houses,” he said. They’d start allocating the flats from Wednesday, and the rightful recipients already had allocation letters. One of the residents who was evicted last week told the SunTeam that it was painful that he’d applied for a house in 1996, but had still not been allocated a flat.“There’s a lot of corruption going on,” claimed the man.
