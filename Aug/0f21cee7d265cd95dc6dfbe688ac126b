ALL she asked was a place to live, but what she got was a rubber bullet in the knee. Pregnant Orlando Mathabela from Nana’s Farm near Avalon Cemetery in Soweto was shot by a Joburg Metro cop on Monday. This after residents held a peaceful protest on the N12 to ask motorists for donations, so they could buy shacks. “The police asked us what was happening. We explained that JMPD officers took our shacks and we didn’t have a place to live. An officer swore at us, walked towards his car and fetched his gun,” she said. Orlando said she was in front when the cops started shooting and she was shot in the knee.  Themba Maseko, community leader at Nana’s Farm, said they were being harassed. “They came to evict us without any court order that states we are not allowed here. The owner left pensioners here in charge and they want to evict them.”  He said they picketed outside the cop shop after seven residents were shot. “They opened cases, but they haven’t been sent their case numbers. We are not taken seriously because we are poor,” said Maseko. Gauteng police spokesman Mavela Masondo confirmed Orlando opened a case and cops were investigating.
