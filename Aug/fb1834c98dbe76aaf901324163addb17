LELE Motloung shed tears when she talked about the treatment her daughter-in-law received last week at Kalafong Hospital. The 52-year-old said after giving birth at the hospital in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, her daughter-in-law was sent to sit on a bench with other women with her baby in her arms. When she got to the hospital, nurses told her there were no beds or cots for babies. She said her daughter-in-law was transferred to Kalafong from a hospital in Pretoria West. “She called us on Friday and said she was being taken to Kalafong. “When she phoned us before midnight, saying she’d given birth, we were very happy. But I later got missed calls from her.  Kalafong CEO Sello Matjila said: “We’ve arranged a meeting with the family and we’ll apologise. “All beds were occupied on the day. “We have patients who come in without appointments and we can’t turn them away. “We have systems in place to avoid overcrowding. “It happens at times.”
