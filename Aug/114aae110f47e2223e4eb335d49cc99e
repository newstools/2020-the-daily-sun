Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Willard Katsande is has backed teammate Khama Billiat to rediscover his form sooner rather than later. The Zimbabwe hit-man has been struggling to find his best form for Amakhosi this season, scoring just once this season. He has been a shadow of the player who joined from rivals Mamelodi Sundowns having lit up the PSL with Keagan Dolly and Leonardo Castro. Instead, Chiefs have had to rely heavily on striker Samir Nurkovic, who is the club's top scorer with 13 goals. But the Serbian will be suspended for Chiefs huge clash against Sundowns on Thursday and all eyes will be on Billiat. And his compatriot Katsande is confident  Billiat will step up, "He is our best  player," Katsande told the media. "He is working hard and playing well for the team even though he has not been scoring. "There are a lot of things like rustiness and low confidence but when he sorts that out he is our best player. "We need to support him and help him get back to his best."
