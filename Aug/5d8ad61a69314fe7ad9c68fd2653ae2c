THIS past week we’ve seen well-known celebs having relationship challenges. This is common: people being unhappy and facing problems. The words “It’s complicated” have become the most used term when describing a relationship status or state. Being with someone and trying to build a family isn’t easy, and with the current socioeconomic state it’s become more challenging. Some people are forced by circumstances to reconsider, and this isn’t easy. Having planned to get married, pay lobola, buy a house and/or car, and have a baby, only to lose your job, is disturbing. Some people find it easy to look for a side partner to fill the gap of being unhappy and broke. This may seem like an easy way to cope but not necessarily right. Having many partners so as to feel complete is pointless. Entanglement, which is famous in the streets of social media, may be seen as harmless fun. But it can be the beginning of serious problems. Not everyone is happy to share their partner. Involving a third person in a relationship is inviting trouble. When you have problems with a partner, communicate and sort it out. Running away from problems won’t make them go away!
