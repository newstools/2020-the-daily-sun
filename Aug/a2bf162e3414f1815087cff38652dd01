BIDVEST WIis coach has been impressed by his side since the resumption of the league. The Clever Boys, who are soon to be defunct after their PSL status was sold to TTM, have not been playing like a team that will cease to exist soon. Although they have been unfortunate as far as results are concerned, their attitude and commitment has been faultless. And the emergence of some young players has pleased Hunt as they look to finish their last ever season on a high. Rowan Human, one of the youngster given a chance to impress in these final matches by Hunt, has grabbed the chance with both hands. He scored his first PSL goal in a 2-1 win over AmaZulu. "I’m glad he (Human) got a goal, I mean he was magnificent, great game again from him,” said Hunt.“We played him out of position because we didn’t have any players to play in that position and he was magnificent."
