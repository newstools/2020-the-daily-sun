CAPE Town firefighters were attacked while extinguishing a fire in Overcome Heights, Cape Town, last night. According to the Fire and Rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse, crews from Lakeside and Wynberg responded to a fire in the informal structures in Overcome Heights at about 11.30pm They managed to contain the fire which had already damaged four informal structures and a vehicle. When they returned to their vehicles, that’s when the attacks occurred. “Two city firefighters were pepper sprayed at the scene of a fire in Seawinds, jeopardising efforts to battle the blaze. The city condemns this callous act, in which the men and women who put their lives on the line to save others, are targeted,” Carelse said. He said the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire at about 1am and when they returned to their vehicle, they were attacked. “While the crews managed to contain the spread of fire, two firefighters, one from Wynberg and the other from Ottery fire stations, were pepper-sprayed by an unknown assailant who was waiting for them when they returned. They were treated by medical staff at the scene,” said Carelse. The city’s Fire and Rescue Service were attacked three times in a space of 48 hours this week. The incidents happened in Khayelitsha and Mfuleni. According to the MMC of Safety and Security, Jean-Pierre Smith, the fire services vehicles were petrol-bombed.
