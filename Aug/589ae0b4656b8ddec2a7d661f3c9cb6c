Malcolm MacDonald (45) from England lost his 4-5 to a horrific blood infection. He has since become the first man in the world who got a new one built on his arm. Malcolm suffered from a long-term perineum infection which developed into sepsis, turning his fingers, toes and 4-5 black. In an interview with The Sun, Malcolm said: "I had struggled for years with an infection in my perineum, but I had no idea what could happen. It spread to my fingers and toes and turned them black. When I saw my penis go black, I was beside myself. It was like a horror film. I was in a complete panic. I knew deep down it was gone and I was going to lose it. Then one day it just dropped off on to the floor. Because I had been through the devastation of knowing I was going to lose it, I just picked it up and put it in the bin.” Now thanks to modern technology and medical surgeries, doctors were able to build Malcolm a new 4-5 that was attached to his arm four years ago. He is desperate for a new medical procedure that costs 50 000 Pounds, to transfer the 4-5 to where it needs to be. “It looks like something out of a weird sci-fi comic. But it’s my chance at a normal life,” said Malcolm. For now, he wears long sleeve tops to hide his 4-5 dangling on his arm and has nicknamed his penis ‘Jimmy’. Malcolm hopes to have this procedure done before the end of the year.
