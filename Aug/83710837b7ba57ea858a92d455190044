FORMER finance minister Malusi Gigaba’s wife, Norma, is expected in the Hatfield Magistrates Court in Tshwane this morning. Her husband allegedly opened a case against her. The 40-year-old’s lawyer, Victor Nkwashu, confirmed she was bust on Friday and released on R5 000 bail on Saturday. She was released and told to appear on Monday. NORMA GIGABA RELEASED ON BAIL! Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hungwani Mulaudzi said they bust her after they were told of a matter which needed investigating. “It’s a very serious matter we’re dealing with and we can’t get into details.” He said the complaint had been with them for some time and they were still working on allegations. “Matters transpired this week which necessitated us to go straight to the magistrates court to ask for a warrant of arrest, based on the severity of the case.” The accused faced malicious damage to property, crimen injuria and assault charges. He wouldn’t confirm domestic violence charges. The arrest came after a video did the rounds on social media of what allegedly was the former minister’s car. A Mercedes-Benz G63 is vandalised, with “cheater” written all over it.
