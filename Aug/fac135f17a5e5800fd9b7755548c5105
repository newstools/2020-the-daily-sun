BUSINESSMAN Solly Mkhabela has recovered from Covid-19. Known for helping those in need through his foundation, Solly had to pause all his projects. Last month, Daily Sun reported that the 51-year-old had tested positive for the virus. “When I found out that I tested positive for Covid-19, I adhered to my doctor’s orders to take my medication and isolate himself, despite my hectic business schedule,” said Solly. He said this led to his projects having to be stopped while he recovered. But last Saturday, he was given the green light to get back on track after testing negative. Solly told Daily Sun he contracted the virus at a relative’s funeral in Gauteng. “All was well during the funeral service as everyone was complying to the rules and regulations of lockdown,” he said. “However, after the funeral, I met with some relatives as it’s the norm in our culture to meet and converse. “I never knew there was someone there who’d tested positive. “I should have known better and not stuck around after the funeral.” Solly advised people to be careful. He said his 83-year-old diabetic mother Ruby also tested positive, but luckily she recovered.
