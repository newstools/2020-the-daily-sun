A MUM has been arrested for allegedly dumping her baby at a taxi rank in Thulamahashe on 9 May. The 19-year-old from Ludlow Trust, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, was arrested on Friday. A relative saw a Daily Sun article, published on 25 May under the headline “Help find mum of dumped baby”, and alerted police. According to Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the mum reportedly asked a hawker at Thulamahashe Taxi Rank to look after the baby while she bought nappies at the shopping complex. “She disappeared and the woman started to get worried as it was getting dark,” Hlathi told the People’s Paper. “She later reported the matter to police, and social workers took the baby to a place of safety. “Police launched a manhunt for the mother, and she was found at her boyfriend’s place in Allandale Village after police received a tip-off from relatives on Friday.” Hlathi said the irresponsible mum was charged with child neglect. She was expected to appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court in Thulamahashe today.
