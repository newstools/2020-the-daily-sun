PUBLIC Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane and her deputy, Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka, started their first day of inspections of Gauteng health facilities yesterday. They visited Jubilee Hospital in Hammanskraal and George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane. This follows inspections at Eastern Cape health facilities. Mkhwebane and Gcaleka, accompanied by investigators from the Gauteng office, were checking on infrastructure developed specifically for the fight against the pandemic. Mkhwebane told Jubilee actiing CEO, Olebogeng Modise, the aim of the visit was to check conditions health workers worked under, infrastructure and protective gear, among other things. She said: “We’re not the police, but we’re here to check what gaps government should look for.” They also wanted to check the hospital’s capacity to handle Covid-19 challenges. “We see here they also have renovations to accommodate the pressure of Covid-19,” he said. Modise said they had enough PPE in their hospital. “We don’t procure Covid-19 PPE locally. We get them at head office, so we never actually run out.” They were also expecting 300 beds from motor company BMW. He said these would be used in the new structure still to be built. Mkhwebane said a report on the findings would be ready in 60 days time. “It will be shared with authorities with a view to remedying the identified shortcomings.”
