SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo has admitted that his side were a little off the pace in their first match since the season resumed but expects them to improve. Matsatsantsa a Pitori were held to a 1-1 draw by Bloemfontein Celtic at Bidvest Stadium on Sunday. Celtic were playing their second match having gotten some minutes in their legs when they faced Baroka FC in the Nedbank Cup on 8 August. Tembo, whose side are currently fourth on the log standings, saw their outside chance of pushing for the title fade away with the draw. The Tshwane outfit will now hope to finish as high as possible and make this season a success having also won the MTN8 cup earlier in the campaign. Tembo is aware his side were not at their best against Celtic but is confident they will pick up momentum as they gain more minutes. “I think we played well in patches considering that it was our first game back and they were playing their second,” said Tembo. “We created the better chances and we should have won but credit must go to the guys because they tried their best until the end. I think it’s a performance we can build from. “We are playing at a new home which suits our pressing game. I think as we get our match fitness back we will definitely improve with time.” Tembo is hoping his side will kick into gear in their next match against Polokwane City who are desperately trying to cling to their Premiership status. The match will take place at the Bidvest Stadium tomorrow at 3.30pm. Rise and Shine will be looking to bounce back from a heartbreaking 3-2 defeat to leaders Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday – a match they led 2-0 until the last 20 minutes. “I’m expecting another tough game,” added Tembo. “Polokwane City are a very good team and they are also fighting for their lives so we need to prepare and ensure that we improve from our previous game so that we can get a positive result.”
