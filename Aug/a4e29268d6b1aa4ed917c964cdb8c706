MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is not giving up on the Absa Premiership title despite being aware that “it’s gone”. Downs ruined their chances of closing the gap between them and log leaders Kaizer Chiefs to three points when they lost 3-2 to Cape Town City in a league game played at Loftus Stadium on Monday. The defeat has given Amakhosi motivation to stretch their six points gap at the summit in order to reach the land of milk and honey. The Brazilians have collected 46 points with six matches still to play. Said Mosimane: “The manner which we are going it looks like it’s (league) going hey because we played three games, drawn two and lost one. In that context and reality maybe, it looks so.  But until mathematically proven that we can’t win it, we will accept it.” The outspoken mentor revealed that their ego doesn’t allow them to give up even though the writing is on the wall. “At this point in time we’ve got a lot of ego and lot of ambition that we try to win three trophies. We still believe the two are still available even though this one looks like it’s realistically going out of our hands. But that’s the story of Mamelodi Sundowns inside Covid-19. That’s the reality, we should try fight and keep going. We’ve got a lot of ambition that we can’t just leave it and say it’s done. We will go for it and if we don’t win it then the table will say so and we should accept it. We will give our best, we have too much pride not to fight. Even if the league is already gone we will fight, even in our last match we will play with pride and put in a strong team to show respect, why not.” The Brazilians have a chance to restore their pride when they meet Maritzburg United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday (6pm). This will be an interesting clash considering that Maritzburg are also reeling following a defeat by the same margin to bottom club Black Leopards on Sunday.
