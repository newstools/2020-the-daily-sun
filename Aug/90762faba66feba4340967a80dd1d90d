ON paper, the Mercedes-Benz Gel√§ndewagen should thrash its young brother, the A45s in a drag race. The G-Wagon utilises a 4.0-litre V8 bi-turbo engine that produces well over 430kW and 850Nm of torque, while its younger sibling the A45s hatch is powered by a 2-litre 4 cylinder turbocharged engine that is the fastest 4 cylinder engine in production, producing 310kW and 500Nm of torque. We also have to take into consideration the weight issue, the G-Wagon weighs about 3,200kg and the A45s weighs almost half the weight of the G-Wagon at 1 643kg, but the big advantage for the big brother is the V8 and 850Nm of torque.
