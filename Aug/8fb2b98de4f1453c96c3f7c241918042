Two men were killed in a shooting at Utrecht and taxi hitmen
have been arrested. Cops followed up on information regarding the suspects
involved and blocked all the routes. The car was spotted travelling between Dundee and Nquthu and
upon approaching the suspect’s car there was a shoot-out. The suspects abandoned their car and fled into the bushes
whilst shooting at the police. The bush was surrounded by the cops to make sure that there
are no escape routes and three suspects aged between 27 and 47 were arrested. The fourth suspect managed to evade police arrest. Cops found three rifles with 84 rounds of ammunition in the
suspect’s possession.
