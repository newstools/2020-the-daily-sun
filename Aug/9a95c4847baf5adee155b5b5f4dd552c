Kaizer Chiefs’ resumption of their Absa Premiership title pursuit got off to a shaky start. Amakhosi, whose title credentials will be put to the test over the next few weeks, could not pick up from where they left off before the Coronavirus-enforced.. They were held to a 1-1 draw by a strong Bidvest Wits outfit at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday night. They could not capitalize on their rivals Mamelodi Sundowns after they also dropped crucial points against Orlando Pirates on Tuesday. Although it was their first match in over four and a half months, the Glamour Boys managed to keep up with the Students who already had some minutes in their legs. Wits got some much needed game time when they faced Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals, losing that encounter 3-2. It was a game Wits coach Gavin Hunt beloved they did not deserve to lose and the Students were eager to bounce back. And against Chiefs, Wits had to chase the game for much of the game after Samir Nurkovic handed the leaders and early advantage. But a strong second half performance saw the Clever Boys salvage a point through midfielder Cole Alexander. Wits mentor Hunt was pleased by his side’s application again. “If we play like we have played the last two matches we will win a lot more games than we will lose,” Hunt told SuperSport TV after the match. “For players who are leaving in a couple of weeks to play the way they have been played these last two matches is unbelievable.” Chiefs will be left to rue a missed opportunity to extend their lead at the top of the log to six points and now remain just three point clear of Sundowns who have a game in hand. Chiefs next face Polokwane City at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday (3pm) while Wits tackle Orlando Pirates at Emirates Airlines Stadium on the same day at 6pm.
