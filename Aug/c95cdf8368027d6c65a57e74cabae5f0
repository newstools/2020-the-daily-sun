SPORTS Minister Nathi Mthethwa has warned PSL clubs to comply with the plans as submitted by the league to the government for the resumption of football. In a virtual briefing yesterday, Mthethwa explained that it was not a “fait accomplishment” that teams will just return to the pitch. “They will play based on the plans that were submitted to the department,” said Mthethwa. “Remember, we reserve the right to halt any activity if we feel and think that protocols were not adhered to.” The PSL is gearing up for a restart on Saturday, starting with the Nedbank Cup semi-finals, following five months of inactivity due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Teams will be staying in a biologically safe environment (BSE) for the duration of the games, as outlined in the PSL’s proposal on football resumption to the government. “We are pleased that the Department of Health has concurred with the proposal for football to return to completing the season behind closed doors – which is a closed environment of procured hotels, transport hubs, training fields, and stadiums,” Mthethwa said. “An internal monitoring team has been on the ground and have monitored 11 of the PSL clubs which have received permission to train,” Mthethwa said. “All teams have taken all necessary measures to comply with the plans that they have submitted. “We are expecting a compliance report from the SA Football Association (Safa) on the state of readiness of the PSL to resume their season. “The compliance officers of both Safa and the PSL will work together and ensure that all measures comply with the commitment made by PSL in their submissions to government.” Mthethwa also expressed appreciation to PSL chairman Irvin Khoza and Kaizer Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung, football legends Edward “Magents” Motale and Jerry Skhosana as well as the Siya Kolisi Foundation for their contributions towards Covid-19 relief efforts.
