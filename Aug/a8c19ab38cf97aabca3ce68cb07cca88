VETERAN Highlands Park midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane has confirmed that he will continue playing football next season. However, the 38-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana star is still not sure which team he will be playing for. He said he has no intention of hanging up his boots anytime soon. The talented and creative midfielder believes he still has plenty to offer the PSL ,with all the experience he has managed to get in a career that has seen him win 11 trophies. Letsholonyane, who recently signed a short-term deal with Highlands to complete the current season, has not closed the door yet on staying at the club beyond this term. He has featured nine times for the Tembisa-outfit this season, and will be eager to add to that number in the remainder of the season. “I feel like I can still play at the highest level. “I will play for as long as my legs allow me,” revealed Letsholonyane. “My manager is working on something. Once he tells me the way forward, then I will reveal everything. But at the moment I’m focused on Highlands and finishing the season here.” Letsholonyane is excited that the PSL is back after a four and a half month hiatus due to the coronavirus outbreak. He said the remainder of the season will be tough because of the congestion, but is confident that Highlands have enough quality to finish in the top eight for the second consecutive season. “We are obviously very happy to be back from such a long break,” added Letsholonyane. “It’s unusual to spend so much time off the field. It will be tough for every team because we are all facing the same situation. “We are confident that we can achieve our goals for this season, we are still on course for that. It’s important that we focus for these remaining games and give our all.”
