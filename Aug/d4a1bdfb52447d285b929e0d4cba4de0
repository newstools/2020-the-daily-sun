BLACK Leopards goalkeeper King Ndlovu has warned his teammates against complacency when they face Golden Arrows in a must-win Absa Premiership encounter at Emirates Airline Park on Friday afternoon (1.30pm). Lidoda Duvha, who sit at the bottom of the Premiership table, come to this showdown brimming with confidence after their 3-2 victory against Maritzburg United last Sunday. “It was good to restart the league with a win,” said Ndlovu. “The mood in the camp is high as no one gave us a chance against United, but we managed to beat them. In our last league game, we were hungrier than United. “What we need to do is to keep our feet on the ground and approach all our remaining matches with the same mentality we displayed against United. “My biggest worry is complacency. If we relax after one win we are going to have a serious problem.” Added the former Jomo Cosmos keeper: “We have a good team and technical staff, led by Morgan Shivambu. I believe we will get away from the bottom of the log and save this team.” The last time these two sides clashed, Leopards beat Steve Komphela’s team 2-1 at Thohoyandou Stadium with goals from Lesedi Kapinga and Themba Ndlovu while Knox Mutizwa netted for Arrows. But the 27-year-old Ga-Rankuwa-born star said he is not reading anything into past results against Arrows. “We got three points from them (Arrows) in the first round,” said Ndlovu. “But this is the second round and all teams are fighting for their goals in these final few remaining league matches. “We are expecting a tough game but we have to get a positive result to move away from the position we are on.” Arrows are coming to this clash without a win in two consecutive league matches.
