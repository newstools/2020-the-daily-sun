The ANC in Gauteng has called for Merafong Mayor Maphefo Mogale-Letsie and former West Rand District Municipality mayor Boyce Maneli, who is now an MP and chairperson of the communications committee, to step down from their roles for failing to act against officials involved in the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank. On Sunday, Gauteng ANC secretary Jacob Khawe announced the two would now be expected to resign from their roles after the Gauteng provincial executive committee (PEC) decided to adopt recommendations made by its Integrity Committee. "Although the PIC [Provincial Integrity Committee] said they couldn't establish if the two mayors were involved in any acts of corruption, they should be held accountable for failing to take action against officials and accordingly should step down from the positions which they are elected," Khawe said. He added the PEC had deliberated over the matter and decided to accept the recommendations. Last year, the ANC in the West Rand exonerated the two of any wrongdoing after it emerged the two municipalities were among several which invested millions of rand in the now defunct bank. he ANC in Gauteng has called for Merafong Mayor Maphefo Mogale-Letsie and former West Rand District Municipality mayor Boyce Maneli, who is now an MP and chairperson of the communications committee, to step down from their roles for failing to act against officials involved in the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank.On Sunday, Gauteng ANC secretary Jacob Khawe announced the two would now be expected to resign from their roles after the Gauteng provincial executive committee (PEC) decided to adopt recommendations made by its Integrity Committee."Although the PIC [Provincial Integrity Committee] said they couldn't establish if the two mayors were involved in any acts of corruption, they should be held accountable for failing to take action against officials and accordingly should step down from the positions which they are elected," Khawe said.He added the PEC had deliberated over the matter and decided to accept the recommendations.Last year, the ANC in the West Rand exonerated the two of any wrongdoing after it emerged the two municipalities were among several which invested millions of rand in the now defunct bank.
