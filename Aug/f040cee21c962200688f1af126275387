SINGER Nomsa Mazwai has started an initiative that strives to make Soweto a safe place. The creative, who’s also the general manager at the Soweto Theatre, started #FunkItImWalking. Nomsa, also known as Nomisupasta, told Daily Sun: “#FunkItImWalking is an organisation that aims to make the streets of South Africa safe enough for a woman to walk at any time of day in any condition. It aims to transform Soweto into a safer, cleaner place to live, benefitting local business and impacting society as a whole in a positive way.” They also sent out a press release which explains how the walk will take place. “On the 5th of September, #FunkItImWalking will be hosting a 5km evening walk to usher in the spring, the season of renewal. The purpose of the walk is to bring attention to the possibilities that exist for the community, if it were safe enough to walk at night,” read the statement. “The walk will pass local places of interest as well as a local restaurant who will benefit from an unlikely group of walking patrons in the evening, a rarity in Soweto as after dark, most move around in cars due to safety concerns, while the rest of the community disappear into their houses,” it continued. People who want to be part of the walk can register on the website www.funkitimwalking.co.za
