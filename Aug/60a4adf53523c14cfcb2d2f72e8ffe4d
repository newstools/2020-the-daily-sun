RESIDENTS of Langa in Cape Town took to the streets on Sunday in support of Thami Tsolekile’s mum, Nontuthuzelo, who’s calling for justice for her son. Thami, a former Proteas wicketkeeper and Lions captain, received a 12-year ban in 2015  for contriving to fix a match or matches. She said she was angry after Thami was banned and didn’t forgive him. Nontuthuzelo said: “Our relationship was never the same. “I felt he’d done something wrong and should apologise to South Africa and all cricket lovers.   “He refused to apologise and this didn’t make our relationship any better.” But after sports presenter Robert Marawa recently interviewed Thami she believed him. “They destroyed his career. They took bread from his mouth. All I want is justice.”   Resident Neliswa Gugushe (34) said they felt the ban was racially motivated. “As you’ve heard from the interview, Thami raised several issues about racism in the cricket world. It’s not surprising he was banned because of racism,” she said. During the radio interview, Thami said he was deliberately sidelined as a wicketkeeper during his time with the national team, the Proteas. He claimed at one point Graeme Smith, who was captain at the time, threatened to retire if Thami was picked for the team.
