MINISTERS, premiers, MECs and senior government officials will all be sent for training to improve service delivery. The decision, made by Cabinet at a meeting on Tuesday, was yesterday announced by Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu. Mthembu said Cabinet had approved two training programmes. “The first one is the Economic Governance Spring School training for members of the executive from all spheres of government. “It’s designed to broaden learning perspectives through analysis and critical reflection on the nature of challenges of government.” He said the programme would be run by the National School of Government, along with the OR Tambo School of Leadership and the Wits School of Governance. Mthembu said the second programme was designed for heads of departments. It has three components and will be run by the school of government and the University College London. “As I speak about these training programmes, Cabinet was reflecting on this and said if there was one thing we’ve always been accused of, it’s governance, it’s our inability to implement wonderful policy positions and policies which are in the public domain to enhance service delivery,” he said. Mthembu also said government was committed to rooting out corruption. He said the three top law enforcement agencies were working together to punish those who were guilty. The minister said the Special Investigating Unit, the Hawks and NPA were working together, as directed by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The scourge of corruption, which manifests itself in the blatant theft and looting of state resources, is the biggest societal cancer that has the potential to erode public trust in government’s concerted efforts to improve the lives of the people.” The inter-ministerial committee, led by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola, wasn’t going to investigate alleged corruption as widely believed. The committee would compile a list of contracts awarded during the pandemic.
