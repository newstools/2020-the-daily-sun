VETERAN actress Connie Chiume is basking in pride after featuring in Beyonce’s musical film, Black Is King. The Lion King tie-in album was positively received in Mzansi. Speaking to Daily Sun, Connie said: “I was very happy when I was approached to be part of the film. Beyonce is a living icon and I didn’t mind being associated with her.

Everyone wants to associate themselves with Africa. I believe this is a good thing because it demolishes that narrative that people have about Africa, which is sometimes portrayed as a continent that’s full of war, starvation and disease,” she said. “We have so much to tell as Africans about our culture, our food, our music, dance, the way we dress, and our mannerism. “The world is becoming small and I foresee many other collaborations like this one in the future. It’s a huge win for us as Africans.” Connie said it was very hard to keep the secret that she’d worked with Beyonce. “It was hard keeping such great news to myself, but I honoured the non-disclosure agreement I signed. “After she shared the trailer on her website, everyone just went crazy and I received a lot of phone calls. “I’m glad people understood and respected the fact that we were not allowed to speak about it until it premiered.”
