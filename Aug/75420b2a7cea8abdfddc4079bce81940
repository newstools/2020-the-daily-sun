Bloemfontein Celtic are so close to winning their first piece of silverware in 15 years. Phunya Sele Sele, who last won a trophy in 2005, have an opportunity to add anotehr title to their cabinet this season. This after they booked their place in the final of the Nedbank Cup with a 3-0 win over Baroka at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Maduka, who was a player the last time Celtic lifted an official trophy, is delighted to be at the helm as a coach as they look to clinch the Ke Yona Cup. However, they have a massive mountain to climb in the final as they face Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns. "I'm happy that we have reached the final," said a delighted Maduka. "We win and lose as a team. 2005 was the last time we won a trophy, i was playing that that and now we have a chance to win the Nedbank Cup and i'm the coach."We are looking forward to the final, we know that it will not be easy, the battle is not over but we are looking forward to that particular game." Maduka was happy with his side's performance in the semi-finals but bemoaned the amount of chances they wasted. "We started very well. we knew that Baroka is a team that would sit and try to get us on the counter so what we did was to ensure that we take the game to them but at the same time keep it tight at the back," added Maduka. "We should have easily scored four or five goals in the first half but our decision making let us down but we are happy to be in the final."  15 years later, Celtic can win a cup
