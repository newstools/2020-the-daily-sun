ONCE it was ranked second only to the Mbombela Stadium in Mpumalanga, today it is a vandalised, neglected mess. The sport stadium, built by former Gazankulu government around 1987, in Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge historically hosted the Cosafa Games as well as ABC Motsepe and Vodacom games. But thugs have stolen doors, stripped the toilets and water taps and broken the stadium fence.  During their visit, the SunTeam was greeted by cows wandering around, looking for grazing. The toilets were dark and dirty and the smell was unbearable. The cubicle doors were broken. There were poo and used condoms, cigarette and dagga butts all over the floor. There were no security guards and all the guard rooms were vandalised. Today the stadium is a place where young drug abusers hang around and lovers come to do their business. Gangsters target people who take the risk of walking through the grounds on their way to the shopping malls.  “We are afraid of crossing through this stadium,” said a resident. “The young gangsters target us and rob us of our grocery and cash to buy nyaope. Police have been patrolling but the gangs run away before they can be caught. There use to be guards and there were boreholes to water the beautiful lawns, but is all gone.” Aubrey Mnisi of the Bushbuckridge Municipality said: “We have appointed a consulting engineer and he has done the design for refurbishment of the stadium. "We will be starting with the process of advertising to appoint the contractor who will be doing the refurbishment.”
