GIGI Lamayne wants to empower women in the music industry. On 27 August, the rapper will host the virtual event, Gigi Gang Show: Pink Views edition, on all her social platforms. She told SunBuzz: “I am doing this show because most of the time, we are overshadowed by male artists. “We are often sidelined and are usually put in small corners of posters. “This show aims to liberate women in the music industry and aims to showcase our work as female artists. “With this show, we are demanding the same respect as our male counterparts. We don’t need to fill the gaps, but want to be treated the same way,” she said. According to Gigi, most of the artists will be women. “They include Holly Rey, Rosa Ree, Nokwazi and DBN Gogo. “I also have a few male artists including Mlindo the Vocalist, and Blaklez. “As much as this is a female event, I decided to include male artists because I am trying to show the public and the industry we need each other, and we need to do things side by side without being judgmental or oppressive,” she said. “I’ve included these male artists also because they understand our plight and actually support us. “They always try to put themselves in our shoes, and they’d go out of their way to work and collaborate with women. In other words, these male artists were carefully chosen. “I also included them to show we still need their input,” said the rapper. Gigi said this show will also be different in that it’ll pay attention to the LGBTQI community. “In hip-hop, we’ve never really had a mainstream gay artist but for this edition, we’ll be revealing our main artist for the gay community and he’s a rapper. The idea is to give the minority groups a chance to shine.” She said this would be the second edition of the show. “I started this initiative last year in May. “My plan was to host the second edition on 4 May this year, but the lockdown happened. I then decided to host it online,” said the rapper.
