TOP KZN Advocate Comfort Ngidi who has represented the provincial ANC has died of Covid-19. The well-known advocate died yesterday in hospital. Family spokeswoman Khanyisile Sindane said Ngidi had been in hospital for three weeks after he developed Covid-19 symptoms. She said doctors found that he had pneumonia but had also tested positive for Covid-19 which ultimately killed him. Comfort Ngidi (59) was a well-known KZN human rights lawyer and ANC activist. He spent many years practicing as lawyer in Durban but at the time of his death he was based in Pietermaritzburg where he ran a law firm. He was part of  the ANC legal desk in the province and served in many commissions in the province including taxi commission which was investigating taxi violence. He also served as chairman of the  South African Post Office, Ezemvelo Wildlife and South African Marine Services Association. At the time of his death he was the chairman of Umgugundlovu Development Agency. Ngidi was almost hired as one of the prosecutors at the state capture commission when it was being set up in 2018 but his name was withdrawn on the last minute after a public outcry that he was close to former president Jacob Zuma. It is believed that he failed the security vetting which all commission's staff had to through. ANC spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela said the party was shocked by Ngidi's death. He said his death was a big blow to the party's legal desk Ngidi was born at Ekupholeni village in Richmond in KZN Midlands town. Sindane said Ngidi leaves behind his and nine children. His funeral will take place at his farm homestead in Richmond on Wednesday.
