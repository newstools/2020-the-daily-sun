AS the PSL is racing against time to have all facilities ready for the resumption of football in South Africa from Saturday, Makhulong Stadium facility management will have to double efforts to have the Tembisa venue in tip-top shape - in a space of a week. Makhulong Stadium has been allocated to GladAfrica championship sides, Steenberg United and Swallows FC, and the Tembisa stadium is scheduled to host its first match on Saturday, 15 August between Steenberg and University of Pretoria FC. The condition of the stadium pitch is believed to be in a dilapidated condition and will need a lot of hard work from the Ekurhuleni Municipality to have it ready by next Saturday. Informants who are privy to entry to the stadium reckon it's going to require a lot of watering and chemicals to have the stadium ready to start hosting matches. Information gathered by SunSport is that the facility management will start working on the stadium on Sunday with the hope of meeting the league's deadline. Whether it will be ready or not remains to be seen, depending on the urgency that will be put in place by the facility managers.
