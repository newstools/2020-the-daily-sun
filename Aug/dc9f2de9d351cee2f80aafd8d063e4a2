Edith told the SunTeam she charges R2 500 to bury babies under the age of two. She said another newborn baby was dumped at her parlour recently. “This is painful and it destroys our image as women,” she said. “On the business side I’m heartbroken and counting losses.” ALSO READ: TAXI INKABI'S TELL-ALL She said the women giving her problems were aged between 24 and 35. “I’ve decided to stop burying babies without a police affidavit,” she said. “These young women are taking advantage of my good heart.” The mum of four said she prayed that God would give these women loving, caring hearts. Edith’s husband Ofentse Mmushi appealed to the community to join funeral societies to avoid such incidents.
