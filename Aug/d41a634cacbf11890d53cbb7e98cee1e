Traffic cops and police who ask for tjotjo from motorists and thugs contribute to corruption. Some of them have lost their jobs, as a result. They even have daily targets of how much they want to make. Shame on those cops who’re committing crime instead of fighting it! These people risk losing their jobs because of bribery. They forget that their job is to uphold the law and to ensure that criminals are brought to book. Instead of giving unroadworthy vehicles and people committing traffic-related transgressions fines, they have the nerve to ask for all sorts of bribes instead. I’m sure that Police Minister Bheki Cele isn’t happy at all about police in his force taking bribes. Corruption needs to be tackled head on, without fear or favour. The police force shouldn’t allow rotten elements to exist within its ranks. Cops asking motorists for bribes affect the force’s mandate to fight corruption. Corrupt traffic cops and police must be exposed and fired.
