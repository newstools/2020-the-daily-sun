KAIZER Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro has been ruled out for the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury. The player has since been released from the bio-buble camp as he cannot recover in time to finish the campaign with his teammates. Castro  injured himself during Chiefs 1-1 draw against Stellenbosch FC last weekend. He was set to undergo a late fitness test ahead of the match against Mamelodi Sundowns on Thursday but he failed it, forcing the medical team to advise coach Ernst Middendorp and his technical team not risk him in the remaining three matches of the season. Chiefs, who were defeated 1-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns in top-of-the-table clash, confirmed the news about Castro's injury in a statement."Leonardo Castro won’t play either, as the Colombian is nursing a hamstring strain," read the statement. "He has since left the bubble and will not take part in the remaining matches of the current season." Ernst Middendorp also confirmed that Castro will not take part in any of the club's upcoming matches.  "As I said earlier, Castro has left the bubble. He's struggling with a hamstring injury," Middendorp told the media.r." Castro has scored seven league goals in 16 appearances for Chiefs this season. His absence will be a huge blow for Chiefs as they have been struggling to score goals since the resumption of football early this month.
