KZN cops are determined to get rid off drugs in the province. On Wednesday, police from the provincial drug and firearm unit went to Vryheid, northern KZN. This is after they had received a tip off about a man transporting drugs to his runners. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a car was spotted and stopped on the R69 Highway near Lakeside. She said a man (37) was searched as well as his car. “Police recovered methcathonone, rock cocaine and crystal meth with a street value of R145 000. The suspect was arrested,” said Mbele. She said the cops then went to East Street in the CBD, where they spotted a man (44) who was wearing a big coat. “He was stopped and searched. Heroin powder with a street value of R27 000 was found in his pockets, packaged to be distributed to runners. He was arrested for possession of drugs,” she said. Mbele said a 30-year-old man was but in Bhekuzulu carrying a bag containing heroin powder with a street value of R32 500. “He was taken to Vryheid Police Station for detention. All the arrested suspects were charged for possession of drugs. They are expected to appear in the Vryheid Magistrates Court. Two men aged 37 and 44 are also facing charges of contravening the Immigration Act,” said Mbele. She said the recovered drugs have a combined street value of more than R204 000. KZN commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula praised the provincial drug and firearm unit for the arrests. “We remain committed to eradicating the drug scourge in this province. And once again, we applaud ordinary residents who are working with police to remove drug dealers from our streets,” he said. A resident said he is glad that cops have arrested the drug dealer and his runners. “Drug dealers sell drugs to the youth and this is ruining their lives. We hope they will continue to clean out drugs in all the streets,” said the resident.
