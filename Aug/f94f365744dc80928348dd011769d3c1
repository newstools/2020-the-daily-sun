THE ANC in KZN has removed former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede as legislature member. The surprise about turn was announced by provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli today at a media briefing. Ntuli said the decision was taken at the special provincial executive committee held earlier today. He said the decision was that all party members, who are facing criminal charges, must step aside from the party and government positions until they appear in the national integrity commission. Ntuli said the decision means that Gumede will immediately leave the legislature and her position as the deputy convener of eThekwini regional task team, which currently runs the affairs of the party, until the conference takes place. Another senior leader who is affected by the decision is party provincial deputy chairman, Mike Mabuyakhulu, who is also facing corruption charges. He was arrested in 2018 and charged for corruption in relation to the jazz event that was meant to take place in 2013. The event didn’t take place, but R30 million was paid to service providers and the state alleged that Mabuyakhulu also got money as kickback for approving the payment. Ntuli said Gumede will remain a member of the legislature, but will sit at home pending the integrity commission’s decision. “The comrades we are referring to have not been removed, but have stepped aside pending their appearances at the party’s integrity commission. The commission will decide whether their charges impact negatively on the image of the party,” said Ntuli. He said in the case of ward councillors who are facing criminal charges, the party always sends a proportional representation councillor ( PR).
