ROOFS were blown off houses in Cape Town this week while properties were flooded. The newly-established Covid squatter camp was one of the hardest hit areas. Thumeka Magadi (56) from Luzuko in Philippi was watching TV when her roof was blown off. “I suddenly felt as if I was outside. I knew there was too much wind and rain, but didn’t expect it to blow my roof away. “I had to ask my neighbours to put a tent over my house. It was difficult because of the wind.” Covid residents had their shacks blown away. Xola Mawisa said: “The wind was too much. “Those who were at work came back to find their belongings soaked in water. We’ve rebuilt our shacks.” Risk and disaster management spokeswoman Charlotte Powell said 60 roofs were blown away in Luzuko and roads were flooded. Flooding was reported in Khayelitsha, Nomzamo in Strand, and Phola Park in Philippi. The municipality provided sand and flood kits to affected residents. The weather service said temperatures were expected to rise in most parts of the country. Cold weather would continue on the coast. Showers were expected in the Eastern Cape today. Spokeswoman Hannelee Doubell said: “Winds countrywide will lessen significantly, but fresh to strong southwesterly to southerly winds may still occur along the southeastern and eastern coast. “The southern half will remain distinctly cold, but daytime temperatures are expected to recover.”
