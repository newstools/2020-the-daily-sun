We had been thinking about it since we had clients from other provinces. “When doing consultation online, my ancestors are telling me what to do. The only difference is my clients are not in the same place as me.” After doing the consultations online, he sends clients their herbs. Sangoma Khanyisa “Dudulutshaba” Mtini said she was doing consultations online before lockdown started. “You’d swear the ancestors knew that at some point we won’t be able to see our clients, but needed to continue doing our work,” Dudulutshaba said. “We couldn’t do a lot of things because of lockdown, including going to the mountains and at the beach. We couldn’t gather because of the regulations, but at least we can help by using our phones.” ALSO READ: R15 MUTHI WRECKS UMSHADO!
