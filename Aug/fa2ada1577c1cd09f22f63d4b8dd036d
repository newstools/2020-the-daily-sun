KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has called for focus from his players as they prepare for their crunch Absa Premiership clash against Mamelodi Sundowns at the Orlando Stadium on Thursday. Chiefs can go six points clear with a win, likely sealing their first league title since 2014/15 with only three matches to play. But conversely, they could also see their once commanding lead cut down to nothing, and go into the game without Samir Nurkovic, who is suspended. "We have to be focused. We have to show the competitive attitude‚ in particular knowing what is at stake," Middendorp said. "But we are excited. We are looking forward to having this game and we cannot wait. "A game like this in the final stages (of the campaign), having only three games left after this, there is always something where you push yourself to a certain level of confidence. "I will not say it is the final decision [on who wins the league]. It does not matter who is winning, it does not matter which result comes out of this match, but it will give a clear direction." Middendorp has backed his players to rise to the occasion and says there is a determination to claim victory. "I haven't really underestimated opponents. Not in this type of environment we are in. I think it is common sense, each and everybody has to do a job. They want to win; they have to fight for something. “I think in every squad, there is a certain ambition, there is a certain way to play."
