BIDVEST Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic have kept their unbeaten record in the Absa Premiership since the season resumed in bio-bubble camp. Wits have now gone eight league matches unbeaten after playing to a fifth draw in their last six outings with a 1-1 draw against Celtic at Tuks Stadium. A point leaves Wits in fourth place on the log standings while Celtic move up to eighth.The Clever Boys took an early lead from the penalty spot following a foul by Wandisile Letlabika on Terrence Dzvukamanja inside the area. Keegan Ritchie duly stepped up to the mark and powered the ball into the corner of the net.Celtic controlled the game after the early setback and were only denied the equaliser in the 25th minute through an incredible double save from Ricardo Goss. Siphelele Luthuli's initial effort cannoned off the post and into the Wits goalkeeper who had to be at his very best to keep out Motebang Sera from scoring the rebound.Siwelele were awarded a penalty of their own 10 minutes later following a foul by Lorenzo Gordinho on Ndumiso Mabena. The Celtic skipper dusted himself off before firing a low shot past the outstretched Goss who had dived the right way. Wits were the better team after the break and went close to regaining their lead through Phathutshedzo Nange and Mpho Mathebula who tested Sipho Chaine in the Phunya Sele Sele goal, but in the end neither team did quite enough to earn all three points.Both teams return to Absa Premiership action on Sunday. Wits welcome Kaizer Chiefs to FNB Stadium in what promises to be a mouthwatering showdown. Celtic will play host to relegation threatened Polokwane City at TUKS Stadium.
