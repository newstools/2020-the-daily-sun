WEST Rand’s mining area has become a target for illegal miners and immigrants. During operation O Kae Molao, led by female officers, more than 80 zama zamas were bust and their equipment confiscated. Speaking to Daily Sun, Carletonville station commander Brigadier Marinda Theron said they bust zama zamas daily. “Members work tirelessly to try to curb the influx of zama zamas coming into the area, but they are still found in numbers.”  She said this was the first time they’ve had women in the frontlines of such a big operation. “Home Affairs is also helping us. Mining security has played a vital role in carrying out this operation. We were split into five groups, with others targeting Khutsong, where illicit cigarettes were found and alcohol was sold.” Theron said her biggest concern were tribal fights. “They are armed and dangerous and kill each other. When they are arrested, they get bail and continue with their business as usual, even recruiting more people.” She hoped to one day bust the kingpins running this big syndicate.  “It is a very big and deadly syndicate. We may be making arrests daily, but are working at a drawback because we don’t have the masterminds,” she said. The operation will continue to be led by women. “This month, we want to remind our male counterparts we are also capable of doing a good job. I hope all women in all industries are given the recognition and respect they deserve. Happy Women’s Month to all,” said Theron.
