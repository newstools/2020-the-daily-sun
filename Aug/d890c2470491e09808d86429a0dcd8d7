THE man who seems homeless was spotted taking a ride at the back of the cash-in-transit truck. The video was posted by Justice Mokoena on Facebook and he captioned it: QwaQwa we don’t care. In the video, the man can be seen taking a balance not to fall down with his right foot on the truck and leaning on the spare-wheel hanged on the back of a truck. Some said they needed to have the man’s brave heart. The video, which was posted on Wednesday, has been shared over 240 times and viewed by more than 7 800 users. Victor Motsepe said: “Haaibo. Is this guy for real? That looks like a “money truck”, if it is. This guy is brave. How long was he behind the vehicle?” Justice responded: “I’m sure close to 10 minutes.” Disebo Leaha said: “He doesn’t want to be alive anymore.” Palesa Thandiwe responded: “You are brave baby.”  The video was taken by the person driving behind the money truck. One of them can be heard saying: “This guy is sitting on top of the money.” His friend is heard responding: “He is thirsty!” By the time of going to print, Daily Sun had not found out which company the truck belonged. Samuel Ntjomane said he knew the man as a homeless who was peaceful. “He just a homeless man who enjoys to laugh a lot. I have never seen him involved in a fight or argument,” he said.
