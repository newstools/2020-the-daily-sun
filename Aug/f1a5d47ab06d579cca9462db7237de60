HERMAN Mashaba plans to launch his
new political party on the 29th of this month. With just over two weeks to go,
volunteers in Tshwane have already started making people aware of the party and
recruiting members. On Saturday and Sunday, volunteers
distributed pamphlets at the Silver Mall in Tshwane. Sub-regional co-ordinater
Donald Buthane said they also told shoppers about the party’s core values. “We have been campaigning virtually
on social media platforms and we now want to reach those we couldn’t through
those platforms and those without social media,” he said. Donald said they had received
positive responses and were confident the new party would be a success. “People want a good alternative to
the political parties we have, which have been given a chance and have failed
to bring real change to the people who voted for them,” he said. Resident Abel Matlou (30) said he
didn’t vote in last year’s election as he couldn’t vote for any of the parties. “Both the ANC and the DA have
failed voters. Wherever they govern, it’s chaos. The poor are neglected while
politicians become fatter by the day,” he said. Bella Nkgweng (37) said corruption
in the distribution of PPEs involving politicians had made her change the mind
about the ANC. “I will vote for Mashaba, who was
mayor in Joburg but didn’t steal a cent. I regret voting for the ANC. Mashaba
should have been president yesterday,” she said. In a shocking turn of events,
Mashaba left the day last year after former party leader Helen Zille was
elected as federal council chair. He then launched his own civic organisation,
The People’s Dialogue. His party’s launch will see the
unveiling of its name, logo, constitution and a solutions blueprint. After Mashaba left the ANC, he was
joined by several high profile member, including former Joburg regional
chairman Funzile Ngobeni and Mashaba’s former chief of staff Michael Beaumont.
The latest to join Mashaba was former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor.
