  A 49-year-old security guard at Shihoko Clinic in Letsitele outside Tzaneen, Limpopo, was arrested after she allegedly shot her colleague several times. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim was on duty together with the suspect when she allegedly shot him several times, using a service pistol, before fleeing the scene. He said the people in the neighborhood apparently heard a gunshot and called the police, who rushed to the scene and found the critically wounded guard lying unconscious. He was immediately taken to hospital for medical treatment. Mojapelo said the police investigations revealed that the victim was not posted alone at the time, and a search operation for his colleague immediately commenced. The suspect was tracked down and was found at her boyfriend's place in Shihoko and arrested. She was still dressed in her uniform, and the firearm that is believed to be the one used in the shooting was also confiscated. He said the motive for the incident is not known at this point and police investigations are continuing. The suspect will appear in the Ritavi Magistrates Court, facing a charge of attempted murder.
