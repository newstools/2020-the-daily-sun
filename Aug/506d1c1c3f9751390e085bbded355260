CRICKET South Africa (CSA) has announced that they have fired suspended chief executive officer, Thabang Moroe. Moroe was suspended back in December 2019 as a result of alleged misconduct. In a statement released to the press, CSA confirmed the termination of Moroe's contract was with immediate effect after an independent forensic investigation revealed that Moroe had committed acts of serious misconduct which warranted the sanction of dismissal. "Cricket South Africaâ€™s decision was based on expert external legal opinion supported by the findings emanating from an independent forensic investigation. "The independent forensic investigation revealed that Mr. Thabang Moroe had committed acts of serious misconduct which warranted the sanction of dismissal," the statement said. "Mr Thabang Moroe was offered sufficient opportunity to provide representations to the independent forensic auditors and to the Board regarding the allegations of misconduct, which opportunity he failed and/or refused to utilise." CSA confirmed that Kugandrie Govender would continue in the acting chief executive officer role. "Ms. Kugandrie Govender will continue in the acting chief executive officer role until such time as Cricket South Africa recruits a chief executive officer."
