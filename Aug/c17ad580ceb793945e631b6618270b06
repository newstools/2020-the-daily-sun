RELEGATION haunted Royal Eagles have been told to go for the kill when they face Free State Stars when the KwaZulu-Natal outfit resume their GladAfrica Championship season at Sturrock Park next Tuesday (3.30pm). That was the message from Eagles chairman Sbu Mpisane, who stressed: “We are going for the jugular.” Mpisane has also beefed up his technical team by appointing former Vaal University of Technology coach Stan Nkoane to work alongside coach Milton Dlamini. “If we can win three games, we are done. In fact, with the team that I have, anything can happen. “We are going there not to donate points, but we are going there to collect points,” he said. Eagles are propping up the foot of the table on 18 points from 24 games, and four points behind Jomo Cosmos, who also have played the same number of matches. For Eagles, it is dramatic fall from grace. The club qualified for last season’s promotion/relegation play-offs, but are staring relegation in the face. Eagles were also said to be struggling financially to comply with the new safety regulations. However, the club have confirmed that they have fulfilled all the regulations and will join other teams in the biologically safe environment bio-bubble in Gauteng tomorrow. Football in Mzansi was suspended by the outbreak of Covid-19 in March. And now fans can look forward to the season being completed, although all matches will be played behind closed doors. Clubs have different goals, especially Ajax Cape Town, who are on top of the Championship on 48 points from 24 games, followed by Swallows FC on 41 and Uthongathi, who are third with 40. The winners gain automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership, while the sides finishing second and third go into the play-offs with the side ending 15th in the Premiership. Two matches restart the Championship programme this weekend. On Sunday, Richards Bay face TS Sporting at the Tuks Stadium while Real Kings play Cape Umoya United at the Tsakane Stadium. Both kick-off at 3.30pm.
