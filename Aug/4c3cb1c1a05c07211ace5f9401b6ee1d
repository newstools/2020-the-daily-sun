RESIDENTS of Slovo Park in Soweto have been waiting for electricity for more than 20 years. Yesterday, a joint operation between City Power and various Joburg law enforcement agencies went to the area to disconnect izinyoka lines and residents were not happy. While City Power disconnected, residents protested, leading to cops firing rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. Dikeledi Motaung (34) said she moved to the area more than 10 years ago and had never had electricity. “The government doesn’t care about us. They only come here when they want our votes. “In this day and age, they expect us to survive with candles, yet we live among people who are well equipped to provide us with light,” she said. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena told Daily Sunthe area was an overloading hot spot. “We have been having outages all year. Paying customers regularly complain about illegal connections eating from the network. They always have issues with the power tripping because of these illegal connections,” he said. Mangena said there had been incidents of transformers and mini substations blowing up because of illegal connections. “Illegal connections cost the City of Joburg millions of rands in terms of lost revenue, revenue that we could have invested back to the infrastructure and the city. “There is a hospital there (Rahima Moosa) that is always affected when there are trips. The hospital is always affected by trips and it’s an essential service,” said Mangena.
