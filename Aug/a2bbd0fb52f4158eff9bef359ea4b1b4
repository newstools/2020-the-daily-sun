Lazio forward Ciro Immobile scored his 36th goal of the season on Saturday against Napoli to equal the record for the most goals in a Serie A campaign. The 30-year-old Italy international tapped in after 22 minutes to match Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain's record of 36 goals, set while playing for Napoli in the 2015-16 season. Immobile will also win the European Golden Shoe for the continent's top scorer this term, having overtaken Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski's tally of 34 in midweek. - AFP
