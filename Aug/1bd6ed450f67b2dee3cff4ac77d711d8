Gaston Sirino will miss Mamelodi Sundowns' two straight matches, including Saturday's Nedbank Cup semi-final against Bidvest Wits at Orlando Saturday at 7.15pm. Sundowns open the resumption of football with two mouthwatering clashes against Wits at Orlando Stadium, then three days later face Orlando Pirates in their Absa Premiership title defence at Dobsonville Stadium. The Uruguayan will not be available for selection for these two clashes as he is still facing suspension after the Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee (DC) found him guilty in May and gave him a two-match suspension. He will be back for their league clash against Highlands Park at Dobsonville Stadium on 14 August. The Uruguayan has made thirty-two appearances in all competitions for Sundowns this season, banging in 11 goals with seven assist. Masandawana to miss Sirino in the opening games.?? https://t.co/vbx9DDzVVm#Sundowns pic.twitter.com/TcmSrgWvOW
