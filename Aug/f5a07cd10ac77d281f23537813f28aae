BANYANA  Banyana star Rhoda Mulaudzi has opened her goal account for her new side Dinamo-BSUPC. The former Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies striker was among the scorers as her side thrashed ABBF U19 9-0 in a Belarusian Women’s top flight encounter on Saturday. Mulaudzi, who was introduced in the 67th minute, wasted little time finding the back of the net to wrap up a convincing win for her side. Banyana teammate, Lebogang Ramalepe, lasted the duration of the match. Dinamo have now opened a 12-point lead at the top of the log, with 45 points from 15 matches. The Banyana duo will now hope to help Dinamo secure their first title in their history when they face Minsk in the Women’s Cup final on August 31. I got to introduce myself on the score sheet for @FC_Dinamo_Minsk yesterday. I’m happy to have helped my team win 9-0. Here’s to many more! ????@pumafootball @PUMASouthAfrica @PumaWomen#womensfootball pic.twitter.com/sYYlEVWIeZ
