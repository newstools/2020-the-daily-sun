THE Tshwane Metro Police Department has lost three officers. This after they were involved in a head-on collision with a
suspected drunk driver on the N4 between Trans Orange Road and Rebecca Street
in Pretoria west in the early hours of Sunday morning. TMPD spokesman Senior Superintendent, Isaac Mahamba, said
they are saddened by their deaths. “It was around 02h00 this morning when the officers spotted
a vehicle driving recklessly and facing oncoming traffic in the Pretoria CBD,”
he said. He said the officers tried to stop the vehicle, which was
driving to the west direction, but it fled, and officers gave chase. “The officers called for back-up and they were joined in the
chase by a TMPD team which was in the area where the vehicle was heading. The TMPD vehicle had three male officers inside,” he said. He said that the vehicle in pursuit was then involved in a
head on collision with the TMPD vehicle that was giving back up. “The three Tshwane Metro Police officers that were inside
the vehicle all died on the scene. The driver of the vehicle which was sought
also died on the scene. “He was driving with a lady passenger who was transported to
the nearest hospital,” he said. Mahamba said empty and full alcohol bottles were found in
the suspect's vehicle. “A case of culpable homicide has been opened. “The identities of the 3 officers who lost their lives will
be released as soon as their families have been informed,” he said. He said they are still in great shock. “We would like to send our sincere condolences to their
families and colleagues,” he said.
