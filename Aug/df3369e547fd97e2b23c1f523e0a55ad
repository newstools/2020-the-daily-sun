AJAX Cape Town will resume their pursuit of the 2019-20 GladAfrica Championship title when they return to action this week with a clash against Richards Bay FC on Wednesday (3:30pm). The Urban Warriors currently lead the pack after 24 rounds of league fixtures and departed for the Premier Soccer League's (PSL) bio-bubble in Gauteng on Monday holding a seven-point lead with six rounds of fixtures remaining.. Calvin Marlin's troops opened up a substantial lead atop the league standings with a 1-0 win over TS Galaxy in March. Thendo Mukumela scored a late winner for the hosts as they capitalised on Swallows' 0-0 draw at home to Uthongathi. There were two GladAfrica Championship games on Sunday with Real Kings defeating Cape Umoya United 2-0 while Richards Bay and TS Sporting played to a 2-2 on the opening weekend of action â€“ five months after the league season was suspended due to the on-going Covid-19 pandemic. Swallows, who sit in second place behind Ajax, will return to action with a clash against relegation-threatened Sporting while third-placed Uthongathi host this season's surprise package JDR Stars. Elsewhere, Jomo Cosmos will be eyeing a much needed win when they take on Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila while bottom-of-the-table Royal Eagles battle Free State Stars.
