Residents
of Empakeni village outside Pienaar in Mpumalanga lives in fear as wild animals
roam free.  This after the
Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency discontinued a R16 million fencing project
at Mthethomusha Game Reserve. Community members told Daily Sun that the animals
from the park are roaming the streets and attacking their livestock.  A resident,
Shadrack Magagula (35) said since 2013, community members have tried to engage
all relevant stakeholders about the fencing issue and they promised to fix it
however nothing has been done. He said now, they can't sleep because they don't
know what might happen to them and their livestock. "The
park fence is being damaged, the animals roam freely going to our community
attacking our livestock. They might come for us anytime soon and we are scared.
Our children cannot play outside because of fear, " he said  Magagula
said what is happening is sad because most of the people in the area survives
by breeding and selling livestock. " If you find your cow or goat dead,
that means you have lost income. We can no longer watch our livestock perish
like that. We are appealing to the president to assist us on this issue as the
provincial government failed us," he said. Last week a
man was allegedly shot and killed in the same park after he went to search for
his cattle.  Mpumalanga
Tourism and Parks Agency spokeswoman, Kholofelo Nkambule said they are aware
about the matter and giving it the necessary attention it requires.  "It is
important to indicate that indeed the fence at the reserve requires urgent
attention and repairs. We had prioritized the fencing project for this year
however with the current budgets being prioritized for the Covid-19 pandemic we
will have to review that and look at other alternative measures, "she said  Nkambule
further appealed to the community to not vandalize these properties in any way
