August is a month that we celebrate women. These are our mothers, gogos and our sisters. We show them appreciation for their care and love. But lately there’s been a rise in the number of abused and murdered women. Most of the victims are attacked by the very same men who claim to love them. Women who depend on men are likely to become victims of gender-based violence. I’d like to encourage women to stop depending on men. Women should move away from the ancient thinking that a man should provide. You have the ability to make something out of your life. You can, woman. By Godfrey Malibe, Acornhoek
