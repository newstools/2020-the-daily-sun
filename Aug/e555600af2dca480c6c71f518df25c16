WITH the positive response AmaZulu coach Ayanda Dlamini has been getting from his players since they resumed training, the mentor is relying on their mental strength to save the club from being relegated. AmaZulu will resume the Absa premiership campaign which was halted by the coronavirus in March against Baroka FC in the bottom of the table battle on Saturday 15 August. Both of these sides have not been getting desired results since the beginning of the campaign. AmaZulu are in position 15 with 23 points after 24 matches, while Bakgaga Ba Mphahlele are occupying the 13th spot with the same number of points. “I think it’s more about the mentality now and the desire to work hard," Usuthu's caretaker coach Dlamini said. "There will be tactics involved but I think for these six games remaining, it will be about who wants it more than the other, the fight that you put out on the field that counts. "It will be a big challenge mentally for the players and so we are trying to work on that," However, Dlamini seems to be impressed with the response he has been receiving fro his charges. He said: "The response from the players is very positive. “It’s very different to train now because we know when we are starting the games compared to when we didn’t know.“Now we have some direction. The attitude has been very good from the boys and it helps that we are going to resume the league.” AmaZulu have been assigned Lucas Moripe Stadium in Pretoria as their home base in the Gauteng Bio-bubble camp until the end of the season.
