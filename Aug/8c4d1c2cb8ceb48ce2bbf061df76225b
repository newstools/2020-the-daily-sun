Samsung just solved a problem to one of the world's most difficult chores. The tech giant just made sure that you can clean and disinfect your clothes while they just chill in your wardrobe. Samsung is selling a £2,000 (about R20 000) wardrobe that doubles up as a dry cleaning machine for lazy or super busy people. The "AirDresser" is said to remove dust and germs, while refreshing and sanitising clothes.  "Blasting hot steam through its bespoke clothes hangers, it tackles those lingering odours, unwanted smells and hidden germs," Samsung said."It's the perfect way to refresh the laundry between washes."  The AirDresser has been available in Korea only but will be rolled out to other countries in due time. Samsung says the product has been designed to make minimal noise and vibration, to suit your home, including the bedroom.Tests suggest the device eliminates 99.9% of four common viruses, including the flu and herpes. "AirDresser is Samsung’s response to consumer demand for more dynamic performance from even basic appliances," said Jennifer Song, Samsung’s VP of digital appliances.
