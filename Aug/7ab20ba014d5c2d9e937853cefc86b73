M any poor families are going to suffer in the wake of the 11,6% increase in food prices. Food prices have increased exponentially, and it’s getting terrible out there for poor people. I’m more concerned about unemployed people and low-earning families during this pandemic. Hunger, which has increased by nearly 3% in South Africa, is fast becoming one of the greatest threats in the fight against Covid-19. There has been little intervention by government in regulating food prices. Government has to take on retailers and agents that make profit in the retail value chain. We can’t have a pandemic amid high levels of hunger in our country. Exorbitant price hikes negatively affect vulnerable communities. Feeding their families has become increasingly difficult, and others have even approached loan sharks. There’s nothing consumers can do about these price hikes. ) Lockdown has affected the economy badly, but the real sufferers are hard-working people who have to worry every day how to feed their families.  Hunger and poverty have increased, with many families battling to secure their next meal. It’s highly immoral for retailers to punish the poor further with these elevated food hikes, and the state must urgently intervene to stop this greedy practice. This letter wins R200.
