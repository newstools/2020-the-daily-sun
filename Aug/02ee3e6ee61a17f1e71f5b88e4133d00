When Idols contestant Vhudi, who looks a lot like Tresor Riziki, belted out a song titled Yoki Yoki yesterday, fans went crazy and flooded Tresor’s social media to get him to do a song with Vhudi. Tresor told Daily Sun his timeline was flooded with requests from people who wanted him to collaborate with Vhudi. “I was having a relaxed Sunday when hundreds of people went to my Twitter asking me to do a song with him.

Tresor said it was also heartwarming to see people routing for Vhudi and wishing him well. “I love the fact that people are supporting him in his quest to pursue his passion.” He said the resemblance between the two of them was because they are both from Africa. “He is from Venda and I’m from Congo, so who knows, he could be my long lost African brother I didn’t know about, because as African Africans we have some similarities.”
