Bosses and supervisors must stop demanding sexual favours from women before giving them work or promotions. It’s not right that women have to go through this. It’s degrading. According to recent research by ActionAid South Africa, 40% of women said they could only access jobs through sexual favours. It’s unfortunate that most women were sexually harassed to get contracts for their small businesses. It’s unfair. Those who give in to male decision-makers’ requests, in exchange for business deals, are being stalled in their efforts to grow their businesses. Only shameless men have the balls to ask for sex in exchange for favours.  Let’s stop seeing women as sex objects.
