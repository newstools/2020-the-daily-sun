A security officer has been shot and killed in an alleged cash-in-transit heist on 3rd Avenue in Stretford, Orange Farm, Johannesburg. The alleged heist took place on Friday afternoon. When emergency personnel arrived on the scene, they found a bakkie and a light motor vehicle parked in the middle of the road and several members of local security and law enforcement walking around on the scene, according to a statement by ER24. The body of a security officer, who had been shot in the chest, was lying near the bakkie. "Medics assessed the patients and found a male security officer lying motionless inside the bakkie. Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his gunshot wound to the chest. Nothing more could be done for him, and he was declared dead," the statement read. Two other security guards were assessed and found to have escaped injury. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. Comment from the South African Police Service will be added once received. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/security-guard-shot-killed-in-orange-farm-cash-in-transit-heist-20200815
