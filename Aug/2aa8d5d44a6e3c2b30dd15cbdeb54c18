A brave boy from Gugulethu, whose picture went viral while mimicking cops, has turned six today. The photographer who took the boy’s picture, Ayanda Ndamane, organised a birthday party for him. Last week, Uzalo actress Nompilo Maphumulo, who plays Nosipho, visited the boy and gave him some groceries. Azola Phapu went viral on social media mimicking law enforcement officials during a protest. The boy took his toy gun and wore his helmet and joined the police. “This is his first birthday. He has never had a birthday party since he was born. I don’t know what to say. We are at loss for words with what is happening to Azola’s life. After the death of his mother, we didn’t know what to do,” said Azola’s aunt, Bukelwa Phapu, who lives with the little boy. Ayanda, who works for Africa News Agency, organised the birthday through donations from various well-wishers. “I only want to see him happy. He is an intelligent boy and I’m glad that he finally has his first birthday party,” said Ayanda. He said the cops, who are in the same picture with Azola that he took two years ago, also visited him and contributed towards his party. Up-and-coming musician Banathi Daniels performed at the boy’s party that was attended by Azola’s friends. Azola took the dance floor and danced with his friends. When Nosipho visited last week, she promised to visit Azola every time she’s in Cape Town. The Lungile Mtshotwana Foundation has promised to send  Azola to school until university level. A process is underway to transfer the boy to Curro Schools. Foundation founder Unathi Mtshotwana said: “I spoke to Curro private school at Durbanville, in the Western Cape, and the principal said we should send the child’s documents. "His concern was transport, but we told him to leave that to us. We are doing something for Azola and want him to get the best education.”
