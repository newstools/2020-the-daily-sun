  POLICE are
looking for a suspect or suspects who allegedly shot and killed a security
guard on Tuesday. The guard
was on duty at a construction site in Barberton, Mpumalanga when he was
murdered and robbed of his weapon and ammunition. Mpumalanga
police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a fellow guard heard gunshots
from the direction where the victim was working and went to check on him. “He
found him lying on the ground. His firearm had been stolen. Police and medical
personnel were notified and the man was certified dead at the scene and a
manhunt was ordered,” he said Last
week  angry community members halted the
construction of the R10 million community clinic where the guard was working,
calling for the contractor to terminate the contracted security company and
appoint a local one. The
security company is reportedly to be from KZN. The community further called for
transparency when there are job opportunities available. They vowed
to continue to disrupt construction work on site until the contractor accepted
their demands. The clinic has been donated by Barberton Mines. Anyone with
information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects is asked to phone
Lieutenant Colonel Senzo Dawe on 071 685 1364, or call the Crime Stop number on
08600 1011. They can also give a tip-off on the MySAPS app that can be
downloaded to any smartphone.
