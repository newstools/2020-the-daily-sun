THEY don’t know what tomorrow holds for them and don’t have much left to fight for in the league. That is the sad story of Bidvest Wits and the players who face an uncertain future. But on the field, coach Gavin Hunt expects nothing but 100% commitment from his players, even as they prepare to tackle Orlando Pirates at Ellis Park tomorrow (6pm). Anyone who doesn’t give his utmost best may as well stay behind at the hotel. Hunt has admitted to the challenge he faces motivating his players for each and every game. But he insisted: “We have to remain professional and respect the game, despite whatever the situation we face. “The sale of the club has hit us, but it hasn’t hit us yet because we have eight games left. I think when we get to the last game, there’s going to be lots of tears, a lot of emotions.” The Students have shown nothing but dedication in their last two big matches, the Nedbank Cup loss to Mamelodi Sundowns and the draw against Kaizer Chiefs in midweek. Hunt threw in youngsters Keegan Phillips and Rowan Human, in the absence of the likes of Buhle Mkhwanazi and suspended Sfiso Hlanti. “If you look at our Diski team, they were top of the league, a good crop of players we’ve had in the last two seasons, and I knew they were coming. The next season would have been the season for them. Obviously, we won’t be together, we are all going our different ways. “But we are going to need more for the next game,” said Hunt. Thabang Monare is battling to get fit, having missed training for two weeks. This could open up further opportunities for the youngsters against Bucs, alongside Alexander Cole. “Buhle needed rest and he was sitting on three yellow cards and if I lose him and another one, I won’t have any players for Saturday. “The problem with the bio bubble is that training is limited. I’ve got to my best. Teams get selected on what you have available,” added Hunt.
