YFM radio presenter Da Kruk is taking amapiano international. The 31-year-old host, whose real name is Kutloano Nhlapo, got two international gigs to host a show called Ama-International on UK-based stations Drums Radio and The Beat London. Da Kruk from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni hosts The Players Club on YFM every Saturday. Speaking to Daily Sun, he said his new shows would be exclusively about amapiano and he was very excited. “This opportunity is an amazing pat on the back. All I’ve ever wanted was to do meaningful shows. This is a big step in the right direction and a huge responsibility because I can tell stories about South African music. MINNIE DLAMINI SLAMMED! “There are a lot of preconceived ideas about South Africa and its music. Now it’s time for me to fix these ideas.” Da Kruk said he had worked for Drums Radio before. “A few years ago I did inserts for a couple of shows. I would talk about South African dance music and they enjoyed those inserts,” he said. “When they heard I was taking a behind-the-scenes role on YFM, they asked me to host these shows. “It was impossible to say no.” Da Kruk, who’s the first DJs to have a segment about amapiano, said: “For me to be the one taking it international is great. I’ll be mixing old amapiano songs with the new.” The shows officially starts on Sunday. It will be airing on The Drums on Thursdays and The Beat London on Sundays.
