ACTRESS and musician Simphiwe Ngema had tongues wagging when she announced her pregnancy on Wednesday. Simphiwe, who plays Ruth on SABC2’s Bone of My Bones, announced she was expecting her first child with Tino Chiyani. Although many congratulated her, some felt she had moved on too quickly after losing her husband Dumi Masilela, who died during a botched hijacking three years ago. One Twitter user wrote: “So quick. Didn’t wait for five years at least.” However, many users defended the actress, saying she couldn’t mourn forever. Another user wrote: “We all deserve to find love again.”  In her pregnancy announcement post on Instagram, she thanked her baby daddy, Tino, for teaching her to love again. “Tino Chiyani, I will forever be grateful to you for this beautiful gift and for teaching me how to love again. I love you both with all my heart,” she wrote. She also thanked God for her bundle of joy and said God had wiped away her tears and given her joy in abundance.  Contacted by the SunTeam, Simphiwe said that she wasn’t currently doing any interviews.
