HE was one of about 15 suspects who blasted a safe at Shoprite Usave in Pienaar at about 1.45am yesterday morning. But he was found dead after a wall collapsed on him! According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the suspects used explosives to blast the safe and took an undisclosed amount of cash. “They gained entry through the front entrance. “The two security guards who were at the back heard the blast and pressed the panic button,” he said. There were police patrolling in the area as the crime was in progress. The thugs fired at the cops and there was an exchange of shots. No police officer was injured during the shooting. Hlathi said the suspects ran in different directions as police gave chase, but they vanished into the houses near the shop. The 32-year-old suspect who died was found with a driver’s licence in his possession. Hlathi said a case of business robbery has been opened.
