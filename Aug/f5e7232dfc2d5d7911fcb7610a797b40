THE SABC is standing by Ukhozi FM presenter Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe, who’s being accused of insulting listeners for the second time this year. This time he was accused of insulting two people in separate incidents. In the first incident Facebook user, Zikhulile Xulu, questioned Tshatha’s relationship with co-host Nongcebo Mackenzie. “Is this still a work relationship or are they having sex?” he asked before posting photos of the pair. In one of the photos, Nongcebo’s legs are on Tshatha’s lap. Tshatha replied: “What’s your problem? Do you want me to have sex with you instead? Stop being forward. You’re too old to be this stupid.” ALSO READ:KIM KARDASHIAN VOWS TO GET C-MURDER OUT OF JAIL! The second incident happened on Saturday when Mbiza Mtongazi wrote in a Facebook group that Tshatha and his team never played Mnikazi Majola’s music, but pretended to support him after he died. Tshatha said in Zulu: “You scumbag mask. What do you mean he wasn’t played?” Some Facebook fans were impressed while others didn’t approve. Inyengelezi Matatazela said: “You must stop this habit of insulting listeners. Stop acting like a fool.” To which Tshatha responded: “Did I insult someone? You like talking rubbish. I responded accordingly.” Tshatha said: “It was a joke and we were all laughing. They also called me a baby’s mask. As for the photos with my colleague, there’s nothing serious there because that’s how we normally play.” SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo told the People’s Paper: “Ukhozi FM management doesn’t find Mr Khathide’s responses derogatory when taken in context and will not be taking any action against him.”
