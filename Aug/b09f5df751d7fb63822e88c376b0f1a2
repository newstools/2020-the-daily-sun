TRIBUTES poured in yesterday for former City Press sports editor S’busiso Mseleku, who died due to Covid-19 complications. S’busiso will be remembered for coining the name Bafana Bafana while working for Sowetan newspaper in the 1990s, and he was an integral part of the growing standard of football journalism in Mzansi. SunSport editor Mathews Mpete said it was with great sadness that S’busiso has died at the infancy of his S’busiso Mseleku Sports Channel. “We introduced copy synergy with City Press and it worked like magic for both publications. “He will be missed for his laughter. He liked the joke of referring to a calf as a ‘kgomotso’ in Setswana. He was never shy to share content with junior staffers, but also took the bull by the horns. “He believed in nurturing journalists for the future, and was a perfectionist.” His family yesterday confirmed the 59-year-old died at Midvaal Private Hospital of a short Covid-19-related illness. “S’busiso also worked as sports editor for Drum magazine. He was also an analyst on SABC Sports and broadcast channels, and led the City Press sports department as editor,” his family said in a statement. Safa president Danny Jordaan expressed his sadness for having lost a “friend”. “We are all gutted and feeling empty. S’busiso was a giant in every right. South Africa is poorer without him. We have been plunged into mourning,” said Jordaan. “To his family, I say, we are all grieving with you on this huge loss. Here is an individual who has run his race. May his soul rest in peace.” UDM leader Bantu Holomisa passed his condolences to the family, while Team SA said: “His excellent work will always be remembered.”
