A COUPLE from Ben Farm in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, want their son’s killers to be brought to book. Nyiko Mashaba (20), a grade 12 pupil at WEM Independent School, was robbed and gunned down in his room near the school on Thursday. Residents have called on the Mpumalanga public works department to demolish abandoned buildings in the area, saying they’re dens of thieves. “They shelter a nyaope gang which killed this pupil and robs people every day,” said a resident. Nyiko’s dad Paul (54) and his mum Ruth Chauke wanted their son’s killers to face justice. “They killed our only beloved son like a dog,” said Paul. “When we arrived at the scene we found him lying dead in a pool of blood on his bed. His killers took his cellphone, cash and ID.” Mpumalanga public works spokesman Frederick Dhlamini told Daily Sun: “The property in question is a subject of investigation and the department will speak once all relevant facts have been gathered. “We’d like to convey our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops were investigating a murder case. “Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects can call Colonel Mushwana on 082 469 1298,” he said.
