BIDVEST Wits players will not bow out without a fight. The club have been sold to Limpopo businessman Masala Mulaudzi who currently owns First Division (GladAfrica Championship) outfit, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). But the players remain committed that they will fight for the badge until the last game of the Absa Premiership season, which is set to resume on 8 August. Wits, who went to the forced break after the outbreak of coronavirus, are sitting in position six in the standings and have nine league games remaining. Those games include two encounters against leaders Kaizer Chiefs, which might give a glimpse of where the league title will go once the season is finally concluded. The Students are also still in the running for the Nedbank Cup R7 million prize as football was stopped while they reached the semi-finals of the competition. The Clever Boys play Mamelodi Sundowns in the Ke Yona Cup semi-final next weekend. Wits attacker Kgaogelo Sekgota, who has been tipped to return to Portugal at the end of the season when his stint with the club comes to an end, said they have a lot to play for. “We are in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals and we still have a few league games left, so there is still a lot to play for,” he said. “Obviously, we are a big team with a good coach (Gavin Hunt) that has a lot of experience. “We have a squad full of national team players, so we’ll remain competitive and professional until the end of season. “It is good to be back after a long time. Football is something that we love and live for, so this is a great feeling.” The 23-year-old said there will not be a lack of motivation in the players, despite the sale of the club’s status to TTM. “It is all about the dedication that you have, your goals in life. You must stay strong. Challenges come and go. You just need to be mentally strong and remain focused,” added Sekgota.
