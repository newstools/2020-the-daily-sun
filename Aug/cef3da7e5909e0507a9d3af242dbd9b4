This after investigating officer Sergeant George Maditse told Roux that one of the suspect’s dad was seen driving around International Pentecost Holiness Church as if he was scouting.

Yet my colleagues here already dismissed it as nonsense,” said Roux. This was during the bail application of 42 people accused of murder, attempted murder and malicious damage to property in the Westonaria Magistrates Court yesterday. Maditse insisted that the accused shouldn’t be granted bail. “They shouldn’t be granted bail because chances are they will want to finish what they started. They must stay behind bars until the date of the trial,” he said. ALSO READ: PANIC AS THUG HIT PICK N PAY STORE! Maditse said that two of the accused were likely to flee the country, should they be granted bail. Roux then argued that the other 40 suspects would remain in jail because of two suspects. Roux told the court his clients were apprehended, even before they reached the church. The matter will continue today to finalise the bail application.
