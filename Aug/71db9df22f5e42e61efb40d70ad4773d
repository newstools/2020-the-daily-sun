A husband is behind bars for his wife's murder. This comes after he allegedly stabbed his wife several times on her upper body. This is according the Johannesburg Central SAPS, spokesman, Captain Xoli Mbele. He said the 32-year-old male allegedly killed his 42 year old wife using a knife and Paramedics certified her dead on the scene. Mbele said the motive behind the murder is not yet known. "The knife used in the commission of a crime was recovered," said Mbele. He also told the People's paper that the suspect left their apartment and one of the residents saw him with blood in his clothes and alerted the security guard immediately. "Police were called and apprehended a suspect then they discovered a gruesome scene of murder. Investigation is under way and the suspect will appear soon in the Johannesburg Magistrate Court," said Mbele. The Station Commander Brigadier Irvin Perumal condemned such a heinous crime against women. He urged the women not to keep quiet when they are being abused by the partners. "Men also need to stop treating women as their property and seek counseling if they cannot solve their problems amicably," said Perumal.
