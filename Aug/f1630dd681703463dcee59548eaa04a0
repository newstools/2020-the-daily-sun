THE mayor of Ditsobotla Local Municipality has pleaded with residents to remain calm. Daniel Buthelezi expressed shock after a police officer was injured and a truck was set alight by angry former employees and businesspeople. A group of people took to the streets on Thursday night, demanding the municipal manager and the mayor to step down. They claimed the municipality wasn’t delivering services properly. Buthelezi dismissed the allegations, saying the protest was politically motivated. He said services had improved in his municipality. “The number of street sewers have been drastically reduced, water leaks have been eradicated, and pipe bursts are speedily attended to and resolved successfully,” he said. Buthelezi said the people behind the protest were involved in groups that wanted to cause instability. “If you look into this, there’s a lot of political interference. This has been done deliberately with the intention to tarnish the image of the leadership. It was done intentionally and was political,” he said. “They have realised the taps are no longer flowing after using municipal resources for their personal matters. They feel aggrieved that they aren’t getting the same opportunities they had when there was instability. Now they’re unable to push their personal agendas.”
