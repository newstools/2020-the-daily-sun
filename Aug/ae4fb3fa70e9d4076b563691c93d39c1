PERCY Tau ensured Anderlecht gets a point when his side Anderlecht played to a draw against Oostende on Friday. Tau scored an equaliser when his side played to a 2-2 draw at Versluys Arena in Belgium. The Bafana Bafana forward who is on loan from Brighton and Hove Albion, was making his first start for Purple and Whites having come on in the last two matches from the bench.It was the home team that took the lead with Robbie D'Haese and Senegal forward Makhtar Gueye (from the penalty spot) doing the goalscoring honours before Adrien Trebel halved the deficit in the 35th minute. With the game at 2-1 heading into the break, there was hope that Anderlecht – under the watch of former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany, would maintain their unbeaten start to the season and they did just that thanks to Tau in the 54th minute.The former Mamelodi Sundowns player latched on to Trebel’s pass inside the box before coolly slotting home a left-footed shot into the bottom right corner of the net.It was Tau’s second goal in three games for his new employers having netted in the 3-1 win over Sint-Truiden on August 16. He was taken off for Landry Dimata in the 89th minute.The South Africa international is now one goal short of reaching his Jupiler League tally from last season which he achieved in 18 games with Club Brugge, providing four assists as they lifted the league title. Overall, Tau scored four goals in all competitions and provided eight assists, one of them coming in a famous 2-2 draw with Real Madrid in Group A of the Champions League.
