ONE of the suspects linked to the killing of women in Mthwalume south of Durban has committed suicide. Police sources close to the investigating office confirmed that he apparently hanged himself in the police cells and his body was found this morning. The two suspects were supposed to appear together in the Umzumbe Magistrates Court this morning after they were taken for questioning on Thursday upon being found in possession of cellphones belonging to the dead women and were linked to the gruesome discovery of decomposed bodies of women in the area. Since March, Nelisiwe Dube (22), Nosipho Gumede (16), Akhona Gumede (25), Zama Chiliza (38) and an unknown woman have all been found dead. Police Minister Bheki Cele said cops have strong evidence against the suspects. KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele told the SunTeam: “Wait for the minister, he will brief you regarding that matter.” Cele is expected to hold a media briefing at the Umzumbe municipality offices later today.
