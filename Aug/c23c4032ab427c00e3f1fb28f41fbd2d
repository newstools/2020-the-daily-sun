THE parents of a teenage boy allegedly shot and killed by police said their son died for nothing. Nateniel Julies, who suffered from Down’s Syndrome, died on Wednesday night after he was shot 100 metres from his home in Eldorado Park, Joburg. According to witnesses, the 16-year-old was shot by police. Sharing events leading up to Nateniel’s death, his father Clint said Nateniel had gone to the gate to get biscuits. “He goes to the gate to collect a pack of biscuits every day after dinner from a person selling them. “At times he’ll wonder off into the streets, but our neighbours are very fond of him and always show him his way home. “However, that night we heard a gunshot. I quickly rushed outside and heard neighbours screaming my son had been shot by cops.  He and his wife had rushed to Eldorado Park cop shop and overheard he’d been taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. “When we got to the hospital, the doctor told us he was barely alive when he got there and didn’t make it. “The station commander was very rude and not helpful,” he said.  “When we returned the following morning he told us he can never open a case against one of their own. “They claim my son was involved in a gang fight. We want justice.” His mum Bridget Harris was heartbroken and said her son wasn’t violent.  She said: “He was just a disabled child who needed care and love. “My son was bubbly. He loved dancing and laughing when we danced. “I’ll miss his laughter. The police have ripped out my heart.” Nateniel’s death led to a standoff between police and residents. Yesterday, residents rushed to the cop shop to demand answers and clashed with police, who fired rubber bullets. Ipid spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said the matter was being investigated. They were expecting a preliminary report.
