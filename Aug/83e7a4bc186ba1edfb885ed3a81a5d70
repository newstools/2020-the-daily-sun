ORLANDO Pirates midfielder Nkanyiso Zungu has expressed his delight after making his debut in the Black and White colors after six months since he joined them. Zungu who joined Pirates from Stellenbosch FC debuted off the bench as a late sub when his side played to a goalless draw with Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday. The 24-year-old playmaker arrived in Josef Zinabauer’s camp carrying an injury which prevented him from starting before lockdown imposed a six-month break on domestic football. The lockdown came in handy for the player who managed to get enough time to recover from a groin injury and make his dream of playing for Orlando Pirates a reality. “This is the beginning of a new chapter for me at Pirates,” Zungu said. “It was a big day for me. Even though I came in towards the end of the match, I am grateful that I finally got my debut. My next focus is on getting more performances under my belt.” “I am sure I echo the sentiments of many other players when I say that it feels good to be back. "Especially someone like myself who has not played any official match after so long. You will recall that I joined the Club in January with an injury but after recovering we had the lockdown which delayed my debut even further. But I am not complaining, there’s no looking back only forward. "I can only hope on getting more opportunities in future.” The player admitted that it was a bit strange to play under the new normality without fans at the stadium. He said: “I have always dreamt of playing in this fixture for iBhakaniya, and this is mainly due to the excitement surrounding this fixture for the football played as well as the vibe that the fans create. "So for me it was very strange playing my dream fixture in an empty stadium but then again these are not normal times and we must get used to it."
