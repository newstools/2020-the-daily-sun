ABSA Premiership title-chasing Mamelodi Sundowns will headline as the top team that will participate in the annual Umsunduzi Cup which is a pre-season tournament in Pietermaritzburg. The tournament, which started last year, will also feature all KwaZulu-Natal three premier division clubs - AmaZulu, Maritzburg United and Golden Arrows. Sundowns will replace Bidvest Wits, who lost in last final to AmaZulu last year. The date of this year’s event, which was supposed to take place in July but was postponed due to the delay caused by Covid-19 pandemic, will take place at Harry Gwala Stadium in October. Event manager Lebo Mokoena, who is interested in buying Bloemfontein Celtic, said this year’s event will not be a one day tournament as it was last year. “The dates that we are sitting on are 3rd and 4th October,” said Mokoena. “This year’s tournament will also be different. It’s not going to be one day event but two days’ tournament. “We’ll have the first semi finals on the 3rd and the following day we will have third and fourth playing against each other and the final.”Mokoena was hoping to have all three KZN premier division teams and one selected side from PMB, but due to the pandemic of the virus and the suspension of amateur football, that selection was put aside. “We are now in the final stages of concluding the contracts and appearance fees of the teams,” added the PMB-based businessman who was born in Bloemfontein.
