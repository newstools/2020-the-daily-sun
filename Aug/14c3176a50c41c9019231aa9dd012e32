   TWO North West municipalities who spent a high amount
of money on Covid-19 procurements were warned that the government was committed
to uprooting corruption.  This was said by Premier Job Mokgoro on Monday who
said the province had spent  over R124 million  on Covid-19
procurement since the hard lockdown began in late March this year.  Recently Ngaka Modiri Molema Local Municipality 
and JB Marks Local Municipality have been in hot water with the standing
committee on public accounts (SCOPA) over usage of funds on Covid-19.  Ngaka Modiri Molema  allegedly spent R90 million  while
 JB Marks Local Municipality spent  on its R11.4 million for
coronavirus-related expenditure.  “Government is aware of the reports that are in the
public domain regarding the COVID-19 expenditure , in particular at the two
municipalities.”  “The expenditure matters relating to the two
municipalities are currently with the law enforcement agencies,” he said.  Mokgoro said the highest spending department was health
where R65 million was spent  to date.  He said the majority of which has been directed to
healthcare workers and patients in the fight against COVID-19.  Education was second highest where  over R32
million were already used for Covid-19 related matters. Social development only
spent over R9 million.  “We are putting in place proper governance measures
that will ensure the effective control measures that will assist departments to
assist the government in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the public
service,” he said.  This was in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s
pronouncement on government’s efforts to root out and deal with alleged
corruption in all COVID-19 procurement in all state institutions from
government departments to municipalities as well as state owned entities.
