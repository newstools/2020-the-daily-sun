GAUTENG Health MEC Bandile Masuku will step aside for a month after claims of corruption rocked his department. The ANC said Masuku, presidential spokeswoman Khusela Diko and Joburg MMC Loyiso Masuku must face the provincial integrity committee. They’ve been implicated in a tender scandal involving PPE procurement by the health department. The R125 million tender was awarded to King Madzikane II Diko’s Royal Bacha projects. Provincial party secretary Jacob Khawe, who is Khusela’s ex-husband, said the PEC had decided they must take leave of absence while the committee probed media claims against them. It had been given two to four weeks to compile a report. The PEC held a special meeting on Wednesday. Khawe said: “As the ANC, we’re losing trust among our people on our commitment to deal with corruption.” The PEC had ruled Diko and Masuku must face the committee and go on temporary leave. The MMC as well would face the committee. He said the party wanted the Gauteng government to explain how the tender was procured.– NEWS24
