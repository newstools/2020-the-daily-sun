NTHABELENG Tsotetsi is a worried woman. The 49-year-old from Hazeldean in Philippi East, Cape Town, has been without electricity for the past four months. “I don’t know what to do anymore. I have been reporting this matter to the City of Cape Town, but without getting any assistance,” she said. READ: MINNIE DLAMINI SLAMMED! According to her, the problem started two years ago when her electricity box just went blank. “At first I didn’t think it was going to take this long. I contacted the City of Cape Town and their technicians came to fix the problem. It didn’t even take three days then it went blank again,” Nthabeleng said. She has been spending money on buying candles filling up a gas stove. “It is painful to be treated like someone who stays in an illegal place. I do not have money to keep up with this.” She is spending more than R500 for gas. “I don’t even know how much I spend buying candles. The city needs to fix this problem,” she said. Nthabeleng is charging her phone in her neighbours’ houses and said sooner or later they’ll get tired. “I cannot keep on asking them. At some point they will get tired because people don’t want visitors in their houses because of the coronavirus,” she said. ALSO READ: R15 MUTHI WRECKS UMSHADO! Lehlohonolo Tsotetsi (24) said: “There is not much one can do without electricity. We go to bed even if we don’t feel like sleeping.” MMC for Energy and Climate Change, Phindile Maxiti, said the city is aware of this fault at the customer’s home and will attend to it as soon as possible. “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenient which has been brought on by a mixture of capacity constraints and area volatility which has affected services. We will do our best to attend the request,” said Maxiti.
