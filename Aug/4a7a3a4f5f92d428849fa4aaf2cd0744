TRIBUTES continue to pour in for the widow of late struggle icon, Matthew Goniwe. Nyameka Goniwe, a speaker in the Nxuba Yethemba Minicipality in Cradock, reportedly died on Saturday while in isolation waiting for her Covid-19 results. Her husband was part of the Cradock Four, together with Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlauli. The four anti-apartheid activists were abducted and murdered by security police in 1985. ANC secretary in the Chris Hani region, Lusanda Sizani, said: “It’s with great sadness that we learnt of comrade Nyameka Goniwe’s passing. “It’s indeed a deep loss, not only to the family and friends, but to comrades and the political space in general. “Those who shared space with her will remember her for the robust engagement and approach to issues she believed in. “As we mourn her passing, we’re reminded of her determined contribution over many years to the struggle for freedom and transforming women’s lives.” Former uMkhonto we Sizwe commander and author Stanley Manong also paid tribute to Mama Nyameka through a post on Facebook. “I am deeply saddened by the sudden death of Nyameka Goniwe,” he wrote, saying Matthew’s brother Zwelinzima died last year at 95. “Those who have read my book, already know that Matthew Goniwe was my Maths and Science teacher in Cradock from 1968 to 1970. In June 1976, after the Soweto uprisings, I met Matthew Goniwe at the bus terminus in King William’s Town. “He was with Nyameka. He introduced her as his wife. As the family and the people of Cradock, we are mourning her passing.”
