“THE situation at
this hospital is very bad. It’s not acceptable at all.” Those were Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane’s words
during his visit to Nessie Knight Hospital in Qumbu on Tuesday. The premier said: “Covid-19 has exposed us to the reality on
the ground in terms of infrastructure backlog, which is resulting in a deeply
debilitated kind of healthcare system we’re offering our people. “You can see this hospital, started in 1929, is a mud
hospital.   “All these years many premiers and ministers have come here,
and the only thing I’d say is we can’t continue like this.” The hospital, left unfinished after its rebuilding was
started, had led to people losing faith in government. Mabuyane said government cancelled in December a  contract with a  company working on the hospital. He said
R30 million had been allocated to the project. “I was told R1 million had already been used on the
project,” he said. “We’ll make sure we get all the necessary money to rebuild
the hospital. We can’t renovate mud infrastructure.” He disagreed with deputy public protector Kholeka Gcaleka’s
finding that Eastern Cape hospitals were in crisis. “It’s not true of the entire province’s hospitals,” he said.
