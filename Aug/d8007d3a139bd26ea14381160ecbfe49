In a previous interview with Daily Sun, Connie, who has starred in many international films and basking in pride after her Black Is King feature, said it is South Africa’s season.“Right now it’s our time. Everyone wants to associate themselves with Africa. I believe this is a good thing because it demolishes that narrative that people have about Africa, which is sometimes portrayed as a continent that’s full of war, starvation and disease,” she said.“We have so much to tell as Africans about our culture, our food, our music, dance, the way we dress, and our mannerism.“The world is becoming small and I foresee many other collaborations like this one in the future. It’s a huge win for us as Africans.” SEE POSTS BELOW: Operation was successful. Thank you to everyone who prayed and dm’d me??  Operation was successful.
