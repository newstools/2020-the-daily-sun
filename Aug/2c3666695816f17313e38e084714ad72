TSHEPISO Malapane will be running 300km to help people
living with cancer. The 32-year-old told Daily Sun he’d be running from the
Union Buildings in Tshwane to Polokwane, Limpopo, in October. Tshepiso, known as Crazy-T, will lead the initiative for the
foundation CancerMustFall. It was started in 2015 by Keleadi Moshabe, who was diagnosed
with liver cancer in 2013 and has been on oxygen since 2018. Crazy-T, who’s originally from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga,
but now lives in Midrand in Joburg, said many people were affected by cancer. “This is close to home as my late father also had cancer,”
he said. Crazy-T said he planned to run the distance over three days
from 29 October to 31 October. He said all money raised would be donated to the
foundation to help those affected by cancer and to raise awareness. “I’ve lost people I know to cancer, so I decided to run to
save lives. I want them to realise cancer isn’t the end of the world, but can
be the dawn of a new chapter in their life.” Crazy-T said it had not yet been confirmed how many people
would participate in the run. He said he’d be running on the R101 route.
