REALITY TV star, Kim Kardashian is on a mission to get C-Murder released from prison. C-Murder, who was a rapper and actor, was sentenced to life after being charged with second-degree murder in 2009. Kim took to Twitter to explain why she’s fighting for C-Murder’s freedom. She wrote: “On January 18, 2002 a tragedy occurred when a young man was killed. The next day Corey Miller was arrested for the murder.” According to media reports, a few years after his conviction, some members of the jury said they were forced to vote him guilty. Some witnesses have taken back what they said during the case when they testified. “Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict,” continued Kim. She has partnered with songstress Monica, who is C-Murder’s ex girlfriend and two attorneys, Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney to free C-Murder. C-Murder isn’t the first convict to be helped by Kim. She has also helped quite a few so far.
