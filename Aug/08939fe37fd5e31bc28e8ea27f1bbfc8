SIBUSISO Mchunu (64), who was the mayor of Richmond Municipality in KZN midlands, has died. He died in the early hours of this morning at Royal Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. His son and family spokesman, Manqoba Mchunu, told Daily Sun today that his father died of stroke. He said he suffered a major stroke in 2018 while in his office at the municipality and was rushed to hospital. Manqoba said his dad has been in out of hospital, but was showing signs of recovery at the time of his death. “The family is devastated by his death because we all hoped that he was recovering and was much better. “As the family, we ask for privacy and would like to urge people who will visit us to adhere to lockdown regulations,” said Mchunu. ANC provincial spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela said the party was disturbed by the death of its mayor. He said they wish to send their deepest condolences to the family and people of Richmond, where Mchunu was mayor. Ntombela said the regional leadership from Moses Mabhida has been sent to meet the family. Municipal spokesman Sibusiso Bhengu said everyone in the municipality is still shocked by the news. He said councillors and officials were on their way to the mayor’s family. The late Mchunu was serving his first term as mayor. He was elected in 2016 after his party won the local government elections in Richmond. He first served as councillor in 2006 after he was elected as ward councillor in his Hopewell Village. Between 2011 and 2016, he was a manager in the mayor’s office.
