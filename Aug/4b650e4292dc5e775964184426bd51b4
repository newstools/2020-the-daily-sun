SOUTH African artists have flown the flag high with their work on Beyonce’s new film, Black Is King. The musical, which premiered in Mzansi last night, is a tie-in album curated by Beyonce for the remake of The Lion King. The film features some of Mzansi’s biggest talents including Warren Masemola, Nandi Madida, Busiswa Gqulu, Moonchild Sanelly and the late actress, Mary Twala. Busiswa, who features on the track My Power, wrote on Instagram: “I’ve realised that they’re never going to take my power.” She said she and Moonchild were flown first class to Los Angeles to shoot their parts.  “When I got to set we started shooting and I tried being calm, being a lady, sassy and groovy,” she said. “One of the producers after the first take came to  me and said ‘we know this is not you, we need you to do you and if you are doing too much we will pull you back. We need you to go all the way’. “I then got excited and I was trying to do as much as I could, particularly African dances to make my fellow Africans proud,” she said. Moonchild, who also features on My Power, tweeted: “Your dreams are valid! Be rejected for being yourself because you’ll never question the love you receive from being yourself! Do you, the world will adjust, I live by this.” Actress Nandi Madida said: “I’m living my ancestor’s wildest dreams! Thank you for the love.”     It was positively received by the whole of Mzansi. One response on Twitter was: “Beyonce was so lucky to secure bookings to work with these legends. She must never forget this!”
