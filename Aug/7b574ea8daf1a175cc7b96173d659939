COMEDIAN Tebogo Ntlhane has written his first comedy series. The 25-year-old comedian from Hammanskraal in Tshwane wrote, directed and stars in Mama Meet The One. The comedy series is about a young interracial couple. Tebogo told SunBuzz: “Tshepo and Bianca met in Joburg, where Tshepo is an attorney and Bianca owns a coffee shop.  “They’ve been dating for a while and are ready to take their relationship to the next level.” So they’re meeting each other’s families . . . “Bianca meets Tshepo’s village family and Tshepo meets Bianca’s farm family. And everything is just chaotic.” Tebogo said the story was inspired by a thought he had while growing up.

Even worse, most of my family members can’t speak English. I turned the thought into a story.” He wants the series to show internationally. “Parties who’re interested will bid for the story, and in November we’ll choose which offer we’re interested in,” said Tebogo. He’s working on three more seasons.
