CAN Ajax Cape Town let automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership slip? That remains to be seen in the remaining five GladAfrica Championship fixtures. The Urban Warriors are now in firm control of their journey to the promised land. On Wednesday they resumed their quest to return to the top-flight football with a 1-0 smash-and-grab victory over Richards Bay FC at Rand Stadium to move to 51 points. They remain at the top of the Championship after 25 matches. Abednego Mosiatlhaga continued where he left off when the PSL season was halted by the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March. The former Bidvest Wits and Stellenbosch FC winger scored the only goal of the match on the 80th minute to increase his goal tally to 17 this season. With Swallows FC held to a goalless draw by relegation-haunted TS Galaxy in the other match at Tsakane Stadium, Ajax are now nine points clear at the top. Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and Uthongathi remain third and fourth on 41 points respectively. In the other First Division match on Wednesday, University of Pretoria played out a 1-1 draw with Real Kings. Ajax next visit Sturrock Park on Saturday where they will be tested by TTM, who have vowed to fight until the end of the season as they are also looking to put the spanner in the works for the Urban Warriors. At the bottom of the table, things are not looking good for Royal Eagles and Jomo Sono as they are occupying the 16th and 15th spot. They are caught right in the relegation trap, and face automatic relegation as the two bottom teams.
