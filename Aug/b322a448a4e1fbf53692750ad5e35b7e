MALEDU Nkawane wants justice after security guards allegedly shot him three times with rubber bullets. The 38-year-old from Rabokala in North West was apparently shot while residents marched to the Rabokala Tribal Office last Wednesday. The aim of the marchers was to find out why the office was opened while it was under investigation. “It’s sad I was shot without posing any danger. They abused my rights. I want justice,” he said. Maledu said he’s been in pain and coughs blood. He said he lived on medication as he’s been suffering from a chronic disease for six years. “I can’t stand properly. I limp and can’t walk properly,” he said. According to Maledu, people were angry. Stands were awarded to church members without the community’s knowledge. “The tribal office didn’t inform us. The land belongs to community members and we’ll not allow people from outside to benefit.” He said those willing to live in the area should follow proper procedure. Baphiring clan representative Moses Tshepe (65) said: “There’s corruption in our area. “We discussed the land issue, but there’s no solution.” Colonel Adele Myburgh said a case of attempted murder was opened. Investigations were under way.
