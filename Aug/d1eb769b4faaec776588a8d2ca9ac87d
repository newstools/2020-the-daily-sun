THE DA in the Eastern Cape believes it can lead four municipalities in the 2021 elections. The DA’s re-elected provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga made it clear during the party’s provincial elective congress that they wanted to acquire Nelson Mandela Bay, Beyers Naude, Koukamma and Inxuba Yethemba in the next local government elections. The DA’s provincial virtual congress yesterday saw Bhanga and provincial chairman Andrew Whitfield retain their seats unopposed. Wonga Potwana was elected alongside Yusuf Cassim and Vicky Knoetze as deputy chairpersons. Chantel King and party veteran Bobby Stevenson were elected deputy leaders. Bhanga said: “When I was elected in the 2017 congress, we were in government in Nelson Mandela Bay and Kouga. The agenda for better governance was set and being implemented. “Even though governance in Nelson Mandela Bay has since been taken from us, we continue our fight to regain control and bring back the DA difference. I am convinced that the DA blue belt of governance from Cape Town through Kouga to Nelson Mandela Bay will soon be restored,” he said. “Going forward, our focus will be on winning more municipalities in the 2021 local government election and we have identified Nelson Mandela Bay, Beyers Naude, Koukamma and Inxuba Yethemba as our next frontier. We want more DA mayors at the next congress. “The 2019 elections did not produce the results that we were hoping for. However, we have seen phenomenal growth in areas, specifically in the rural areas. We must not dwell on the past, but rather redouble our efforts and recapture the spirit that we had in the build-up to the 2019 elections as we head into campaigning for 2021. “It is up to the DA to change this. Our vision of a better South Africa must succeed. The ANC has shown its hand, especially with the Covid-19 corruption scandals engulfing many departments and municipalities in the province,” said Bhanga.
