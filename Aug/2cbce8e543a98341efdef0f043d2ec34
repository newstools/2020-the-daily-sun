ONLINE dating suspect is behind bars for common robbery. The Johannesburg Central SAPS spokesman, captain Xoli Mbele said the 57 year old male was arrested at Copper Leaf Eny Els Estate. Mbele said it is alleged that the suspect robbed a 42 year old female at Alcazaba Hotel at Fordsburg on the 18th of January this year. "The victim and suspect met through Tinder dating app early January 2020. He told her that he had divorced and wanted a serious partner," said Mbele. He said they met on the 18th of January 2020 at Wimpy restaurant for breakfast. "After that, they both went to the hotel. The suspect left her and went to buy food and drinks. He was captured by CCTV footage of the Hotel pouring something like powder inside one of the juices," said Mbele. He further stated that the suspect gave her juice and she drank it. "She woke up the following day and she was still dizzy. An ambulance took her to hospital and was discharged on the 23rd of January 2020," he added.
