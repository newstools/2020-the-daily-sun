MAMELODI Sundowns will play Bloemfontein Celtic in the final of the Nedbank Cup on 8 September. Lyle Lakay's stunning free-kick in the dying moments secured a 3-2 win over plucky Bidvest Wits at Orlando Stadium on Saturday evening. Ricardo Nascimento and Keletso Makgalwa had given Sundowns the lead, but Terrence Dzvukamanja scored two superb goals to keep the Clever Boys in the game before Lakay's magic moment. Sundowns opened the scoring in the 37th minute through Nascimento who was on target from the spot after Buhle Mkhwanazi was caught tugging Motjeka Madisha's jersey inside the penalty area. Wits improved following the break and leveled matters in the 76th minute. Dzvukamanja stripped Madisha of the ball in a dangerous area before keeping his cool and lobbing the ball past the onrushing Denis Onyango.Sundowns regained their advantage five minutes later – albeit through fortunate circumstances – as Makgalwa pounced on an error from Brighton Mhlongo before passing the ball into an open net.The Clever Boys though were not going down without a fight and leveled matters once more as Dzvukamanja turned past Madisha from a perfect Phathutshedzo Nange pass before sliding the ball home for his brace on the night.But having fought their way back into the game so valiantly, Wits were dumbed out of the competition with what proved to be the final kick of the encounter as Lakay curled a pin-point free-kick past Mhlongo and into the back of the net to send Sundowns into another cup final. Sundowns are now going to face Celtic who reached the final earlie on Saturday after defeating Baroka 3-0 at the same venue. - supersport.com
