FORMER Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany has retired from playing football at the age of 34 and has been named as Anderlecht's full-time head coach. Kompany joined the Belgian side in a player-manager role back in May 2019 but has now hung up his boots and will become their full-time manager.  The 34-year-old replaces Franky Vercauteren as Anderlecht boss."I want to fully commit to my role as a coach and need 100% of my time and focus for it," said Kompany."That's why I'm quitting as a football player. Our ambition and our hunger remains the same."I want to stay with the club for at least four seasons and prove that Anderlecht can play a modern style of football, with results." Kompany has the backing of Anderlecht CEO Karel Van Eetvelt. “As everybody knows, this was always the plan. It might have come a little sooner than expected, but Vincent committing himself for another 4 seasons to the club is great news for the club, our supporters and our players”
