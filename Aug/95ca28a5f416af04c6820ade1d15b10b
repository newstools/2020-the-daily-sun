Dinamo-BSUPC head coach Yuri Ivanovich has hailed Rhoda Mulaudzi and Lebohang Ramalepe after their debut for his side in Wednesday's 7-2 victory over Bobruichanka. The Banyana stars joined the Belarusian outfit for the rest of the season last Friday, from Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies and First Touch Academy respectively. Ramalepe played 90 minutes on her first professional debut, while Mulaudzi was introduced in the final 24 minutes of the game replacing Salimata Simpore. Following their maiden appearances in the colours of Dinamo, the coach shared his views on the duo's performances."You know, considering that they have not trained for four months, both showed a very solid level," he told the club website.Â "It is clear that it still takes time to adapt, but they did a good job and, I hope, will improve with every game." The move to Belarus saw Ramalepe earning her first professional contract abroad, while Mulaudzi secured her third deal overseas after previous stints with Cyprus' Apollon Ladies and Australia's Canberra United. After their enterprising start to life in Belarus, they will seek to make their league debuts when Dinamo face-off with Neman on Saturday.
