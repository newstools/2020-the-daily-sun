THE future of Ajax Cape Town remains very much in the air. Well, at least not with regards to their status in the National First Division... or possibly in the Absa Premiership. But their partnership parent club, Ajax Amsterdam, hangs somewhat in the balance. Discussions between the two clubs have continued since officials leveled damning allegations against the Cape side boss Ari Efstathiou in a scathing statement issued in January. In it, the Dutch club accused Efstathiou of lacking football acumen. They also accused him of paying players poor salaries, selling players with the objective of raising the highest profits over player development, and of using the club's status to create personal revenue and further his own business interests. It appears souring relations haven't improved since then, with Efstathiou confirming there are still talks over the future of the Urban Warriors. ”There is a discussion with Ajax with regard to the future of Ajax Cape Town. I wouldn't be dishonest to say it is not guaranteed. But we are still discussing things, ” Efstathiou told the South African Football Journalists Association. The relegation of Ajax from the Premiership two years ago seemingly left the partnership fractious. And even the prospects of the Urban returning to the PSL haven't improved the 22-year partnership.
