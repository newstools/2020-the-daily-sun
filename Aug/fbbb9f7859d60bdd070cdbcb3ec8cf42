ACTING
National Consumer Commission 
commissioner, Thezi Mabuza, says they’ve closed the tab on Up Money
pyramid scheme. She
said the scheme, which isn’t registered with the Reserve Bank, is not a
registered stokvel, nor is it a financial services provider, used social media
to recruit members. In
Tshwane yesterday, Thezi said Up Money scammed people by making them pay a
once-off joining fee  of R180, qualifying
them for a meat pack. She
said the scheme robbed over 230 000 investors. “New
members were then required to recruit five other new participants. This process
was termed level one. “The
original investor would then help the five he or she recruited to sign up their
five new members each.” She
said although the scheme received R42 720 501,82 between 4 May and 2 July, over
R12,5 million was blown in purchases at retail stores and on three luxury
vehicles. “We
were alerted to the scheme by a complainant from East London. The
commission’s investigation revealed Up Money contravened the Consumer Protection
Act by promoting and causing members of the public to participate in a pyramid
scheme.” The
Gauteng Division of the High Court granted the unit orders to freeze bank
accounts worth over R18 million and luxury vehicles associated with scheme
director Jade Matsemela and ex-director Sipho Mdlhuli.
