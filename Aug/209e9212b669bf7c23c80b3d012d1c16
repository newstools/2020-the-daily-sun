UNKNOWN gunmen went on a shooting spree in Kosovo in Cape Town on Saturday night. And six women were caught in the crossfire. Two of them died at the scene and four were hospitalised. Nomazwi Mbishu said two of her sisters were in the house when this happened. “One of my sisters died and the other one is fighting for her life in hospital. “She was shot in the mouth and the bullet came out at the back of her head. I’m glad she survived.” She said a suspicious car with six men was parked outside their home days before the incident. It looked as if they were spying on her sister’s house. Although she was always at her sister’s house, she wasn’t there on the day of the incident. “I wanted to go, but felt tired when I came back from work,” she said. The other women in the house included a neighbour and family friend from Hout Bay. A resident said: “These people just went into the house and shot at everyone. The motive isn’t known, which makes us all possible targets.” Brigadier Novela Potelwa said cops were hunting for the killers. “Samora Machel detectives are investigating two murder cases and attempted murders,” said Potelwa. “The deceased women, aged 33 and 25, were with four other women who were admitted to hospital. “The motive is the subject of a police investigation.” Potelwa said no arrests had been made and urged anyone with information to phone 08600 10111.
