TODAY marked the national reopening of schools after they were closed for a month in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. The government took a decision to close schools on 23 July after an uproar by organisations, unions and parents, who argued it was unsafe and too early for learners to attend classes during the outbreak. Among the resuming schools was Rantailane Secondary school in Ga-Rankuw zone 4 in Tshwane, welcoming back its grade 8 and 11 pupils this morning. Principal David Sanyane said they were ready and prepared.“We have marked lines on the floor to make sure pupils practise social distancing. There are sanitisers at the entrance, as well as others in each class and before every pupil enters the premises, they get screened.” He said their only challenge was pupils would wait in a screening queue for some time before entering the school. “Pupils must come very early so they can get screened and get in class by the time school starts,” he said. Pupils were happy to be back at school and said they were ready to learn.  One said: “We have been home for a very long time, and this feels like a new thing. It feels great to be back and we are more than ready to learn.” In Mamelodi, Sediba Sa Thuto Primary School pupils also came to school in numbers, atheir parents and guardians having walked them there. The school made sure all pupils and people who entered the premises were sanitised and their temperatures taken.
