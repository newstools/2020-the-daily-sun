TV’s favourite strict mother Madea will be saying bye as she stars in her last theatre play. Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Farewell Play will see Madea starring in her final play. She’ll be bidding goodbye to theatre, just as she has to film. In this play she’ll be joined by Cora, Mr Brown, Aunt Bam and other cast members. “Madea, the gun-toting matriarch, drives a couple of hours to a rural town in Georgia to be with her loving family. Madea’s great-grandson is graduating from law school, and the entire family is gathering to celebrate the occasion. The family is in need of a happy time after Darlene has gone through a bitter divorce, leaving her financially and emotionally drained. The entire family has pitched in to help Darlene and her son Malik, who’s barely paid his tuition bills. The graduation party is off to a joyous start until Darlene’s ex-husband shows up uninvited. “Sparks immediately begin to fly as Madea in the fashion of life coach, Iyanla, begins to fix everyone’s life,” reads the plot of the play. Madea also starred in A Madea Family Funeral last year.
