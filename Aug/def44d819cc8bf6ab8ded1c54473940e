EFF leader Julius Malema has challenged Zimbabwean youth to stop fighting their battles on twitter, in Mzansi or London. He said they should go face the battle head-on in their country. Speaking at a Women’s Day event, Malema said Mnangagwa has become a pig and he is eating his own children in Zimbabwe. He is no different to Ramaphosa. Malema said when these two leaders came in “we had hope for change, but things have become worse”. “Things have become extremely worse in Zimbabwe…Zimbabweans are not cowards…they have fought before… #EFFWomensDayRally cic @Julius_S_Malema challenging Zimbabweans to stop fighting the battle on Twitter or in SA or London but confront the regime head on, you can't be afraid of death you are dead already: guys please confront the monster @edmnangagwa and his gangsters pic.twitter.com/ocaGF1Vhjg  “Why is the youth of Zimbabwe fighting through hashtags…? Why is the youth of Zimbabwe fighting from South Africa and London…why are they not occupying borders and say no car goes in and out of Zimbabwe….we will support them until the rights of their people are restored. “Why is the youth of Zimbabwe not rising in Zimbabwe and face death because they are already dead,” asked the firebrand EFF leader. He added that If Ramaphosa is serious about human rights, then he must withdraw the South African embassy from Zimbabwe and also shut down the Zimbabwean embassy in South Africa. Turning to Mzansi, Malema said rape and abuse of women and children should be crimes against the state. So much that even when the victim withdraws the case, the state must proceed with the case against the perpetrator.
