LUYANDA Nchukana is happy to have survived the coronavirus. She said before she got tested, she had an unusual flu. “I went to my doctor, got injections and some medication,” said Luyanda. “After two days the flu became worse and I was weak, had a runny tummy, throbbing headache and shortness of breath.” The 50-year-old from Langa in Cape Town said she decided to go to hospital on 26 April as the shortness of breath had become too much. “I suspected I might be infected with Covid-19 as I’m an essential worker,” she said. “I could hardly walk when I got to hospital and had no energy. It was difficult to focus on recovery. I have high blood pressure and asthma.” Luyanda had bad dreams and her heart wanted to give in.  “I slept in a sitting position to avoid dying in my sleep.” She said she lived with her kids and they all tested negative. “I was hospital for eight days and quarantined for 14 days at home. I retested and the result was negative,” said Luyanda. She asked people to take Covid-19 seriously. “People must wear masks at all times, wash hands regularly, sanitise and observe social distancing.” Luyanda is grateful for the support she’s been receiving. “We had a friend who constantly prayed for us and she created a WhatsApp group, so we could share our experiences and remedies. We formed a support group with these ladies and all infected and affected people. It helps to talk and share what we’re going through.”
