HER in-laws promised they’d never chase her out – but as soon as her husband died her problems started. That’s according to Beauty Makhuba (53), who said she was being harassed by her s’bali and other in-laws who want her out of the family house in Chiawelo, Soweto.  Beauty said she was in Booysens when she got a call from neighbours telling her the roof was being taken down. “I went straight to the police station to ask the police to escort me home. “I found my brother-in-law and his brother’s son on top of the house. “The police told me they can’t help me because it’s a family matter.  “Now I live in fear because they can come back any time to finish what they started.” Beauty said after her in-laws left, community members helped her put the roof back on. “I don’t know what will happen next. I don’t have anywhere to go. I’ve stayed in this house for 21 years,” she said. She said her in-laws started harassing her in 2014 after her husband died. “My husband wanted to buy me a house, but they said we must look after this house as we were married in community of property,” she told Daily Sun. Beauty’s brother-in-law, Thembani Makhuba, said they don’t have a problem with Beauty, but won’t allow her to bring her lover into their parents’ home. “People have told us that her lover sleeps over and traditionally, this is not allowed,” said Thembani. “She’s a makoti and should continue to behave like one if she wants to stay in our parents’ house.” Busi Kheswa from the Gauteng social development department said the people who have the title deed have the rights to the house.
