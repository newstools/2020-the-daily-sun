CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink has showered Surprise Ralani with praises after the trickery winger scored twice to help his side overcome title chasers Mamelodi Sundowns 3-2 in the Absa Premiership match at Loftus Stadium on Monday. Ralani gave Downs defenders all sorts of problems whenever in possession of ball and his goals seems to have dented their hopes of defending the title. The 32-year-old broke the ice with a low show in the 13th minutes after his first attempt was blocked by Nicolas Lukhubeni. The Citizens striker Kermit Erasmus doubled the lead a minute before half-time when he lobbed the ball over keeper Denis Onyango. Although, City defender Edmilson Dove pulled one back for Downs via an own goal, Ralani ensured that his side restore their two-goal lead as he clipped the ball over Onyango to walk away with man of the match award. Riekerink, whose side’s victory moved them into the top eight credited the club scouts for getting a quality player like Ralani. “Ralani can play fantastic between the two lines and he’s like magician and nobody can teach him that,” said the Dutch coach. “I must compliment the scouting of the club in finding this player because he has developed well under me in a very short space of time. He was excellent and has made a team excellent too.” Ralani was not the only player Riekerink heaped praise on the night as Mduduzi Mdantsane also caught his admiration. The pint-sized former Chippa United midfielder was workaholic, as he supplied quality passes to strikers. His pass also set-up Erasmus to grab the second goal. City will hope the duo continue where they left off when they visit Stellenbosch FC at Tuks Stadium on Thursday (6pm).
