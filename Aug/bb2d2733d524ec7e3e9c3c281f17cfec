BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt will be happy to see his number one goalkeeper Ricardo Goss and midfielder Sameehg Doutie back from suspension for their Absa Premiership clash against Kaizer Chiefs at Orlando Stadium tonight (6pm). But the bad news is that Wits will be without left-back Sifiso Hlanti, after he got his fourth booking when Hunt’s side lost 3-2 to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Nedbank Cup semi-final at the same venue on Saturday. Hlanti, who has been a stalwart in defence since he arrived from AmaZulu in the second half of 2015-16 season, will be hugely missed as Hunt relies heavily on him. The 56-year-old Hunt said everything is going against them and sounded down after the Ke Yona Cup clash against Sundowns. “This doesn’t help us because our squad is very thin and it is going to be a major task for me on Wednesday in terms of picking up the team,” Hunt added. “It is the way our lives are at the moment. And I feel for the players because I did not think we deserved to lose the game (against Sundowns).” Hlanti’s place is likely to be taken by Lehlohonolo Nonyane or Keagan Ritchie. To add to Hunt’s worries reserve goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo didn’t stake his claim when he got his chance against Sundowns. The former Orlando Pirates goalie, who has seen little action this season, was at fault for the last two goals against the Brazilians. The winner came from Lyle Lakay who caught Mhlongo out of position and bent his winning free kick in added time to see the Tshwane giants reach the final, much to the annoyance of Hunt. Mhlongo will now be on the bench when his side take in Chiefs as Goss will take over the goalkeeping duties.
