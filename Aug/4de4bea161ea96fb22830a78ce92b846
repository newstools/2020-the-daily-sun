The unemployment rate in Mzansi is alarming. And the country is been hit by a pandemic which has led
to many losing their jobs. But it seems like crooks are cashing in on desperate job
seekers. Today Joburg Metro officers bust three suspects for
selling fake jobs. It is alleged that a man complained that his wife had
paid the suspects R450. Speaking to Daily Sun, JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar said
the suspects had promised to get the complainant employment. "But the three suspects phones were switched off,
and they weren't seen or heard of again. "Officers went to the seventh floor of a building at
the corner of Von Wielligh Street and Nugget Street, where the three were
operating from," he said. ALSO READ:Â REWARD OFFERED AFTER ANOTHER BUS TORCHING! Minnaar said when the officers arrived, one female
suspect tried to run away but she was arrested along with her accomplices. He said there were dozens of CVs and fake application
forms found, as well as R7140 in cash. "Officers seized a computer printer
as well as four cell phones, which will form part of the investigation,"
Minaar added. Minnaar said desperate unemployed people are always
caught in the firing line by job scammers who promise to get them employment. "People should always scrutinise job posts that are
advertised especially on social media platforms because that is what criminals
use to defraud innocent job seekers," he said. "Job seekers must be very wary of people who want money for jobs. "If it is genuine, then you will have to submit your CV and go for an interview and not pay money for a job," he added. Minnaar said the suspects are facing charges of fraud.
