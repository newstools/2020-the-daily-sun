SOUTH African MotoGP rider, Brad Binder, took his first win in the premier class yesterday (9 August 2020). Binder, having started the Czech Grand Prix in Brno in seventh place, moved up to fifth place by the end of the first lap, and third by the end of the second. It was a timeous race, with each on-track action being timed perfectly. With about ten of the 21 laps remaining, Binder made the deciding move on Franco Morbidelli for first place. From there, Binder pulled out a gap over his rivals and won with more than five seconds in hand. Interestingly, when Binder moved to Moto2 from Moto3 a few years ago, it took him more than a year to register his first win in the category. In 2020, in just his third race in MotoGP, he took his first victory. Binder revealed: "I have been dreaming about this day since I was a little boy, and gosh, it came true. I really wish my parents were here because they were the ones that backed me from the beginning. "I can't thank my team enough. They put an absolutely insane motorbike underneath me this weekend. Thank you to everyone at home for always supporting me. I hope that this is the start of many more."
