  Two sources, who have knowledge of the party's national working committee, on Friday said Yengeni had a go at Ramaphosa, and said he, too, should be removed as leader because he is accused of vote buying at the Nasrec conference. A source said Yengeni was unhappy with Ramaphosa's letter, in which he said the ANC is accused number one with regard to corruption.   Corrupt Ramaphosa told the meeting that society views the ANC as being corrupt. He also, in jest, said it would be a relief off his shoulders to step down. He is said to have remained on this theme when the broader NEC meeting started after 16:00 on Friday. The president is said to have told the meeting that civil society has raised concerns around corruption, particularly Covid-19 corruption.
