A 34-YEAR-OLD Mozambican woman was arrested for possession of dagga. Cops also found illicit cigarettes and liquor estimated to worth about R95 000 during An Intelligence Driven Operation conducted by police, the defence force and Sars officials in Komatipoort on Friday. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the law enforcement agencies followed up on information about illegal trading activities carried out by some people in Komatipoort. He said when cops arrived, they found about six women from Mozambique and a South African man and conducted a search. “They found illicit goods and issued the suspects fines in terms of lockdown regulations, except for one woman, who was found in possession of dagga,” said Hlathi. “We want to warn the community to stop the illegal sale or distribution of illicit goods and must abide by the law.” The arrested woman is expected to appear in the Komatipoort Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
