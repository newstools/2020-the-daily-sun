PARENTS at Chayaza Secondary School are shocked after the admin and teachers offices were burned down by unknown people. The incident happened at Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Saturday. SGB chairman Lucky Sibiya told Daily Sun a security guard was patrolling when he saw a group of suspects cut the fence. “They fired bullets in the air and he ran for his safety. “Minutes later he saw flames coming from the two buildings. “We don’t know the motive behind this attack. “We wish community members could help with information to catch the people responsible for burning the school.” Bushbuckridge Municipality Fire and Rescue acting chief Khensani Maduna said firefighters at the Mkhuhlu Fire Station received an emergency call from community members to alert them to the school burning. “When they arrived at the scene, two buildings were already up in flames and nothing could be saved. It took them nine hours to battle the fire,” said Maduna. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department had opened a case of arson and asked anyone with information that could help bust the perpetrators to contact the nearest police station. “The department will send officials to the school on Monday (today) to assess the damage and advise on a course of action,” said Zwane. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of arson was opened.
