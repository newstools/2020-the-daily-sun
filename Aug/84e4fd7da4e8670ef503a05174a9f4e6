IN THE past, calling a woman a “stocko” would be an insult. But Mzansi is moving to lockdown level 2, and some women have owned the word, letting men know they’re ready to party! Social media is flooded with these ladies who’re simply saying let the best immune system win. Stocko refers to ladies who’re usually invited to events and parties to add more fun. Some people are already planning parties and asking any coronavirus-free stocko to make themselves available. Siphesihle Shabalala said she’s been called worse things in her life. “Covid has shown me that we only live once and I want to live my life to the fullest,” said Siphesihle. A woman, who even supplied her phone number on Twitter, came in for some criticism – but she’s ready to party. “I’m here and available,” she said. Celokuhle Mzila said she missed having a jol a lot and couldn’t wait to be invited. “I can’t believe I told myself that I won’t drink or groove anymore. I was crazy. I’m Covid free and ready. Please invite me!” Zoe Kheswa said the only thing that will bring her home now is Khumbulekhaya. “I want to be stocko everyday of the week. I’ve been home for too long and cleaning my mum’s house. I’m ready to get lost,” said Zoe. Noxy Maako said she doesn’t care what people say. “I’m stocko and I’m proud. Call me!” Some guys are shocked while some are happy and ready to party. “I’m shocked, but I’m honestly ready to party with whoever is Covid-19 free,” said Jay Malema. Khutso Mahowa said he’s afraid places will be over the limit of 50, but he’s ready to party. “I won’t allow overpopulation to put me down,” he said.
