BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has lavished praise on RSC Anderlecht striker Percy Tau after the 26-year old scored the club’s third goal on his debut in the Belgium powerhouse’s 3-1 win over Sint-Truidense on Sunday. Tau was introduced as a second-half substitute and netted Anderlecht’s third goal deep inside stoppage time as the hosts climbed to third position on the log standings with four points from two games in the Belgium Pro League. “It is every South African’s wish to see their idol doing well in Europe, and for me I am really happy for Percy,” said Ntseki. Ntseki said it would be nicer if more and more of South Africans can make a mark in top European leagues but for now South Africans must relish Tau’s exploits. “Mentally, he is a fighter, he is a strong character and a focussed individual. I know most people want to see him in England but his time will definitely come. “I like Percy’s unwavering commitment and I am glad he has hit the ground running with his new club.” The Bafana Bafana leading striker is on a season loan spell with the Belgium outfit from the English Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion. In Sunday’s match, he was introduced as a 64th-minute substitute with Anderlecht leading 2-0. However, Sint-Truidense pulled one back but the Witbank-born Tau had the last say as he completed a 3-1 win with a stoppage time goal. Anderlecht is coached by former Manchester City defender and captain Vincent Kompany and are gunning for their first league title in four years. Kompany explains his decision to take over the coaching reins: “I want to fully commit to my role as a coach and need 100% of my time and focus for it. That’s why I’m quitting as a football player. Our ambition and our hunger remains the same.”
