THE bail application of the 42 suspects charged with murder, attempted and malicious damage to property on 11 July at the International Pentecost Holiness Church was postponed once again. The defence also demanded to see evidence linking their clients to the violent events at the church. The fourlawyers representing the accused submitted reasons why their clients should be granted bail. Advocate Barry Roux reminded the court the five people who died were in the same faction as the accused. He slammed investigating officer, Detective Sergeant George Maditse for being evasive in answering his questions. Roux said Maditse didn’t give solid reasons why the accused must be denied bail.  “Maditse wants to keep 42 people in jail for more than a year. When I asked him what he has against the accused, he replied that he has nothing at this stage. “His identification of the accused was compromised,” said Roux. He told Magistrate Gavin Pillay that Maditse hadn’t submitted enough evidence that could keep the accused in jail while awaiting trial. “They have been sitting in jail for almost a month. Is there evidence that can link them to the murder of their own people? Can they be linked to a murder where cartridges were found inside the church?” he asked. Representing 17 of the suspects who are security officers, France Mphatswe argued his clients couldn’t have been aware of the events at the church as they were collected for work as usual, and did not even get instructions on what to do for the day. “They were not at the scene at all. The state must prove who was in possession of the gun found in the taxi. If the state can’t prove that, they are riding a dead horse,” he said. Judgment was reserved for next Tuesday.
