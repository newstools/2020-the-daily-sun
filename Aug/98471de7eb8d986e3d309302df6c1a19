TENDER irregularities have offered the country lessons to close the gaps for thieves and criminals. Yesterday, President Cyril Ramphosa admitted to the National Assembly that there was an oversight by the government when he announced the R500 billion to fight the coronavirus. He said they overlooked the over-pricing when buying PPE. “The measures we are taking will lead to procurement reform that will ensure that we find solutions to many procurement problems,” said the president. “This includes corruption, and making sure the government does not overpay for goods and services.” Ramaphosa said while this should not come at a cost for companies owned by those who had been disadvantaged in the past, but said the days of government paying more for goods is over and this is the time to reform the tendering system. He suggested the first step to reforming would be to make tendering digital. He even listened to a suggestion by EFF leader Julius Malema that perhaps the government should do away with the tendering system and built capacity from within. “This marks the start of a new era in transparency and accountability in the procurement of goods and services by public entities. “We believe that this establishes an important precedent for future expenditure,” he said. Ramaphosa said it was disgraceful that at this time of a national crisis, there are companies and individuals who seek to criminally benefit from the efforts to protect people and save lives. He avoided addressing the question about his spokeswoman, Khusela Diko, who is involved in a procurement scandal after it emerged that her husband’s company benefited irregularly. He said Diko has taken leave of absence.
