RAPPER Kanye West has found himself in hot water after being sued for $20 million (R336 million). A tech company called MyChannel, Inc. (MYC) claims they worked with Kanye to help advance his clothing line Yeezy in 2018, but the rapper crossed them. TMZ reported that MYC said they had a contract with Kanye but he broke it and further stole their tech for his Sunday Services. “MYC, represented by attorneys Ben Meiselas and Michael Popok, alleges Kanye got the company to work around the clock for him for six months based on a series of business promises including a future $10 million investment and estimates it put in 10,000 man-hours and invested $7 mil of its own into the Yeezy project. According to the suit, MYC even moved its headquarters, once to Calabasas and once to Chicago, all to please Kanye and make the partnership work,” read the article.

The company alleges Kanye’s promises of a partnership were just an effort to fuel his Yeezy brand, and steal confidential tech to make millions on Sunday Service ... so now they’re suing him over it,” continued the article.
