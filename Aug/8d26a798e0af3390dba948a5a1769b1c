The Mabena family, together with Power 98.7, have gathered at Power FM studios to celebrate the life of Mzansi’s most prolific and multi-talented broadcaster, the legendary Bob Kgomotso Mabena (51). Mabena lost his life on Monday after suffering from lung problems. He was the presenter of Power Breakfast on Power 98.7, and hosted his last show on Friday, before the country celebrated Women’s Day on 9 August, a subject among many he was passionate about.

He always made sure that we all felt like we're a part of his family," said Danisile. She said Bob was also very protective of his colleagues. Representing SANDF, Chaplain General Monwabisi Jamangile has sent deepest condolences to the family. "The past few months have been special because our division has become one with us.
