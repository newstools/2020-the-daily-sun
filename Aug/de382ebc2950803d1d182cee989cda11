“TO fall in love with yourself is the first secret to happiness.” Robert Morley might’ve been renowned to be an arrogant English actor, but his above quote beautifully articulates the importance of self-love. Many of us are fixated in #RelationshipGoal and often have an outward outlook on relationships. Not to say there’s anything wrong with that notion, but when it comes to relationships, we often forget that any relationship starts with an individual, aka you. According to chemistry, a relationship is a special emotional connection that two people equally share. Simply put, the one seizes to exist without the other. So, the million-dollar question is: will you date yourself? According to love and life coach Francesca Hogi, there are a lot of good reasons to start the process of dating yourself before anyone. From finding your passion, strengthening your independency to self-identity. Dating yourself is the first process at finding true love. Then there’s cognitive dissonance, which many psychologists attribute to the main demise of relationships. Cognitive dissonance is the state of having inconsistent thoughts, in this case in one’s relationships. Simply put, people not knowing what they want. We struggle in relationships because we personally don’t know what we want and as a result, we jump in and out of love without finding any gratification. According to recent stats, more than 45% of relationships end because of people not knowing what they want. This then results in people seeking love in other people which then results in low self-esteem and emotional breakdown. What is the solution? Self-love and falling in love with yourself because that is the greatest love of all. So, start by taking yourself out and see how liberating that is. It called loving yourself.
