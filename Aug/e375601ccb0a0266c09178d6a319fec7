What better way to bid farewell to Women’s Month than by giving great advice to help salvage and keep marriages in good shape. After all, who doesn’t want a great marriage? It doesn’t have to be a fantasy. Your journey to an excellent marriage can start right now. The best marriages are made up of many everyday decisions that say “I love you” rather than those that say “I love me”. Men must realise their wives gave their hearts to them. Value it. It’s a sacred treasure. Every wife has a deep desire to be cherished, to be of supreme importance and value to her husband. If your wife’s friends were asked, “Does he cherish his wife?”, what would they say? A woman’s heart is a garden – tend it well. A true gentleman believes her heart is a sacred treasure. A woman who’s truly loved gives back far more than was ever poured into her soul. Heilbron
