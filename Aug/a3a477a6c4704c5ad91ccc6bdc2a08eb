HIP HOP mega star Nasty C has come out to defend Kwesta, saying he’s a great artist who’s doing magic. He was tweeting as part of a feud he was having with Nhlamlo Baloyi. The feud between started when Nhlamlo tweeted Nasty C, saying he’s like a dad to him and should do more for others. READ | BONOLO'S A RISING STAR Tweeted Nhlamlo: “Nkwenkwe. . . I’m more like a father to you. You and I know you can do more for the culture. “The thing about greatness is that it burdens you. You’ll see how you really soar when you do for others more than you do for yourself. Develop your craft don’t be in a rush. You’re only 24.” However, this didn’t sit well with Nasty C, who reposnded with a cheeky tweet: “You don’t know me, madala. . . You’re NOTHING to me. Shit I do for others is something you could never even do for yourself. You washed up & bitter.” The star then went on to compare Nhlamlo to Kwesta, whom he described as a great artist unlike Nhlamlo. “Kwesta is a goat coz of what HE does, his own efforts. . . He’s the one doing the magic!! You jus sitting on his lap singing his name. Now u wanna act like you’ve done something. Nigga WHERE?!!???,” tweeted Nasty C
