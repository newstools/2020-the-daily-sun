 “I believe if I cut my hair I will die. I dare not to change anything,
not even combing it.” These were the words of 92-year-old Nguyen Van Chien from Vietnam’s
southern Mekong Delta region. Chien, believes in a faith that prescribes leaving untouched what a
person is born with. The Madala hasn’t cut, washed or combed his five-metre-long dreadlocks
for nearly 80 years. “I only nurture it, cover it in a scarf to keep it dry and clean and
looking nice.” Talking to The Guardian, Chien explained that he worships nine powers
and seven gods, and believes it was his calling to grow his hair. “I remembered my hair was black, thick, and strong. I combed it,
untangled it to make it smooth. But when I heard the calling from the divine
power, I knew immediately that I was chosen,” he said in his village about 80km
west of Ho Chi Minh City. “I touched my hair and overnight it has become really hard. It has
attached to my head and became a thing of its own.”
