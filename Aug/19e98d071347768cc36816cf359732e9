THE man who was moered by a mayor’s bodyguards wants a big payment
as an apology.  Uphongolo municipality mayor Bawinile Nhlabathi  was fired 
according to an announcement made by the ANC KZN leadership earlier this
week. ANC secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli announced in a media briefing
that the party had decided to recall the mayor from her position.  But Thabo Gumbi  (24)from
Uphongolo northern KZN told Daily Sun that although he was happy with the
decision; it did not mean anything to him because the mayor will not fix his
kidney that was damaged by the attack. He said the only
thing that console him will be R1 million compensation. He said the now former mayor
approached him June for an out of court settlement but when he told her that he
wants R1million  she said it was too
much. “If she can’t pay me R1m she must serve harsher sentence in
jail for what she has done,” said Gumbi. He said he sees her everyday because they are neighbours and
he feels like crying. Attempts to get Bawinile’s comment failed as her cellphone
was on voicemail. She, two bodyguards and two brothers were arrested in March
and charged for severely assaulting Gumbi after accusing of him trespassing. The suspects are out on bail. They appeared in Uphongolo magistrate court last month and
will appear again on 23September according to Gumbi. National Freedom party which has been vocal calling for
mayor’s dismissal welcomed the news. National secretary Canaan Mdletshe said
the party was happy but warned the ANC that it must not appoint her to another
position. Mdletshe said Nhlabathi’s dismissal has been long overdue.
