MUSIC fans were left confused this week when Master KG’s Jerusalema disappeared from YouTube. It came just days after Master KG signed an exclusive deal with Warner Music Group’s label Elektra France for his latest album, also called Jerusalema. Fans were greeted with a message saying: “Video unavailable. This video contains content from WMG, who has blocked it on copyright grounds.” They quickly took to Twitter to vent their anger. Master KG tweeted to reassure fans that the problem was technical. He wrote:  A few hours later he announced that the video was back on YouTube, promising it won’t happen again. Speaking to Daily Sun, Master KG said: “It was just a technical error and I’m glad it’s resolved now. This has shown me the amount of support I have and it really humbled me. “My brand is really growing and there is demand in the world for me to visit countries and showcase myself. It is due to lockdown that I have to be patient. “As I’m speaking to you, I’m number one on Spotify for monthly listenership in South Africa. I’m currently sitting at just over three million monthly listeners. I really appreciate the support.”  A few weeks ago, he and Nomcebo Zikode, who features on the track, were named cultural ambassadors to the world by the Arts and Culture Department. Open Mic Productions, his record label, apologised on Twitter, saying the disappearance was a technical issue. CEOs Molau Rammala and Lionel Jamela said: “Our mission is to develop and export talent from Africa to an international audience, which was why we welcomed the new opportunity for Master KG with both hands.”
