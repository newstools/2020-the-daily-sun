South African athletes made a quiet return to track and field season action on Saturday night, with lone representative, Antonio Alkana, lining up at the Triveneto Meeting in Trieste, Italy. While there were initially four SA athletes in the entry lists, Alkana was the only individual to ultimately take part. Alkana, the African record holder, crossed the line in fifth place in the men's 110m hurdles race in 13.79 seconds as he opened the nation's top international campaign in European in the midst of the global pandemic which has brought SAâ€™s domestic activities to a complete standstill. Olympic 400m champion and world record holder Wayde van Niekerk had also been scheduled to compete, but was reportedly removed from the start lists as a precautionary measure after allegedly first testing positive and then negative for Covid-19. Long jumper Ruswahl Samaai, who had been in camp with Van Niekerk and Alkana in Gemona for the last two weeks, was also missing from the results, and sprinter Danel Holton did not start the women's 400m heats.
