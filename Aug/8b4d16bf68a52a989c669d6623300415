  All the 42
accused involved in the violence that erupted at the International Pentecost
Holiness Church in Zuurbekom have been granted bail. Exactly a
month after the hostage drama at the church and a series of appearances,
Magistrate Gavin Pillay has dismissed the state's case as weak and lacking
sufficient evidence. Pillay stated
that the matter was still under investigation and demanded that the accused
hand over their passports with immediate effect. "You will
have no direct contact with any of the stateâ€™s witnesses. You're also not
allowed to enter the premises or be anywhere around the church. Should you have
any of your belongings at the church, your attorney will speak to the
investigating officer to help you retrieve them," said Pillay. He added that
should the suspects violate the conditions of their bail they will be brought
back into custody immediately. On the morning
of the 11th violence erupted at the IPHC "ISilo" headquarters in Zuurbekom,
West of Johannesburg. Five lives
were claimed in the midst of it. The church has
been under siege since the death of its founder's son Glayton Modise in 2016. The church has
been split into three factions and these fights have ended up in court. The matter has
been reminded to the 27th of November for further investigations.
