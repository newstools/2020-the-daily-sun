Olwethu Leshabane wants to spoil pregnant women through her initiative The Mother of All Baby Showers (#MaB). This forms part of her 30th birthday celebrations, which will see her spoiling 33 expectant moms across South Africa via a virtual baby shower on 5 July from 13h00 CAT. The event will be a webinar with special guest appearances by Dr Khanya Khanyile, Vika Shipalana and Basetsana Khumalo. ALSO READ: LOCKDOWN HITS TV STATION HARD! The  mother of three has not slowed down over lockdown. As @olwe2lesh on Instagram she has been hosting parenting talks with prominent experts on #TheSitDown. "Besides being a certified doula (coined #DigitalDoula), I love a good baby shower experience! As the host of 1 Magic’s Oh Baby (A baby shower competition show that saw me travel across South Africa attending and scoring baby showers), I attended and judged so many baby showers, so I kind of think I’ve become quite the expert at them. "I also treasure the journey of pregnancy and believe moms must be treasured and spoilt on this journey," she said. "This will be an online baby shower and the aim is to cheer up moms that are almost due to deliver," she explained. Each mom will receive a gift worth R5 000 while the overall winner walks away with R50 000. SEE POST BELOW: The final moment of truth??
