The Alexandra, Randburg, Midrand, Sandton Taxi Association (ARMSTA) has announced that it will increase taxi fares by 172%. A notice that has left many commuters shocked amid the lockdown regulations which will see many returning to work in June. Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula has since urged associations and the operators to be mindful of the poor when adjusting fares. In a statement, Mbalula warned the taxi industry against illegal profiteering during the lockdown. “We are aware that some taxis have not been operating for some time now and that those which have been operating have been doing so at a limited capacity.

Anything outside of that fairness is illegality”, he said. Mbalula said his department would refer the matter to the Competition Commission to assess if the fare increases are fair and justifiable.
