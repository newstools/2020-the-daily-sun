VARIOUS pressure groups picketed at the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday to demand the removal of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Thuto Nthulenyane, one of the organisers, criticised Motshekga for making kids go back to school without assuring their safety. “A number of schools were closed,” he said. “Pupils are not safe and there’s no personal protective equipment in some schools.” He called on the education department to implement the same measures in private schools. “Pupils in kasi and in rural areas are congested in classes,” said Nthulenyane. “Other schools don’t even have proper sanitation and toilets.” Progressive Student Movement president, Kabelo Nthekiso, demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa relieve Motshekga of her duties. “We’re giving the president seven days to recall her and ensure that all schools are shut down,” he said. He said if Motshekga was not removed, they’d take militant and radical action to remove her from office. “We’ll shut down all schools until they open Parliament,” he said. “We’ll take this to national level if our calls are not heard.” Forum for Service Delivery youth president, Kgothatso Ramautswa, told Daily Sun schools were not ready to welcome pupils. “Since 1994, the department has been failing to deliver basic needs to pupils, and now they’re failing to deliver sanitisers,” he said. He said if the department isn’t ready to fight Covid-19 if it fails to deliver sanitisers and equipment. The organisations also picketed at the American embassy in Tshwane, in solidarity with George Floyd. Floyd was killed by police in America recently.
