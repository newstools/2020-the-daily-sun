“MY son is a thief and the safest place for him is a prison cell.” These were the words of a heartbroken mum, who told Daily Sun she’s raised a thug. The 49-year-old mum from Soweto said she phoned the cops a number of times to arrest her son, but they never pitched. She said her 24-year-old son had been naughty from a young age. The mum of four said he’d graduated to petty crime lately and was terrorising the community. “He started stealing at school when he was about 15,” she said.

He eventually dropped out in matric.” She said her son denied being a tsotsi when she confronted him. “I’ve asked him if he’s on drugs, but he wouldn’t reply. “He steals clothes, cellphones and anything he can lay his hands on.” The mum said her son on Sunday stole his younger brother’s cellphone and left home. “I hardly sleep at night. I fear he might be killed by an angry mob,” she said. “If he was in jail at least I’d know he was safe.” GRADE 12 PUPIL TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 Her younger son (20), an accounting student, wasn’t able to write a test after the cellphone went missing. “We’ve been studying online due to lockdown,” he said. Captain Kay Makhubele urged her to approach the local cop shop and submit a written statement. “She’ll be provided with a case number and police will investigate the case,” he said. But social development spokesman Thabiso Hlongwane referred Fikile’s problem back to the cops. Hlongwane said theft is a police matter.
