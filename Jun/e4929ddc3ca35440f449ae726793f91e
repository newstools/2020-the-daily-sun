AS PUPILS returned to school today, the Capricorn district command council has done its bit in making sure classrooms are safe. The council on Friday donated sanitisers and thermo sensors to 10 schools in the Lepelle-Nkumpi Local Municipality. More donations will be made in the Blouberg and Molemole municipalities throughout the week. Mayor John Mpe told Daily Sun: “We won’t wait for the education department’s call to assist because we believe it’s everyone’s duty to ensure all is well at our schools. “It should be us who say we’re ready instead of being asked. “We’re going to support 80 schools across the district. Each school will receive various protective materials.” Mpe said wearing masks had become the new reality. “As the municipality, we’ve also noted that there’s a need to ensure that we assist our schools with whatever we have in our pockets,” he said. The mayor said the municipality will make sure water tankers are delivered to schools in areas experiencing water shortages. Each school will receive 30 litres of sanitisers, two thermometers and face masks for principals attending meetings. “This will ensure that we spend less time doing screening with more thermometers,” he said. Capricorn south education district director Tinyiko Nkuzana thanked the mayor for his support. “The great work done by the municipality will be rewarded with good matric results,” she said.
