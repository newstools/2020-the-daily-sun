IT’S all systems go for Boxing South Africa (BSA) to resume compliance inspections for all boxing gyms in Mzansi. The local boxing regulatory body tested their systems and instruments they will use to conduct the compliance inspections in the Eastern Cape over the weekend, and have given it thumbs-up. Considerations are underway for professional boxing to be allowed to return to training under level 3, and Boxing South Africa (BSA) will hit the ground running conducting the compliance inspections in all boxing gyms. Boxing SA CEO Tsholofelo Lejaka and his crew invaded the boxing crazy province, testing 15 facilities in East London and Port Elizabeth. According to Lejaka, this week they will be rolling out on a national basis through their provincial managers, and there will be no gym left uninspected. “Over the weekend, Boxing South Africa undertook an inspection of facilities in the Eastern Cape. The purpose was to conduct that as a pilot to test the systems and the instruments that we use to do a nationwide inspection of facilities,” said Lejaka. “We did about 15 facilities in the Eastern Cape, 12 in East London and three in Port Elizabeth. “While there are challenges here and there, overall we think those are not insurmountable challenges,” said Lejaka. “There are no challenges if Boxing SA join hands with trainers. They will be able to assist them to comply and whenever the minister gives a green light for training under level 3 for both non-contact and contact sports to continue, we too will be in the position to resume training.” Lejaka has emphasized the importance of exercising health and hygiene measures, in calculating the culture of compliance in the boxers, and continuing to be vigilant. “This is a deadly virus and we don’t want our training spaces to become a breeding ground for this virus. “We can only do that by maximising our health hygiene and the safety protocols,” Lejaka added.
