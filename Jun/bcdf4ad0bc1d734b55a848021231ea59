KNOWN as one of the most temperamental footballers during his days as a player, Mabhuti Khenyeza is said to be nothing like that as a coach. The former Kaizer Chiefs striker, who landed his first gig as a full-time coach after being appointed to lead GladAfrica Championship side TS Galaxy in February, is said to be a joy to work with. This is according to Galaxy goalkeeper Ludwe Mpakumpaku, who insists Khenyeza has what it takes to succeed at the Mpumalanga-based outfit. Khenyeza replaced former coach Dan Malesela‚ who resigned from Galaxy after a string of poor results, which resulted in the club exiting the Nedbank Cup in February. Khenyeza’s struggles with ill discipline had cast doubt on whether he would be able steer his charges in the right direction. But Mpakumpaku believes Khenyeza will prove all his critics wrong in due time. “I won’t lie, working with coach Mabhuti is challenging, but in a good way,” said Mpakumpaku. “The challenge is more about adapting and learning his methods because he’s different, like every other coach. “Every coach has their own philosophy and way of working, which they believe works for them, and coach Mabhuti is no exception. He has his own football beliefs. Mpakumpaku, who has been through the highs and lows with The Rockets, is optimistic about the future under Khenyeza. The Rockets were knocked out of the Ke Yona Cup and were also struggling in the league with relegation issues, with the unfashionable ABC Motsepe League looking like a reality for them. They are currently 12th on the Championship standings with 28 points from 24 matches., a mere four points clear of the relegation zone. “This season has been a tough one, personally. With the injuries I have been battling, as well as for the entire team, given the state that we were in. “But there were signs of improvement before everything came to a halt because of the pandemic. “Hopefully, we can kick on from the get go when the season resumes, whenever that may be.”
