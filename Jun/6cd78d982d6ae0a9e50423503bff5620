ATLANTA, US AN Atlanta cop has been charged with murder. He allegedly shot Rayshard Brooks to death in a fast food parking lot last week. A fellow officer facing lesser charges has agreed to testify against his colleague. The death of Brooks is the latest in a long line of unarmed African Americans whose fatal encounters with cops have been documented on video. Brooks, a 27-year-old father-of-three, “never presented himself as a threat” and showed no aggressive behaviour toward the two white cops involved in the confrontation last Friday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard told a news conference. Garrett Rolfe, the officer who shot Brooks and was dismissed the next day after surveillance video showed his conduct in the incident, was charged with 11 criminal counts, including felony murder, assault with a deadly weapon and violating his oath of office, Howard said. Rolfe (27) faces the possibility of life in prison or the death penalty if convicted, Howard said. He said Devin Brosnan (26), the other officer on the scene, was charged with aggravated assault and violations of his oath of office. Brooks’ family welcomed the charges. His widow Tomika Miller said: “I am really hurt, and all I can think about is what if my husband was still here.” Howard said Brooks was running from the officers and was more than 18 feet (5,5m) away when Rolfe shot him twice in the back with a 9mm Glock pistol. One round penetrated Brooks’ heart. Howard quoted Rolfe as exclaiming, “I got him,” after the shooting, citing audio from eight videos including police body and dashboard cameras and witness cellphone footage. According to Howard, after shooting him, Rolfe kicked Brooks twice while he lay on the ground. – REUTERS
