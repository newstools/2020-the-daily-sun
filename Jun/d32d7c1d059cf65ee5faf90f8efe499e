Two cops have been bust for robbing another cop of cash and a state tablet at gunpoint. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a warrant officer stationed at Mutale police station outside Thohoyandou, and a sergeant stationed at Waterval police station outside Louis Trichardt and a community member from Khubvi village have been arrested for allegedly robbing a police warrant officer and his wife. He said the warrant officer was in the company of his wife, driving along the Tshandama-Khubvi public road when he was allegedly ordered by the occupants of a Ford Focus to stop, who in the process, allegedly pointed a firearm at them. The victim kept on driving until he was allegedly blocked by another vehicle, a Jeep Cherokee in front. He and his wife were then robbed of an amount of cash and state tablet at gunpoint. Mojapelo said the couple alerted the local police who immediately commenced with investigations which led to the arrests. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Major General Jan Scheepers praised the police for quickly arresting these suspects. He further condemned the alleged criminal behaviour of these police members. “Although the majority of SAPS members carry out their tasks with diligence and integrity, decisive action will be taken against any member who engages in criminal activities,” concluded Scheepers. The suspects, aged between 29 and 56, will appear in Mutale Magistrate's Court, facing a charge of armed robbery.
