ON WEDNESDAY, 20 drug addicts were served tea by the Reaga Areka Multi-purpose Centre outside Falala Hall in Soshanguve, Tshwane. The NGO also donated face masks, sanitisers and sanitary towels. Founders Lerato Aphane (35) and Pontsho Makwati (43) said the organisation started last year to help youth realise how important life is, and to promote a safe environment in the community. Lerato said they used the little money they had to change addicts’ lives. “We don’t have any funding or sponsors to help the addicts with soup and bread for breakfast. We’ve been giving them breakfast for the past week and will continue as long as we still have money.” She said former councillor and member of Gauteng legislature Dolly Ledwaba, who also sits on the social development committee, has been supporting their of the organisation. Pontsho said they planned to work with government to ensure drugs and substance abuse were tackled. “The youth need our help to overcome the serious battle as it is destroying young people and our communities.” Ledwaba said they were running a great project after she ran a similar programme during her time as councillor. “They took the baton from me and I will continue to give them my support because my community is very special.”
