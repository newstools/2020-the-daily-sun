As gender-based violence continues to haunt South Africa, police say a Durban granny and her 7-year-old grandchild were raped in the early hours of Sunday morning. "Yes, the woman, 51, as well as her grandchildren aged 7 and 12 were sleeping in the house," said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. "At around midnight, the suspect knocked on the door and the victim opened as he is well known to them. He immediately took out a knife and threatened them and then raped the two."

"The suspect was later arrested in the Point area." KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza said the continuous rape incidents in the province pointed to moral decay. "We continue to witness women and children being violated, raped and abused by young people [who are] supposed to protect them," she said. She said despite a number of intervention programmes and laws to mitigate attacks, "women and children continue to be victimised." Khoza said it was pleasing to see a swift arrest from the police.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/durban-granny-and-grandchild-raped-by-man-known-to-family-20200629
