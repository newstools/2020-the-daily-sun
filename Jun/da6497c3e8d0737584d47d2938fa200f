The ruling
by Judge Norman Davis that regulations for Level 3 and 4 of the lockdown were
unconstitutional and invalid will be taken on appeal, government has decided. Minister in
the Presidency Jackson Mthembu made the announcement during a media briefing on
Thursday afternoon. Mthembu
also said that the special virtual cabinet meeting discussed the judgement and
nothing else. Davis, in
his judgement, slammed a number of the regulations, saying besides the specific
ones cited, "there are many more instances of sheer irrationality included
therein". "After
obtaining legal advice and listening to numerous comments made by members of
the legal fraternity in reaction to the judgement, we are of the view that
another court might come to a different conclusion on the matter," Mthembu
began, before announcing, "Cabinet has therefore decided to appeal the
North Gauteng High court decision". He also
announced that Cabinet approved the extension of the National State of Disaster
by another month from 15 June to 15 July 2020. The law
allows for the National State of disaster to lastÂ  for 90 days which necessitates the extension. Joining the
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister in the appeal challenge
will be President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize. Government
will ask that its appeal be heard on an urgent basis, Mthembu said.
