APTLY dubbed The Rock, Stellenbosch FC skipper Mogamad Rafiq de Goede, is a warrior on the field and every opposing striker’s nightmare. But off the field, he is a gentle giant. He has made the most of the coronavirus-induced break to display that tender touch through philanthropic projects that are benefitting communities left in a lurch by the virus at the epicentre of the crisis. Communities in the Western Cape have been the major beneficiaries, thanks to the skipper dedicating his time as an ambassador to the Be the Difference Foundation. “I’m inspired to give back to the community,” the Cape Town-born 27-year-old said. “We’re going through a tough time regarding the virus and obviously the lockdown. People are losing their jobs.” The Foundation has mainly been distributing food parcels during lockdown. The Western Cape is the region worst affected by the COVID-19 crisis and consists of around half of about 112 000 cases South Africa has recorded since March. Of the more than 2 200 deaths, some 1 600 have been recorded in the province. De Goede, who has been with Stellenbosch since 2014 during their time as Vasco da Gama, encouraged the sporting fraternity to assist the government of President Cyril Ramaphosa and other stakeholders to fight the spread of the virus. “As players, we have a bigger platform than other people. We’re well-known. People watch us play and they look up to us. It’s important for us to give back and assist them. We’re in a bad situation now,” he said. The pandemic has not only wreaked an economy that was already been battered by a meltdown but has also brought the nation’s favourite sport to a halt. Premier Soccer League games were last played in March. Stellenbsoch lost their fixture, a 1-0 home defeat to defending champions, Mamelodi Sundowns. “It’s been very tough,” de Goede said of the lockdown. “But we just have to move on. Luckily, joining the foundation has kept me busy,” the player concluded. – CAJ News
