PREPARATIONS to resume football and complete the season will hit GladAfrica Championship clubs hard in the pocket. It’s no secret that most, if not all, National First Division (NFD) clubs have been hamstrung financially. Only a few clubs might be able to sustain themselves without the Premier Soccer League (PSL) monthly grant. Some of them go months without paying players every season. In March, some NFD clubs including Cape Umoya United, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Real Kings and Royal Eagles, among others, were reportedly struggling to pay their players. In some instances, players had to take salary cuts. With the proposed return, TS Galaxy chairman Tim Sukazi hopes the Premier Soccer League will come on board and help, as preparations will cost them a fortune. Last week, the South Africican Football Association confirmed government had given PSL teams the go-ahead to return to training. But the 16 PSL and 16 NFD clubs have to submit COVID-19 tests as one of the key regulations that have to be met. “The main challenge that many teams will encounter is finance. “Getting prepared is expensive,” Sukazi told SunSport. “Teams have to buy litres of sanitisers, masks, and all those are consumed on a daily basis.” He continued: “Another big expense is testing the players. Testing of players is R850 per head and we’ve tested about 45 players. “We have to do these tests three times and that will cost a lot of money. “I’m hoping the Premier League will chip in and help in the second and third tests.” Sukazi’s team, Galaxy, confirmed midweek that three unidentified players at the club have tested positive forCOVID-19. The prominent lawyer said the players have been taken to a safe place to be quarantined. “We started educating our players way early when we embarked on a programme of giving to communities, and the infected players were part of that.”
