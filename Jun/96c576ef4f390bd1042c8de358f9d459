ADHERING to lockdown regulations seems to be hard for everyone, including law enforcement officers. This after an Ekurhuleni Metro police officer allegedly slapped a motorist. The incident was captured on video in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, on Sunday. Thalente Ngidi, who was allegedly slapped and touched inappropriately by the officer, said: “The police officer came to our car, and when he came into close contact, I asked him: ‘buti, can you please put on a mask? “I asked him about three times, but he refused and started to take photos. “He came to the passenger’s side, dragged me out of the car and slapped me.” The officer apparently tried to handcuff Thalente. “When I asked him what I was arrested for, he said he was arresting me for ‘ukuphapha’,” she said. “I walked away, he slapped me again, touched my butt and pulled me by my pants.” In the video, the officer appears to be losing his cool as he pushes around one of the women filming the incident. The officer can also be heard threatening to beat up the woman. Thalente’s sister-in-law, Siphumelele, said she reported the matter to Dawn Park police, but didn’t get any help. “They started with the paper work, but someone took the paper work, tore it up and threw it away,” she said. They were allegedly told they could not open a case as there was already a case against Thalente. Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng said they saw the video. He said they checked whether officers had protective gear such as masks. He said masks should be used when officers interacted with motorists. He urged Thalente to give a statement about the incident to their internal affairs team, and it would be investigated.
