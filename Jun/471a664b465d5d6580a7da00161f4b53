THE Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced the fast-track of financial grants to member associations to assist the management of football in their domestic leagues that have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Caf confirmed that a total of R191 million ($10.8m) will be immediately distributed to countries, following a meeting of their emergency committee last week. “Due to the fast-spread of Covid-19, member associations have suspended all domestic competitions, which has brought about huge financial burdens on their shoulders,” said Caf president Ahmad Ahmad. “Caf has thus decided to wave the eligibility requirements to access the annual grants, so all associations can benefit during this difficult period.”  The statement further added that, “Caf is assessing the opportunity of additional financial support to associations for the resumption and organisation of their domestic competitions”.Caf has already paid out R55m to the teams that participated in the 2019-20 African club competitions, which have been suspended ahead of the semifinals due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The continental governing body say they are working closely with Fifa and the Wealth Health Organization (WHO), and constantly evaluating return to play protocols. “Caf is monitoring the situation closely and working with the relevant authorities including Fifa and WHO on the impact of the virus on the continent, and will announce developments to our competitions at the appropriate time.”
