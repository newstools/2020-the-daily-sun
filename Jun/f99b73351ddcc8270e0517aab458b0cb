LUSANDA Bless (46) from Khayelitsha in Cape Town is gatvol of her neighbours. She told Daily Sun the problem started three years ago when her neighbours’ son built a shack in her yard and she told them to remove it. “I don’t know what they want from me anymore. I’ve asked them several times to do the right thing, but they keep on making me a fool.” Then they started removing the slabs she used to fence her yard. “They’re taking me for granted. They have a nerve of even taking down my slabs so they can extend their shack in my yard. I have been asking them all these years, but they just don’t want to remove their shack.” Lusanda said she went to the cop shop but was told to contact the City of Cape Town. “I went there with the hope of getting help, but I am not going to stop until they do the right thing. They see they overlapped into my yard. I want the shack gone.” Street committee member Cecilia Jack said they visited the family that built their shack in Lusanda’s yard. “We are still shocked that they haven’t removed the shack. We’ve been going there several times and they would promise to remove it before the end of the week.” She said they’ve given them a lot of time and now they would remove the shack themselves. “We will decide to do it for them because it’s clear they can’t do it, because we have been asking them nicely.” The SunTeam visited the owner of the neighbours’ house, who said it was her son who built the shack “It’s difficult to tell a son what to do when you’re a woman because I have been telling him to remove it from her house. I saw it and it’s wrong.” Law enforcement spokesman Wayne Dyason said the owner should report it to the building inspectors at their building and planning department. “If they refuse to dismantle it, then the building inspectors must act.”
