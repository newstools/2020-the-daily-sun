MZANSI needs a budget that will reduce the country’s debt. This is what the DA expects from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni when he tables his revised budget today. Sharing his alternative budget yesterday, shadow finance minister Geordin Hill-Lewis said at a time when the nation was vulnerable, Mboweni needed to put back the spark in the economy. Hill-Lewis said with the country in economic despair as a result of the coronavirus, the only option available to Mboweni was to ensure there was economic stability to spur growth and show a clear path to debt stability. Hill-Lewis said the February main budget and the emergency budget did not show a path out of debt. “According to Treasury’s projections, debt will reach 113,8% of the GDP by 2028, and will continue to grow. This is unacceptable. Government must stick by the R160 billion cut in public sector wage expenditure over the medium term. Mboweni also has to ‘hold the line’ on any further bailouts to SAA. It would be wrong to prioritise SAA bailouts over funding the Covid-19 response,” he said. In his weekly newsletter yesterday, President Cyril Ramaphosa hinted that the government might abandon some of its prioritised programmes and redirect funds to dealing with the economic impact. Ramaphosa said for a country that was already facing an unemployment crisis and weak economic growth, difficult decisions and difficult days lie ahead.
