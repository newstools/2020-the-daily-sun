"Long legs give the best view." The evolution of men was centered around two important things: Power and status. A real man or warrior, depending on the context, was measured by how strong and tall he was, and what position he did hold in society. These were the two things that would lure a women towards him. Fast forward to today, the context hasn't changed much. Women are driven by a man's "x-factor", and it always comes in handy if you're tall. Research shows that in the top three pre-requisites for any woman, height is always the common factor. Women prefer a taller and physically well-groomed guy because as the opening quote to this piece: "Long legs give the best view." In a 2013 study by Dutch psychologists Gert Stulp, Abraham Buunk, and Thomas Pollet, the three went on a pursuit to find out more about what leads women to prefer those "lanky" guys. In their study, they asked 650 female first-year psychology students to fill in a form which asked about personal details. In some of those details, the students were asked to provide their height and weight size, whilst also asking them if they preferred dating taller or shorter men. An overwhelming majority preferred dating taller men, whilst a small minority were willing to settle for a same-height sized men. This phenomenon they described as associative-mating, as more women were only willing to compromise on height based on their sexual desires. So the long and short of it (excuse the pun) is that women need something to be drawn into as far as men are concerned. So if your'e tall, maybe dark and handsome, 9 times out of ten lately you are in with a chance.
