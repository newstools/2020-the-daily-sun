 WITHOUT sporting events taking place for the past three months, local stadium securities have been enduring the toughest times of their lives as they have not been getting any salaries. The Premier Soccer League security personnel have not received any income since Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship matches were postponed in March. Fifa and PSL referee Victor Hlungwani has put in a helping hand in the form of food parcels. Hlungwani has teamed up with a group of fans known such as Phushi Passion and Limpopo Sports Wise and donated food parcels to PSL security personnel in Soweto on Saturday. “Since the breakthrough of this Covid-19 the stadium securities have been enduring some tough time as they are not reciving any salaries,” said Hlungwani.  “When the government released the relief fund, they (stadium securities) were not covered. So, we tried to fundraise and put something together for them.” He added: "I am with a group of fans called Phushi Passion, it's a group of supporters who have contributed together with Limpopo Sports Wise, which is an NGO. "It really touched some of us and I tried to find a way how we can assist them. That's why we came with the initiative and started making contributions.” "Now it's time to give them hope that we do care about them and understand their situation due to Covid-19. We are here to assist." Former PSL players, Phumudzo Manenzhe and Tebogo Monyai were also present when Hlungwani was giving the parcels on Saturday in Soweto, Diepkloof.
