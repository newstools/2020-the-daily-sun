HE left home to quench his thirst with homemade traditional beer at a neighbouring village on Thursday. But Calvin Mambane (49) never returned home. And his body was found floating in the river on Saturday. His father Saniso (68) from Merry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe, Bushbuckridge, said his son was mentally challenged. He told Daily Sun that on Thursday morning, his son told him he was going to visit his aunt in Hokwe Village, where he drank traditional beer. According to Saniso, the aunt told him to go home after she noticed he was drunk. “It was reported that he took a different route home where he had to cross the river. It was becoming darker and we started getting worried because he didn’t make it home. “When we looked for him where he was visiting, we were told he went home,” said Saniso. “On Friday morning, we announced in the village that Calvin went missing and embarked on a search in the bushes, but didn’t find him until Saturday morning when his shoe footpath led us to the river. “We couldn’t believe it when we found his body floating in the river. “We’re in pain and don’t blame anyone. We suspect he lost balance and fell into the river.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an inquest docket has been opened for investigation.
