A GROUP of unemployed people in Seshego kasi, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, are excited about level 3 of lockdown. They survive by collecting scrap metal from the dump site, and will be able to carry on with their hustle today. They sit there all day, waiting for residents and businesspeople to dump their rubbish. They start searching for scrap metal, which they take to a scrap metal workshops in exchange for cash. Johan Mothusi (49) said they were unable to go to the site since lockdown started. “We were struggling as we were not able to hustle for money. This is the only way we know of making money. “We’re very happy we will be able to go back to our spot during level 3,” he said. Depending on the weight of their collection, they could make at least R100 from a wheelbarrow of scrap metal. On a good day, they get at least R300. John Molepo (53) said rubbish at the site was piling up. This meant there would be plenty of metal waiting for them. “We’d get heartbroken when we saw municipal trucks coming to collect the rubble because we knew they were taking our money away,” he said. “We’ll go back to doing what we love. We’re not ashamed of it because we know why we’re doing it.” They said couldn’t wait to bring an end to their suffering today, and were excited to live their normal lives again.
