After parting ways with Cape Town City on Tuesday, Roland Putsche revealed that he didn't have football in mind when he came to South Africa. The Austrian midfielder said ending up as a professional footballer at Cape Town City was a happy accident, and one he will always cherish. Putsche originally came to South Africa to help underprivileged children through the Young Bafana project, but he unexpectedly got the chance to play football for City and never looked back. "Honestly, I had the best four years of my life here in South Africa. I'm very emotional after I saw the reaction on social media. It feels like I'm leaving home. I never expected it to be like this. It will be hard to eventually leave these shores," Putsche said in an interview with SA FM. "I hadn't set out to play football when I came to South Africa - I was part of a project called Young Bafana and my friend asked me to come and help out. It was a project to assist underprivileged children. It felt right in my heart to come here but I also ended up playing professional football. "Honesty, I don't know what the future holds, but now my focus is getting back to Austria to be with my family again during this crisis. When I'm there, I will make up my mind. I'm a bit uncertain right now, but I have a few options open. I'd like to stay in football. "I want to thank everyone for giving me this experience to see the beauty of South Africa. How I'm leaving right now is not ideal, but I hope to come back to South Africa and say goodbye in a proper manner." The 29-year-old joined City in July of 2016 and went on to make 71 PSL appearances, scoring nine goals and providing three assists. - TEAMtalk media
