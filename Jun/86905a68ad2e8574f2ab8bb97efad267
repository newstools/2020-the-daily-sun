Repairs of pipes had to be done at a school after thugs
broke into it. Thugs broke into J L Dube High School in D sectio KwaMashu
north of Durban on Thursday. They stole taps and pipes. The caretaker of the school Themba Mkhize told Daily Sun
that the thugs gained entry through the roof of the building where the pipes
are. He said they then cut the taps and also the pipes. "I arrived to find that they had broken in on Wednesday
morning. I then informed the principal and repairs were done the same
day," he said. He said the repairs were quickly done because schools are
expected to open soon. "Teachers have already arrived and taps would be needed
in order for washing of hands to take place. And for the toilets to be
flushed," he said. He said the matter wasn't reported to the police. "These thugs took advantage of the fact that currently
schools are not operational," he said. A teacher who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that the
thugs are known in the area and residents are afraid to reveal them. "I think the principal is now tired of reporting to the
police because thugs always break into the school but no arrests are made.
Residents should know that itâ€™s also their responsibility to take care of the
school. If they keep hiding thugs the school will be vandalised," said the
teacher. Cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no case was opened
regarding this break in. KZN Department of Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said he
isn't aware of this incident but he will find out from the district director.
