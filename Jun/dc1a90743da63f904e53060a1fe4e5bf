ACCUSED number six linked to the kidnapping and murder of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu told the court he feared being beaten and ended up saying accused number one killed the teen. Malusi Mthembu (22) revealed this in the Verulam Magistrates Court today. Mthembu was appearing along Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Andile Nhleko (27), Mcedisi “Kenneth” Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27) and Lindani Ndlovu (22), as they were applying for bail. In his affidavit read by lawyer Chris Gounden, Mthembu said that on 28 April, he was called by his friend Kenneth, (accused three) who asked him which movies he had. He said he told him he would come to Magagula and show him the movies from his flash disc. “There, we were watching men fixing a broken window. We then saw Thabethe with other men leaving and then they came back. I heard Thabethe saying they should get the alcohol.” He said after a while, they returned to the tavern. “I heard Thabethe swearing at Bobo. I also saw them offloading alcohol from the car.” He said Thabethe left and after a while, Lindani came back with the car. “Lindani left. Shortly after, I saw Bobo’s sister, who called Kenneth and asked him where Bobo was. Kenneth came back to me and told me she was looking for Bobo.” Mthembu said he left as he had another meeting. “After that, I went home to eat. I then went back to Magagula to fetch my flash disc.” He said Kenneth told him there was a braai at Thabethe’s house but he didn’t attend. “On the day I was arrested. I was taken to the bush where I found Kenneth and Lindani being beaten. I was told if I agreed Thabethe killed Bobo, I wouldn’t be beaten.” He said he admitted Thabethe killed Bobo. “I didn’t want to be beaten. I was forced to sign a statement which until today, I don’t know what was written there.” He said he didn’t know anything about the death of Bobo and had only said it was Thabethe because he was scared of being beaten. The matter was adjourned.
