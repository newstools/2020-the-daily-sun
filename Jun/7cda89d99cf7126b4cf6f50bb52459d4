 IT seems there won’t be any peace in the AbaThembu
kingdom anytime soon. This after Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane’s
Office announced the termination of Azenathi Dalindyebo’s responsibility as
acting king. But the AbaThembu Royal Council confirmed to Daily Sun
it approached the court to challenge this decision. However, some of the AbaThembu’s royal houses,
including the Ngangelizwe royal family, welcomed Mabuyane’s decision to
recognise king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo as AbaThembu king and to terminate
Azenathi’s responsibilities. Buyelekhaya’s spokesman Babalo Papu said they welcomed
the premier’s decisions to terminate Azenathi’s term. “His Majesty is over the moon, however no one has won
or claimed victory over this, but things have been aligned back to their origin
and a way forward is reconciliation, unity and development of the AbaThembu
nation,” said Papu. AbaThembu kingdom spokesman Zwelenqaba Mgudlwa said
they also received a letter from the premiere’s office, but he described it as
a political agenda decision. “The royal council approached the court about this to
defend Azenathi. Government has no right or authority to remove Azenathi as
acting king, only royal family has that power, so we’ll meet them in court,”
said Mgudlwa. Mabuyane’s spokesman Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha said the
premier’s office communicated with both parties. The battle between Azenathi and Buyelekhaya started in
2019 after Buyelekhaya was granted parole. The AmaDlomo royal family removed Buyelekhaya as
AbaThembu king and appointed Azenathi as acting king, but that meeting was
described invalid by Buyelekhaya’a faction.
