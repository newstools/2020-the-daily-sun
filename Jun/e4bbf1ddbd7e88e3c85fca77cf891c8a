WHEN other artists are complaining of hunger since the lockdown started, gospel star Babo Ngcobo said he did not sit back and feel sorry for himself as an artist. He said he viewed lockdown as an opportunity to work even harder to beat hunger. The Thixo Mkhululi hitmaker revealed that he managed to record a single track titled Egolgotha, which was released last month. He said although the lockdown hit artists' pockets hard, he refused to let it dent his spirit. "It is a critical time for us artists. But instead of sitting back and do nothing, I decided to use this time in a positive way. I spent my time writing a couple of songs for me and other artists. Now I have a single track out," said Ngcob, who shot to fame when he was still a member of the gospel group Sgwili noBabo. The award-winning gospel star further said that he also made a collaboration with other gospel musicians such as Andile Mbili, as well as Jumbo. "I have the song titled Ukunqoba which I did with Jumbo and Endumisweni which I did with Andile. These songs are both out on all digital platforms. I know that people who are sitting at home wantÂ  to enjoy music and that is what I am giving them. I revive their hopes and I praise with them," said Ngcobo.
