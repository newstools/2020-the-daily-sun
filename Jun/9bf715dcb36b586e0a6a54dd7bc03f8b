AFTER an angry 35-year-old allegedly poured petrol over her lover’s car on Monday night, the couple went to the cop shop yesterday to talk things through. But the angry woman allegedly set the car alight while it was moving. She and the 38-year-old man, as well as their five-month-old baby, were inside the car when this happened! But patrolling soldiers and cops broke the car windows and pulled the three people out. Ntokozo Dlamini (25) said she was sweeping her yard when she saw a burning VW Golf 3 approaching at high speed. Said Ntokozo: “I thought the car had a fault, but when it came closer I realised something else might be going on. Luckily there were cops and soldiers nearby. “The windows had to be broken, so as to rescue everyone. The doors seemed locked.” When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, the doors were wide open and the cops monitoring the car. The boyfriend was apparently at the cop shop giving a statement. Boipatong police spokeswoman Sergeant Thembeka Koago said: “The mother and the baby were rushed to Sebokeng Hospital in the defence force ambulance after sustaining serious burn wounds.” Koago said the man escaped with minor injuries after jumping out the windows while the Golf 3 was in motion. Captain Neo Mokolopo of the defence force applauded the brave soldiers who saved the fighting people from instant death.
