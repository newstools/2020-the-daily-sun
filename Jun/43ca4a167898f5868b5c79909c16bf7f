The death of two family memebers in Mahikeng in the North West has left the family heartbroken. The Ndabambi family in Setumo Park lost two children in a gruesome murder. According to the family, their son Molwantwa Ndabambi (27) stabbed to death his 24-year-old sister Boitumelo Ndabambi. Molwantwa was diagnosed with schizophrenia three years ago. In a statement released by the North West department of community safety and transport management the incident happened on Saturday. This was after Molwantwa had warmed food in the Microwave but surprised the family when he took a knife and attacked a male member of the family. The statement says he thereafter stabbed his cousin several times before going outside to attack a passerby at the street. The community members allegedly then attacked Molwantwa whom they beat to death.  Boitumelo was declared deceased on arrival at the hospital. The family said despite his illness he managed to complete his Civil Engineering degree at the Central University of Technology in Bloemfontein. The family said her sister Boitumelo was also a bright student who graduated with  BCom Law degree from University of the Free State and was studying towards LLB at the same institution. Their deaths left Boitumelo’s mother Sibongile Ndabambe
with an unbearable pain. Sibongile said even though they were cousins, the bond
they had for one another was stronger than anyone else. “I still cannot believe what had happened. They had just
arrived from their grandmother in the Free State and they died the same day,”
she said. The deaths came after Molwantwa stabbed his uncle out of
nowhere with a knife while the family was having supper on Friday evening. His cousin Boitumelo then tried stopping him but
unfortunately she got stabbed to death while trying to intervene.
