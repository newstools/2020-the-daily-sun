THE body of an unknown woman believed to be a sangoma was found floating in the river. Her body was found by residents in the Umzimkhulu River in the Gumatane area on Tuesday. They informed the cops, who arrived and took the body away. Cops are appealing to anyone who might have a missing woman in their families to come forward. They said the woman is estimated to be in her late 30s. A resident said nobody in the area knew the woman. “Maybe she was killed somewhere else and her body was dumped in this river because nobody knew her. I hope her family can be located soon,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the St Faiths police, together with the police from the Port Shepstone search and rescue unit, went to the scene after being called. “On arrival, they found the body of an unknown woman floating in the river. The victim had no visible injuries. The victim had her right leg amputated and gold teeth on the upper incisors,” said Gwala. She said the woman is light in complexion and has a heart tattoo on her left shoulder, as well as seven star tattoos on her neck. “She was braided on her head. She was found wearing a black and brown stripped dress. She’s believed to be a sangoma because she has beads on the hands and legs.” Gwala said anyone who can assist in locating her family or relatives can contact the investigating officer Sergeant Mandla Memela 078 340 5681/039 835 0012 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
