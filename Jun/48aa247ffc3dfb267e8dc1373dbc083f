HIP-hop group Lab Crew is angry following non-payment after a performance. One of the six group members, Anele “Dinho” Moloi told Daily Sun they were booked by a modelling agency to perform at Miss Dihlabeng at Bohlokong Youth Centre in Bethlehem, Free state, on 23 March last year. He said they were owed R8 400 “We had a verbal contract with SB Modelling Agency. One of the terms was that we’d get paid within two weeks after the event. “We had no problem with the verbal agreement as we trusted the event organisers. But there was no payment after two weeks. “We tried to approach them, but were told to wait,” said Dinho. He said they tried to set up a meeting with Gcinumuzi Tshabalala, the owner of SB Modelling Agency, but he kept dodging them. Gcinumuzi confirmed that the group performed at his event. “But I never had a contract with them because they approached me asking for exposure. I told them I’ll only pay them if the event makes money. Unfortunately the event did not make any money, and I communicated this to them,” he said.
