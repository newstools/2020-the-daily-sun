HIP-hop artist Khathutshelo “Rol Dee” Mudau’s hustle towards making his first album has finally paid off. The 25-year-old from Itsani in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, said he’s been making music for as long as he can remember. He’s happy to have finally released his nine-track debut album titled Mukomana Wanga. The album features songs such as Mukomana Wanga, The Girl and You Mine. Rol Dee told SunBuzz: “With this success I give all thanks to the mighty God, my family and all the people who continue to support my music.” He said he prefers rapping and singing in his mother tongue, Venda. “This is because I’ve realised that many artists still fear singing using their own languages,” he said. He said he wanted to break that mentality and promote his home language in every corner of the globe. “It’s in our hands to preserve our languages through music or poetry,” he said. Rol Dee featured various local artists. “This is because I believe in local talent and the hard work they put into every project.” Rol Dee said being in the music industry for years has taught him a lot. “I’ve learnt that when you give the public good and proper music, you will easily be lifted one to newer heights.” He said he believes music serves as a universal language which connects people from different cultures. “I was inspired by Dr Colbert Mukwevho who has gone on to represent our mother tongue overseas. “His success has proven to me that nothing is impossible,” said Rol Dee.
