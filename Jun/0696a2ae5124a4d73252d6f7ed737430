THE 2021 Africa Cup of Nations has officially been postponed. The Confederation of African Football (Caf) made the decision during their online conference on Tuesday. The tournament which was initially set to take place from January 9 to February 6 next year, has now been moved to January 2020. The decision was expected following the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak that has gripped the world and halted football activity among others. Qualifying for the tournament is still far from complete with international football, especially on the African continent, not due to resume anytime soon. There are still four rounds of qualifiers to play and it was becoming increasingly evident that there wouldn't be enough time to complete them in time. Caf are also made a decision regarding  the possible process for completing this season’s two continental club competitions, the Champions League and the Confederation Cup. The Champions League semi-final fixture will now just be one match instead of a two-legged tie, and the same goes for the Confed Cup. CAF's executive committee also confirmed that African Nations Championship (Chan) has been moved to next year.
