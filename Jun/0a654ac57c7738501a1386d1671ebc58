  WHAT was
supposed to be one of the happiest days in a car owner's life, ended in
heartbreak. The owner
of the R5 million Lamborghini Performante Spyder lost control of the drop-top,
in West Yorkshire England. The life of
the Performante Spyder was cut short when there was “mechanical failure” and
the driver couldn’t stop the car. According
to Motor1 Just 20 minutes after collecting the car, the driver had no other way
but to pull over due to a “mechanical failure.” It’s reported that a driver of a van was
unable to stop in time and crashed into the Lamborghini’s rear end.
