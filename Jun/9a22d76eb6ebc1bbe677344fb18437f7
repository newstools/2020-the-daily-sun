Radio presenter and rapper, Vusi Alphaa, has just discovered his sound and he can’t wait to share it with Mzansi. The artist, whose real name is Vusimuzi Mapeta, has released his single Chakalaka. He said it’s the best single so far. The 23-year-old from Polokwane, Limpopo, told SunBuzz: “I’ve dropped some mixtapes in the past, but this song is different. “I can now say through Chakalaka, I have found myself as an artist. It’s also doing well on music charts. “It’s currently sitting at number four on the Limpopo Big Five on Capricorn FM. It even trended on Twitter.” Vusi presents two shows on Capricorn – The Morning Grind from 3am to 6am on weekdays, and The Saturday Breakfast between 6am and 10am every Saturday. The rapper said his genre is different. He calls it Urban Venda. “Urban Venda is a modern sound. I rap in my home language, Venda and I fuse it with tsotsi taal, English, Xhosa, Zulu and Sotho. “I have new music ready, but people are still enjoying  Chakalaka . As soon as the hype goes down, I’ll release an EP,” he said.
