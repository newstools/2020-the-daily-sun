MINES are battling to contain the coronavirus outbreak and the communities surrounding them are at high risk of infection. Residents of Freedom Park near Impala Platinum Mine in Rustenburg, North West, said they were living in fear of the virus. Dimakatso Makola, a mum living with 14 kids in a shack, said not enough was being done in her community to protect residents. “Our home is small, so it’s impossible to practise social distancing. And many people in our area can’t afford PPEs,” she said. Dimakatso said the mining industry and the government was not taking their safety seriously. She said since lockdown started, life has been difficult. Nthatiwa Mochochonono said: “Living with my husband, who works at a mine, is very stressful. “He might get infected at any time. We can’t support the closure of the mines because how will we survive?” Taxi drivers said they were forced to work to avoid going hungry. A taximan said: “We need to provide for our families. Most of us are breadwinners.” North West has 1 957 confirmed coronavirus cases, 175 recoveries and five deaths.
