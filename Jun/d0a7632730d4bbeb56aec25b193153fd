 Gauteng
police are on the hunt for the perpetrators of a hijacking and abduction in
Florida, south of Johannesburg on Friday. CCTV
footage of the incident, which was widely shared on social media, showed that
it took them less than a minute to carry out the crime. In the
footage, the victim's car can be seen in a driveway. A vehicle then pulls up
and two men get out. One approaches the driver's side of the parked car and
forcefully opens the driver's door. The victim is forced into a getaway car and
both cars then drive off in the same direction. "Police
are investigating a car hijacking case. No suspect has been arrested yet,"
police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele told News24. Makhubele
refused to give any further information: "I cannot share the details of
the case. That is for investigation purposes." SOURCE:
