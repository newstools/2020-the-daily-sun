THE road was covered in bank notes after money rained from the sky! Yesterday morning, people helped themselves to money scattered on Kagiso Drive in Chamdor, Krugersdorp, after thugs robbed a cash-in-transit van and fled. A series of videos that went viral on social media show pedestrians and motorists running to help themselves to cash before rushing off. Some are seen stuffing their pockets while others use handbags to gather money. The thugs set alight a Mercedes-Benz after forcing the cash van off the road with it. Videos taken from CCTV footage show the driver of the van losing control before men carrying rifles surround it. A bomb can also be heard. NDZ MUST BE DISCIPLINED! Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Brenda Muridili said the thugs also used a BMW and two A4 sedans in the robbery. “The suspects used explosives to gain access to the cash. “They fled with an undisclosed amount of money and left cash scattered on the road,” she said. Muridili condemned the looting after the robbery. “It’s a crime. Anyone found in possession of the stolen cash might also face criminal charges,” she said. Three hours after the incident, a 56-year-old man was bust with some of the notes by the Soweto Flying Squad in Diepkloof. They apparently stopped a suspicious grew VW Tiguan while patrolling and the driver refused to be searched. ELDERLY LEADERS MUS STAY HOME! “Members then drove with him to the police station. Upon searching the vehicle, they found a green plastic bag with bank notes. Some of the notes were torn. “The suspect was questioned and he said he picked it up from the crime scene,” read a police report seen by the SunTeam. The suspect had about R5 000 on him. Muridili had not commented at the time of going to print.
