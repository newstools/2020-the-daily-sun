LIMPOPO cops have launched an internal investigation at Hlanganani Police Station outside Giyani. This after awaiting-trial prisoner Knowledge Mashava escaped from the police cells on Wednesday. The 25-year-old Zimbabwean is facing nine charges, including murder, house and business robberies. It’s not clear how he managed to cut open a part of the cell to get out. The police are calling on residents not to approach him, but to tip them off if they see him. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: “Preliminary investigations revealed the escapee used an unknown object to cut open a certain portion in the cell building.” He said they were investigating the circumstances of how Mashava escaped and if any foul play was discovered, those responsible would be held accountable. Mojapelo said the police were looking for the suspect everywhere and hoped he’d be rearrested with the help of the community. “An internal probe into the whole circumstances surrounding the incident and the criminal aspect of this escape have already begun. “Anyone with information that can assist the police in rearresting this suspect should contact Captain Walter Marivate on 082 468 8673, or CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” said Mojapelo.
