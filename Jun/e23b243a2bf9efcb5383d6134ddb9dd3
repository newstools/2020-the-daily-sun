How you wipe when you are done with your business in the bathroom is very critical for your vaginal health. Most women know that you wipe from front to back but if you do not understand why, it easy for you to stop paying attention while doing the deed. Wiping front-to-back helps your butt bacteria stay right where it is. Some of the bacteria from your backside can throw a wrench into the health of your vagina and urethra.“The rectum and the anus have a lot of bacteria that are normal for the bowel to have but are not normal for other organs to be exposed to,” Sara Twogood, M.D., assistant professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Keck Medicine USC, told SELF. Wiping from front to back does not completely eliminate bacteria but reduces the chances of it spreading to your vagina. “If you wipe back-to-front, you could actually move bacteria from the GI tract to your vaginal area and also to your urethra,” Clara Paik, M.D., chief of the division of gynecologic specialties and clinic medical director at UC Davis Medical Center, tells SELF. Bacteria from your GI system can also cause a urinary tract infection. Urinary tract infections occur when bacteria get into the urinary tract via the urethra and multiply in the urethra, bladder, or kidneys.
