Dear MizzB I AM a 28-year-old gay guy involved with a married man. He gives me emotional, sexual and financial attention. The challenge is that his best friend is making moves on me. I’m attracted to him, but I’m worried I might ruin a good thing with my man. Should I give him a chance? He’s not married?  ) Brother Dear Brother Being involved in a relationship where all your needs are met brings a great feeling of contentment. Not everyone is able to find all their desired qualities from their partners. Ask yourself if the new guy is worth risking your current relationship for. The ball is now in your court.
