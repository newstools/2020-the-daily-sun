ANDILE Nhleko yesterday told the Verulam Magistrates Court he had nothing to do with the murder of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu. The 27-year-old from Hambanathi, north of Durban, said he had only asked Bobo why he had stolen from his relative. He appeared with co-accused Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Mcedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22) for a bail application. The six are facing charges of kidnapping and murder. They allegedly kidnapped and beat the grade 12 pupil to death after he was accused of stealing booze from the Magagula Tavern. Led by his lawyer Chris Gounden, Nhleko said he was bust and beaten by cops, who covered his head with a plastic bag. He said Thabethe slapped Bobo after finding he had stolen alcohol. “When we heard Bobo had stolen the alcohol, I was with Thabethe.  “We went to look for Bobo and when we found him, he confessed.  He said he only asked Bobo why he had stolen from his relative, Thabethe. Nhleko said he was an event organiser and was supporting his three-year-old, who had been suffering since he was arrested. Magistrate Thiloshir Badal postponed the bail hearing to today.
