EFF leader Julius Malema is fuming after the release of a 22-year-old suspect who allegedly raped his 15-year-old relative. “I helped lazy Seshego police arrest the suspect,” he said on Twitter. “I’m shocked that the suspect is now free after he was released on warning on the same day by the prosecutor and an officer.” He said his relative would open a case of defeating the ends of justice against the two. “Rape doesn’t fall under schedule 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which authorises such a procedure,” he wrote. He said he helped Seshego police catch the suspect after they failed to do so for two nights. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim, accompanied by her mother, visited Seshego Police Station where the mother complained that the 22-year-old suspect was in a relationship with her 15-year-old daughter. “After the case was registered, the suspect was traced and arrested. He was released on warning on Sunday before appearing in court,” he said. “Crimes against women and children are a priority for the police. “We’ll act against any allegations of non-performance in this regard. “The case is being investigated by the provincial family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit.” Spokeswoman for the NPA in Limpopo, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, said the prosecutor advised the police to obtain a statement from the child and take her for examination. “They may release the accused on warning because at that stage it was only the statement of the mother, which was hearsay,” she said.
