"I don't want to live with stress just because I don't get laid. You know that sex releases stress," said Zodwa. She said that she is ready to move on and get into a relationship with a new person. "I can't stay single for a long time. I don't want to turn to alcohol for the comfort. I can afford alcohol. So what I want is umpipi (4-5)," she said. Her public break up with Buthelezi was the second after she broke up with Ntobeko Linda. Lord donâ€™t make me a Miserable Bitch. To those who have Men Stay at Home. Thina Sifuna Umpipi??????????
