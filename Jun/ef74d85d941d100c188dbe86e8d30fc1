Orlando Pirates midfielder Ben Motshwari has shared a message of support with Given Mashikinya of Bloemfontein Celtic after he tested positive for Coronavirus. The former Cape Town City midfielder became the second PSL player to test positive for the deadly virus after Motshwari a few weeks ago. Motshwari, who has since made a full recovery from the virus, has shown full support to Mashikinya who is now going through a similar predicament. Phunya Sele Sele confirmed on Monday that Mashikinya was the only player to test positive following the preliminary round of testing ahead of the Absa Premiership's proposed return to training. Mashikinya will now go into 14-day quarantine, Celtic confirmed in a statement released on Monday. “Bloemontein Celtic can confirm that after we have conducted Covid-19 tests on Friday, 19 June 2020, one player [Given Mashikinya] tested positive," read the statement from Phunya Sele Sele. “The player was and still is asymptomatic and is currently in isolation for the next 14 days. In accordance with protocols, NHI has been notified of the case by the club. We urge everyone to continue practicing safe and healthy measures to contain and stop the spread of the virus.” Meanwhile, Motshwari took to social media to wish Mashikinya a speedy recovery, urging the Celtic star to follow all the guidelines to ensure he recovers fully. “Ntjaka speedy recovery you’ll get through this difficult time I’ve been there I know. Just do the necessary things you’ve been told to do. I’m with you Dawg,” Motshwari wrote on social media. ????? Urgent Communication #LoveSiwelele?????
