A LEGAL battle is looming between NFP national executive committee and its representatives in parliament and in the KZN legislature. This comes after the party wrote letters to two representatives, asking them to vacate their seats. The party wants to replace MP Emmam Shaik with its deputy president Jeremiah Mavundla, and Shevu Mkhabela will replace Vikizitha Mlotshwa in the provincial legislature. The party has also disbanded the provincial executive committee, which Mlotshwa is chairman. In the letters seen by Daily Sun, the party has asked Mlotshwa to resign and offered him a position of national organiser, while it offered Shaik the party’s office administration post. Spokesman for both men, Teddy Thwala, said the men are consulting their lawyers about what action to take. He said in terms of the policy, the party can only ask the member of parliament to resign if it is going to pay all benefits he had as an MP. He said it was also confusing how the NEC will remove these two while they were challenging the legality of the same NEC in a case that will sit in August this year. “Mlotshwa and Shaik are consulting lawyers. They will respond to the NEC once they’ve received legal advice. But on our side, the letters are meaningless as we challenge the legality of the NEC. We don’t know how the NEC continues to sit and take decisions while we’ve served them with papers to come to court to explain how they were elected.” Party secretary-general Canaan Mdletshe said the decision to remove the two was taken after the party’s evaluation and monitoring committee recommended that they were not performing well. He said the party was not concerned about court threats, and will continue with its restructuring process as it prepares for next year’s local government elections.
