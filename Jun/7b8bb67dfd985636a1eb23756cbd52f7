THEY had been waiting for houses for more than 15 years and decided to end the wait. They grabbed the land they claimed their forefathers had left them. Speaking to Daily Sun, residents of Elandsfontein in Midvaal said they could no longer wait for government, and that’s why they decided to grab the land. Njabulo Mkhwanazi (50) said he moved into the area two weeks ago. “I was renting a room in Tembisa,” he said.  He said he won’t move. “This land belonged to our forefathers, and I know they’re turning in their graves watching us renting rooms. “The government should leave us alone, otherwise this won’t end well.” Sandile Sibeko moved to the area three weeks ago and planned to fetch his family at the end of the month. “I was still checking out the area and I’m sure of raising my children here.  “I left them at my mother’s house to build them their own home. “I’m not going anywhere. If blood must be shed, so be it. “We’re tired of being bullied by government and their puppets who live in big houses with remote gates.” Midvaal Mayor Bongani Baloyi told the SunTeam the officials were instructed to remove the structures from private land. “This land belongs to someone,” he said. “Yes, people are desperate to have places of their own, but they can’t be allowed to steal. “This is criminal behaviour and arrests will be made. “This is a big syndicate. Someone is convincing these people that the land belongs to them.”
