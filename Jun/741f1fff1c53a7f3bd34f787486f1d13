We've seen the M4 testing at the Nurburgring in camouflage but this view of the M4 displays horizontal slats. Carscoops.com reported that a user on Reddit posted the photograph. The M4's grille is flanked by large air intakes and a deep front spoiler. The upcoming M4 and M3 will use the S58 3.0-litre straight six-cylinder that powers the X3 M and X4 M, albeit in tuned guise to. BMWblog.com reports that a purist derivative of the new M4 will feature a manual gearbox. There will also be a rear-wheel drive only and four-wheel drive versions. The M4 will of course line-up against traditional rivals from Audi and Mercedes-Benz with their RS4 and C63.  Autocar reports that the normal M4 model will produce 352kW while the Competition version will make 375kW. The new M4 and M3 will be unveiled in September 2020. SOURCE: NEWS24
