BONGIWE’S strict father is making life difficult for her – and he’s been dead for almost 10 years! Bongiwe Mazibuko (32) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun her dad died in 2011 while she was still living at home.  She said her father followed a traditional way of life, but she and her stepmum didn’t get on that well and she moved out in 2012 to live with her lover. According to Bongiwe, things started going wrong in 2013. She couldn’t remember how many jobs she’d lost and started dreaming of her dad demanding she went home. “At first I thought it may be because I missed him so much, so I went to his grave to talk to him,” she said. But the dreams continued. KLAPS FROM THE GRAVE! “My father insisted that I should go home,” she said. “At first I couldn’t believe he would make demands from beyond the grave, but things went badly.” And she started fighting with her boyfriend, Gibson Jack (33). “He’s been there for me through thick and thin, having to turn him away from me was devastating,” she said. A sangoma confirmed that her father was angry that she was living with a man. “My man tries his best to make sure there’s food on the table and he can’t lobola me,” she said. Gibson said there was nothing he wouldn’t do for her. “We’ve been through a lot together,” said Gibson. “I’d marry her tomorrow if we could afford it.” He told Daily Sun that with the way they’d been fighting, they should have broken up a long time ago, but he loves her. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi threw the bones and confirmed the cause of Bongiwe’s problems. Dungamanzi said if they continued disobeying her father, Bongiwe’s issues might even be passed on to her kids. “They need to visit his grave and introduce the boyfriend,” said Dungamanzi. “He needs to explain why he hasn’t married her yet, and they must apologise and tell him it will happen as soon as they can afford it.”
