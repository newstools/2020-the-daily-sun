A Barberton Prison inmate in Mpumalanga who escaped from the facility on Thursday  has been rearrested. Bheki Manzini was last seen gardening within the premises of the facility. The 38-year-old who is serving 15 years for rape was found hitch hicking with his uniform on at Jatira on Friday. According to Ehlanzeni Correctional Centre communications manager, Messiah Hlungwani said the fugitive was identified by farm workers next to Jatira in Barberton. "The workers informed a security company that immediately called the police. The security apprehended the inmate and called the police to arrest the escapee, which they did and handed him over to correctional services," he said. Hlungwani said the department would like to appreciate all stakeholders who spent sleepless night to ensure that the inmate is brought back to prison. Meanwhile Acting Area Commissioner, Midjohn Mhlongo indicated that a special team has since been appointed to look for the offender. "We did not sleep, we searched until the early hours and we are happy that our efforts paid off," he said. A case of escape from  custody has been opened with the local police. The offender is expected to appear in court in due course.
