Cape Town City midfielder Thabo Nodada believes signing for a club in the Belgian top-flight would be an ideal move to advance his career. Nodada was recently linked with a move to PSL rivals Kaizer Chiefs but City rubbished the reports, and now it seems Nodada has his heart set on a move to Belgium if there is interest. "I think Belgium. Watching a bit of the Belgian league and also speaking to some of the players that have been there, it's a good stepping stone into whatever next phase my career is going," said Nodada in a press conference with the South African Football Journalists Association. "There, I feel I could have a decision of the world being my oyster and me going to greater heights we've never imagined or becoming a way better version of a Thabo than one who would have stayed in South Africa. "So, a move to Belgium for me would be a win and from there we just work, enjoy the football and push to be the best of ourselves. So yeah, I think Belgium." Nodada earned his first professional contract in 2015 when Mpumalanga Black Aces gave him his chance - the club is now known as Cape Town City after John Comitis bought the franchise. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
