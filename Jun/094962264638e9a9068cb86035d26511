FEAR, according to one life coach, is an acronym for: False evidence appearing real. Simply put fear is an anxiety we create as humans, which most of the time is not justified. So when it comes to men, most of us wouldn't expect the average man to have any phobias. Most men were brought up to be tough and fearless. However, there is one synonymous fear that all men have and that is commitment. Now, I'm not talking about the commitment to their favorite sporting club or alcohol beverage. But, I'm talking about the commitment to a romantic relationship. Psychology deems this fear as gamophobia. This is the fear of marriage or a serious commitment. Psychologists attribute this to the financial, intimate and social barriers that come with commitment. The greatest fear is losing the independence and sharing their space with one person for the rest of their lives. Men always want to be in control. Commitment prevents that from happening, and thus creates a fear of committing to someone. As more and more women grapple with this issue, psychologists suggest time and communication as solutions. It is important to give him time to come to terms with his insecurities and fears. It also important that you allow him to express his fears and be open about his feelings.
