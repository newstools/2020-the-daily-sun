FORMER Kaizer Chiefs player Bhongolwethu Jayiya is on the verge of swapping his soccer boots for a 9-5 job. The 30-year-old was released by Chiefs in May last year after struggling to break it into Amakhosi’s line up. Since then he has been struggling to get a team. And he has now resorted to finding a full-time weekly job. In an interview with SunSport, Jayiya who has played for played of Chiefs, Bidvest Wits, Mpumalanga Black Aces and Cape Town City, says if he can’t get a team in the July transfer window, he will have to sacrifice his passion for an income. “Its been 12 months since I’ve been without an income,” Jayiya said. ”I have been taking it each month as it comes but I cannot afford to stay for another year without a salary. Kuzomele ngithole umsebenzi (I have to find a job). He went on: “I made provisions while I still was playing and that is helping a lot. ”I do not mind playing in the First Division or PSL, as long the package is good. “If that does not happen, I’m not a fussy person. I will look for a 9 to 5 job.” Jayiya is currently doing his honours in accounting. He says his modest lifestyle is one of reasons he hasn’t been frustrated about not getting a team. “My lifestyle hasn’t changed at all. It’s still the same lifestyle I have adopted. If I’m not training, I’m at home.” While other people think that his move to Chiefs was the bad one, Jayiya does not think so. “I went to Chiefs to try new challenges and I do not have any regrets in my career choices.”
