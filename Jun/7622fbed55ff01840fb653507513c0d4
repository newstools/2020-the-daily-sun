A double tragedy has hit the Pule family.  This after a 
28-year-old pregnant  Tshegofatso
Pule was found murdered at Durban Deep near Roodepoort. It is alleged that the young woman from Meadowlands zone
3  went missing last week Thursday.  It's believed Tshegofatso Pule was eight months pregnant
when she was found with 10 stab wounds by a passerby on her lifeless  body.  Social media users expressed their pain and disappointment
towards this cruel act. A hash tag #Justicefor Tshego was started on her behalf  "I have never heard of such cruelity. A person who is
eight months pregnant and stabbed to death then hung on a tree. Im so sorry my
friend.. To you and your unborn baby! #RIPTshego #JusticeforTshego," said,
@Charmain. @Kimye said: "Monsters live among us and they look just
like us. In my experience, crimes of this henious nature are committed by those
closest to us."  "What kind of people do such thing to others though? So
much cruelty in the world. People must be made to fear the outcome of Murdering
or raping others. This has to end guys. She must have been feeling sorry for
her unborn child," said @Guccigod.  A case of murder has been reported at the Roodepoort SAPS.  No one has been arrested at the moment, this is a developing
story.
