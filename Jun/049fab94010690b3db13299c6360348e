SA Football Association (Safa) president, Danny Jordaan and National Soccer League (NSL) chairman, Irvin Khoza will report back to Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa this week on the protocols for the return to play football in the country. This follows Monday's Joint Liaison Committee at Safa House where it was agreed that the two football heads will speak in "one voice" before the minister. The two have also been mandated to meet and brief Ministers of Health (Zweli Mkhize) and Transport (Fikile Mbalula) on what needs to be done in the case of football returning to play. In a statement, Mondayâ€™s meeting adopted the report and protocol from the Task Team that says football can only resume under specific conditions as prescribed by the protocol. "The meeting resolved that Safa will write to the minister asking permission on training procedures," said the JLC in a statement. Jordaan and Khoza will also discuss the possible starting dates for the resumption of football matches. In his address on Saturday, Mthethwa spelt out the way forward for contact and non-contact sport. He gave training the green light but also underscored the fact that playing was impossible on alert Level 3, according to firm government specifications. Mthethwa participated briefly in the meeting on Monday and emphasised the need to balance the health of football stakeholders and that the economic impact Covid-19 has had on the game. https://t.co/dG54YH8hRg
