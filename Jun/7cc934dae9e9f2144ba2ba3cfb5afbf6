WE have said it before. The senseless destruction of state property needs communities to do some serious introspection. We all know that thugs and skelms who break into schools to steal valuable equipment live among us. During lockdown, we’ve seen unprecedented damaging and stripping off of our schools by thugs who took advantage of unguarded schools to break into them. Some even brazenly stole food meant for feeding schemes to help the poorest of the poor, leaving many children to starve. Occasionally, school security guards pay with their lives during robberies. Amos Mgwenya was killed last week when robbers stormed into Mthayiza Primary School in Kabokweni, Mpumalanga. The suspects, who’re still at large, broke into the school’s computer room and stole laptops, PCs, routers and other equipment. What kind of short-sighted nation are we, if our own brothers and uncles can steal from churches, clinics and especially schools? Why are we content to just fold our arms while many of these crimes go unsolved? During apartheid, communities had strong intelligence which they shared with various structures through street and block committees run by comrades, and everyone knew what was happening ekasi. To protect the future of our children and demonstrate how important our schools are for their success, it’s high time communities revisited the idea of street committees to combat these crimes. These committees shouldn’t take the law into their own hands, but work with local authorities to help police solve these crimes. Communities need to stop being passive and get involved through citizen policing initiatives and campaigns that will discourage thugs who feel they can own our streets and our kasis. Taxpayers and ordinary community members bear the burden of replacing and rebuilding schools. Editor
