SUPERSPORT United are losing their tight grip on Aubrey Modiba... and it is not by force. Faced with a tough financial situation, as a result of the coronavirus-enforced football ban, Matsatsantsa are now compelled to sell their prized asset. United have been battling to ward off interests for Modiba, as speculation continued to swell over his future. But SunSport understands that United CEO Stan Matthews has offered Modiba to Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns. Even though the two clubs would not confirm renewed interests in the Bafana Bafana winger, Matsatsantsa have put Modiba up for sale as they battle under an increasing financial strain as a result of the pandemic. Matthews has since revealed he has had two budget cuts so far in the lockdown period, and this was affecting the club’s finances. “I’m going to try and balance my books as best I can by not selling players. But there will come a point where you can’t cut the budgets anymore (without selling),” Matthews said last month. “I think in the game of football, nothing is ever cast in stone because it can’t be. Four or five months ago, we didn’t have coronavirus and we didn’t have lockdown or sponsors pulling out. “If someone comes along and triggers a buy-out clause, then we regretfully wave goodbye to whichever player’s clause has been triggered because we go into deals with our eyes open. And we know it’ll be good for the player and for us.” Sundowns courted Modiba for over a year without success, as their cross-town rivals refused to part with him. Their last ditch multi-million bid failed when Modiba extended his contract with a further four-and-half years earlier this year, with the club tightening their grip on him. But that was before the crisis, which has since forced a ban on all sport activity in the country.
