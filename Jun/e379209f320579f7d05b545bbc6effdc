MAMPINTSHA and DJ Tira have finally buried the hatchet. Their relationship turned sour when Mampintsha launched his record label, West Ink. This also resulted in the death of Big Nuz, the music group signed under DJ Tira’s Afrotainment record company. Mampintsha was a member of Big Nuz, alongside Danger and the late R Mashesha, who died in 2015. Asked for comment, Tira confirmed the rebirth of Big Nuz. Said Tira: “We can’t shy away from the fact that people love the group and its music. So, we decided to bring it back.” He said they were still planning how the group would be re-introduced. In 2018, Tira had confirmed Big Nuz was no longer under Afrotainment. Asked if that would change, he said: “Everything will be finalised soon. We still haven’t decided whether Big Nuz will record music under West Ink or Afrotainment. That’ll be finalised next week.” At the height of their beef, Mampintsha accused Tira of being jealous of him and his girlfriend, gqom music sensation Babes Wodumo. About the past drama, Tira said: “All I want to do is make music. I don’t dwell on issues that won’t help me. All I care about is making music and making music fans happy.”
