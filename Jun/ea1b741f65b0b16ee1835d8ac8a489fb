Rising DJ and producer, DJ Lost Soul, is about to make his dream come true. The enthusiastic artist, whose real name is Gomolemo Letswalo (30) from Pella in the North West, is set to release two albums. He said music has always been his passion. He told SunBuzz: “I started making music professionally in 2012, but I haven’t released an album since. “And releasing an album is something I’ve always wanted to achieve. Now that I’m working on two albums, it’s a dream come true.” His album is an amapiano project titled Piano Hive Vol 1, which will be released in October. His second one is deep house called Ka Love (Pandora’s box), which will be released in December. “I’ve always wanted to show my versatility, while accommodating everyone. I’ll list unreleased songs that I’ve done over the past years in the albums.” He said he was introduced to music by his friend and he fell in love with it. “Around 2005, a friend of mine introduced me to the world of deejaying and producing and I loved it. “I loved it so much that I went to college for it. I did a music course at Boston Business College in 2012,” he said. Talking about his albums, DJ Lost Soul said they’re about life. “The deep house album talks more about my journey in the music industry. The ups and downs, the good and the bad stories about hope. “The amapiano one is more about street life, nightlife and the impact they have on the youth. I’ll be featuring fresh talent that people will enjoy listening to,” he said.
