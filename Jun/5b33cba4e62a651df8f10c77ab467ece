We need each other."Nakhane said his performance will be intimate, seeing that he'll be performing in his London apartment. "The thing about these performances is that one doesn’t have all the fancy things that they normally have when they are, for example, on tour. No lights, no costumes, no band. It truly is whittled down to the basics of the song. Two instruments: my voice and the piano. If it weren’t for the medium, I’d say it’s intimate," he said.
