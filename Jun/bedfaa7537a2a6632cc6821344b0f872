THE number of viewers has decreased, but Uzalo is not shaken nor disappointed. The latest ratings show that Uzalo has moved from having 11 million viewers to 10 million. However, the production is still the most watched show in Mzansi, followed by Skeem Saam. Uzalo publicist Nomfundo Zondi said they’re certain that when they’re back on air on 15 June the numbers will increase again. “We’re grateful that we’re still on top. And we’re sure that more viewers will be glued to their screens when we’re back on air.” Uzalo had to stop airing episodes because of lockdown. She said telling a story that most people relate to is the reason they’re on top. “People are affected by crime and family disputes,” said Zondi. “There are also serious issues in most churches that people don’t talk about.” Uzalo will be back on Monday on SABC1 at 8.30pm.
