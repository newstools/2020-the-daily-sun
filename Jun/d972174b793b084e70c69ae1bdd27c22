DESPERATE mums who earn a living by collecting rubbish for recycling are struggling because of lockdown. The SunTeam visited a dumping site in Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. Rubbish collectors were searching for metal scraps, plastics, card boxes and bottles. They said they hoped trucks would start operating under level 3, so their lives could go back to normal. Speaking to Daily Sun, Lindiwe Mgiba (52) from Thulamahashe said she survived on recycling, but since the trucks that collected the waste material stopped operating, her kids have been going to bed on empty stomachs. “I’m worried that we’re going to starve to death. “We’re not making a lot of money, but the little that we get makes a difference in our lives,” said Lindiwe. Another rubbish collector, Nusi Bhayi (50), said: “I have been doing this job for 10 years now. It helps me to feed my five kids. I normally make about R200 a day, but since lockdown, things have been tough.”
