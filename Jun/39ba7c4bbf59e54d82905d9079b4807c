THE lockdown has cost government R300 billion in lost tax revenues. This was revealed by President Cyril Ramaphosa during a virtual National Assembly question and answer sitting yesterday, where he explained to MPs that the country could not afford to continue with lockdown. Ramaphosa said if government continued with hard lockdown, many companies would not be able to open their doors when the regulations were eased. “As it is some sectors are on their knees, especially in the tourism industry. We have not yet started counting the number of jobs that are going to be lost, and I say this with a heavy heart, a lot of jobs are going to be lost,” he said. Ramaphosa was answering in part to questions by political parties who accused him and his cabinet of not using scientific evidence to draft regulations. They demanded scientific proof for the opening of schools. Ramaphosa admitted that the shortage of water in schools was an issue that continued to get the attention of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. He said that it was agreed that any school that was not ready to open should not. He emphasised that the National Command Council was taking advice from scientists who were part of the ministerial advisory council. “Ours, was not a thumb sucked lockdown. It was a thorough process. We had one of the hardest lockdowns and we can admit that,” said Ramaphosa. He argued that if the government has not acted the way it did, the country could have had a runaway epidemic with potentially catastrophic consequences for “our healthcare services”. He said government tried to offer financial relief to affected businesses, as well as introduce a special social grants for the people.
