A 63-YEAR-OLD gogo was found guilty and sentenced to two years imprisonment or R4 000 fine for dealing in dagga. Half of the sentence was suspended for five years. Anna Raloane appeared in the Bolobedu Magistrates Court outside Tzaneen in Limpopo on Friday. She was arrested by Tzaneen cops and the dog unit in Bokhutha Village, outside Bolobedu, last Friday. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they confiscated 14 bags of dagga weighing 211,2kg, with an estimated street value of more than R800 000 during the arrest. “The arrest came after police responded to a tipoff from community members, which led them to a house in Bolobedu. On arrival, they searched the house and found 14 wrapped bags of dagga,” he said. Mojapelo told Daily Sun the gogo was immediately arrested and taken into custody. “This proves police are hard at work during lockdown and won’t hesitate to arrest those who break the law, no matter the age. We are delighted that community members are working with us in a bid to fight crime,” said Mojapelo. A villager (49) said they were happy with the arrest. “These things corrupt the minds of our kids. Police should continue arresting people dealing in drugs, so our kids can be safe.”
