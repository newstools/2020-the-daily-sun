THE mountain is our home, and there’s no other place for us. Those were the words of residents of Marry Me in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, who have been erecting shacks on a local mountain. They said they decided to settle there because there wasn’t other open land, and they’d be safe from flooding. Hermel Ndou (25) said he had been digging for five days in preparation for building a shack.  “This is very hard. Nothing is easy when you’re building a home on a mountain. This is something I never thought I’d do in my whole life, but I don’t have a choice as I have no home,” he said. The father of one was planning on erecting a shack next month, but there was still a lot of work to be done. Hermel said the biggest challenge was bringing building material up the mountain. When he spoke to the SunTeam, he was exhausted from digging and breaking stones all day.  His brother Vincent Mbazima (23) said it was hard work, but he wanted to help Hermel to erect a shack. Talent Siziba (29) said using a hammer and chisel was hard work, and he also used a big iron rod and shovel to level the area. “We want to build a strong shack on this rock.”
