German-owned
luxury car brand Bentley on Friday said it would axe around 1000 jobs in the UK
as the market weathers the coronavirus-induced downturn. The
carmaker, a Volkswagen division that employs 4200 workers in Britain, said
fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak "hastened" its move to cut almost
one-quarter of the UK workforce. "Losing
colleagues is not something we are treating lightly but this is a necessary
step that we have to take to safeguard the jobs of the vast majority who will
remain, and deliver a sustainable business model for the future," said
Bentley Motors chairman and chief executive Adrian Hallmark. "Covid-19
has not been the cause of this measure but a hastener," he added. Friday's
news caps a grim week for Britain's automotive sector, which has been slammed
by tanking demand as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. Car
dealership group Lookers said Thursday that it would axe about 1500 jobs and
shut 12 showrooms. James
Bond's favourite carmaker Aston Martin meanwhile cut 500 jobs in response to
tumbling demand and ballooning losses at the luxury group that began long
before the virus appeared. It comes as
car dealerships in England reopened this week as the UK government relaxed
Covid-19 measures that slammed the brakes on vehicle sales. Car sales
had screeched to a near halt in April and May after Britain's lockdown imposed
on March 23. SOURCE: NEWS24
