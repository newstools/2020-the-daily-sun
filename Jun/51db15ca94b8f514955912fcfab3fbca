THE world’s celebrating June as pride month in recognition of the rights of the LGBTQI+ community. SunBuzz spoke to actor Lunga Mofokeng, who plays a gay man Andile Dikana on 1Magic’s The River. He said: “I remember when I got the role my agent asked if I read the brief well and would be comfortable playing a gay character. I said ‘yes, why not?’ “I went for it because my career needed a challenge and it was a great start for me. I enjoy portraying Andile. “He’s an interesting character to play. I have found my feet when it comes to him. There are no challenges at all.” The 24-year-old said his role has taught him a lot about the LGBTQI+ community. “Through my role as Andile, I’ve learnt that LGBTQI + community are literally fighting against society for being themselves, and the fact that they actually owe no one an explanation for who they are,” he said. “I’m glad I play a role that teaches and changes people’s perspectives. The responses I get are amazing and people salute me for the job I do. This shows that society is starting to accept that we are all human.” The Katlehong-born youngster said he’s now comfortable kissing another man on screen. He urged everyone to participate in pride month, whether they’re homosexual or not.
