Kaizer Chiefs players Siphelele Ntshangase, Braylon Petersen and Philani Zulu have renewed their contracts with club. The trio have all signed one year contracts to keep them at Naturena beyond the current season. Ntshangase, who has not been getting much game time at Chiefs under coach Ernst Middendorp, was expected to be on his way out. However, both the club and the player feel he still has a future in the famous gold and black of the mighty Amakhosi. “Foremost, I am emotional about it. I want to thank the Chairman for this opportunity. I want to thank everyone involved in seeing that I can still contribute to this immense institution," Ntshangase said as quoted on the club's Twitter account. Another one who has struggled to get a look in is Petersen. He has been forced to settle for a spot as fourth choice keeper at Chiefs behind number one choice Daniel Akpeyi, Itumeleng Khune and Bruce Bvuma. Petersen, however, is grateful that he can continue to develop alongside these keepers and gladly extended by a further year. “I'm excited about my contract extension. It gives me a chance to improve further and compete at one of the best clubs on the continent. It is an honour to be here," Petersen said. Zulu on the other hand said: "I feel happy and grateful. All I can do to show gratitude and appreciation is to continue working to the best of my ability. I want to give back to the club. Thank you to the Chairman.”
