When this baby was born, they discovered that she had an extra lip and a set of six teeth and even a small tongue that moved at the same time as the one in her main mouth. According to Sky News, the condition, called duplicated oral cavity, is so rare, that there have only been 35 recorded cases since 1900. The abnormality was picked up by doctors in the third trimester scan of the mother's pregnancy. Their initial diagnosis included a cyst, a bone disorder or teratoma, which is when a twin absorbs another during development in the womb.
