A 19-year-old man was arrested for allegedly stabbing his
stepfather to death. Police were called to a house in Marikana, just outside of
Christiana, where the body of Eric Thomson (43) was found with a stab wound on
his back. He was declared dead on the scene by Emergency Medical
Rescue Services. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said initial
investigations into the matter revealed that the suspect and his stepfather
were involved in an argument, which led to the fatal stabbing of the latter. Mokgwabone said in another unrelated incident in Ventersdorp
also on Friday, police were called to a house in Tshing Location in the early
hours of the morning. “On arrival, a 56-year-old Moses Mahambehlala was found on
the floor with what appeared to be stab wounds on the upper body. He was also
declared dead on the scene by Emergency Medical Rescue Services.” “The police were initially informed that the victim was
allegedly killed by intruders. However, preliminary investigations led to the
arrest of the victim's son aged 26 for murder,” Mokgwabone said. The Provincial Commissioner of North West, Lieutenant
General Sello Kwena condemned both incidents.
