WHEN she saw a group of residents beating up a young man, her motherly instincts kicked in. She pleaded with the residents not to kill him. But some people didn’t like it and they threatened her. “One told me, ‘who do think you are? “‘You’ll take a bullet for him. You know too much’,” said Patience Mzembi (39) from Zandspruit squatter camp in Honeydew, north of Joburg. She took the threats lightly, but was awoken by smoke in the middle of the night. She woke her kids up and they managed to get out of the shack.  Patience watched in despair as everything she worked hard for was destroyed in the fire on Wednesday. She suspected saving the man from the angry crowd could be the reason her shack was targeted. “I didn’t have enemies. It was only the quarrel I had with those people during the day. “The fact that they told me I was going to pay really holds water,” said Patience. “I love the truth and I’m not going to allow somebody to silence me. I swear God will always protect me,” she said. Patience said she was grateful no one died. Neighbours used buckets of water to kill the fire. “We suspect they used petrol because the fire moved fast. I nearly died for telling the truth. What they were doing was very wrong. “I couldn’t keep quiet,” she said. Patience said they were left with nothing, only the clothes they were wearing. They now depended on donations. The victim is fighting for his life in hospital. Community leader Kenneth Lekalakala said the family lost everything, and they appealed to the public for help. A case of arson was opened at Honeydew Police Station.
