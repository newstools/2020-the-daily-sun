FORMER BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb and the late Hollywood actor "Pops", real name John Witherspoon have a very striking resemblance. Maybe Pops and Tignyemb are long lost relatives as they could be easily mistaken for siblings. Tignyemb is making headlines on social media after a video was circulated of his kids singing him a Happy Birthday, counting up to 55 - this insinuated that he was 55 years-old and he ended upp being the butt of all jokes. The comedian Pops made a name for himself by acting in many hit movies like Soul Plane and TV series such as The Wayan's Brothers. He recently passed away after a long illness.
