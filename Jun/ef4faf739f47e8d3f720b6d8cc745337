Medical student Sibusiso Qongqo who died in Cuba, will be buried on Youth Day alongside his grandfathers at his ancestral Cofimvaba home in the Eastern Cape, his family told News24 on Monday. Qongqo's remains, which were trapped in the Cuban capital of Havana since 29 April due to restrictions implemented during the lockdown, were finally repatriated on Sunday, the Eastern Cape government said on Monday. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane previously announced that the body would only be brought to South Africa on 2 July. But on Monday, Mabuyane's spokesperson Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha explained that, thanks to the intervention of the national government, the body was brought back sooner. News24 previously reported that Qongqo died on 29 April - 15 days after celebrating his 28th birthday, following a short illness. His repatriation had proven to be impossible at the time because all South Africa's borders and ports of entry - including airports - were closed. Remains The stalemate happened despite a high-level intervention by top government bureaucrats, including the SA ambassador to Cuba. Qongqo family spokesperson Azola Qongqo announced in a short statement to News24 on Monday: "The Qongqo family has received the remains of our son, brother Sibusiso Qongqo, after months of engagement with government. "Sibusiso's body is in [the Eastern Cape, ku Ngqwaru, our brother will be laid [to rest] at home with our fathers tomorrow, 16 June 2020. We appreciate the relevance of burying a revolutionary person on Youth Day. We appreciate and [are] forever grateful to South Africans for their support in our grief," he said.  http://https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/covid-19-medical-student-who-died-in-cuba-to-finally-be-buried-on-after-his-body-arrives-home-20200615
