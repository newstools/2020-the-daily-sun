EVERY day, residents stop and admire Doctor Monama’s shack with some even taking photos. This is because the 27-year-old has built himself a double storey shack in the Juju Valley area of Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo. Doctor told Daily Sun he started by drawing up a plan. “I then started looking for building materials and started building. It took me a week to finish. When I started, most people didn’t believe me when I said I was building a double storey shack,” he said. Doctor had enough materials to build a bedroom and kitchen. “I am still collecting more materials because I want to have four rooms. I want to do a basement. I have already started digging. “I want people to admire it because it will be beautiful when it’s complete. People will come from far just to see it and take selfies.”  Doctor said he also wants a balcony and a swimming pool. He used corrugated iron, timber and steel to make the structure. “I called people who know about building to check it out. “They said it’s perfect.” Doctor said he looks forward to waking up from the top floor to see the nice view of his kasi.
