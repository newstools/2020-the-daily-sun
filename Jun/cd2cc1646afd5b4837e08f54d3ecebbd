Justice is dealing with a man who allegedly killed his wife claiming that she was cheating. The Vosloorus SAPS spokeswoman, Constable Nompumelelo Nhlapo told Daily Sun that the 53-year-old Teboho Maleka accused his wife, Busisiwe Miya 59-year-old of having an affair at her workplace. Nhlapo said this is after the wife received a call from a male person who later turned out to be her nephew. Nhlapho said the man started acting strange then went to the bedroom opened the wardrobe and took out his firearm from the safe. "He stood behind his wife and shot her twice with a 9mm pistol in the back. It's alleged that her husband then bent over her and wanted to shoot her in the head as he held the firearm against her head," said Nhlapo. Nhlapho also told the people's paper that two children who were also in the house rushed to her aid and the boy came to her rescue by fighting his stepfather and in the process disarmed him. The mother was severely injured and was rushed to Thelle Mogoarane hospital. Constable Mashakwe visited the seriously injured victim in the ICU and was able to obtain a statement from her but she died shortly after giving her statement. The case was changed from attempted Murder to Murder. Nhlapho said the accused was on the run and went into hiding after that incident but he eventually handed himself over to the Vosloorus Police and was immediately taken into custody and charged for Murder then taken to Court. Detective Makgalo Mashakwe emphasized how dangerous Domestic Violence is to our Communities. He requests that if any person feels abused in any form, they must please stand up and talk to the relevant people.
