TAXI bosses in KZN have threatened to bring the entire province to a standstill if cops don't allow full loads. Taxi bosses have given instructions to drivers to do away with the 70% capacity imposed by the government in its fight to stop the coronavirus spread and return to 100% load. This means, instead 10 passengers will go back to load 15 passengers for quantum and 22 for 22 seater taxis. Provincial South African National Taxi Council chairman Boy Zondi told Daily Sun today that they met yesterday and decided that on Monday all taxis must take the full load. He said they are sick and tired by government empty promises and want nothing anymore from it. He said they will never accept the R5000 government was offering them per taxi. Zondi said the government was undermining their industry because it has allowed planes to take a full load, but tells taxis to continue with 10 passengers per taxi. He added that no passengers on long distances will be asked to produce a permit. "We want to warn the government and police not to stop any of our taxis and count passengers anymore because if they do so the entire province will come to a standstill. We are not playing we are serious because our taxis are being repossessed by banks as were not making enough to keep our installments," said Zondi. In terms of coronavirus virus regulations on level 3 taxis are forced to load 10 passengers and if traveling to another province passengers must provide permits either funeral or work. Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police will work with the transport department to enforce laws of the country.
