REIGNING World Boxing Council (WBC) silver featherweight champion Lerato “Lights Out” Dlamini has given himself a pat on the back. He admired the efforts and sacrifices he has made for his boxing career. Dlamini, who hails from the Free State, sacrificed his youth days and left his family behind at a very young age, migrating to Gauteng to chase his boxing dream. The 25-year-old skilful fighter believes it was worth the struggles. However, his boxing journey was never smooth sailing, even though his dedication led him to win three international belts – IBF Youth, WBC Silver and WBC international crowns. “I gave up normal things that teenage boys do and also missed out on family gatherings,” he recalls. “I did not have a chance to do naughty stuff that young boys of my age were doing, like chasing after girls and partying as my eyes were set on this ultimate goal.” The former IBF Youth title holder said all this has given him financial independence. “I told my mum about my future plans and she gave me her blessing,” he said. “She saw my frustration since there was no boxing in Free State, and the only way was to relocate to Gauteng.” Dlamini introduced himself to local boxing scenes with a stunning knockout victory against favourite and equally talented Sinethemba Bam to capture the vacant youth crown. Bam had to be taken to hospital for medical attention after a seventh round knockout. “That knockout against Bam introduced me to the boxing world,” said Dlamini. “I was excited to win my first professional ring accolade. After being crowned IBF Youth champion, I realised that all my sacrifices have not gone in vain. “When I had opportunity to share a ring with Mzansi boxing legend Simphiwe Vetyeka, my confidence level was sky high. I knew victory against former unified world champion would put my name out there,” he said. Dlamini has now been out of action for nine months.
