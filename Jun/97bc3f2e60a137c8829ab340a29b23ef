Mpumalanga social development MEC, Thandi Shongwe has raised concerns about the increasing numbers of child neglecting cases in the province since the country was placed under lockdown. She said this while she was visiting St John's child and youth care centre in Barberton outside Mbombela on Friday as part of celebrating children's week. Shongwe said they have received so many cases in terms of neglect especially during this Covid-19 period. "Some of the parents are not bonding with the children, they neglect them during this pandemic and our social workers are dealing with this matters. What we want to do with these children, is to reunify them if they got extended families. Once they are done with their tertiary studies we will make sure that we trace their families to so that we can reunify them with their families if it's possible," she said. "What we are encouraging is that they must be on the alert and report such cases to local social workers so that the department can intervene immediately. We just want to encourage caregivers, parents and relatives to take care of children because during Covid-19 they need to be protected," she said. Shongwe said if a child is neglected that child can be vulnerable for Covid-19 and that would contribute to the spread of the virus. "Let's keep our children at home, protect them and love them during Covid-19," she said. At least 55 cases of child negligent cases have been reported to the department since lockdown started with 60 child abuse cases, 13 sexual offenses cases and 73 drug related cases. Shongwe will continue visiting other centres in the province as part of monitoring compliance.
