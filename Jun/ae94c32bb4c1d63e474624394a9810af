MAPASEKA “Mapasexy” Makhanya was hoping to use the Soweto Marathon to announce her comeback on the road after a relatively quiet year. But her dreams have been dashed just like that after the race was cancelled due to Covid-19, this week. The darling of Soweto did not take part in her hometown’s marathon last year because of ugly fights with her former club Massmart as they refused to release her a clearance, to join another club. The death of her brother last year, also affected her career as the pair were close. With the cancellation of Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town in April, Makhanya was banking on the Soweto marathon. The outspoken runner and the former Spar Ladies Challenge 10km winner now runs for Murray & Roberts running club. But she is not getting paid a cent as she is yet to hit the road and unfortunately, that won’t be happening this year as all big races have been scraped off the calendar because of Coronavirus. “The year 2020 never happened,” said a frustrated Makhanya. “To think that I was eyeing Soweto marathon to return to the road, is sad. I was really hoping to get back on the road and start running again and this happened.” Soweto Marathon Trust chairman Sello Khunou said the event, which was supposed to take place at the FNB Stadium on 1 November, had to be called off for the safety of the 40 000 runners that were expected to line up on the street of Mzansi’s biggest township. “The People’s Race will hopefully be back in 2021. Our safety and the safety of the runners, comes first,” said Khunou. Irvette van Zyl of the Nedbank Running Club won the race three years in a row and she was still the favourite to stretch her record. Her running club manager Nick Bester previously told SunSport that Covid-19 had severely affected the sport. “It’s a sad year for road running in Mzansi. Coronavirus is not going to disappear just like that. We must forget about running competitions this year,” said Bester.
