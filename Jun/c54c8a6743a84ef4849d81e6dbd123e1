Sinazo Mnukwana thought her dreams were coming true when the man she was in love with asked to marry her. But the 28-year-old from the Eastern Cape was in the end deeply disappointed by her husband. She claimed North West Amcu chairman, Loyiso Tyabuko, became a monster after their marriage in April.
