SUPERSPORT United winger Kudakwashe Mahachi said his decision to join the Tshwane giants was his best career move as he has already won a trophy with them. Mahachi joined Matsatsantsa a Pitori from Orlando Pirates at the beginning of the season, along with Thamsanqa Gabuza. It was a move that took many by surprise as he spent just one season at Pirates, from Golden Arrows in 2018. But the decision to play for the three time Absa Premiership champions have already borne fruit for Mahachi. He helped Kaitano Tembo’s men win the MTN8 trophy in September. This was his first piece of silverware. He previously played for Mamelodi Sundowns where trophies are guaranteed – and Arrows, but he wasn’t lucky enough to collect any trophies. “When coach Tembo called me to come and join SuperSport, I accepted it because I wanted to play (regular) football,” said Mahachi. “I’m happy about my decision because at SuperSport, I’ve won the MTN8 this season and I didn’t get that at Pirates, Sundowns or at Arrows. “And you look at where we are in the league. We are sitting third and anything can happen when the league resumes.” Mahachi said it made no sense to boast that he was playing for big clubs while he was a bench warmer. But he has no regrets joining Bucs and Downs as his dream was always to play for a bigger team, having come from a smaller league in Zimbabwe. “I don’t want to be moving from one club to another. It will destroy my confidence. At SuperSport, everything is going well,” Mahachi added. Despite working under fellow Zimbabwean Tembo, the 26-year-old said getting his place in the starting line-up is not a given. Mahachi has featured in 26 matches, scoring three goals in the process. “Our coach doesn’t do me any favours because I’m from Zimbabwe. You need to work hard so that you can be in the starting line-up,” revealed Mahachi.
