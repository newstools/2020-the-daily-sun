Bees are attracted to sweet things. From that left-over soft drink in a can to a candy wrap, bees are lovers of the sweeter things in life. As the makers of honey, bees collect nectar which is sugary fluid secreted within flowers to encourage pollination by insects and other animals, collected by bees to make into honey. They also use all the other sweet things to produce this nectar. 4-5 juice or sperm can also be seen as nectar because it attracts the honeys (excuse the pun). If pollinated correctly, its result can often be sweet and rewarding. 4-5s carry the juice that helps birth a nation, so in order to ensure that it serves that purpose it needs to follow these recommendations that will ensure it always comes to the party:  Sperm likes to live and function at a narrow temperature range (usually two to three degrees less than your core body temperature). Exposing your testicles to too much heat can cause fertility problems. In other words, there is no need for boiled eggs, keep them cool.  According to doctors, excessive alcohol has been shown to reduce sperm production. We understand that quitting might be a bit of a stretch, but by limiting your alcohol intake. You can toast to a healthier sex life.  This might sound a bit nutty, but in a nutshell, nuts are very important to men's fertility because they provide zinc,Â a role in regulating sperm count and quality.  Tobacco not only reduces your sperm count, it makes the sperm you have less motile. Simply put, should you not quit smoking, your sperm count and sex life will be up in smoke (literally).
