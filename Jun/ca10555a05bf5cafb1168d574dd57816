I've always maintained that winter, according to climatology, is the shortest season of all four. But you also agree that it's the most impactful season of them all. The winter patterns become unbearable, because the day-time feels like a highlights package because of how short they are and the nights feel like an eternity. We dress up more and spend more time indoors, especially in our warm bedrooms. So, if you and your partner are going to be keeping yourselves warm this winter. We have put together sex positions that are surely going to keep you both warm during this winter:  For those that love to cuddle, spooning affords you the perfect opportunity to do that while getting some action. This cuddle position may need you to lift your partners leg, but other than that. Its cuddling all the way. This position is ideal for winter because it allows you to kill two birds with a stone.  Sitting on top of the world, this popular position can be beneficial during winter. This position requires her to climb and guide you to the inside of her. Once that's done, all she has to do is enjoy the ride while you ensure she maintains balance and rhythm. If done correctly, this can be done inside the blankets and best believe this will be one hot ride you wont forget.  Who said hugs are only when standing? Who also said that hugs cant be given when sitting down? The seated hug position defies both norms, because it is done by a partner who sits cross-legged and climbs on top of you while guiding you inside them. Much like spooning, this is perfect for winter because you share each others body heat.  Almost everyone's favourite position. The position that requires you to be fully behind your partner. Get on all fours position, spread your legs a bit and have them come in between your partners knees. Apart this being the best clitoral stimulation exercise, its also the perfect sexercise to get you both wet.
