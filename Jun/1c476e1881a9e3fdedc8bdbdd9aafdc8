VETERAN midfielder Lindokuhle Mbatha has pledged his loyalty to his club Highlands Park. The 34-year-old, who was in the books of Mamelodi Sundowns and defunct Platinum Stars, says that he is not seeking a move away from the Tembisa-based outfit. When his former team Mpumalanga Black Aces sold their status to prominent football administrator John Comitis in 2016, Mbatha was on-loan from Sundowns. He was recalled by the Tshwane giants, while some of his teammates relocated to the Mother City to play for the newly formed Cape Town City owned by Comitis. With Bidvest Wits having been sold to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila owner Masala Mulaudzi, Mbatha recalled the events of four years ago when Aces was sold. “It’s not easy on players when a club has been sold,” said Mbatha. “You have more questions than answers about your future. When Aces was sold, I was not affected that much as I returned to Sundowns. But what about the other players? Some are kept, while others are let go.” Mbatha was a regular before the Aces sale materialised, and he had to go back to Tshwane to fight for his place in the starting line-up at the star-studded Brazilians again. Mbatha added that he enjoyed his football in Mpumalanga while at Aces but had to accept that the club was no more. He is now enjoying himself again at Highlands under the guidance of coach Owe Da Gama. He said he has no desire to move away from Tembisa. “Even though you cannot guarantee anything in life, I’m happy here,” said Mbatha.
