MANY
had believed that the cops were scared to stop Interstate Bus Lines buses that
operate between Bloemfontein, Botshabelo and ThabaNchu. But
on Thursday afternoon, the Free State traffic cops showed that they were not
afraid to stop and impound the IBL buses. Three buses were found to have been
overloaded with passengers and they were immediately removed from the N8 Road
that connects Upington, Kimberley, Bloemfontein and Maseru in Lesotho. Tsietsi
Masithela posted the photos on Facebook showing some of the passengers standing
inside to what appeared to be an Interstate Bus. He
then wrote: "Why this bus is not complying to the stipulated regulations? Was
there any new amendments allowing buses to load 100% capacity? Are the
authorities and the bus company not putting the lives of the poor passengers at
risk? Why law enforcement officials are so hard on taxis? Can I also load
100%?" It's
alleged that the buses were loading more than 50% of loading capacity. The
Free State traffic said they were aware that many had thought they were not
stopping the Interstate buses on the N8. But
on Thursday, that came something of the past when three buses were impounded
after overload. Department
spokeswoman Hillary Mophethe said they have decided to focus on the
buses. Mophethe
told Daily Sun: "The three IBL buses were taken to Lengau traffic
department to pay fines. Alternative buses were arranged by IBL to take the
passengers. All
three of them were fined with failure to comply with regulation on loading
capacity." Interstate
Bus Lines spokesman Vuyo Ondala said they were aware of the impounded buses. Ondala
told Daily Sun:"We confirm that yesterday afternoon around 5pm a number of
our buses were stopped by Traffic Officials outside Bloemfontein near the
airport and three were directed to the Lengau Traffic facility but were later
released. This is all we can confirm at this stage as members of our Management
team are meeting Traffic Officials.
