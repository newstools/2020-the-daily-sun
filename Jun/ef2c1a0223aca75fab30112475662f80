 HER LOVER’S body was allegedly found under the bed. And he was allegedly found dead without his private parts. But the young woman could not explain how. Now the 22-year-old woman from Pretoria Central, Tshwane, is in hot water with the law. And her boyfriend’s relatives are not happy with her either. In a video doing the rounds on social media, the young woman can be seen kneeling next to the 36-year-old Ugandan man’s body crying in a Sunnyside flat. People believed to be the man’s relatives can be heard insulting and shouting at her as they demand to know what happened. But she says she isn’t God and doesn’t know. She says she is in pain and then asks the people if they know that the man is her husband. However, this did not faze the group, who asked her why she put the body under the bed. The woman answered by saying they wouldn’t be shouting at her if she was from Uganda, but would instead be crying with her. They then asked her if she and her other boyfriend tortured their brother. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said police were called to the scene by the man’s relatives. He said the relatives told the police they hadn’t been able to reach the man on his cellphone, so they went to check on him at his place on Thursday. “It is reported that the relatives found their brother’s girlfriend, the suspect, at the residence and his body was found under the bed with injuries on the upper body,” said Makhubela. He said the woman was arrested and charged with murder after she could not explain what had happened to the dead man. He said she was expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court today.
