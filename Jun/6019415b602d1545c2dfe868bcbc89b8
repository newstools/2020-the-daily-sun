The South African Football Association (SAFA) has announced that government has approved the protocol of regulations that will allow for PSL teams to resume training. PSL matches were last played on 11 March before the league was halted in line with measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus. This left most clubs with six or seven matches of the current campaign still to play. A SAFA Joint Liaison Committee (JLC) was then put together to formulate safety measures for soccer to resume that was to be approved by Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa. This has since been approved and was confirmed on a statment which was published on their website on Friday. "According to Government Gazette promulgated by Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture on 11 June 2020 under the Disaster Management Act of 2002, football can resume training after complying with the regulations. "These regulations entail among others that all teams need to test for Covid-19 and chronic medical conditions (as stipulated in the football return to training protocol adopted by the SAFA Joint Liaison Committee (JLC) and results must be sent to the Compliance Officer.
