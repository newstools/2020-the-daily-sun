Times have changed, but it's still true that the world is one big jungle. A lion will never settle for grass when it knows it can have some buffalo ,so indeed we live in a world where it's eat or be eaten. The time for waiting is long gone and the art of asking someone out or expressing your feelings towards them has also changed. The old tradition where a man shelas or asks a woman out has drastically changed in recent years.Â  Women have become go-getters in terms of their dreams, goals and now, also ntheir men. In a recent study done in America, more and more women are comfortable in making the first move, from finding out who you are, or buying you a drink to actually approaching you. Women have become the hunters. Let's go back to the jungle again. The lioness is one of the deadliest female hunters. It's mastered the art of patience and knowing when to strike. Once it's set its target on a prey, it will never stop until it catches its prey, very much the same concept when it comes to women making the first move. They soon realised that good things come to those who pursue and time waits for no woman. As scary as this may sound, these are the days of our lives where this generation of women has become both bold and beautiful. So guys, if you are scared to make the first move, chances are, she will!
