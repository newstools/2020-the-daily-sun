TOP African musicians and producers have joined in spreading the message of kindness. One song that deserves a standing ovation during the Covid-19 crisis is Kindness Contagion, which aims to spread the message of ubuntu all over Africa. It’s the brainchild of Human Innovative project, organised by the South African Creative Industries incubator in Eersterust, east of Tshwane. The song features over 20 artists including Vusi Mahlasela, Buhlebendalo, Maurice Kirya, Vicky Sampson, Suzziah, Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse, Tu Nokwe and others. The producers included Gabi le Roux of Nkalakatha fame and skilled jazz pianist Camillo Lombard. Award-winning vocalist RJ Benjamin composed the melody and editor Michael Lee wrote the lyrics and put together the content of the video. The song will appeal to most people since it features various genres. Madosini and Pops Mohammed’s instruments also show off Africa’s indigenous music. The follow-up of sweet young vocalist Tau Lion and Jonathan Butler also shows a mix of generations. The song will also take you through an imaginary journey into Africa. Executive producer Freddy Arendse said: “Top African artists have created a song and music video rooted in African values of friendship, generosity, sharing and togetherness. “Every artist recorded their music and video content independently from where they are around the world, offering a truly pan-African message to the rest of the planet around the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on a call to action for all to heal the world together based on our common humanity.” He appealed to Mzansi to donate to artists and share the message of spreading kindness in Africa by visiting their social media or sending a friend a postcard.
