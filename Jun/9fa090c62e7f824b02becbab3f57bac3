PATRICIA Oliphant says she was admitted to hospital but was sent home while still in pain. The 48-year-old from De Doorns, Western Cape, told Daily Sun she was admitted to Eben Donges Hospital in Worcester last Monday with a swollen leg. “I was discharged on the Tuesday but I was still feeling the pain. I asked if they could give me a walking stick because I was struggling to walk, but the staff just ignored me,” she said, She was discharged even though her leg was still swollen. “I was only given painkillers. I wanted to get help, not to be given painkillers. I wanted hospital care but now I’m in pain again” said Patricia, Her daughter Ziyanda Buqwana said it was painful seeing her mother like that. “We were hoping the hospital could assist her so she could walk on her own because now we have to take her to the bathroom, as she can’t do anything on her own.” No one knew what was happening with Patricia’s leg. Ziyanda said: “She is diabetic, so we don’t know if that’ the cause of the pain. But we want the hospital to at least give her walking sticks.” Maret Lesch from Western Cape health department said Patricia presented herself to Worcester hospital emergency centre with a swollen leg. “She had a small laceration on her leg and was admitted for 24 hours, where she received the appropriate medical care and medication.” Lesch said after 24 hours, the swelling on Patricia’s leg had improved and she could walk. “There was no clinical indication to issue her crutches. Medication was prescribed and she was discharged last Tuesday. She presented herself to the emergency centre again last Wednesday for further medical treatment for her leg.”
