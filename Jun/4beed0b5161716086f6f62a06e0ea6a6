Is it really for the likes? My late grandmother taught me this very invaluable lesson about relationships: "The issues between two people are never to be interfered with." In other words, never involve yourself in matters relating to two people because as the old saying goes: "Three is a crowd." Social media has added a great spanner in the works of our relationships. It seems the more we post about our lives, we sadly invite the world to have a say in how we live our lives. So hashtags couple goals, love lives here and glowing. Is it worth it to post your partner on social media? Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Kansas conducted five different experiments to understand how sharing things about yourself online impacts relationships. They used a variety of methods, including self-reported questionnaires, objective ratings made by independent judges, and partner reports. In their overall findings of the study’s authors found that people who are romantically involved with Facebook over-sharer are less satisfied with their relationships than those who have partners who know how to edit themselves online. The study’s results; "suggest online disclosure, when done incautiously, can bring more harm than good to romantic relationships, from their development to maintenance". So it's clear through the above research that sharing some episodes of your relationship can be healthy for your relationship. So I guess I can no longer use singer Tellaman's song- No Sharing as an Excuse for not posting our relationship online?
