WHEN his mum and gogo died, Sphumelele Mazeka was forced to drop out of grade 10 in 2017 and look for piece jobs. But the 25-year-old from Inanda, north of Durban, made sure he put money away to spend on his passion for art. Sphumelele told Daily Sun he fell in love with art when his maths teacher gave him a project to build a miniature house. “Teachers told me I was talented. When I started it was just for fun. I’d use any materials. “But I was advised to turn it into a business and started saving money for materials.” Sphumelele said people started coming to him for model houses to decorate their real houses. He said he was living at his home village of Impendle near Bulwer at the time, and he ran out of clients. “I then moved in with my uncle in Inanda. I’m now looking for a proper job so I can save money to open a studio,” he said. Sphumelele advertises his work on social media, and this helps to grow his business. He said he wanted to get a place in town so he could reach more people. “This is pure talent that God gave me,” he said. “I believe the Lord gave this to me because he knew I’d struggle to find work. “My dream is to own a studio where I can exhibit my work.”
