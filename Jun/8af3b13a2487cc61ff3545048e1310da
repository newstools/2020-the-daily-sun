We had a huge joblessness problem long before lockdown began and, as a result, people who had jobs stuck to them. Some companies have collapsed now and others are retrenching. We’ve fallen into the trap of unemployment because the youth of 1994 failed to make themselves employable once they were liberated. Had they been innovative and not waited for government to spoon-feed them, we’d have been in a far better situation. They should’ve become pioneers who led the way in creating jobs for future generations. But dwelling on past failures won’t improve the youth’s situation. The youth of today need to take the bull by the horns. Neighbouring countries have poor economies yet their people get by. They work hard to put food on the table. We need to stop loafing on street corners and come up with plans on how to make an income. Stop expecting government to give you grants. The economy is suffering as it is as a result of lockdown and the relief funds that have been made available to struggling people. The youth of 1976 fought for our liberation, and it’s now up to the youth of today to grow our ailing economy.
