Famous in Mzansi for creating the best dupes you can find, Mr Price is South Africans' favourite clothing retailer. MRP recently started selling wireless earphones and they are already always sold out. Wireless earphones provide more than the freedom we want from wires, for many, it is a sign of swag. Selling for just R149.99, these are an absolute bargain from what the actual Airpods cost. People went crazy on social media after seeing these wireless earphones and this is what they had to say.
