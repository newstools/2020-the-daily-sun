Maritzburg United defender Nazeer Allie insists retirement is the furthest thing from his mind. The 35-year-old is one of the longest-serving players in the Premier Soccer League (PSL) having made his debut in the competition in 2005. Allie started his career at Ajax Cape Town where he won the 2007 Absa Cup (Nedbank Cup) and 2008 Telkom Knockout Cup, before moving to Bidvest Wits in 2015. The Cape Town-born player enjoyed some success with Wits as he helped the team clinch the Absa Premiership title and MTN8 during the 2016/17 season and the 2017 Telkom Knockout Cup. Allie, who has also played for Bafana Bafana, has entered veteran territory in footballing terms, but he is not thinking of retirement. "Honestly, I am not thinking of retirement [because] I still have the hunger, passion, and drive for more success on the field," Allie told SuperSport.com. "So, I have not even thought of that so far in my career. I am only thinking of looking after myself and performing well on the pitch whenever I get the opportunity to play. "I still have the desire to continue with my career and play at the highest level. Known for his ability to excel as a right-back and central defender, Allie was signed by Maritzburg from Wits ahead of the 2018/19 campaign and the current season has seen him establish himself as a key player for the team. The tough-tackling player made 25 appearances across all competitions for the Team of Choice before the current season was suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic last March. "Personally, I have had some average games this season and also performed well in other matches," the former Ajax Cape Town captain said. "I am pretty pleased with my overall performance this season. But I can obviously improve my game. "So, I am looking forward to the resumption of the season and the last six games which we have in the Absa Premiership. -SUPERSPORT.COM
