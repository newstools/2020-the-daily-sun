WITH just a few weeks since TV productions started shooting again under lockdown restrictions, not all could avoid contracting the coronavirus. The River announced that a member tested positive and production had been halted. The 1Magic’s telenovela closed doors for the set to be decontaminated. But it’s unclear if the person is a cast or crew member. Tshedza Pictures, the production house behind The River, asked the cast and crew to self-isolate while health protocols are being implemented. Phathu Makwarela of Tshedza Pictures said: “Ever since we resumed production on 1 May, all lockdown health guidelines were implemented on set. “After receiving news of a colleague testing positive, we immediately asked the cast and crew who came into contact with the member to self-isolate. “They’ll soon avail themselves to health authorities for testing, in line with government directives.” Nomsa Philiso, channel director for local entertainment channels at M-Net, said: “We’ve contacted the production team to assure them of our support. “Our understanding is that ever since they resumed production, the team implemented all necessary health precautions to ensure safety of cast and crew.” She said they needed to show compassion to fellow brothers and sisters and wished affected member a speedy recovery.
