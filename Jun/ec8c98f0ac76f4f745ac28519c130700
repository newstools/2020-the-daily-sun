SHE was scared and shocked after she discovered she had coronavirus. The 40-year-old mum from Umlazi, south of Durban in KZN, told Daily Sun she was infected by her sick friend who was admitted to one of the hospitals in Durban in March. “I had visited my friend and we thought she had asthma. But doctors later found that she actually had coronavirus,” she told Daily Sun. She said she was informed she should get tested. “My results came back positive. I was taken to Clairwood Hospital at the end of March to quarantine for 14 days,” she said. But just a day in hospital, she was told her daughter (10) also tested positive for the virus. “That scared me a lot. I was scared my child and I were going to die,” she said. “My symptoms were different from other people. I couldn’t smell or taste anything. My back was painful.” She said she and her daughter went home after 14 days. “I couldn’t believe we survived. I was so happy” she said. She said people should know that Covid-19 was real and they must look after themselves.
