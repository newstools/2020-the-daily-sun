A MAN crashed into a fence wall of a house in K
section KwaMashu north of Durban after he lost control of a bakkie he was
driving. The man lost control of his brother's bakkie after he
was shot and injured by a tracking company on Wednesday. The man had been driving his brother's car that had
been hijacked earlier on the day. His brother was hijacked in KwaMashu. The brother reported to his tracking company that his
car was hijacked and called the cops. But the car was recovered and taken back to where the
owner lives. But the tracking company wasn't aware that the car had been
recovered, they were still looking for it. The man then took his brother's car and while he was
driving it, the tracking company saw him and they tried to stop him. It is alleged that the man didn't stop, he continued
driving and then he was shot, he lost control of it and crashed into the fence
wall. He was admitted to the hospital after he sustained
injuries on his bum. A family member of the house where the car crashed
into who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that she was on her way to her
shopping when she was called to come back home. "I arrived to find a man injured and the fence
wall damaged," she said. "I heard that his brother was still in hospital
as he was hijacked earlier on the day. But they promised to fix the damaged
fence wall soon," she said. She said she trusts that they will fix it and she
didn't open a case. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the
complainant didn't want to open a case.
