CAPE Town City FC have confirmed that midfielder Roland Putsche has left the club with immediate effect. The Austrian-born signed with the Mother City club in 2016 winning Telkom Knockout in City's inaugural season under Eric Tinkler and two years later helping guide Benni McCarthy to his first piece of silverware as a coach with an MTN8 triumph. Just shy of 100 appearances for the club, Putsche will now return home after four amazing seasons of donning the Blue & Gold CTCFC kit, with a lifetime of memories and experiences in Cape Town. "I just want to thank every single individual beginning by the club management over to our hardworking ladies and gentlemen in the office, to all my amazing teammates and coaches I had over the years, up to our incredible fans which makes my Cape Town City family complete," Putsche said in a statement released by the club. "All of you have been and are a big part of my life and created memories with me that I will never forget. Iâ€™m not fully happy with my last game and my good bye so I might have to come back one day and come say goodbye in a proper manner. Love you all, until we see each other again." Club owneer John Comitis believes that the player has been integral part of the club's success. "Football clubs are built on characters like Roland Putsche. Roli has been a key pillar in the success story of Cape Town City," said Comitis. "He arrived relatively inconspicuously but leaves as a club hero through all we have achieved together. "Roli defines what it means to be a City player on and off the field. Initially we had agreed he would only stay 1 year before returning to Austria - 4 years later and it's quite a story. "We respect his wishes to finally return home, but don't be surprised to see him back at the club one day. Go well Roli!"
