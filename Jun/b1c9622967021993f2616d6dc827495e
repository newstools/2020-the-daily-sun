South Africa's most
populous province, Gauteng, is now recording more Covid-19 cases every day than
at any point during the Western Cape's outbreak. So far, the Western
Cape has been the hardest-hit province. As of Friday, the province recorded 57
941 cases - 48% of the Covid-19 cases nationally. On 26 June, Gauteng
recorded 2 598 new cases and 2 590 on 25 June – both representing the highest
increases in cases in a single day in any province. In comparison, the
Western Cape's highest rise in cases in a single day was reported on 4 June,
with 2 349 cases.    These increases have
also pushed the average daily increase in cases on a seven-day rolling average
basis in Gauteng to more than 2 000 a day, also the highest increase in cases
in any province since the first case was confirmed on 5 March. As of 26 June, Gauteng
recorded 31 344 cases, and 15 898 cases were recorded on 18 June – which
represents a doubling rate of eight days. By comparison, cases
in the Western Cape took 21 days to double to a reported total of 57 941 cases,
and the Eastern Cape 10 days to double to 21 938 cases. This heralds a
significant shift in the behaviour of the Covid-19 outbreak in Gauteng and the
Eastern Cape. Gauteng is, however,
expected to record the highest number of cases and deaths nationally, according
to projections used by government. "The current
surge of Covid-19 cases we are experiencing in Gauteng is expected," the
Gauteng health department said in its daily statement on Saturday. "Increased
movement and mobility of people is one of the contributing factors of the rise
in number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. We continue to observe cluster outbreaks
from gatherings," the department said. "The numbers will
continue to increase as we head towards the peak."  https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/investigations/graphics-gauteng-now-recording-more-covid-19-cases-a-day-than-the-western-cape-has-at-any-point-20200627
