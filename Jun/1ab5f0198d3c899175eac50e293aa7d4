IF LIFE begins at 40, then it’s not a good start for Rendani. While Rendani Ramoba celebrated his 40th birthday on 5 May, three Joburg Metro cops arrived at his house in Alexandra and allegedly broke his 4-5. One of the cops allegedly said “he is the one”, then they took him to the police van and beat him up. But a few minutes later they sent him home. The attack may be over, but bedridden Rendani has suffered such serious injuries that he now relies on a urinary catheter because he’s unable to pee on his own, apparently because he was kicked in his genitals. His injuries have extended to the bedroom because his 4-5 won’t work, and doctors have told him the injuries may be permanent. Rendani said he’s worried that his wife might leave him.  He said he even thought about suicide. Rendani, a father of five, is unhappy that his wife is going out trying to find the means for them to have food on the table. “I submitted CVs before lockdown, but I can’t work in my current condition.” His wife Nthabiseng Maake (35) has been by his side all the time.  “He was peeing blood after the attack and asked to be taken to hospital,” she said, crying. Security guards said only one person at a time could enter due to regulations, but Rendani could not walk by himself. “I asked if they could hold him until he gets to the door, but they said he must walk on his own.” She watched as her dizzy husband collapsed at the clinic entrance and the same guards got him a wheelchair. Brave Nthabiseng said she will be by her husband’s side until he recovers. Ipid spokeswoman Ndileka Cola confirmed they have received the matter and it was being investigated.
