TEENAGE alcohol drinking is a serious problem. The drinking rate of Mzansi teens is high and they start from a young age. Our country ranks among the third-largest consumer of alcohol in Africa and 19th in the world. The liquor industry is seriously concerned by the stats showing the youth is drinking from as young as 15 years. Research shows people who begin drinking before the age of 18 are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who have their first drink at the age of 20 or older. We should have community engagement and help to reduce teenage alcohol consumption by changing attitudes and providing information about the realities of alcohol abuse. Letâ€™s educate kids about responsible alcohol consumption.
