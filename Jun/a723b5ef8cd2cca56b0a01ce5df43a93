SPORTS Minister Nathi Mthethwa has given the go-ahead for “contact sport” codes to get back to the training fields during alert Level-3 lockdown, but how long will it take the players to be ready? The Joint Liaison Committee (JLC), made of the PSL and Safa officials, met yesterday to discuss on the compiled report that would make it possible for football to return in the country. More importantly was the health measures in relation to government’s regulations, and what steps would be taken to ensure players and officials are safe from the Covid-19. SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo said they’ll need a maximum of six weeks to get their players back into shape for competition, to conclude the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season. But with time not being on their side and players having being entrusted with exercising from home during lockdown, Tembo said they will have to be flexible and two weeks or less should do to get the engines up and running. He believes this will be a gruelling pre-season resumption training after almost three months without playing competitively. “For us to get where we were, the league has to finish,” said Tembo, whose contract with the club is due to expire at the end of current season. “The league has to resume soon because failure to do that then it will take longer to finish, and it might be in September if we are going to that way.” SuperSport, who captured the MTN8 earlier this campaign, were third on the table with 40 points from 24 matches when the season was suspended due to the virus. The Tshwane giants last played on 8 March when they trounced Highlands Park 2-0 at Makhulong Stadium.
