TALK is cheap and I think it’s high time we take serious action against gender-based violence (GBV). The senseless massacre of women and children is again raising its ugly head and Mzansi does nothing to protect this vulnerable group of our population. Violence against women during the lockdown period has been worse. There’s no assurance the government will do what’s necessary to curb or lessen the scourge of these atrocities. Men need to come to the party as they’re abusing women. How many women should die before drastic measures are taken? Women should walk away from toxic relationships. Women weren’t born to be death rate statistics. Let’s support each other and stop abusing women. Let’s all work to stamp out femicide and GBV in Mzansi. Let’s love and protect women.
