TV PRESENTER Olwethu Leshabane will be hosting the mother of all baby showers for 33 mums-to-be. The former Real Housewives of Johannesburg star said she wanted to help expecting mums in honour of her 30th birthday. She said at the event, the mums would receive prizes worth R10 000. Speaking to Daily Sun, Olwethu said: “I love baby showers, hence the decision to celebrate my birthday by hosting one. “Secondly, I love helping pregnant mummies. I’m a certified doula, (someone trained to give support during birth), which explains my love for pregnant mummies.” Olwethu said the mums were nominated on social media. “I got the names and chose 30 mummies. I had initially planned on hosting the baby shower for 30 women because I’m turning 30, but I added three of my doula clients.” The media personality said she hoped the virtual baby shower would be one of many. “I hope I can do more of these. We want mums to find hope and look at the positives of being a mum, instead of focusing on the stress of giving birth during the coronavirus outbreak.” When asked what the mums should expect from the baby showers, she said: “It will be fun. We will play games. “Basetsana Kumalo, Dr Khanya Khanyile and Vika Shipalana will also share a word or two. “At the end, there will be a grand prize to be won,” she said.
