THE Joint Liaison Committee (JLC) report is expected to shed light on the feasibility of football recommencement. The committee, made up of both the PSL and the Safa members, met yesterday to discuss the report of the Task Team, established by the JLC to look into the possibility of football resumption during the national lockdown, necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. Both PSL chairman Irvin Khoza and Safa president Danny Jordaan were present in the meeting at Safa House, where the JLC studied and adopted a reported of the Task Team. As directed by Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa a few weeks ago, the two honchos will then report to the ministry on the protocols for what they have termed the “Return to Play”, coming up with a single position. According to Safa, the report states that football can only resume under specific conditions as prescribed by the protocol. The football association will also write to the minister, asking permission on training procedures. “The two, Jordaan and Khoza, will also discuss the possible starting dates for the resumption of football matches,” read the statement. The two have also been mandated to meet and brief ministers of health and transport on the requirements to be met, in the event football returned. In his address at the weekend, Mthethwa gave the green light to training, emphasising the fact that playing was not allowed under Level-3 of the government lockdown regulations.
