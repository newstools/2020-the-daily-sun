HE kept singing Master KG’s hit song Jerusalema on Saturday, not knowing he’d be dead the next day. The next evening six-year-old Lukhanyo Gadu was knocked down by a car on the N1 North in Freedom Park, Soweto, after disappearing from the care of his father. His mum Ntomboxolo (31) said she was at work when it happened. “My husband was preparing a room we were supposed to move into next door to where we live. “Our mastand had asked us to move out following an argument with my husband over Lukhanyo. “A lot of people didn’t understand he had autism and saw an unruly kid. “People close to us knew he was a special needs child and kept an eye out for him because he was sneaky. “If they saw him on the street they sent him home. This time no one saw him.” Ntomboxolo said when she came home from work, she didn’t find Lukhanyo in their room. “I went next door to ask my husband where the child was and he said he was in the room watching soccer,” she said. “When I told him he wasn’t there, we immediately started searching and the community helped us.” Ntomboxolo said the principal of Lukhanyo’s creche told them to open a missing persons case. “As we were giving out statements, two Metro cops walked in,” she said. “Later, they came and asked if we knew a little boy who carries a Pirates vuvuzela and showed us his pictures. I told them it’s my baby. “We’re all pained, but I’m happy we gave him love and he had everything he needed. “I don’t really blame anybody. He was borrowed to us and God has taken him back.” Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said a six-year-old boy was knocked over on Sunday by a car on the N1 between the N12 and Golden Highway. He said the accident happened at about 5.10pm when a 28-year-old woman driving a silver Citroen bumped the child. He said a charge of culpable homicide was opened. The driver was not injured but was in shock.
