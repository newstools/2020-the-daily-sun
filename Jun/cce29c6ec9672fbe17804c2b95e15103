FOR the past week, Mzansi has once again been focused on the murder of women. Just a day after Tshegofatso Pule, who was stabbed and hanged while eight months pregnant, was laid to rest, the nation learnt that the stabbed body of Sanelisiwe Mfaba has been found near a bridge in Dobsonville, Soweto. On Sunday, the body of another woman was found in a red sports bag on the Golden Highway, south of Joburg. Her killers are unknown. Yesterday, thousands of people braved the cold and rainy weather to march against the murder of women. The march started at the Roodepoort Police Station and ended in Jabulani, Soweto. Wata Taxi Association spokesman Sibongiseni Ngubane condemned Sanelisiwe’s lover and alleged killer, a member of the association. “Justice must be served and the law must show its might,” he said. Katlego Sedibedi from the Bikers Association said she organised the march after hearing of Sanelisiwe’s murder. “I couldn’t sleep at night. I contacted all my female friends from the biking fraternity to unite. “We want the government to bring back the death sentence, so people can understand what we mean when we say the law must take its course,” she said. MacDonald Sitipe from the E36 BMWs spinners club said there was no way members would not have joined the march. “This weather won’t stop us from fighting for our mothers, sisters and children. “Femicide must stop! Our women must be protected. “They must feel safe around us. This is not a man’s world. Our women must trust us,” said MacDonald.
