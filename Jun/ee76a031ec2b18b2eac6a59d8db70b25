VICTOR Vena lived a good life with his father and stepmum but in 2006, things changed when his dad died. In 2011, Victor’s stepmum chased him away, sold the house and disappeared. He then slept at friends and neighbours’ houses, but said they got tired of it. He ended up living in a container next to a dumpsite. The 23-year-old from Nellmapius in Tshwane said the dumpsite has been his home for the past five years. “I don’t have a choice. I often eat leftovers.” Victor collects and sells recycling materials to make a living. “I sometimes feel my father Emmanuel Ndimande died too soon. I know he’d not have left me in this situation if he was still alive. I forgave my stepmum for what she did. “This allows me to live in peace. My life is now in my hands and God has plans for me. One day I will leave this place and tell my story,” he said. Victor needed help to get back to his father’s house or a chance to start a new life. He said his mum Buyelwa Vena from the Eastern Cape left him when he was six. “It’d be nice if she can help me fight for the house.” His dad’s friend Samuel Molokomme (58) said Emmanuel occupied the house in 1999. “I became worried when Victor was not aware of the sale of the house. His stepmum secretly sold it.” The SunTeam contacted social development about Victor’s situation and were referred to human settlements. The department said it would look into the matter and respond in due course.
