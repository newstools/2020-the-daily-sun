TWINS First Born and Last Born Ngoveni (21) can’t get IDs. The siblings from Makoxa B9 near Giyani in Limpopo said Home Affairs listed them as dead. Their dad Xivanganyama said he had spent a lot of money trying to get them IDs, but with no luck. Last Born said: “Our brother has an ID and gets jobs, but for us, it’s not possible. VOETSEK! I'M NOT DEAD! “We can’t find work because we don’t have IDs. We can’t even go to university.” Xivanganyama said he was confused as the twins used to get child grants. “How is it possible that they got child grants, but when they apply for IDs, we are told they are dead. Something does not add up at Home Affairs,” he said. “At first, I was told to pay for their IDs by some officials. This shocked me because first-time applicants don’t pay.” The brothers visited all Home Affairs offices near their place, but always heard the same thing. “We have given up on getting IDs. Visiting these Home Affairs offices is not helping,” said First Born. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the department was working to resolve all such cases. “I have taken the responsibility of making sure their matter is speedily resolved and they get IDs.”
