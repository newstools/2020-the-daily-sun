WORRIED Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) players have convened a meeting with club management this week to get clarity on their future with the club being sold for R10 million to unknown investors. The GladAfrica Championship side owner, Masala Mulaudzi, announced last week that he has sold the Limpopo outfit despite the team being in a good position to fight for a promotional play-offs spot. Mulaudzi revealed in a radio interview that he is close to concluding a deal to buy an Absa Premiership club, where he’s already paid R20m as deposit. And the club in question is strongly rumoured to be Bidvest Wits. “This is not the kind of a phase that you would want to go through as a player,” said Tshakhuma captain Carlington Nyadombo. “It’s difficult for everyone in the team. At least we will have a meeting with management this week, and we are looking forward to it. We hope to get everything in detail because we’re just hearing all sorts of stories in the media.” Added the former AmaZulu and Polokwane City player: “But as a player there is nothing much we can do when the club is sold. “We just hope that everything will go well for us next season, concerning our future.” The 34-year-old veteran said all they want to focus on is to help Tshakhuma end the season in the promotional play-offs spot. The Venda-based side are fourth on the log with 38 points, with six matches left to end the season that has been suspended and delayed by the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. They are three points behind second-placed Moroka Swallows. “Anything is possible when you are playing in the promotional play-offs,” said the former Zimbabwean international. “Our aim is to end the season on a high and not focus on these side issues.”
