ABSENCE makes the heart grow fonder for what is being missed and the Stormers’ Springbok prop Steven Kitshoff believes that will spur local players to be prepared to make sacrifices, if it means they can get onto the field to play the game they love. Rugby restarts with the Aotearoa competition in New Zealand and Kitshoff, like many rugby people the world over, is just so pleased to be in a position to watch live games again after an absence that dates back to mid-March – a period of eight months. However, Kitshoff is not under any illusions that South Africa is anywhere near where the New Zealanders are when it comes to getting rugby back. While the Kiwis restart this week, the South African players will only return to team training next week or even the week after that. Rugby is mooted to restart in South Africa in August, possibly later in August, which would mean two months after the Kiwis make their return. That is one of the reason why it is hard to see any kind of competition in which the 2015 World Cup champions and the most recent winners of the global prize play each other taking place any time soon. Although SA Rugby chief executive Jurie Roux did confirm earlier in the week that the Rugby Championship played in a “bio-bubble”, meaning the teams base themselves in one centre and play at one venue for the duration of the tournament, was possible, once he expanded on that it didn’t seem he was too confident. – Supersport.com.
