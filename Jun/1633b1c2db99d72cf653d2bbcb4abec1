AS the winter cold creeps in, many people looking for ways
to keep themselves warm. A popular but also dangerous way to do keep warm this using imbawula . Sadly many have lost up their lives and this freezing weekend was one such tragic weekend. Cops  are now warning
families to be very cautious when using imbawula (braziers) as a source of
heat. Five people suffocated to death and two survived after using
imbawula since Friday. One sad case is where the mother lost three kids in Duduza
after they inhaled toxic fumes. Sergeant Media Khoza said the parents of the siblings aged
33, 16 and 10 went to Limpopo. "This morning  they tried to contact them but their phones
were not answered and that's when they send a family member who made gruesome discovery. "He knocked several times but they were no answers and
he broke window to gain entry," said Sergeant Khoza. Their other sibling believed to be 13, was still alive and
was taken to hospital where he's recovering. On Saturday, in Tsakane east of Joburg, a 28 year -old male suffocated to
death but his girlfriend survived. The man is believed to have died from smoking toxic fumes as
well. In Nigel a security guard believed to be in his 30's was
found dead by a colleague in the guard room on Friday, its alleged that his
colleague found the room full of smoke and 
next to him was imbawula. "We are pleading and warning people to be extra
cautious of putting imbawula inside their houses while all doors and windows
are closed," said Sergeant Khoza. Inquest cases are opened.
