Many of us want change. “I believe when black people tell our own stories, we can shift the axis of the world and tell our real history of generational wealth and richness of soul not told in our history books. “With this album, I wanted to present elements of black history and African tradition with a modern twist and a universal message and what it means to find self-identity and build a legacy.” The Mzansi actors said they weren’t allowed to speak about the album. Mzansi Magic publicist Lucky Mangela said Connie could only comment once it was released, while Nyaniso’s management said he has signed a non-disclosure agreement.
