Liverpool will resume their quest for a first top-flight title in 30 years against city rivals Everton on 21 June, as the Premier League released its revised fixture list for the first three weeks of the restarted season on Friday. Football in England has been suspended since mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but clubs have voted to restart the season on 17 June when second-placed Manchester City host Arsenal and Sheffield United visit relegation-threatened Aston Villa. Liverpool are 25 points clear at the top and are two victories away from winning the Premier League, but will have a shot at securing the title by beating Everton if City lose to Arsenal. Other potential dates in the first three fixtures when Liverpool could clinch the title are 24 June, when they host Crystal Palace, and 2 July, when they face Manchester City. The venues for Liverpool's games against Everton and City are yet to be confirmed. Tottenham Hotspur, who are currently eighth, host fifth-placed Manchester United on 19 June, while third-placed Leicester City travel to Watford on Saturday, 20 June. Arsenal are back in action on the same Saturday with a trip to Brighton and Hove Albion, while Villa play again on Sunday, 21 June when they host fourth-placed Chelsea. City play again on Monday, 22 June when they host mid-table Burnley. All the matches will be broadcast live on SuperSport but take place without fans present. -REUTERS
