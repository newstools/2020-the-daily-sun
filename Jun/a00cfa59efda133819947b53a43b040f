WHEN Castro Wambir lost his car, he consulted sangoma Nzama Maluleke from Meadowlands in Soweto. Nzama tracked Castro’s car using the traditional way and in no time, his Nissan Sentra was found. “We found it in Lenasia,” said Castro (40) from Orlando West in Soweto. “I had pimped it nicely and when I found it, the rims were stripped and the sound system was gone. I was happy to have found it quickly.” Castro said it took Nzama three days to find the car. “After he did his things, we got a call from people saying they saw it in Lenasia.  The father of two said it was stolen outside his friend’s place on 23 May. Gift Thembeni (50) said he lost his Toyota Fortuner during the Easter holidays. “They stole it at a parking lot,” he said. Luckily for Gift, he had put a traditional tracker on the car. He said his car was found in just one day because the tracker was already installed. “I fear nothing with my car. I can leave it unlocked the whole night knowing exactly that if you touch it, you will regret that decision,” said Gift. Nzama said tracking a lost car required an experienced traditional healer. “I’ve been a sangoma for more than three decades. The ancestors have taught me almost everything.”  He said it took three to seven days to find a car without his traditional tracker. “If it has the traditional tracker, a day is enough.” He said if he installed his tracker in the car, the person who stole it wouldn’t find peace until he abandoned the vehicle. Sangoma Mtungwa Khumalo from Meadowlands agreed about traditional trackers. “I also helped people find cars.” Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya knew about the traditional tracker. “It’s about time people stop undermining our traditional ways of helping people. They work. Cops and traditional healers can work hand in hand,” he said.
