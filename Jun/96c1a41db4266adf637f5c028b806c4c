THOUGH not convincing to the question posed of Bidvest Wits being sold to Masala Mulaudzi of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), the Clever Boys chairman Alan Fainman denies that the Milpark club have been sold. He, however, confirmed that there has been a lot of interested parties in buying the club which is based at Wits University, with the latest being on Monday when Fainman confirmed to having been approached by another interested buyer. He was also not clear whether Wits are in the market or it’s just pure speculation that Mulaudzi has already changed money with them as part of a deposit to buy the team. Mulaudzi told an SABC radio station at the weekend that he has sold his GladAfrica Championship club, TTM, for R10 million and made a deposit of R20m for a PSL club, which he did not reveal. But multiple SunSport informants say Masala is closer to concluding his transaction with Wits. “Look, numerous clubs in the PSL are speculated to be for sale – Highlands (Park), Bloemfontein Celtic and many others,” said Fainman yesterday. “We cannot really comment on speculation. We would certainly not allow ourselves to be drawn into that. Clearly there are processes to be followed before the club could be sold – our partners, the board and the PSL must approve. “We’ve had a couple of approaches from different people, but nothing has come about. What I can tell you, Wits are not sold. There is just a feeding frenzy.” Mulaudzi opted not to be engaged on the Wits matter: “I am not going to entertain this thing. I have nothing to do with Wits. My team are TTM, which I have just sold. I am asking you to release me from such a thing.” One of our informants has brought about the name of ambitious businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize to the picture. “Mam’Mkhize is also involved in this matter and is believed to have been the one who has given financial guarantees on this (supposed) sale,” our source said.
