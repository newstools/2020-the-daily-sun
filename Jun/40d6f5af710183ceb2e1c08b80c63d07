Dear MizzB MY girlfriend of four years has disappeared. I’m not coping. She’s changed her numbers and her family says she moved to KZN with another man.  I love and miss her so much. Hey Brother Losing someone you love is always heartbreaking, especially if you didn’t see any signs that such might happen. Your partner disappearing on you is frustrating as it leaves you with a lot of questions. Don’t blame yourself. As much as it’s difficult to live without someone you love, accepting she’s moved on will help ease your frustrations.
