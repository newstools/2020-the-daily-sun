EFF LEADER Julius Malema says President Cyril Ramaphosa will be held personally liable for the loss of lives as a result of the coronavirus because he recklessly reopened the economy. Speaking at a virtual Youth Day rally, Malema called for the reinstatement of the ban on alcohol, saying the protection of life must be valued over the desire for profit. “We have warned Ramaphosa, who has constituted himself as an ally of white-monopoly capital and the coronavirus, that he will be held personally responsible for the loss of life that is going to happen as a result of his decisions.” The EFF commander-in-chief reiterated their opposition to the reopening of schools and of the economy, as Covid-19 cases increase in the country. “We want to warn Ramaphosa and all his accomplices the mass deaths we are to witness over the coming weeks are due to his lack of decisiveness at a time when the country needed leadership.” Malema said the decision to reopen alcohol sales under level three of lockdown was reckless, as it burdened an already overwhelmed healthcare sector. “To make matters worse, the president of the country has allowed the sale of alcohol in a country that has a history of high fatalities and hospitalisation due to alcohol-related inter-personal violence,” Malema said. As of Monday, there were 3 495 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the total infections to 73 533. A total of 1 568 people have died due to Covid-19 complications. During Malema’s lengthy address, he attacked Ramaphosa, insulting his struggle credentials. He went as far as calling him an apartheid collaborator, saying that while the youth of 1976 were protesting, Ramaphosa was wining and dining with white monopoly capital. “We have to save South Africans from apartheid collaborators,” Malema said. He also slammed the brutal incidents of femicide in South Africa.
