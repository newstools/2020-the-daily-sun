DESPITE Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila being sold, interim coach Lucky Nelukau says that their aim is to get a playoff spot and fight for promotion to the top flight. Limpopo businessman Masala Mulaudzi sold the GladAfrica Championship side for R10 million and the new owner will take over the club at the end of this season. Vhadau Vha Damani are currently 4th on the log with 38 points with six matches remaining to end the season. Tshakhuma are 10 points behind leaders Ajax Cape Town. They are also eight points behind the play-off bracket. “We know that the club has been sold but as a team we have to do our job on the field,” said Nelukau, who has been in charge of the team since their head coach Vladislav Heric was placed on special leave in March. “I am a young coach with a dream. I have been given a chance to coach a professional team and it will be a huge achievement to help the team gain promotion. “As for the players, this is their chance to give their all to impress the new owners and to be part of the new PSL team next season. “My future and that of the players are in our own hands. We have to qualify for playoffs and fight to help this team team gain promotion for our CVs too.” Added Nelukau: “Whatever is happening in the office is management issues and its beyond our control. “We have to focus on what we have been hired to do which is to play football and enjoy it.” Mulaudzi has made it clear that not all players from the current will be part of Tshakhuma next season. That means some will have to look for new employment next season. But Nelukau is likely to be part of the new team as he is one of the trusted members of Tshakhuma. Tshakhuma’ remaining matches are against Jomo Cosmos, Ajax, Free State Stars, TS Sporting, Uthongathi and Moroka Swallows.
