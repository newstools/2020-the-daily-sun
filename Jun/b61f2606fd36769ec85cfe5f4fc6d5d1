AFTER sitting at home for almost a week, nurses at KwaMashu Community Health Centre went back to work. The nurses from the clinic in the north of Durban downed tools last Thursday. This was after several nurses were infected with the coronavirus. They told patients to go to other clinics such as Ntuzuma and B section. They wanted to be tested and for the clinic to be fumigated. One of the nurses told Daily Sun that about 19 nurses tested positive. The nurse said they were told that they could now go back to work. “But we’re still afraid. We were not given enough PPEs to work at the clinic. Too many sick patients come and we have to assist them,” said the nurse. Another nurse said they were left with no choice but to go back because they feared losing their jobs. “If we continue sitting at home we’re at risk of losing our jobs,” said the nurse. Meanwhile, patients that go to Qadi Clinic in Mzinyathi, north of Durban, said they now feared using this clinic after one nurse tested positive for Covid-19. A patient said she heard when she was at the clinic on Monday that there’s a nurse who tested positive. “I was there to get my chronic medication when I heard about this case. It scared me because everything was going as normal. There was no social distancing,” said the patient. Another patient said the clinic should be closed and fumigated,
