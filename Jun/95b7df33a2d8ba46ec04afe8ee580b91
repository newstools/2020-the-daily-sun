WITH President Cyril Ramaphosa having given the go-ahead for contact sport to return to training under strict regulations, AmaZulu midfielder Siphelele Magubane has taken that as a glimmer of hope. The Usuthu star has been itching to kick the ball again, and now remains optimistic that they will soon see action. Magubane was last involved in a competitive match on 7 March when his side AmaZulu stunned Absa Premiership log leaders Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 at FNB Stadium. “I miss football,” said the 27-year-old Magubane. “Everybody misses football, but we all have to respect the regulations until it’s safe enough to play again.  Honestly speaking, it has not been easy because we had to put everything on hold, including being unable to see my daughter for such a long time.” When the league resumes under alert Level-1, a recommendation by the SA Football Association (Safa), AmaZulu have a mountain to climb as they will be trying to avoid the relegation axe. They are among relegation candidates occupying position 15th on the log.
