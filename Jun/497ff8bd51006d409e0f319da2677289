African Ministers Independent Church members in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, prayed for Covid-19 victims and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zolani Ndenge said they lit candles for those who’d died and those who’re still fighting for their lives. “We’re praying for all of them including our president because it’s a difficult time for him. We’re asking God to intervene,” he said. Bishop Welile Solomon said it’s time to be united and ask God for forgiveness. “We’re happy that our president has allowed churches to be opened, but we won’t go to church yet because it’s not safe. We’ll continue praying for this disease to end,” said the bishop. Reverend Mzukisi Mbili said: “We were supposed to be given time before alcohol was allowed under level 3. When our government wants advice on how to deal with crime they come to us. Why didn’t they do that before deciding for the return of alcohol?” said the reverend. He said they’ll continue praying for the country and everyone who’s affected by the virus. President of the organisation, Bishop Sizwe Nyolobe, said it was important to come and pray under strict rules. “We’re all wearing masks because we don’t want to add to the number of people affected by the virus. We’re following the rules.” He told Daily Sun they won’t open their churches but will continue to use social networks to pray. “God will hear us even if we pray in our homes. We can’t risk the lives of our members,” he said.
