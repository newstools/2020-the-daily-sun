TSAKANE Chauke (40) regrets living next to the bridge, because people use it as a dumpsite. “Soon there won’t be any bridge. “It will be just rubbish,” said Tsakane from Letsokoane Village outside Polokwane, Limpopo. He feared for the health of his four kids and wife. Tsakane told Daily Sun villagers dump rubbish such as used nappies and sanitary pads at the bridge. “Some people even dump dead domestic animals. The terrible smell comes into my home and it’s unbearable. “I’m afraid that my family or others might get sick because of this dump.” Tsakane said villagers started dumping rubbish at the bridge after it was built in 2014. He said the trench dug to channel rainwater to the bridge has also been filled with rubbish. “Some villagers burn rubbish, but it is not enough. Some of it doesn’t burn easily.” He has spoken to villagers during community meetings to find a solution, but nothing has changed. “The bridge is piling up and it becomes a problem when it rains because the water can’t get through.” Tsakane was calling on Polokwane Municipality to either identify a spot where people could dump or to place their bins around the village. Villager Matome Maemo (33) said there was no other spot where villagers could dump their rubbish. “The municipality must come up with a solution.” Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said they would clean the area and implement litter picking with the Expanded Public Works Programme. “The area will also be added to our rural weekly collection,” he said.
