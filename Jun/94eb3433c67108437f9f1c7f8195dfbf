SOCCER star Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala celebrated the 10th anniversary of the 2010 Fifa World Cup yesterday with Mogale City residents. The Siphiwe Tshabalala and Bokang Montjane foundations partnered with the Mogale City Municipality to donate food with 55 sets of food hampers, blankets and books titled Super Shabba Siphiwe Tshabalala to families in need. The event took place in Muldersdrift, west of Jozi. Tshabalala and his wife, former Miss SA Bokang, said they chose to donate the 55 sets of items because Tshabalala scored the opening goal of the event in the 55th minute. “I’m so grateful to have partnered with Mogale City in celebrating the 10th-anniversary of the 2010 Fifa World Cup,” said Shabba. “Together with Bokang we saw the need to extend a hand of goodwill in assisting those in need during this difficult time of Covid-19.” Shabba said the foundations would work with the municipality to uplift and change the lives of the city for the better. “We want to say thanks to the people of Mogale City and the entire world for being supportive in my career. What I’m doing today is one way of saying thank you.” Mayor Francis Makgatho said: “I’m so humbled that Siphiwe and Bokang honoured their promises and came back to donate goodies to the residents of plot 89. “We’ve worked with Siphiwe on other community-related projects and today the community is blessed that they will be receiving goodies from him and his wife.”
