Maritzburg United and defender Siyanda Xulu have officially parted ways, the club have confirmed. This after the two parties failed to reach an agreement on a deal that would at least have seen the former Kaizer Chiefs man finish the current season with the Team of Choice. "The club can confirm that we have parted ways with defender Siyanda Xulu," the club said on their official Twitter account. "Thank you for 3 amazing years of solid performances and leadership both on and off the field. We wish you all the best in your future endeavours." The player also confirmed his departure earlier with a tweet that read: "Amazing journey it was. Thank You." Xuluâ€™s contract with the KwaZulu Natal outfit was set to expire on Tuesday with Maritzburg keen on holding on to him for the remainder of the season, however, an agreement could not be reached in that regard. The former FC Rostov defender is now free to join a team of his choice ahead of the 2020-21 season with clubs like Orlando Pirates, SuperSport United and his former clubs Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns linked with him.
