“SEE, in the military, sometimes you shoot all your targets, other times you don’t.” These were the words of Baroka FC striker Richard Mbulu, when asked if is he felt any pressure with the fact that he’s yet to score a goal since his arrival in Mzansi. The Malawian international joined Baroka on a three-year deal in July last year from CD Costa do Sol, and is about to finish the campaign without a single shot on target. The 26-year-old trained soldier from The Warm Heart of Africa admitted he has not achieved his primary job as a striker. “But soldiers never give in,” he said. “I might be facing a dry spell at the moment, but I won’t give up. At training matches, I do score goals. I believe it’s just a matter of time before I open my PSL account.” Mbulu was part of the Malawi squad that played in the Cosafa Cup at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban last year. As a soldier, Mbulu has made it clear that when he decides to quit football he will go back to pursue his military career. “After finishing school, I joined the military. I’m a soldier, together with my father, but I decided to focus on my football career,” he explained. “Now I’m on unpaid leave. I still report to the military when I’m home.” As much as he is a soldier, the player said he has never felt any fondness for war. The soft-spoken player has played in Malawi, Mozambique and in Portugal, where he spent six months on loan with Associação Desportiva Sanjoanense. He has not been in action for three months now due to the coronavirus-enforced break. Mbulu said staying home and doing nothing for this long has been frustrating, but he remains hopeful that they will return to the field. “We understand the pandemic we’re facing. Life is more important than playing football, but I hope things will go back to normal soon. “My first season has been tough, but I will get better with time and start scoring goals for the club.”
