Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has shared his sentiments with South Africans as the nation commemorates Youth Day. “The Soweto uprising is one day where we get reminded of where we come from as a nation,” said Motaung, as quoted on the Kaizer Chiefs website. “We must use this occasion to gain inspiration and courage to fight against all forms of oppression. The class of 1976 was resolute and demanded change, and that change came at a huge cost, loss of lives. We do not want to go back to using the same methods to fight the system. Let us organise, mobilise and campaign against laws that seek to condone oppression. The use of voting for the leaders that will change the world is one form of bringing reform. “I want to take this opportunity to salute the young people,” says Motaung, “I am intrigued by their energy and will to change the world. I observe around the world the young people are leading the protests and making their voices heard. This is the spirit that we must support as part of the resolution to bring change.” Motaung, who made a name for himself and built the brand that is Kaizer Chiefs amid apartheid turmoil in 1970, is no stranger to the black struggle. “The struggle continues,” added  Motaung. “it is sad to see the protests spiralling into acts of looting and vandalism. While I call on sanity to prevail under dire circumstances, I do however understand that this act of looting is prompted by the desperation and lack of compassionate leadership. All that is required now is leadership to act and walk the talk of transforming the world and not retaliate with force as we are witnessing in some peaceful demonstrations.”
