IT seems the tension in the AbaThembu kingdom is growing. In the latest incident, AbaThembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo's spokesperson Babalo Papu was rushed to hospital after he was attacked by a group of people. And he is currently in critical but stable condition in Nelson Mandela Hospital. Papu issued a letter which read: "Bathembu and friends. I am in good shape; I cannot go into details or merits of this matter as advised by my legal counsel. "I can only confirm that I was brutally attacked. This is all I can say. Thank you very much nge calls, SMS, WhatsApp, it shows that I am not alone. Thank you." Papu's attack came a day after Buyelekhaya and his son acting king Azenathi Dalindyebo appeared in the Mthatha Magistrate'ss Court on Monday for assault and eviction, but both cases were postponed to 30 June and 7 December. The first attack was on 13 March when Buyelekhaya allegedly stormed into Bumbane Great Place to attack his son Azenathi. It is not clear whether Papu's attack was a revenge attack.
