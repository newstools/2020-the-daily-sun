SUNLANDERS have been urged to beware of coronavirus scammers. According to the Gauteng health department, fraudsters have been targeting personal protective equipment suppliers. Department spokeswoman Kwara Kekana urged suppliers to be careful of criminals pretending to be department officials. She said there had been an increase in people approaching suppliers to submit invoices for payment, supposedly from the department. The scammers then steal equipment and the supplier never gets paid. “The scammers use the department’s name and corporate colours to deceive unsuspecting victims who engage these individuals, believing they are dealing with the department.” Kekana said some suppliers were careful and had seen through the scam, which they brought to the attention of the authorities. “Unfortunately, others have fallen victim and lost money. We caution suppliers to verify the authenticity of a request for an invoice before engaging with any individual or organisation that claims to represent the department,” she said. “We advise companies to ensure they have an official and confirmed purchase order before they deliver any goods.” She said most of the scams used incorrect contact details and email addresses. She said it should be noted that quotations were only for items below R500 000. Items above that amount were advertised with all suppliers being given 21 days to bid. Kekana said the department would not be held accountable for any actions resulting in companies falling victim to a scam. The department said anyone who suspects fraud should contact the Vuvuzela hotline on 012 664 5568 or email office@thehotline.co.za.
