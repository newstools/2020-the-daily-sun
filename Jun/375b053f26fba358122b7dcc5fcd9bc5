IDOLS SA is one of Mzansi’s most loved and watched music shows. But just like all other events that have been affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus, the show won’t happen this year. According to insiders at the talent search competition, disagreements between Idols SA producers andM-Net have resulted in the failure to select those who made it to the top 16. “The auditions were done and the top 16 should have been selected by now, like every year. “But this year, it’s not clear what is going on. All we have seen were back-to-back meetings. “I feel for those who went for auditions. I believe they want to know if they had made it to top 16. “Remember, most talented people depend on this competition for their dreams to come true,” said the insider. Under normal circumstances, Mzansi would have by now known the contestants who’ve made it to top 16. Another insider told the SunTeam the competition is experiencing hiccups. “There had been numerous meetings between the producers and M-Net. “By the looks of things, Idols SA won’t be continued this year,” said the insider. It’s alleged the coronavirus outbreak compounded the problems. “Producers are failing to come up with ways to work around this outbreak. I mean, lockdown regulations contribute to the competition not aired because the crew involved is failing to come up with a strategy. “It might be easier for other shows to continue working under around this critical time, but not for a music competition show. “They use the same microphones and that could put them at the risk of infection,” said the mole. Idols SA PR manager Irvin Pooe promised to respond to our inquiry on Friday but hadn’t done so at the time of going to print.
