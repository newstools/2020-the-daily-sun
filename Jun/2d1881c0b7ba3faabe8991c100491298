After the Western Cape High Court dismissed an application by the hairdressing industry to be allowed to operate during alert Level 3 of the lockdown, the DA has picked up the battle and is threatening to take the government to court over the same matter. The DA announced, in a statement by its trade and industry spokesman Dean McPherson on Tuesday, that it would go to the courts regarding the ban on hairdressing.  The party has written a legal letter to Dlamini-Zuma over what it termed as the "irrational, arbitrary and unlawful" continued ban on the personal care services industry. Evidence The letter, by Minde Schapiro and Smith attorneys, complains that the government has not provided any evidence to support its stance.  It requests the minister to explain which cabinet member was responsible for issuing the directions in terms of Item 7 in Table 2 of the amended disaster management regulations, which speaks to the continued ban of hairdressing, beauty treatments, makeup and nails salons [sic] and piercing and tattoo parlours.    Engaging The government said it was still engaging as to how some of the affected industries, including tourism, could be reopened with safety protocols in place. "Our litigation will especially be for the sake of the single mothers and the young entrepreneurs, who have no other source of income than the personal care services they provide, often from their homes and other low rent venues," said McPherson.  McPherson slammed the government for not attempting to halt the expected job losses.    He said hairdressers were able to adopt physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the disease among employees and clients. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/lockdown-da-takes-up-fight-for-hairdressers-and-salons-20200602
