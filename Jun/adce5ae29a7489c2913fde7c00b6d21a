 According to sources, the said cop received a call this morning (12/6) informing that he tested positive.They allege the said cop even told them that the results came out positive.The said cop had since been taken to be quarantined somewhere.But his colleagues are worried because the management of the police station is sweeping this under the carpet.They say they have been interacting with him the whole of this week and has been coughing and has a runny nose.They are worried because nothing is being said about them being tested and the police station continue to operate as normal and are serving people. Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed that a sergeant received his results today while standing parade with other cops.'He informed the relief commander who then sent him home. The other members were also sent home for quarantine. The station will be decontaminated today. The charge office will operate from a hall next to the station."
