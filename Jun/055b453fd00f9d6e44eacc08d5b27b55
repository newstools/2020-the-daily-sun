GOVERNMENT must take quick action against gender-based violence. This is the call from gospel star Fikile Mlomo, who said she was lucky to be alive after the abuse she experienced in her previous relationships. “Seeing women being violated and killed in Mzansi sparks fear in me. I ask myself how I survived. I’m scared,” said Fikile. The Phendula singer previously revealed that her former boyfriend abused her, leading to the loss of her four-month-old baby. “I got into a relationship with an older guy when I was 15,” she said. “He beat me up for no reason when he was drunk. “I felt I couldn’t act against him because I loved him and he provided.  Last year she revealed that her former fiance was abusing her emotionally. She said she wanted government to act in favour of abused women. “We live in fear. We must not blame a woman if she doesn’t report the abuse,” said Fikile.  “She may be scared that if the law fails her, the abuser will kill her. “I’m glad that I always found the courage to walk away in the end.” Fikile said she’s scared of relationships because of her previous experiences.
