CONCERN abounds in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality as Covid-19 cases in Uitenhage and KwaNobuhle increase. While Motherwell has been the epicentre for Covid-19 in the area, Uitenhage and KwaNobuhle’s rising numbers are a major concern. By Monday, 547 people in Motherwell had tested positive, while Uitenhage and KwaNobuhle recorded 306 and 266 confirmed cases respectively. This means the two areas have recorded 572 cases. Covid-19 Disaster Management Forum chairman Shane Brown said: “We have a newly developed hot spot in Uitenhage and KwaNobuhle. We must not ignore what is happening. Cases have increased everywhere. “Private hospital beds are currently full. The provincial hospitals do have some capacity but they are also filling up: that is in Livingston, Dora Nginza and Uitenhage provincial hospitals,” he said. “Fortunately, we have the new VW-sponsored field hospital which will open on 1 July and will assist hugely with the rising numbers. The VW field hospital came at the right time.” Sponsored by Volkswagen and the German government, the Reverend Doctor Elizabeth Mamisa Chabula-Nxiweni Field Hospital was handed over on Tuesday. Brown urged residents to continue adhering to the health department’ safety measures as there was still no vaccine for the virus. “The Department of health is very clear that people must wash their hands regularly, wear face masks when in public and keep social distancing. We urge residents to only go out when there’ a need,” Brown said. At least three Nelson Mandela Bay members of the mayoral committee have tested positive for Covid-19. The three councillors are Yolisa Pali (public health), Lehlohonolo Mfana (sport, recreation, arts and culture) and Itumeleng Ranyele (constituency services). Meanwhile, Nelson Mandela Development Agency spokesman Luvuyo Bangazi said the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium has provided isolation and quarantine facilities to 476 people, with 162 people currently in the facility.
