IN an unusual turn of events, cops had to be called on other cops outside the council chambers in Germiston, Ekurhuleni yesterday. This as Ekurhuleni Metro police officers descended on the council chambers to hand over their memorandum of grievances at the mayor’s office. But they were greeted by public order policing unit members. Although a helicopter was sent to the area, there wasn’t any chaos, but only singing and dancing. In their memorandum, the cops raised concerns including excessive allowances paid to officers in the VIP division. Officer Nkosana Gould said the 60 VIP officers who were employed at the start of lockdown were getting a salary of R444 468 per annum. He claimed that they also got a 10% discretionary benefit calculated based on the total annual salary. The EMPD officers were apparently told that the VIP officers’ salary and allowance came because of the risk associated with their duties. But they disputed that, saying they all risked their lives and should be paid equally. Another cop, Dominique Phala, called for the city to probe the excessive allowance paid to the VIP officers. He said they only knew of house, car and bicycle allowance. Phala said senior officers should be suspended for allegedly removing the EMPD chief from a scene of an accident before he could be subjected to a breathalyser test. Community Safety MMC Frans Mooko accepted the memorandum, He said they would look into the allegations. On the excessive salaries, he said: “I’ve introduced myself to say I’m from community safety, not HR.” He said HR would help to address the issues raised in the memorandum.
