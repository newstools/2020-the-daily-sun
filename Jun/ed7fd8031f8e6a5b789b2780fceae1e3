   The Krugersdorp SAPS spokesman, captain Raymond Sebonyane said it is alledged that four unknown males fired shots at the entrance while entering the house. "One of the occupants in the house retaliated by firing shots to the suspects," said Sebonyane. He further stated that suspects flee the scene with a Samsung laptop driving a White Suzuki Shift with registration number HF 53 FG GP and White VW Golf with unknown registration number.     The pair was arrested immediately and they are expected to appear before the Krugersdorp Magistrate court soon. "Investigations continues, two other suspects are still at large. Police are therefore making an clarion call to the entire public to refrain from creating market for stolen goods. The buying and storing of stolen properties constitutes a crime punishable by law," said Sebonyane.
