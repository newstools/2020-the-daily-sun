Kenya’s finest Afro pop band Sauti Sol has released its latest album Midnight Train.The album features Sho Madjozi, Black Motion, Soweto Gospel Choir and India Arie among other talented musicians. The band had nothing but praise for South African Grammy winners Soweto Gospel Choir’s extreme professionalism. “We have been fans of Soweto Gospel Choir for a very long time, and we have always wanted to work with them. So when the opportunity presented itself when we were in Joburg, we jumped on it very fast. They were so gracious. “We worked together in harmony. They are beautiful people and they were extremely professional. “They took the song to the next level. We are just so glad we had the presence of the mighty Soweto Gospel Choir on that particular song,” said the band’s vocalist and songwriter, Bien-Aime. He told SunBuzz the album was inspired by real life experiences. “We have written about insecurities, addiction and depression. These are things that are either happening to us or our loved ones,” he said. Bien-Aime also shared the meaning behind the title of the album. “Midnight Train is either the last train or the first train. It’s the late nights, it’s the early flights. It’s the grind that has brought Sauti Sol to where we are. “We believe the grace that brought us here is the same grace we need to continue. So it’s a steady grind and a steady rocking of the midnight train,” said Bien-Aime. Sauti Sol’s producer and guitarist, Polycarp, hopes that people will listen and connect with the message in the music because it is from their hearts. “My grandma used to say that when you sing from the heart, it goes to the heart. These songs are very personal to us. I hope that all of them will touch the fans. I am urging the fans to come with an open mind and an open heart,” said Polycarp. Sauti Sol released the album during the Covid-19 period because people are going through a lot and need this music as part of their therapy.
