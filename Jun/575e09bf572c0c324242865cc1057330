PARENTS and guardians should empower their children with enough information to respond to any crisis or act of criminality during the lockdown. Hardly a day goes by without Mzansi reading or hearing about some violent act or tragedy involving children in the community. Our children are exposed to violence at homes and in the neighbourhoods. So, it’s our responsibility, as parents, to educate children about safety and give them the necessary tools to deal with a crisis. Teach your child skills to help them reduce the risk of becoming victims of crime. Know where your kids are, where they’re going and who they’re with. Emphasise and build on your children’s strengths. Help your children practice personal safety skills.
