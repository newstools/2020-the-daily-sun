Baroka FC have penned a new two-year contract extension for defender Ethen Sampson, the club confirmed on Friday. The 26-year-old joined the club in January and has already impressed enough to win a new deal. He has made seven appearances so far, including two in the Nedbank Cup, where Baroka will face Bloemfontein Celtic in the semifinals this season. Sampson is a right-back who can also play more centrally, and hails from the same ASD Academy that developed the likes of Ayanda Patosi and Ebrahim Seedat. He had spells in Canada and the USA with Vancouver Whitecaps and New Mexico United respectively, and also previously played for Ubuntu Cape Town. The Limpopo side also recently announced new contracts for winger Tshediso Patjie and defender Ananias Gebhardt. 2 year contract extension for Ethen Sampson @BarokaFC #LENNAKEMOROKA #BAROKAFC #GLOBAOILSA pic.twitter.com/LEQeZKKvHb
