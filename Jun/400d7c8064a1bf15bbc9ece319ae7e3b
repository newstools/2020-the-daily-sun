POLICE continue to ensure people comply with lockdown rules of social distancing and the wearing of masks. Home Affairs officials, cops, soldiers and the Metro police had an operation in Soshanguve, Tshwane, on Saturday. They were led by Gauteng police commissioner LieutenantGeneral Elias Mawela and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko. “Soshanguve is also problematic in terms of crimes such as robbery, house robbery and hijackings,” said Mawela. “We arrested a man who was dealing in nyaope while pretending to be selling vegetables.” He said they positively identified two stolen vehicles and also bust people transporting liquor. “A man was in possession of alcohol, and was also trying to hide alcohol under the spare wheel.” He said Home Affairs officials arrested undocumented people. Mawela said they will appear in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court with other suspects, where the order will be issued to repatriate them to their home countries. Mazibuko said Soshanguve was a hot spot of Covid-19, and people in the area were not respecting lockdown regulations. “We were also educating people about the dangers of the virus.” She said people must continue practising social distancing and making it fashionable to wear masks. “Covid-19 does not move on its own. It is moved by people.” Mazibuko was worried about Soshanguve as people in the area had died from the virus. She said testing and screening would continue. Mazibuko said cars were stolen elsewhere and then brought to the kasi. He was also charged for being in possession of a car which was reported stolen 10 years ago.
