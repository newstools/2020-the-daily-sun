TAXI commuters are shocked after the Alexandra, Randburg, Midrand, Sandton Taxi Associations announced that they will increase taxi fare by 172%. This means that a taxi from Alexandra to Sandton will now cost R30, from R11 for a single trip. Taxis owners said the current 70% lockdown regulation capacity is killing their business so they have to charge more to survive. The notice said that “Due to the government stipulated regulations f decreasing passenger load to 70% and fuel increases as well as motor spares increase, our taxis will with affect from June 15 2020, increase fares to R30 across the board.” The association said that the increase is necessary as they are losing revenue and the government is not assisting taxi operations.
