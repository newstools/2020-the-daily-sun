SAMUEL Nyakane (42), the father of Naledi Lethoba, is not happy with the sentencing in her murder case. The 21-year-old was brutally killed on 18 May last year in Welkom, where she was attending college. Naledi’s boyfriend Obed Leshoro (19) was sentenced to 15 years in prison last week in the Virginia High Court. Obed had accused Naledi of cheating when he apparently stabbed her to death, burnt her body and cut off her breasts. About 10 days after the incident, he confessed to his dad and was taken to the cops, bust and charged with murder. Samuel said: “We have many questions that need to be answered. I think justice was not fair on us. This sentence is opposite to what the state president announced about femicides in our country. Why is this is so different? Is it because we are from Free State? We are not happy and the killer could be out even before finishing that 15 years’ sentence, but my daughter is gone forever.” Naledi’s brother Mohau Nyakane (18) said: “We are devastated how the judge handled this case. The case brought trauma into our family and has opened wounds. We are now continuously crying. We thought the justice system would be on our side, but it has failed us. We are still pleading for justice for my sister Naledi. “He was Naledi’s boyfriend and he killed her, burnt her and removed my sister’s breasts. That’s brutal and 15 years is not a fair sentence.” Naledi’s aunt Sebina Lethoba (44) said: “The justice system has favoured Obed. We sent Naledi to college to get an education, but she was killed. We are deeply saddened and disappointed.” Free State NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said Obed was sentenced to 15 year imprisonment.
