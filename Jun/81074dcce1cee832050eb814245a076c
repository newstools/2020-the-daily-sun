AMAZULU midfielder Michael Morton has raised concerns that his newly born twins may face the risk of contracting coronavirus when he gets back to training, as they are still at a vulnerable stage. However, the former SuperSport United midfielder has drawn encouragement that the Covid-19 pandemic, that forced the PSL to suspend the Absa Premiership in mid-March, has mainly affected the elderly and those who have other existing diseases. Morton was recently blessed with twin girls. He says when he goes to shopping with his wife, they ensure that they wash their hands before touching their twins. “From what the research is saying, younger kids and infants are probably not as susceptible to the virus as elderly people,” said Morton. “But there’s lot of things that we don’t know about this virus and I think in terms of the numbers that are coming out it doesn’t mean that there’re no cases of younger kids getting infected. But obviously it is concerning because my kids are very young and I’m extremely careful. “It is also not to say that as footballers, we are clear either, so it is a tough one. But we all know that people have got to go back to work at some point.” With the PSL-Safa Task Team hard at work looking at ways for local football to resume, Morton, who has won three Nedbank Cups and one Telkom Knockout trophy in his career, says this forced break due to the Covid-19 has allowed him time to bond with his twins. He has also been training hard at home. “I don’t think a lot of fathers get to spend the first two or three months with their kids at home after they were born,” revealed Morton. “Obviously for mums they get maternity leave but for dads who are working, it is very seldom you get to spend this (sort of) time with your newborn kids. So it has been pretty cool.” Usuthu are fighting relegation. They’re 15th on the log with 23 points from 24 matches.
