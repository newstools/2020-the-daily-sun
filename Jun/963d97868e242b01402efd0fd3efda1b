GAUTENG Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC, Jacob Mamabolo, handed over the upgraded Kudube pedestrian bridge to Hammanskraal residents in Tshwane on Wednesday. He said it was exciting to hand over such services to the people of Hammanskraal. “We are handing over this pedestrian bridge that connects Marokolong and Kudube communities. We hope it will create a very good link between the two communities. “This bridge will support the movement of workers and pupils,” he said. Mamabolo said upgrading the bridge cost the department R2,4 million. He said the delivery of the bridge and cost effectiveness set the tone for other transport infrastructure in the department’s project pipeline. “The bridge serves both a social and economic infrastructure role for the community. “It provides an opportunity to bring the cultural and tourism dimension to the area as it will attract further investment,” he said. Mamabolo was joined by Tshwane administrators Mpho Nawa and Gilberto Martins, as well as community representatives. Nawa said he was grateful of the support the provincial government provided. He said the bridge would be helpful to residents. “We call on our people not to destroy properties, especially this bridge. “This bridge will be economically sustainable to residents,” he said. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of the people of Tshwane. Ward 74 councillor Solomon Qebelu sent his gratitude on behalf of residents. He said the community has been suffering. “We hope the administrator will get security guards to guard this place from people who might want to destroy it,” he said.
