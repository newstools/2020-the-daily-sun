  Amos Mgwenya was shot dead at the Mthayiza Primary in Kabokweni. Visitors to the school found Mgwenya's body inside his vehicle parked in the school yard. Police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said three women arrived at the school and called out for Mgwenya to open the gate for them and he did not respond. "They then grew suspicious as this was a daily routine for him; prompting them to jump over the gate with the intention to investigate. This led them to discover Mgwenya in his car, bleeding from what looked like gunshot wounds. "Police and medical personnel were summoned to the scene where Mgwenya was unfortunately certified dead," said Hlathi. Police further discovered that the suspects broke into the computer room and made off with laptops,Â projectors, routers, a computer box, earphones and an internet booster. "The investigation has further highlighted that this incident was an orchestrated robbery and it is clear that the suspects were armed and were targeting certain items at the school.  "A case of murder and robbery was opened and a manhunt launched immediately. No arrests have been made as yet," Hlathi said.
