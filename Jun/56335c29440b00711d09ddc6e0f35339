THE Maubane family wants justice for their son Leroy. This after the 23-year-old was allegedly stabbed to death by his friend in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, on Saturday. According to the family, he was with his friends at the park before the incident happened. They said he came home to get a jersey and then came back after a while, screaming he was stabbed. His uncle said: “He told me his friend stabbed him and as soon as I saw how bad it was, we took him to hospital, where he died.” Leroy’s mum, Lerato (40), said she wasn’t home when the incident happened. “I was at work. I received a call and went to the hospital, but they told me he was fine. “I went home, where I was told my son was killed,” she said. “I am a mess. I feel useless and broken. I haven’t slept and eaten.” She said they didn’t know why he was killed. Lerato said Leroy was humble and couldn’t hurt a fly. “He was a respectful young man. “He wouldn’t talk back, even when I shouted at him,” she said. Lerato said people in the area loved him. “Pensioners asked him to help them withdraw their Sassa grants. They’d give him their pins and cards,” she said. Lerato said she wanted her son’s killer to rot in jail. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder was opened, and the suspect was arrested and will appear in court soon. “The suspect and deceased were allegedly at a local park with a group of friends. “An argument ensued and the group assaulted the suspect. “It is reported the 22-year-old suspect went home and returned with a knife, which he used to stab the deceased in the neck,” said Masondo.
