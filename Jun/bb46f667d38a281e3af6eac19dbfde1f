A very wise friend of mine once said: "Never peel your potatoes twice." At first I thought she was advising me about food, but later I discovered that this was food for thought. In other words, my friend was warning me of the dangers of looking back and revisiting history. She explained that progress is achieved by moving forwards and stagnancy is a result of looking back. This, she warned was more dangerous when it came to relationships. Many relationships are failing to progress because our partners are still stuck with memories of their exes. We constantly carry a scale to weigh our current relationships with our previous ones, and the question is: Is all this healthy? According to one 2000 study, friendships between exes were more likely to have negative qualities, and less likely to have positive ones, than cross-sex platonic friendships. Simply put, having an ex as a friend is a recipe for a disaster. This becomes tricky when exes have children with each other. The dynamics change, and the bond between the two becomes difficult to legislate. Studies suggest that couples who remain in contact for the same reasons — whether those are pragmatic or sentimental — are more likely to have successful friendships, while staying in touch because of unresolved romantic desires is a predictor of negative outcomes. It is important that relationship boundaries are set in dealing with exes. Your ex odd to respect your relationship and partner. Remember, three is indeed a crowd.
