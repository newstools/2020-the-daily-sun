MAKHOSINI Mpofu is being tormented by horny men. He shares a number with a well-known magosha house and men keep phoning for sex. The 47-year-old from KwaDukuza, KZN, told Daily Sun he was gatvol of being an unpaid switchboard operator for the Ipi Ntombi brothel in Tshwane. Mpofu said he had been using the same Vodacom number for eight years when the trouble started two years ago.

It’s even on the magosha house’s website.” The SunTeam checked the website and found it listed the same number as the one being used by Mpofu. He said he had to explain the situation to his wife so she didn’t accuse him of cheating, or being a pimp. “I also get calls from women who want prostitute jobs at Ipi Ntombi. I get so frustrated.” Mpofu said he went to the Vodacom store at Gateway in Durban, but staff said there was nothing they could do. “I just want my life back. I’m no pimp,” he said. He said he had been switching his phone off over the weekend to make the calls stop, and he put it on silent at night. The manager at the magosha house, Huang Wg, said they were not aware of the problem but would make sure the number was removed from their site. Vodacom’s Byron Kennedy said they’d investigate the details around Mpofu’s line, and revert back to him in due course.
