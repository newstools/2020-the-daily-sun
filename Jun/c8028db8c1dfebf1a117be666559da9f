The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has vowed to continue monitoring schools as they resume with their academic programmes. The Commission’s Gushwell Brooks said no learner should be left behind as schools scramble to catch up with the academic year. In a statement released on Monday, Brooks said the Department of Basic Education, unions and governing bodies needed to speed up the process of delivery to avoid any delays. “However, the Commission will continue to monitor the challenges faced by schools in ensuring schools open for Grade 7 and 12 learners, which will include school visits; and will publish these as results become available.

Brooks said the actions taken by the SAHRC were aimed at having a substantial impact on monitoring and protecting rights. "The commission has developed an in-depth overview of the key Covid-19 implications on the right to basic education. Ensuring access to adequate food, nutrition and learning materials for learners are key components of an adequate response to the epidemic. "The commission shall also seek expertise and guidance on a number of related issues, particularly access to education during the lockdown, the need to bridge the inequality and digital divide, ensuring inclusive learning, as well as an increased focus on foundation-phase learning,” Brooks added.
