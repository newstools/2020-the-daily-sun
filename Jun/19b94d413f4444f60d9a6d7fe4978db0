SuperSport United defender Onismor Bhasera can hardly wait to get back on the football pitch. While the former Kaizer Chiefs star admits that the Coronavirus enforced break has afforded him a chance to spend some quality time with family, he is now really missing football. It has been over three months since the Zimbabwean last kicked a ball in an official match and he admits that it is getting harder every day to keep waiting. “First few days I was happy on spending time with my family and also analyzing my previous games but lately I miss being on the field of play with my colleagues, especially on our winning streak and our camping. I miss everyone who makes our team even the ones behind the scenes,” said Bhasera as quoted on his club’s website. Fortunately, Bhasera does not have to wait too long now after government gave PSL clubs the green light to resume training. “To all football supporters and our fans, we miss not just entertaining you but also your presence in the stadiums, the sounds of your excitement or otherwise. However the situation we are under needs all of us to adhere to the rules and regulations for our own safety. Please keep the social distancing and washing of hands. The mask is now our new look,” added Bhasera.
