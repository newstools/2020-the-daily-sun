PANIC has gripped Bampoen farm dwellers in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga after the death of over 10 cattle in the area last Tuesday. The families have been living on the farm for more than 10 years. According to Joyce Nhleko (59), who has lost at least nine of her cattle, the tragedy seemed to be because of food poisoning. The mother of seven said they were still in shock. She said this was the first time this happened after a new owner took over the farm. Joyce, who owns goats, horses and cattle, said the farm owner once complained about the livestock belonging to the families and asked them to take some of them from the farm. She said her husband even decided to stop working for the owner, fearing his livestock would go missing or die. She said she was shocked when she received a call from one of her children on Tuesday, informing her their livestock had died. “I rushed to the spot and found my cows scattered all over the place with foam on their mouths. I was so hurt,” she said. Joyce said they informed the police about the matter. She said the farm owner never came to find out what happened. “We don’t want to point fingers at anyone. But the owner should have come to see what happened. “What hurts me the most is the cattle were a source of income for many families in the area. Most of us are not working and depend on the cattle to take care of our families,” she said. “We know the person who did this cannot bring back our cattle but he must pay for what he did.” Daily Sun’s attempts to contact the farm owner were fruitless. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of malicious damage to property and animal cruelty was opened. He said investigations were continuing.
