Eleven teachers and a pupil have tested positive for Covid-19 in Gauteng, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi told a weekly Provincial Command Council meeting on Friday. He said the schools where the teachers and the pupil attended had since been disinfected and cleaned and would open on Monday when schooling's expected to resume around the country.  He said there were only 67 schools experiencing challenges in Gauteng - 53 of these will not open on Monday. Names Lesufi said his department would publish all the names of the schools that won't open on Monday. About 27 of those schools are in Sedibeng where there are serious water shortages and poor sanitation. "Even if we can put water tanks in those schools, we can't risk the lives of pupils," said Lesufi.      "On Thursday, 15 more schools were hit and in one school in Nellmapius all learner gadgets were stolen. In some schools levels of vandalism and theft are severe. We have 138 schools without perimeter fencing and have budgeted funds to fix the fencing.  "We have 351 schools that were vandalised either through theft or arson. Three of them were badly damaged and we are making arrangements in the interim," said Lesufi. https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/11-gauteng-teachers-and-a-pupil-test-positive-for-covid-19-20200605
