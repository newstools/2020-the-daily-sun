A MAN (30) from Kabokweni who is accused of killing his mother is expected to appear in court today. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the man, his wife and another woman who is believed to be his friend, had a heated argument on Wednesday. Hlathi said the man’s mum, who was in a room in the house with her other children tried to intervene. “But her son allegedly fired a shot, which struck his mother.” The victim’s daughter ran out of the house and found her mum lying on the ground. The injured woman was taken to hospital, but was certified dead on arrival. The matter was reported to cops, who opened a case of murder. On Thursday, police found the suspect in possession of an unlicenced firearm and ammunition. “He failed to give clear answers and was arrested,” said Hlathi. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma praised the cops for their efforts. “I have also ordered the detectives to determine whether the confiscated firearm was not used to commit other crimes,” Zuma said. He condemned the incident. “The issue of so many firearms has a devastating effect on the safety of the community. “We encourage the public to report anyone unlawfully in possession of a firearm, whether they are family or not,” he said. “Police Minister Bheki Cele has instituted the Firearm Amnesty Project in November, where the public are encouraged to take firearms to their nearest police stations.”
