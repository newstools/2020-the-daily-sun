ELEVEN suspects who were detained at Standerton Police Station holding cells escaped last week. Among the suspects were two madalas who were bust for allegedly raping an 11-year-old girl. Six of the escapees were rearrested, but five are still at large, including the two madalas. Upon hearing of the escape, the girl’s mum moved her from Standerton in Mpumalanga as she feared her life might be in danger. The 45-year-old mum told Daily Sun she moved her daughter as the suspects’ families were harassing her family. “The rape happened in September last year and they threatened my daughter. One of them told her he had a gun, while another apparently told her to keep quiet and gave her R40,” said the mum. She said her daughter tried to kill herself by drinking poison. “She didn’t want to speak, but opened up to one of my relatives. I’m sick and my blood pressure is always high. I feel like I’ve failed as a mother,” she said. Delani Thabethe from the #IAm movement said they were disappointed that so many suspects escaped. “We raised our concerns with the station commander that they need to improve the way they handle detainees. ‘I don’t think this was a 30-minute job or an hour. It took a lot of time for these people to break the wall or steel door,” said Delani. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops have launched a manhunt for the escapees Bongani Vilakazi (22), Sipho Zulu (24), Mandla Maseko (27), Sibusiso Ntuli (29) and Tsepo Thabo Mofokeng (29).
