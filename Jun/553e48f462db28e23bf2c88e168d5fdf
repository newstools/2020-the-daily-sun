THE family believe the house caught fire when Thembinkosi tried to light a cigarette. Thembinkosi Xulu (57) from Ulundi, northern KZN, burnt to death on Monday. His nephew Nkosi Mathabela (34) suspects a matchstick fell on his bed. Nkosi’s uncle had been very weak after an operation on his tummy, and his one leg was amputated. “We suspect the match fell on his blanket and he couldn’t shout because of his condition,” he said.  “We suspect this because there’s no electrical fault and no candles were used. We have electricity. “My uncle was weak and his grip even weaker. It was already late by the time the children noticed smoke coming out of his room.” Thembinkosi and his gogo apparently spoke a bit before she left to make breakfast. When she was done making him breakfast, she heard kids yelling in the yard that the house was on fire. HUSBAND: TODAY KUZO NYIWA! “When she got there the flames were too big to save him,” he said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a 57-year-old man died after his house in Jikaza Reserve caught fire while he was inside. Mahlabathini police were investigating.
