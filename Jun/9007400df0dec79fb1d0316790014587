THEY put their experiences, talents and passion together to create a new community radio station. The duo are the founders of Klipcity FM, which started broadcasting on 18 May. It’s an online radio station based in their kasi of Klipgat, Tshwane. One of the founders Estelle Banda (27) told SunBuzz their kasi needed a radio station. She said she and George Boikhanyo (31) wanted to give the youth in the area a voice. They also wanted to show them their dreams are within reach. “Our station is easily accessible and anyone can listen to it from anywhere. Our aim is to become one the best. We want to give listeners the best shows as the station is theirs. We also want to educate and inform them by providing accurate and entertaining news.” ALSO READ:MAN LINKED TO TSHEGOFATSO PULE  MURDER ARRESTED They also give young presenters and newsreaders an opportunity to sharpen their skills. Up-and-coming artists are also given a platform to share their music. Estelle is a former student from Leaders in Motion Academy. She’s also a writer, poet and co-founder of Blacktoned Pictures, a company which owns an online TV station called Kasi Local TV. George said his journey started as a radio presenter at Letlhabile Community Radio in 2009 before moving to SMU FM in 2015. “I wanted to open my own radio station back in 2010, but my challenge was money. I saw an opportunity to open an online radio station and this was a great platform as I’ve always loved being on radio, informing and entertaining people,” said George, who’s also a filmmaker. He said their challenge was that they didn’t have enough funds to make the station more vibrant.
