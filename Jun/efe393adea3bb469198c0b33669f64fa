AS a young boy who wanted to join the army, Lebohang Moshitoa joined boxing to prepare himself for his intended career path. After he got his first taste of sweat science, the young fighter fell in love with the fistic sport and he has never looked back. Now the talented fighter is slowly making a name for himself in the local boxing scene. Moshitoa, a former Gauteng cruiserweight provincial champion, is third on the national ratings and wants to prove his mettle here at home before taking on international opponents. “As a young boy, I started to have interest in joining the army once I finished school. I knew that I would need physical strength and mental fitness, so I joined amateur boxing at Booysen Boxing Club under coach Nicky Ness,” he said. “After two years of learning about the art of boxing I started fighting as an amateur. It was really tough but I stayed put. I knew if I’m going to join the army I must give my best in amateur boxing,” said Moshitoa. The dedicated amateur heavyweight pugilist mastered the noble art to an extend that he ran out of opponents. “I was performing well as an amateur heavyweight boxer and as a result, I struggled to get opponents. The heavyweight division was very thin in Gauteng. I even spent the whole 2017 without a fight,” he said. Moshitoa started assisting professional boxers with sparring sessions and the following year, he decided to turn professional. “It was not my plan to join the paid ranks but due lack of competition in the amateurs, I had to turn professional,” he said. Despite doing well in professional boxing, his desire to join the military and become a soldier is still burning. The 24-year boxing sensation will be part of the proposed money cruiserweight competition. A mouth-watering Golden Gloves showdown will see Mzansi prospects Akani Phuzi, Chris Thompson, Keaton Gomes and Moshitoa battling it out. This tournament will be a good stepping stone for these prospects.
