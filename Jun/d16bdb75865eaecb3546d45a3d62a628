THE SABC is expected to give detailed answers to the Communication Workers Union following a coronavirus scare at its Durban offices. Last week, Ukhozi FM presenter Khathide “Tshatha” Ngobe tested positive for coronavirus, but the laboratory that conducted the test made a U-turn within hours. And it turned out the laboratory made a mistake. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said the employee was presented with new test results, whose outcome was negative.

We want to know if the SABC is in possession of the letter or written confirmation by the laboratory,” said the union’s KZN secretary, Thami Mzileni. “If they have such confirmation, we want to know what safety measures are being taken to ensure members’ safety, especially in KZN, after this coronavirus scare.” He expected the SABC to give answers before the end of yesterday. Seapolelo said they received the union’s letter. “As a matter of principle, we respect our relationships with our stakeholders and are not at liberty to divulge any of our interactions with them through the media,” said Seapolelo. “As per the norm, we’ll use internal channels to engage the union directly.”
