WHEN they heard bangs on Monday night, Jabulani Hostel residents thought a storm was coming. But it wasn’t thunder they were hearing – it was gunshots! Brothers Mhlekise (37) and Felakuphi Mpungose (30) and five unnamed friends died in a hail of bullets. It’s believed three armed men opened fire on them. The men apparently started shooting from outside before kicking open the door to check that everyone was dead. There was only one survivor. Their brother Mnothi Mpungose told Daily Sun the family was devastated by what had happened. Mnothi said his brothers and their friends were sitting outside the shack when they were attacked. A neighbour who heard the gunshots said: “I asked myself where the rain could be coming from in winter. After a while I realised it was gunfire.” During a visit to the hostel, along with national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khehla Sithole yesterday, Police Minister Bheki Cele said it looked as if the killings were planned. Captain Kay Makhubele said: “The police are searching for at least three suspects. Five people died at the scene and one in hospital. The seventh victim is still in hospital.” Makhubele appealed to anyone who may have any information to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or send a message on MySAPSApp.
