SOCIAL media challenges come and go and now there’s a new one. The stand-on-my-bum challenge sees women balancing their kids, or their lovers on their bums. Although some women said they loved the challenge, others said they hated it. Mbali Mkhonza said on Facebook: “It exposes women who have flat bums.” Nombuso Dlamini said she liked the challenge. “It’s not about having a flat or big bum, but about women being pillars.” Nombuso said the challenge was about proving women could stand whatever burden they faced. Feminist Lucia Ngcobo (38) said: “Women are strong. I like this challenge. It proves our capabilities.” She said women needed to stand together and fight any scourge. Lolo Ndwandwe said: “I hate this challenge. Those of us with no big bums can’t participate.”
