HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli 
Mkhize has warned South Africans that the coronavirus will be around for
some time. Speaking to Enca at a hospital visit in Mpumalanga
,Mkhize  also said government was trying
to do a balancing act of curbing the virus and also keeping regular life going. “We cannot continue the lockdown forever,it’s
impossible.  This is a major issue on our
side,trying to curb infections while fighting hunger and to keep the economy
afloat. Also it is clear that it we will be with Covid-19 for some years,maybe
two.” Mzansi’s Covid-19 death toll currently is nearly 1000 with
nearly 50 000 actives cases and the Western Cape accounting for more than
half of those cases. Mkhize said President Cyril Ramaphosa wanted a risk adjusted
strategy in preparation for level 3 and for activities such as schools and
churches to reopen. “ A team of paediatrics met with the department of Basic
Education and made recommendations for schools.” Grade 7 and 12 pupils returned to schools today since the
beginning of the lockdown nearly three months ago. Yesterday Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said 95%
of schools were ready to reopen. “Each and everyone of us must taken individual
responsibility. Covid-19 is serious,we must try to flatten the curve”,added
Minister Mkhize. Minister Mkhize said teams of specialists had been assigned
to hospot areas to keep people who have tested positive in self-isolation and
their contacts in quarantine. “Right now we don’t have a shortage of PPEs,there are
distribution challenges in some areas. There is a need for more understanding
for what level of protection a health worker needs. For example a full
protection suit and goggles are for staff dealing with patients in an isolation
ward.”
