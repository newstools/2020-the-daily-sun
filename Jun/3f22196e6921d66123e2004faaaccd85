NONE is happier to have Warrick Gelant in the Stormers team than Damian Willemse. The Springboks and Stormers fullback reckons the Western Cape side’s backline will benefit from Gelant, who joined from the Bulls. The Stormers have made a perfect start to their Super Rugby campaign, winning four out of six games before the Covid-19 lockdown, despite losing flyhalf Jean-Luc du Preez and Jamie Roberts. “I’m really excited for Warrick to come down to Cape Town. He is a great signing and a world-class player,” Willemse said of the utility back. “The attributes he will bring to the Stormers, with Dillyn (Leyds) leaving, he will fill that position. He will definitely be a leaderin that backline.” The two have worked together in the national team, teaming up with the Boks side at the 2019 World Cup. “It was amazing to work with him,” Willemse continued. “That was one of the first times that we worked together. I can’t praise him enough for his work ethic and the way he plays the game. “He is such a natural baller. I’m really looking forward to playing with him. With an ability to kick with both feet, Gelant possesses a rare skill which is most welcomed at John Dobson’s team. “It is always such a helpful thing to have someone who can kick with both feet,” added Willemse. “So, Warrick will definitely help me and assist the team there, with his left boot. He has got great attributes and skills that he can bring to the team that will add another dimension.” Willemse has also shared his frustration at not being able to play due to the lockdown. It is still unclear when Super Rugby wi return as the sport grapples with the pandemic. “It’s been challenging training alone and seeing the day through. Goal kicking is one of my priorities and obviously with the lockdown it’s being restricted. But I’ve managed to do some other stuff, he said.
