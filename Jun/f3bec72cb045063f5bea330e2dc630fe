BULLETS flew in Robertsville near Florida, Joburg, as three men opened fire on zama zamas in the area. According to the police, three armed suspects wearing balaclavas, were waiting in an open veld next to an old mine on Friday. “A group of eight Basotho men who were going to the old mine shaft met three other Basotho nationals who robbed them of cash and cellphones, then shot all eight of them. Two died and six were taken to hospital.” The zama zamas were attended to by various paramedics from different ambulance services. The road was temporarily closed and motorists were turned back as some of the injured people were treated on the scene. Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said: “We’ve launched a manhunt and have mobilised maximum resources to trace three suspects following the murder of two people and six injured at an open veld in the Florida policing precinct. “Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or perhaps have information that could lead to the apprehension of the suspects, is urged to report to Florida Police Station or call the CrimeStop on 08600 10111.” Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela has condemned the violence and vowed to intensify deployment on the hot spots. “Investigators must also work around the clock to ensure that the suspects are found and arrested,” he said.
