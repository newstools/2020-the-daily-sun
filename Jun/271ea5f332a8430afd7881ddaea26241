RUMOURS that Maritzburg United coach Eric Tinkler has been attracting interest at Highlands Park have left the Kwa-Zulu Natal club management angry and disappointed. The Team of Choice CEO Younus Kadodia says such are destabilising the team after great work done by the former Orlando Pirates coach this season. Tinkler, who joined Maritzburg late in January last year, is regarded as an important member of their team after his achievements at the club, and they’re hoping he will surpass his achievement of the past year. “It’s pure speculation,” said Kadodia. “From the club’s side we don’t intend losing him. I think whoever is behind the story is being mischievous. But we are not paying too much attention to it.” For Tinkler to be linked to Highlands, it is also believed Owen Da Gama could be on his way out of the Tembisa-based at the end of this season. “From our side, we are looking forward to getting back to training and back to work,” added Kadodia. The Team of Choice are currently fifth on the table with 39 points from 24 matches. With six games to go, they are on course to make history to better the 2017-18 season of the 44 points tally achieved by Fadlu Davids. Tinkler is expected back in Maritzburg this week after spending few weeks in Cape Town.
