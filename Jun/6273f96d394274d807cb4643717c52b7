Cape Town City have confirmed a contract extension for central defender Keanu Cupido that will keep him at the club until June 2022. The 22-year-old has long been thought of as a highly promising player, but has failed to kick-on as he would have liked with just eight league appearances so far this season. But City have shown faith and he has put pen-to-paper on a new deal that could see him cement his first-team place. “The club is delighted to confirm that we have taken up the option to extend rising star Keanu Cupido’s contact until June 2022,” City said in a statement. Cupido joined the Mother City club ahead of the 2018/19 season from French side Ajaccio, and made 15 Absa Premiership starts in his first campaign. City announced earlier this week that they had extended the contract of experienced midfielder Mpho Makola for an extra season.
