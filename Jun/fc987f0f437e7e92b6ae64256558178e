A FAMILY was hit with a double tragedy following the death of their daughter. This after Tshegofatso Pule, who was eight months pregnant, was found dead in Durban Deep near Roodepoort, west of Joburg. The 28-year-old from Meadowlands zone 3, Soweto, allegedly went missing last Thursday. Her dad Sphiwe Mashiyane (67) said there was a gruesome video of his daughter’s body hanging from a tree. He said whoever killed his daughter tried to make it look like a suicide. “Seeing the video left me weak. The police explained that it looked like Tshegofatso was stabbed in a car and later dragged to the tree,” said Sphiwe. “She had bruises showed she was dragged and a stab wound below her left breast,” he said. Sphiwe told Daily Sun Tshegofatso left home to go to her boyfriend’s house. “Footage from where he lives shows him walking Tshego to a Jeep. “From there we really don’t know what happened. She had promised to show me a picture of the boyfriend, but never did,” said a pained Sphiwe. He said Tshegofatso had two kids, and the one she was carrying would have been her third. “We’re still trying to come to terms with her death. She was humble and sweet. I pray I get justice for my daughter and grandchild,” he said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated and no arrests were made.
