AWARD-WINNING gqom group Distruction Boyz has gone separate ways. This was confirmed by the duo, who said they are both working on solo projects. Yesterday, Zipho “Goldmax” Mthembu dropped his solo single titled Iphupho Lami. He told Sunday Sun the full album will be released next month. “There’s no bad blood between us, it’s just that we’re now focusing on our solo careers,” Goldmax said. Thobani “Que” Mgobhozi said he’s also in studio working on his solo album. “There’s no bad vibes about our split,” he said. Sources say the Omunye hitmakers parted ways because they wanted to try their individual careers in showbiz. But another source painted a different picture, saying there was a conflict between them. Said the mole: “They felt they’re talented and will be more appreciated as individuals and can succeed much better apart. “They realised that they’re different and want different things in life and have different styles of music.” Another source said they’ve been advised that in order to be rich in the industry they should go solo. “If you’re set on making it big in the industry, you need to leave the group and start your own thing,” said the source.
