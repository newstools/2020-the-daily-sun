Amapiano DJ and producer Semi Tee dedicates his debut album to his mum. The Labantwana  AmaUber hitmaker is releasing his album titled I’m Only TweentyOne today. Speaking to SunBuzz, the artist said it’s a thank you album for his mum, Tiny Lichen Ramaila. Semi Tee said: “It only makes sense for me to dedicate my debut album to my mum because she raised me. “I am now 21 and it’s because of her love. So the album is a token of appreciation to say thank you for everything. This is from my heart to her.” Semi Tee said people should expect fire from the album. “I already have two singles out, Mercedes featuring Focalistic and Stayla featuring Kammu Dee and Njelic. “People love the songs already, so one can already imagine how the other songs will be. “I always make sure that I deliver the best. I also decided to not include Labantwana AmaUber and Lemonade in the album because I wanted it to be exclusive,” said Semi Tee. “I also didn’t work much with Kammu Dee and Miano because I wanted to build my own brand. I featured Kammu on some songs, but Miano isn’t featured on the album.” Semi Tee said about his 10-year plan: “I want to open my own record label in 10 years. “Through the label, I want to recruit young talent and teach them. “The music industry isn’t easy when you’re new and young. Artists need to be advised on how to handle the pressure. In 10 years’ time, I’d have acquired all the experience I need. “That’s what I’m working towards right now,” he said.
