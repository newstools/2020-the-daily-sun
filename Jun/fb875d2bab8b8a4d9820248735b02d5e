AFTER two months of no worship, churches opened their doors again Sunday. But services were smaller than usual, as no more than 50 people were allowed to attend. At Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng’s Incredible Happenings Ministry in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, congregants had their temperatures taken, hands sanitised and had to fill in a questionnaire to check if they didn’t have coronavirus symptoms.   During the sermon, Mboro told congregants: “I did say that in 2020, the hospitals would be overwhelmed and some of the doctors would get sick from touching other people.” He said he took the service outside so people could sing together. “They told us to come back to church but not to sing. How can that be called church?” He preached from the back of a bakkie.      “We sang and danced. We had everyone, including kids and those above 60, which we couldn’t if we were inside,” he said. Everyone who attended the service wore a mask and sanitisers were handed out. Inside, congregants sat apart while listening to Pastor Themba Mqadi. Member Siyabonga Kortjaas (33) told Daily Sun he was happy to return to church. Nearby, His Grace Bible Church also opened its doors again. Pastor Malusi Makhanya said the church was well prepared but only a few congregants attended. Pastor Shadrack Maswanganyi said he was happy to see his members after such a long time. “I wish all churches could operate and pray for the end of this virus,” he said.   Church member Nosizi Nyathi said congregants were sanitised and wore masks. The church’s headquarters in Mbhekwana Village, outside Tzaneen, were open as were a number of branches around Limpopo. The church said branches that remained closed and those in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and neighbouring countries would soon open.
