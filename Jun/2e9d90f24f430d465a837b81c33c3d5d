Ferguson Films responded to Mlamli Mangcala's accusations that he received a pay increase of only R100, saying they weren't wrong. Their spokeswoman, Lauren Neil Nel, was on Metro FM three days ago to clear their names. She said Mlamli, who plays Captain Sthembiso Radebe on The Queen, knew the role he played was meant for someone who lived in Joburg and he agreed to take the role anyway. Lauren further said the accusation about the R100 increase was false. Also, she said they paid Mlamli even when he wasn't working. Read:Â MUVHANGO PRODUCTION HAULTED Mlamli posted a letter last week, blasting his bosses. He claimed the Fergusons gave him an increase of R100 when he asked for a raise. He also claimed the Fergusons pay for his trip to Joburg, but he pays for the journey back to Cape Town. He said he shares a bed with the caretaker at the Khoza mansion because they don't pay for his accommodation.
