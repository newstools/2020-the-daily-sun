Brazil has joined South Africa and other countries who have withdrawn its candidacy to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup. After making their Fifa Women's World Cup in France 2019, South Africa were set to bid to host the 2023 tournament. However, last year December South Africa Football Association (Safa) announced that SA will not be submitting a bid book and other proposed hosting documentation to Fifa for the next Women's World Cup, ending their effort to host the 2023 event.The South African Football Association said it wants to focus on improving the women's game, particularly the fledgling national league, before bidding for another international tournament - but more likely the country's economic malaise has mitigated against the bid. Now the Brazil has also withdrawn. The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said the government did not consider it wise to offer financial guarantees in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. "Because of the fiscal and economic austerity brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, (the government) thought it would not be recommended to right now sign the guarantees asked for by Fifa," the CBF said in a statement on Monday. Brazil has hosted a string of international sporting competitions in recent years – including the World Cup in 2014, the Olympic Games in 2016 and the Copa America in 2019 - and the CBF also felt they were outsiders to host yet another major event. Brazil will instead join the other South American nations and "support Colombia in the dispute to host" the tournament, the organisation said. Brazil's withdrawal means Colombia, Japan and a joint bid from Australia and New Zealand are the remaining contenders to host the 32-team tournament.
