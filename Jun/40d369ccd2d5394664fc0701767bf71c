THE driver of a Toyota Corolla is lucky to have been on the other side of the car. This is after a bus collided with him on his car's passenger side on Friday morning in Bloemfontein. The crash happened at the traffic lights near the gate of Free State hospital. It's alleged that the empty bus had brakes failure when the crash happened. When SunTeam arrived at the scene opposite the Free State Psychiatric Complex, fondly known as Orange Hospital, the medics were busy trying to take out the driver of the red Toyota Corolla. The bus driver told the paramedics that there was no passenger inside the bus. Seun Leope (33) said he saw what appears to be the bus that had failed breaks. "The Toyota was turning to its right side when the bus came towards it. The two then collided and the car driver was injured and could not go outside the car. I think the bus breaks might have slightly failed the driver who tried to avoid the crash.Â "But I'm happy that no one died and the car driver is lucky that the crash did not impact on his side," said Seun. The ER24 paramedics managed to remove the injured driver and he was rushed to the hospital and Cobra Towing took the car away after the Parkweg police monitored the incident. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the accident took place at about 7:30am on the corners of Victoria Road and President Brand Street, Willows, Bloemfontein. "The bus was allegedly driving straight when the car turned right when the accident took place. The driver of the car was injured and taken to Medi Clinic by ambulance. A reckless and negligent driving case was opened," said Mbambo.
