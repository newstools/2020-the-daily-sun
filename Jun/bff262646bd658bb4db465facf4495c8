South African Mihlali Mayambela will not be returning to Portuguese club Farense even if his Israeli club Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv do not take up the option to turn his current loan deal into a permanent transfer. Mayambela would cost Bnei Yehuda 500 000 euros but there has been no decision yet on whether they want to keep him. He moved from Farense in January on a six-month loan deal. Mayambela, 23, spent 18 months as a regular at Farense, who have since been promoted after the Portuguese second division was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the club in second place with 24 matches of the 36-game competition completed. Mayambelaâ€™s contract at Farense only runs out in mid-2022 but the club said on Friday they would not be taking him back, suggesting to Portuguese media there was also interest from Sweden, where he previously played at Degerfors and Djurgardens. -Supersport.com
