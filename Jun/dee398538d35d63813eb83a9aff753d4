 ACTING ON information, cops went underground to check on a man suspected of selling body parts.A cop approached the man and asked him if he had a womb for sale.“I HAVE A PLACENTA AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW FOR R5 000,” SAID THE MAN.Speaking to Daily Sun, Captain Piet Rossouw explained that the undercover detective found the 60-year-old madala who matched the exact description the police had received in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. Rossouw said this kind of trade was usually associated with international syndicates, but his time it was a local man. The 60-year-old man was arrested for selling placentas in Vosloorus on Saturday. “The detective said he wanted to buy a placenta,” said Rossouw. “The man replied that he could supply the body part immediately.” The cop said he was phoning his brother to bring the money. “The detective was actually calling for backup,” said Rossouw. The suspect heard the conversation and asked the detective why he had phoned the police. “The suspect overheard the conversation and asked the detective why he was calling the police,” said Rossouw. “The member then showed the suspect his badge and told him he was under arrest.” Rossouw said that the human tissue has already been sent to the forensic laboratory for testing. The suspect was charged with trading in body parts and appeared in court on Monday. His case was remanded to 18 June. Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Makhosi Maliyavuza, who confirmed that human placentas are used as muthi. “Not every child is born with their placenta, therefore it’s considered as good luck and used as muthi,” she said. She claimed the government hospitals have been ignorant about this subject and refused to give mothers who give birth in public hospitals their placentas. “They know very well that their staff sell them,” she said.
