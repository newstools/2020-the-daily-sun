THE family of Tokelo Rakgosi (56) from Botshabelo wants answers about their family member's mystery death. This is after Tokelo started to complain about not feeling well after he had drunk some traditional beer on Wednesday. The ambulance was called but Tokelo died on the same day. His family says he was healthy like a horse and they want answers. His aunt Senoe Malehloa (56) from section A in Botshabelo said she was shocked when she heard about his passing. She told Daily Sun: "Tokelo died a very healthy man. He was at my house even cutting a tree for me. I was not here when he met his sudden death but, we heard that he died after drinking traditional beer. "He did love it but we suspect something. We heard that he complained about not feeling well and the ambulance delayed to arrive and he died." "He drank the wrong one this time and we want answers. I'm truly hurt about his death and hope the police will manage to get to the bottom of this." Tokelo's nephew Lefu Senowe (33) said it was like he was dreaming. "My uncle was a peaceful man who loved his family. It will be better if I could have answers to what and why it happened. He had a boy that he was raising and loved very much. This is sad and we hope one day we will get closure as to what happened. We want to know where did he get that traditional beer," said Lefu. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said a case of Inquest has been registered for further investigation. Mbambo said: "Post mortem results are awaited so as to determine the cause of death." She said the province has not had any other incidents have been reported where people died from drinking homemade beer.
