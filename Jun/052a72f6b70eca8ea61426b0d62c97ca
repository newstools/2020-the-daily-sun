The Democratic Alliance has filed an urgent application with the Western Cape High Court to have the ban and criminalisation of personal care services declared invalid and unconstitutional. This comes after the party gave Minister Dlamini-Zuma a deadline of 03 June to provide them with the reasons and rationale for the ban. DA Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry, Dean Macpherson said the Minister had also failed to meet a self-imposed deadline to publish regulations for the industry as she had promised by 5 June 2020. “The DA, therefore, has been left with no choice but to take this legal step to save the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people who have suffered at the hands of this government that does not care about them, and could not be bothered to provide any reasons for their hardship,” Macpherson said in a statement.

Macpherson said DA believed that Minister's unspecified ban was violating section 22 of the Constitution which allows citizens the right to practice their trade. “In our papers, we have argued that the blanket prohibition on the entire personal care industry is irrational and arbitrary which is prohibited from operating indefinitely, subject to the whims of some unidentified Minister that should provide "directions" for the industry. “Closing this industry does not stop people getting haircuts, piercings or tattoos. It stops people keeping a roof over their heads and food on the table," Macpherson added.
