GRATEFUL men sing the praises of Fika Khumalo for introducing them to her beetroot wine! The men love it. They say it boosts them in bed and saves relationships. “I use simple herbs found in the garden,” said Fika. “I’m a traditional healer who’s more on the herbal side. I’m honoured to have such a special gift.” The herbalist plants beetroot in her small garden. “People eat my herbs to heal their bodies,” she said.  Truck driver Zofania Nhlabathi (58) said he was always tired after a long day at work. But after using beetroot wine he’s enjoying his life in the bedroom. “The wine has done wonders for my relationship. I know I’ll enjoy the night because I don’t get tired.” Elliot Mhlongo (45) said his 4-5 was weak, but after he drank beetroot wine he enjoys his love life. “My wife almost cheated on me. I was not satisfying her, but now she calls me daddy,” he said.  Fika said beetroot wine regulates blood flow but makes one drunk if they drink too much of it. Men may drink six spoons and women just enough to awaken the senses. “My muthi boosts high performance in bed. It gives men stamina and makes women active.” She said the wine works against sleeplessness and high blood pressure and has no side effects. “Since 2013 I’ve been experimenting with close friends,” she said. “I’m grateful to my ancestors who make me do wonders.” Ancestors show her herbs in her sleep and tell her how to mix them.
