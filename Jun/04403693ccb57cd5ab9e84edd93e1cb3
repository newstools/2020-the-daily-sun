GODFREY Mtimkulu was a man of many talents. But what he’ll be remembered for most is the love he had for his 10 kids. The member of the 80s music group Zasha was buried yesterday at Thomas Nkobi Cemetery in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. He died from kidney disease last week. Members of the community, friends and relatives came to pay their last respects. Although Mtimkulu was known as a people’s person, only 50 people could attend the funeral due to lockdown regulations. Among those who attended were fellow 80s bubblegum stars Yvonne Chaka Chaka and Rebecca Malope. Chaka Chaka told Mtimkulu’s kids to love and support each other. “You supported your dad. We all saw that,” she said. “You took him to hospital. Most kids don’t do that.” Danny “Kamazu” Molewa said he learnt a lot from Mtimkulu. “One thing I used to admire about him was his dress sense. “When I saw him I knew I had to up my game. To his children, know that he loved you. “Not a single day went by that he didn’t talk about how much he loved you.” Rebecca said Mtimkulu was a good friend and dad. “It’s hard for all of us,” she said. Mtimkulu’s eldest son, Thanduxolo, told mourners: “What comforts us is that he knew Christ. He was saved and we know he’s in a better place.” Addressing his siblings, Thanduxolo said: “We need to continue. “Let’s stick to what our father has taught us.”
