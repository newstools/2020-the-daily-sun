TWO days before the 2010 Fifa World Cup finals in Mzansi, Reneilwe “ Yeye” Letsholonyane celebrated his 28th birthday. But the only thing on his mind at the time was whether he was going to play or not at the biggest football spectacle in the world on home soil. Before the big kickoff, Letsholonyane had goosebumps and he kept on dreaming about his big moment. But two days later, the talented midfielder, who was in the books of Kaizer Chiefs, fulfilled his lifelong dream of playing in the World Cup. He was part of the team that achieved a credible 1-1 draw against a talented Mexico outfit at Soccer City on 11 June 2010 in the opening game of the tournament. As Mzansi gears up to celebrate 2010 Fifa World Cup 10-year anniversary tomorrow, Letsholonyane, who celebrated his 39th birthday yesterday, said the World Cup is the biggest tournament he has ever played at in his career. Letsholonyane is one of the most decorated footballers in the country, having won trophies with Chiefs and SuperSport United. But Letsholonyane, who is one of the oldest players in the Premier Soccer League and a role model at his current club Highlands Park, said nothing beats the feeling of playing in the World Cup finals. “I remember the 2010 Fifa World Cup as if it was played yesterday. I cannot forget the feeling of playing in a sold-out stadium in one of the biggest matches of my career,” said an excited Letsholonyane. As the whole country remembers the year that changed the country and hosted who’s who of world football, Letsholonyane is also sharing his 2010 World Cup moments.
