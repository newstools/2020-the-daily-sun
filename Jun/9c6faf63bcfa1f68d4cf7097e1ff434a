THE Hawks have made another arrest in connection with the looting of VBS Mutual Bank. Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale confirmed that Mattheys Gerhardus Wienekus, Merafong Municipality manager for budget and treasury until his retirement, was arrested yesterday. Wienekus (64) appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court after he was subpoenaed on charges of contravening the Municipal Finance Management Act 56 of 2003 in the ongoing investigation into the bank. Mogale said investigations revealed that more than R50 million was invested with the bank at the time Wienekus was acting chief financial officer at the municipality. The Merafong Municipality is one of 20 municipalities that invested funds with VBS in alleged contravention of the law. “I have indicated that the investigations into the municipalities are at an advanced stage. This is the beginning and all the other cases are receiving the necessary attention,” said Hawks head, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya. The matter was postponed to 29 July for further investigation. This is the ninth arrest in the high-profile case. Last week, VBS chairman Tshifhiwa Matodzi, described as the alleged “kingpin” of the looting scheme, CEO Andile Ramavhunga, former treasurer Phophi Mukhodobwane and former non-executive VBS board members Ernest Nesane and Paul Magula, as well as former KPMG engagement partner Sipho Malaba and former police chief financial officer Phalaphala Ramikosi, were arrested. The seven face 47 charges of fraud, theft, money laundering, corruption and racketeering. An eighth accused, former VBS chief financial officer Philip Truter, is yet to appear in court. He’s in quarantine due to Covid-19. – NEWS24
