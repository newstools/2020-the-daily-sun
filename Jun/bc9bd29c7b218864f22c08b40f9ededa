MAMELODI Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mngqithi has signed a four-year deal with the Brazilians. The former Golden Arrows and Chippa United coach said everything has been finalised and now it is left to the nine-time champions’ management to confirm the news. Just like coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane, whose contract was expiring at the end of this current suspended season, Mngqithi’s contract was also expiring at the end of this term. When Mosimane recently signed a much publicised four-year deal, eyebrows were raised as to what is happening to the former Arrows coach, who has played an important role alongside Mosimane to help Sundowns win three league titles in the last four years. “I have renewed my contract. It’s a done deal. It is just that it is yet to be official,” said Mngqithi in his hometown of Umzimkhulu in the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal where he was donating food parcels with his foundation called Manqoba Mngqithi. The 49-year-old, who guided Abafana Bes’Thende to the MTN8 title in 2009, joined Sundowns towards the end of the 2013-14 season. In that season, the Tshwane giants won the league title, his first at Downs. The duo’s success has since been unmatched. They have since won four league titles, two Telkom Knockout – including this season, a Nedbank Cup, the Caf Champions League in 2016 and Caf Super Cup the following year. Having achieved so much at the club, Mngqithi says Sundowns are eager to make it three league titles in the row and make history by becoming the first club in Mzansi to win 10 league titles. The duo promised the club’s president Patrice Motsepe that they’ll try to win the Caf Champions League again. “You know when you win one cup, you want to win all of them,” revealed the man known as TV. “I’m talking about every year. When I don’t win against Orlando Pirates, I feel bad. When I don’t beat Kaizer Chiefs, I feel bad because I want win. When I don’t beat Baroka FC, I feel, I don’t want to lose.”
