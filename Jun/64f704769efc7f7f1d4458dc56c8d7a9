We woke up to a buzzing noise on Social Media about Babes Wodumo crying on an Instagram Live chat with Tha Simelane. The Gqom sensation's interview started on a high note with excitement about working on a new album and people in the industry she would like to work with. She then confessed to having had a few drinks before the interview. Things started going South when Babes started talking about her career journey and extreme criticism she has been subjected to. “I was a child when I started in the industry. I was born in 1994 and  I didn’t know anything. I got money and learnt how to save and not drink every day.“People don’t know my situation. They think I love partying too much. I didn’t have a home. I had to start afresh. I had to close the curse my family had. My dad didn’t have a home, I had to a build a home,” she said crying. “People say I drink too much, I’m always drunk. They don’t know me and what I have been through. I want to show people who I am and what makes me famous,” she told Tha.
