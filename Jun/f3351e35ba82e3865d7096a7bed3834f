The all-round media personality shared that even when she was still in school, she would date the best of the best. “I think this comes from my family, my dad is a very strict man. He is Zulu and he is unimpressed by everything. With him it was always aim for the best. But I guess he is doing it to get us uncomfortable, but it always creates a complex of I’m not good enough and I need to push more,” she said. Khanyi said the fact that her dad was unimpressed with everything led her to have daddy issues and to close that void one of the things was to date Mandla, whom she met for the first time while she was checking out at a hotel in Durban going back to Joburg. She then later met him at a club in Joburg, where they started to vibe and went on to have breakfast every morning for 3 months, before they started dating. “He knew every interview I did, every article written about me. He was literary impressing me by telling me facts about myself. Going back to daddy issues, my dad doesn’t know anything and he is never impressed and here is a guy impressed by everything I do,” she said. Khanyi said the fact that he made time to get to know her impressed her a lot. “For me I was blown away by a man who has 24 hours like me, but could put aside his own life and try to understand me,” she said.
