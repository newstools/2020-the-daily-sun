 Police in
Lebowakgomo, 45km southeast of the Limpopo capital Polokwane, are investigating
a case of assault after a teenager was allegedly attacked by her mother, who poured
hot water on her. A
37-year-old man laid a complaint on behalf of the 14-year-old girl, who resides
with him. According
to police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the girl's mother found
her sleeping at home in Ga-Maja, woke her up and started to "assault her
with wood". After the attack, she allegedly poured hot water on her. The
teenager sustained several injuries and was taken to a local hospital. The
29-year-old mother was arrested and given a warning to appear in court at a
later date because she is pregnant. She will
appear in the Lebowakgomo Magistrate's Court on 28 August after giving birth. SOURCE:
