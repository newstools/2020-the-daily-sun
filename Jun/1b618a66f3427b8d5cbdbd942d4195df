RESIDENTS of Tshepisong near Kagiso in Krugersdorp, west of Joburg, are living in fear after a spate of break-ins. But they can now breathe a sigh of relief after a man was bust with stolen goods on Tuesday. Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso cop shop said police received a tip-off that a criminal was in possession of suspected stolen property. The cops went to a house in Ebumnandini in Tshepisong West and cornered the suspect. “They found laptops and cellphones suspected to have been stolen goods,” said Sibiya. He said station commander Themba Ngcobo praised residents for working with cops. He said the high crime rate in Tshepisong was a headache for police. “We hope this success will lead to more arrests and that the suspect will lead us to those he worked with,” he said. Sibiya said there’d also been hijackings in the area. Two Uber drivers had been hijacked by unknown people in the past two weeks ekasi. Resident Zozo Makhambane (46) told the People’s Paper: “Thugs are terrorising us. “We hope this latest arrest will send a strong message to other criminals who’ve turned Tshepisong into their playground.” Another resident, Petros Dikutu (55), said he knew of people who’d fallen victim to thugs. He hoped their stolen goods were among those taken from the suspect.
