AFTER a season of the reality show The Way Ngingakhona, one of its stars was hoping it was going to educate people about the LGBTQ+ community. But this was seemingly not the case. One of the show’s stars, Innocent Matijane, is furious after a shop owner allegedly refused to help him because of his sexuality. Innocent told Daily Sun he was disappointed by the shop owner and more disappointed by the people who just stood by and did nothing. He said he went to a shop on Sunday to buy a cold drink, but was humiliated. “When I was about to pay, he took the cold drink back and said he doesn’t like my style and that his culture doesn’t allow him to help gays or lesbians,” said Innocent. “I couldn’t believe it. I felt embarrassed and decided to take a video of him hoping this would shake him up, but it clearly didn’t. He still didn’t help me.” Innocent said he expected people to call the man into order, but they just stood there and did nothing. “At this point I realised we’re far from being accepted by society,” he said. He said he called the police, but they were not helpful. “I was told I’m annoying. A policeman told me it’s his shop and he can do as he pleases. I’m hurt and disappointed,” said Innocent. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun what may have happened to Inno was hate crime and was prohibited. Masondo advised him to lodge a complaint at his nearest police station.
