SOUTH Africans would have to make sacrifices if the country was to win the battle against the coronavirus. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize was referring to quarantine when he said this while in the Western Cape yesterday. He said: “We do understand it’s an issue where people are concerned about what happens to their houses when they’re away for two weeks.” Mkhize said he was comfortable with the work being done in the Western Cape, the worst-hit province. He said President Cyril Ramaphosa would visit the area soon. Mkhize, however, admitted to Daily Sun that there were testing backlogs, but insisted that South Africans shouldn’t panic. The backlogs, which he said stood at more than 90 000, were mostly in Gauteng and KZN, as well as in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. “We’ll find backlogs every now and again,” he said. “In the first few weeks when we started testing, we started having backlogs. “When we do have backlogs, we go out and check who has backlogs – whether it’s the private or public sector. “I’d say we should not panic about the fact that there’s a backlog. We’ve gone all out.” Mkhize said the department was happy with the state of readiness in the Western Cape, Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KZN, in so far as observing regulations and dealing with the pandemic were concerned. “What do I see as the area of constraint?” he said. “The first issue was seeing the number of beds matching the number of patients. “And we agreed we needed the province to have reserve capacity. “In case the numbers are quicker than the beds being released, then we’d have to use the private sector.”
