”SCANDAL won’t be the same without you.” These are the words of those who loved Thembeka Shezi, a character on e.tv soapie, Scandal. Thembeka Shezi was played by Masasa Lindiwe Mbangeni, a South African actress well-known for her incredible portrayal of Thembeka, the arch-villain on e.tv's Scandal. Mbangeni broke the hearts of millions Mzansi people when her character died last night, meaning she left Scandal. People on twitter have been asking is she is really dead or if she will wake up in tomorrow’s episode or whether she’ll come back as a ghost. The actress took to twitter to inform her followers that the character has died and she jokingly said she won’t be coming back as a ghost because she was never taught how to act as a ghost at Wits.
