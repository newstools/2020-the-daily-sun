RESIDENTS blocked the entrance and exit to Eskom in Tshwane with their cars and branches. Coming from different areas in Ga-Rankuwa, the residents gathered outside Eskom’s office on Tuesday, protesting about electricity. The residents from zone 7 and 9, Mmakau and GaRankuwa View in Tshwane said they hadn’t had electricity for days. Protester gogo Sarah Chauke (77) said her meter box doesn’t work anymore, but she didn’t get help. “I sent my daughter here and they said they’ll give us a new meter box, but we are still waiting,” she said. “My husband is sick. I need help because it is cold and I am an old woman.” Mmakgosi Modipa (34) from Ga-Rankuwa View said they were sick and tired of how Eskom was treating them. “Living without electricity is painful,” she said. Councillor Floyd Thema said during the past weekend it was extremely cold and everyone was using electrical appliances. Eskom Gauteng spokeswoman Reneiloe Semenya said a transformer supplying the area broke down due to overloading. “When equipment fails as a result of overloading, an audit is conducted to remove the illegal connections and activities to protect and safeguard infrastructure against repeated failure and explosions,” she said. She said Eskom had scheduled the repair work for the following week. Semenya said they planned to audit this week and once illegal connections had been removed and fines issued, they would change the transformer. “Hopefully, the community won’t cause more disruptions as it will delay work,” she said.
