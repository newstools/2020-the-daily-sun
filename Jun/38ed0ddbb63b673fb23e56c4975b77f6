THE high rate of coronavirus infections among the elderly remains a serious concern. For this reason, SABC sports commentator Hodi Tsamago donated 500 resuable three-layer masks to the gogos at Ga-Molepo Village, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, yesterday. The donation came from DrewMach Branding Solutions, a company owned by former soccer star Hareaipha “Simba” Marumo. Hodi told Daily Sun: “It’s unfortunate that our elderly are the target of this pandemic. It’s also unfortunate that the majority of our village elders don’t have access to personal protective equipment. “It’s appalling to see our elderly wearing old cloth as masks. We’ve learnt that many elders live alone and no one looks after them.” Hodi said many elderly people suffered from chronic diseases, which meant they were at a higher risk of dying from the virus. “During the visit, we taught them about the pandemic and encouraged them to regularly wash the masks for their safety.” He said as someone who grew up in a village, he was aware of the struggles faced by many rural people. He said he’d continue donating masks in several Limpopo villages. “We encourage business people and companies to come on board to help fight this pandemic,” he said. Hodi encouraged the youth to help in fighting the virus, as they understood it better than the elderly. Hareaipha said he was happy to have partnered with Hodi. “It’s our duty to ensure our elderly citizens are in good health. We’re concerned about the rising number of coronavirus infections in the country. But we believe we can win this battle through wearing masks and practising social distancing.”
