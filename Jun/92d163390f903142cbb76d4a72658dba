KNOCK, Knock! Who’s There! It’s me! Corona! And this, SunLanders, is where the joke ends. With 92 681 confirmed cases of corona positive people in Mzansi and 1 877 deaths, the reality is that with the maturity of the epidemic, many of us are going to be either infected or affected by Covid-19. Living with the coronavirus is fast becoming a reality for many of us, with the virus patiently waiting to strike anyone of us from the other side of the door. In the next two months, most of us would either know someone who is positive, or in self-isolation waiting for their results if we are not directly affected ourselves. As the corona pandemic reaches its peak in many provinces in Mzansi, it is how we react to this crisis that will define how we survive this battle. With restaurants, hair salons, movie houses, hotels and conference venues set to welcome customers, it’s not the time to be lulled into a false sense of security. Now more than ever, we need to be highly vigilant by adhering to safety precautions and practise social distancing. We also need to guard against the discrimination and intolerance of people among us, who will test positive. The deepening crisis facing Mzansi needs all of us to dig deep into our African humanity in how we treat our family members, relatives, colleagues and community members testing positive. Let us become active citizens and identify areas where we can offer help during this pandemic to support and connect with others in our kasis and townships. The second wave of this virus is set to be more deadly. It’s also going to put more strain on the poor who since lockdown have not been able to earn a living. Let us be guided by the spirit of ubuntu as we grapple with the greatest threat ever to face mankind in this millennium. – Editor
