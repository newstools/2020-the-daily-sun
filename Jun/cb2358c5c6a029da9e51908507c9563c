THE feeling of driving your brand-new car from the dealership is great and overwhelming. The driver of this VW Polo in India seems to have been very happy about their new whip, so happy that he flipped it. In the video that has gone viral, the white Polo can be seen driving out of the parking bay while people clap their hands. As the driver gets to the gate, he loses control of the car and speeds towards the gate, and crashes the car. Crashing the car was not the only problem, he also flipped the car upside down while ramming into the gate.
