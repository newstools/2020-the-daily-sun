The Dutch football federation said on Wednesday the 2020-21 season will start on 12 September, following the government's decision to ease coronavirus restrictions. "The anticipated start of the league will take place 12-13 September," the KNVB said in a statement, adding players would need six to eight weeks to get fully fit. The Netherlands are also due to play Poland and Italy at the start of September in the Uefa Nations League. Dutch authorities announced on Wednesday that football stadiums can re-open their doors to fans from July, but only under conditions including a mandatory 1.5 metre distance between occupied seats. The Eredivisie in April became the first top European league to be called off due to the coronavirus pandemic. No team was declared champions after Ajax and AZ Alkmaar were left level on points at the top of the table.
