“I WAS stressed and I cried for the whole day after testing positive for coronavirus.” This was what Vuyokazi Qumza told Daily Sun while speaking about her experience with the virus. Vuyokazi from Khayelitsha in Cape Town said she was first tested on 6 April and the results came back negative. “I decided to do the second test after one of my colleagues tested positive. In my mind I thought it would be negative again, but it was positive,” she said. Vuyokazi said she tested positive on 9 May. “I was stressed because I share a house with seven family members, including a newborn baby. “I didn’t know what to do until someone told me about a group for infected people,” she said. Vuyokazi said drinking water with lemon, ginger and garlic helped her.  “I was also using a lot of vitamins to boost my immune system. “I became very weak and had headaches. People need to take this virus seriously,” she said. Sinalo Plaatjie (39), also from Khayelitsha, said she tested positive at the end of last month.  “When the results came back, I felt dizzy and I didn’t know what to do. I felt afraid because I have heard of people dying of this disease,” said Sinalo. She thanked God for helping her heal, and the Together We Can coronavirus support group. “My experience of contracting this virus taught me to take it seriously. “I hope other people start following the rules because this virus is real,” Sinalo told the People’s Paper. Both women urged people still hosting parties and gatherings to stop. “They are not only putting their own lives at risk, but also those of people they will meet after the parties,” said Sinalo.
