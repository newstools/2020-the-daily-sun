THE mission to retrieve the bodies of miners Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi is set to resume. Former Lily mineworkers and families of the trapped workers will once again work to recover the container and remains of the three miners trapped during the mine disaster four years ago. Work was stopped earlier this year to allow legal processes to unfold. Worker representative Harry Mazibuko told Daily Sun when the Mineral Resources Department and Vantage Goldfields visited the mine in January, they were hopeful both parties were ready to deal with the matter, but nothing happened. Last year, the former workers made progress with their illegal search for their colleagues. They saw tyres believed to be supporting the skip container, as well as a fence and pole which were 5 metres from the container before the mine collapsed. Mazibuko said if they weren’t stopped, they might have retrieved the container by now. “We can’t get closure because of their endless meetings,” he said.  In April last year, workers camped metres away from the mine’ premises to force government and the mine to retrieve the container and the remains of the miners. Former Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba helped the workers and the families with legal services.  “We know where the container is. We know it’s less than 70 metres underground and we are ready to fetch it,” said Mazibuko. “If illegal miners go underground every day and blast, why shouldn’t we?” He said their challenge was some of their working tools were not available, but they would continue.
