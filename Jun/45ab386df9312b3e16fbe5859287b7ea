A woman from Port Alfred in the Eastern Cape has appeared in the local Magistrate's Court on allegations that she submitted funeral claims on behalf of a deceased person's family and then stole the payouts. According to police spokesperson Captain Mali Govender, 33-year-old Tumeka Louise Zweni of Bathurst was released on R1 000 bail. Govender said Zweni allegedly submitted funeral claims and then told the deceased's unsuspecting family members the claims could not be paid out due to various reasons. In one such incident, a family member went to the funeral home where Zweni was working. She took the policy for her relative who had died to submit a claim, but Zweni allegedly informed her the funeral policy was "not mature" and that she will not receive payment. "The victim was requested to submit a death certificate so that they can cancel the policy. The victim handed over the requested documents." Paid into relative's account Zweni, who is a data capturer at the funeral home, then allegedly submitted a claim on "behalf" of the victim and R10 000 was paid into Zweni's relative's bank account, from which she allegedly made several withdrawals. "The suspect's relative went to report it to the Bathurst police station, where a case of fraud was opened," Govender said. "The witness also revealed that there were several other claims paid into her account." Zweni will appear in the Port Alfred Magistrate's Court again on 27 August. The Commercial Crimes Unit of Port Alfred has urged the community to contact their local police or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 if they have similar incidents to report.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/rip-off-port-alfred-woman-allegedly-defrauds-family-of-deceased-out-of-funeral-policy-money-20200610
