A WELL-KNOWN pastor is in hot water for assaulting  his wife. The pastor who's been charged  with common assault and domestic was arrested on Saturday. According to a source, the argument started after the pastor brought estate agents to their house in Crystal Park in Ekurhuleni to take photos. The pastor is apparently selling the house. The shocked wife wanted to know what was going on as she was never informed and that's when the argument started. According to cops the pastor went mad. He allegedly grabbed his wife and lifted a hand to klap her but he stopped and started attacking her verbally. She went to Crystal Park SAPS to open a  case of domestic violence. The wife told the cops she didn't answer back as she was scared of him. She alleged the pastor beat her previously. She told cops she never opened cases but had medical reports to prove the previous assaults. Captain Mavela Masondo  confirmed the arrest and that he was released and would appear in court on Thursday.
