AT least 2 126 people have been killed during a reign of terror by Islamists in northern Mozambique between late 2017 and this month. The deaths have been documented from at least 465 organised attacks in the Cabo Delgado province. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project recorded the incidents. According to the data collection, there were 1 288 reported deaths from organised violence. The project documented 838 reported deaths from civilian targeting. Insurgents continued their spree of small-scale attacks throughout the conflict zone last week, killing at least 11 civilians. In one incident, militants beheaded four civilians who had refused to follow insurgent orders to leave the Bilibiza area. People’s homes have been burned and shops looted in regions. – CAJ NEWS
