Bafana Bafana legend Benni McCarthy says he never discussed the Orlando Pirates coaching job with chairperson Irvin Khoza despite the rumours. The former Bucs star was heavily linked with the head coach position, prior to the appointment of Josef Zinnbauer in December last year, but McCarthy has revealed it was just speculation. "Yes, I was linked with Pirates [before they hired Josef Zinnbauer] but I never had a conversation with the chairman (Irvin Khoza)," McCarthy told the South African Football Journalists Association (Safja). "Pirates made their decision and at this point in time that seems like it was a right decision. He (Zinnbauer) has done relatively well with Pirates." Asked about Pirates' decision to bring in the German tactician, McCarthy praised the move and reckons it has worked out well thus far. "The team is playing much better and it seems like he is getting the best out of a lot of players," he added. "I'm happy for Pirates - that they seem to have gotten back on track. So, I did not have a conversation with the chairman about taking the job or not taking the job." - TEAMtalk media
