THINGS have started to look up a little for businesses that were hard hit by lockdown, as a number of them are allowed to operate under level 3. But some businesses are either operating illegally or selling illegal goods to survive. Kagiso cops have warned culprits they are out to catch all those involved in illegal activities. Captain Solomon Sibiya of Kagiso Police Station in Mogale City said cops have been clamping down on those operating illegal businesses or selling illegal goods for the past three days. They have managed to confiscate dagga, dagga muffins, expired goods from spaza shops, booze from shebeens operating illegally and those selling booze after permitted hours, even arresting the patrons and shebeen owners.  Ten patrons sobered up in the police cells after they were found drinking in a shebeen. They are facing charges of contravening Covid-19 regulations. Sibiya said the suspects will appear in court soon. He told Daily Sun that this was an ongoing operation, as people were continuing to break the coronavirus regulations. “We are out to clamp down on mushrooming shebeens operating illegally.” Sibiya said several tuck shops, mostly owned by foreigners, were raided for expired goods, which then were confiscated.
