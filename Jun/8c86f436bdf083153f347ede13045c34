South African design and fashion icon Rich Mnisi made social media go wild yesterday after his luxurious lounge-wear collection Azania consisting of branded tracksuits, scarves and polo-necks dropped. One of the most sought-after items was the classical unisex polo-neck top which everyone said they wouldn't mind spending the R2 000 on.  Many flocked to his website to see the entire collection and Bonang's famous R2 million joke came back. A while back Bonang once joked that everything from Rich Mnisi is R2 million, that is why she doesn't wear his clothes because she can't afford it.
