When media personality Somizi Mhlongo reached out to some his friends to be a part of his upcoming TV project, they declined offering no explanation whatsoever while others couldn't, because of contractual obligations. Although this was initially shocking for Somgaga, because these are people that he'd been there for, he soon realised that they didn't owe him anything.

This he details in a video posted on his Instagram account, saying while he was disgruntled about being snubbed by his friends, he soon realised that they didn't owe him anything. "Don't do things, because you want other people to do then back for you. Nobody owes you anything," he said. The star, who is an Idols judge and a Metro FM host, didn't give up and eventually had DJ Zinhle and Pearl Thusi shooting with him. They posted a picture together at Somizi's house where the upcoming project is being recorded. He said people's behaviour shouldn't affect the way you are, because they are not willing to do what you did for them. The star, who has released two albums, has in the past worked with the likes of Euphonik on his 2017 single titled Ngibonile. His upcoming show has yet to be revealed, but it involves having celebrity guests and navigating the realities of fame.
