Two Cape Town police officers accused of stealing cash from
a member of the public will remain behind bars after appearing in the Blue
Downs Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The pair, a 31-year-old constable and 43-year-old sergeant
based at Kuils River police station, were arrested on Tuesday, police
spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said in a statement. "According to information, the members stole an
undisclosed amount of money from a [complainant] during a stop-and-search they
conducted in Kuils River," she added. Detectives attached to the Blue Downs Cluster investigated a
case of corruption and theft, resulting in the arrest. The two officers would remain in custody until their next
court appearance on 24 June, Rwexana said. SOURCE: NEWS24
