However, the player is not fazed about the tough competition, instead, he believes that he is in the right path and his time where he will be a regular in coach Pitso Mosimane’s team will come. Talking to the club website the lanky player said he is still fitting.“One thing about me is that I am a patient person. It hasn’t been so long since I joined the team and I was still fitting in,” he told the club website.“ I know my time will come, I just need to put more effort” "My target now is to help the team fully to reach our goals and to win the league (when the season resumes) as well as the other cup competitions.” The central midfielder also reflected on his first-ever CAF Champions League experience with the club when they went to Morocco. Seabi did not play he was part of the squad for the experience. “It was a very good feeling to be part of the team because it was my first time. I had never played CAF Champions League and for me being part of the team was great,” he said. “I appreciate the opportunity (to travel to with the squad) and believe I will help the team to achieve more and more. "I must also add that the atmosphere there was super, so it was a great feeling, I must say. And I can’t wait to feature.”
