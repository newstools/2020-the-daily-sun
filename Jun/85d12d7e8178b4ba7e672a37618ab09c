THATO Mokasi (26) and
her friend Perm Stomberg (26) both from Block XX in Soshanguve, North of
Tshwane have created a stir on Social Media. This after their pictures
wearing their graduation gowns while selling scones at the robots trended. The two ladies said
they have been selling scones since last year. Thato who is a
qualified Interior designer said they started baking and selling because they
were unemployed and needed money to get by. "We had to put our
pride aside and use what we can do to make extra money," said Thato She said the business
has been going well and people have been responding positively. "Our costumers
support us every day and they also give us a positive criticisms if we haven’t
baked well," she said. Their picture attracted
mixed reactions s from people on social media as some were impressed with them
while others criticised them. But the two ladies said
their reason to wear the gowns were not to show-off or to look down
on people who are also selling scones. Perm who is a qualified
Somatoligist said the main reason was to motivate people, especially the youth
that just because you are unemployed doesn’t mean you should stay at home and
do nothing. She said they know that
there are a lot of graduates who are in the same position as them, who struggle
to get employment. "We want them to
know that just because you are a graduate it doesn't mean you should only look
for the job that you are qualified for, even the jobs that we look down on can
help one to get by," said She said although
baking and selling scones was not part of their plans career- wise, they are
happy that they ventured into it. "When we started,
it was just to get by but now we see that we can actually make something big
with this business," she said. She said their decision
to wear the graduation gowns was to show other people not to undermine street
vendors because most of them are educated and just struggling to get jobs in
their different fields of study.
