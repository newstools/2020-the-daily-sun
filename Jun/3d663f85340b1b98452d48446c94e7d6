Producer and DJ, Prince Kaybee says the biggest misconception about him is that he is pompous, arrogant and he's got a big head. He said he has learnt a lot from that misconception. On a video he posted on Instagram, he explained what he's learnt. "I've learned a lot and I've looked at how people understand outspoken people. People understand outspoken people as arrogant, as too much. Even when you walk into a room, people keep quiet," he said. The DJ said he realises that we are going in the wrong direction. "I've understood that we are going in the wrong direction as the human race, if we're going to now try and step on people's feelings for them not to say much about how they feel or what kind of opinion they have. That's why you find people would commit suicide. Someone will keep something in for a very long time," he continued. He said people should teach their children to be outspoken to avoid problems.
