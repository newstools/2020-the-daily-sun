ANGELINE Seanego will spend another week behind bars. She failed to provide the Pretoria Magistrates Court with her correct home address. The 22-year-old made her second court appearance yesterday after her arrest last Thursday. Seanego is accused of murdering her 36-year-old Ugandan boyfriend Dennis Kyazze, a shop owner, and hiding his naked body under their bed.

But the magistrate advised against it, stating that she had no legal training and could face life behind bars if found guilty. Yesterday, her lawyer asked the court to postpone Seanego’s bail hearing until her address could be confirmed. Ivan Namalala, a relative of the victim, was present in court and told the SunTeam he hoped Seanego would not get bail. He claimed she’d been abusive towards the victim. “We need justice for our brother,” said Ivan. “He was murdered in a brutal way.” Ivan also said the suspect didn’t show any emotion when the family found Dennis’ body. He claimed the accused often assaulted Dennis. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the accused had been charged with murder after she failed to explain to the police what happened to the victim. The matter was postponed to Tuesday for a formal bail hearing.
