IT'S essential to have good tools, but it is also essential that they should be used in the right way. Any handyman knows the importance of his toolbox. Every tool in his arsenal is important because they all serve a specific purpose for a specific need. The same thing can be said when it comes to our 4-5s.Â  They serve as an important tool for leakages, fillings and many other domestic emergencies. We have dealt with how to keep them sharp and fully functional. https://www.dailysun.co.za/LIfestyle/how-to-keep-your-4-5-working-20200603 But the question is, what makes this tool the best?  Apart from this act being a sign of respect, its also a sign of dignity and honour and that is the role of circumcision. Apart from the known health benefits of circumcision, sexologists agree that women prefer men with a convertible 4-5 because it makes for a perfect ride.  According to a study done by the University of New Mexico, women preferred the size of the 4-5 to be between 5.6-12 inches (about 12,7-30cm) in size. Coupled with that, they also wanted the scrotum (balls) to be trimmed and compact, in fact everything nicely packaged and managed.  Just like any haircut, your pubic hair needs to be trimmed and shaved regularly especially the one in and around the 4-5. Sexologists claimthe greatest contributor to the best 4-5 is pubic hair. They also say it affects the actual size of the 4-5.  Erections work exactly like using hand signals to commute via taxis. If your signal is uncertain or timid, you will miss your taxi. A strong erection is like a showing women a thumb. It can never be missed because of how it stands out - trust me, they love it!
