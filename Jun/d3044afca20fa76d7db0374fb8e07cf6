CITY of
Joburg wants to be safe rather than sorry. Their offices have been closed
and are into the second round of deep cleaning. The City of Joburg's spokesman,
Nthatisi Modingoane said the centres that offer the full bouquet of municipal
services, were all recently opened to resume operations under the Level 3
Covid-19 lockdown. MMC for
Finance, Councillor Jolidee Matongo said the closure comes after an
assessment of customer traffic volumes in the centres. "We saw it fit to
continue prioritising safety precautions through continuous deep cleaning of
our facilities and the provision of personal protective equipment to
staff," said Matongo. He further
stated that the centres will be reopened on Monday. "The City has
created a number of platforms for municipal account holders to continue
conveniently paying their accounts. They can even pay grocery shopping at Easy
Pay counters inside Pick n Pay, Shoprite, Spar and Woolworths. Payments can
also be made through electronic fund transfer, telephone or cellphone banking,
automated teller or at the South African Post Office," he said. Matongo
also gave thanks to residents who've been paying their municipal accounts since
the beginning of the current lockdown. “We all
need to continue working together to ensure that service delivery also
continues by paying for services consumed while keeping safe during the
lockdown," he said.
