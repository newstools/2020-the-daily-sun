THE six suspects linked to the murder of Hambanathi teen Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu continued their bail application yesterday. Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Andile Nhleko (27), Mcedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22) appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court in Durban. The bail application started on Tuesday. Before Thabethe could continue with his application, his lawyer Chris Gounden said the matter was adjourned on Tuesday because the suspects hadn’t eaten. He said they’d still not been given food. But senior prosecutor Krishen Shah said according to his experience, food was provided to suspects in custody. Magistrate Thiloshir Badal said the matter must stand down for the claim that the accused hadn’t eaten to be investigated and for them to get food. NDZ MUST GO! When the matter resumed later, it emerged that the suspects were indeed given food in the cells. Shah then continued with Thabethe’s application. It emerged that Bobo allegedly stole 27 cases of booze from Magagula Tavern. On Tuesday, Thabethe said he contacted cops when he heard they were looking for him. Shah said it appeared Thabethe knew the police well as he called them by name. The matter was postponed to today for Thabethe to continue with his application. Bobo’s uncle Ntobeko Ngidi (49) told Daily Sun he didn’t want to say much. “As the family, we want to see justice being served,” he said.
