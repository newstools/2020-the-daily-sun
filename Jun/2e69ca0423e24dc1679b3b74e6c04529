KAIZER Chiefs defender Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya is a firm believer in the faous quote "Education is the key to success." The 23-year-old who was born in the area called Buzana in the  Eastern Cape, insists that the only way for young people to advance in life is by educating themselves. The Amakhosi defender, who is currently a Business Management student, is preparing for life after football. "“I think there is only one way out for the youth to advance in life,” Ntiya-Ntiya told his club's website. "The only opportunity that is real is to study and be qualified. The youth must study as much as possible. With education the youth will be able to avoid the many ills that we witness happening everyday in the society.” Ntiya-Ntiya, a Chiefs academy product, has stamped his authority in the Chiefs squad whenever he’s been fit, making a total of 45 appearances across all competitions. This season, Ntiya-Ntiya has played 16 games in all competitions  for Amakhosi, starting 10 of those matches.“It took me by big surprise when I signed for the first team. Everything changed,” said Ntiya-Ntiya. “For starters, I was able to provide for my family back home. And that is a great feeling. My grandmother was able to resign from work because I was able to provide for her needs. There are many things that changed for the better. I am very grateful to Kaizer Chiefs.”
