Maluleke won the Premiership title with Matsatsantsa a Pitori in 2009-10 season with coach Gavin Hunt. “I am still enjoying football and to be honest, what keeps me going strong is discipline ,dedication and respect,” said Maluleke He also admitted that he has been missing football as the league had been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic since March. “It has been tough, but we have to follow the rules,” said Maluleke. Despite Maluleke’s age, Rise and Shine coach Clinton Larsen still has full trust in the former Lidoda Duvha star. Larsen will be relying on Maluleke to guide youngsters in his team’s fight for survival when the Premiership season resumes. City are not yet safe from relegation.
