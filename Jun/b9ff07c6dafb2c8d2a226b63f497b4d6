WINNIE Khumalo’s daughter Rethabile has finally opened up about the car accident that almost ended her life. Last month, Winnie announced on Instagram that her daughter had been in a crash. “I’d like to inform Rethabile’s fans and friends she was involved in a car accident and badly hurt, but she’ll be OK. Please keep her in your prayers,” she said. Rethabile told the SunTeam: “I was just a pedestrian walking on the side of the road when a car hit me. What I can recall is I was soaked in blood with head injuries and scratches on my face. “For a while I couldn’t move. As I lay there on the road, I kept praying, asking God to spare my life. I wasn’t ready to die. I was then rushed to hospital. “Fortunately, none of my bones were broken. I had a blood clot in my right thigh, a few scratches on my face and a scar on my head. “I still have a minor swelling on my thigh, but it’s going down. “From what I understand, the car that hit me was beyond repair. I’ve seen pictures and it’s clear the accident was very bad. “I don’t know how I survived. I know one of the victims is still in hospital.” Rethabile said she was still dealing with it. “I just want to forget about it, but I know it’s impossible. “I’m a staunch Christian. I believe God allowed it for a reason. “One day I’ll have to encourage other victims of car accidents and help them cope.” She was recording an album when it happened. Within a few days she was back in studio. “For now I just want my fans to know I love and miss them,” she said.
