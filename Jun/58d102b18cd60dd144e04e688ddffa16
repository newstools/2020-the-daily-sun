IT has officially been confirmed that the next generation VW Amarok will be built by Ford at the Silverton assembly plant. The Amarok will be based on the Ranger from 2022. Ford and VW have gone into an alliance to enhance ownership experiences for current and future customers by more rapidly innovating vehicle offerings, incorporating relevant new technologies. They anticipate continued growth in global industry demand for commercial vehicles and for high-performing electric vehicles to add valuable scale to their product portfolios. The partnership will produce a bakkie engineered and built by Ford, to be sold by Volkswagen as the Amarok starting in 2022 within the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles lineup. Furthermore, they will produce a city delivery van based on the latest Caddy model, developed and built by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and later a 1-ton cargo van created by Ford. “This collaboration will efficiently drive down development costs, allowing broader global distribution of electric and commercial vehicles, and enhance the positions of both companies,” Volkswagen Group CEO Dr Herbert Diess said. While chairman of the board of management Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Thomas Sedran, said: “This long-term cooperation with Ford will strengthen our very good position in area of light commercial vehicles, especially in our core European markets, and is proof that we are successfully implementing our plan step by step.”
