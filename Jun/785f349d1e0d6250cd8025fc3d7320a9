ANGRY bus commuters protested after buses didn't pick them up! The angry protesters say they never managed to go to work and continued to protest on in Hammanskraal north of Tshwane. Sad commuters asked why the company sold them tickets knowing very well that there wonâ€™t be busses to commute. Commuter, Anna Tlou (53), said they want to know why the North West Transport Investment buses didn't take them to work as they were at the station early in the morning. She said the buses must leave and not operate as they keep on frustrating them. "We are sick and tired of these buses which give us empty promises all the time. "They are not special as they fail to practice social distancing," she said. Another commuter, John Lebese (36), said the company is a shame because it fails commuters always. "They must stop opening windows to sell us the tickets if they know they don't have diesel or their drivers are not working," he said. The bus officials apologized to commuters before addressing them. The officials said they didn't know that they will be a strike today. Operating Centre manager, Jimmy Lekgwathi, said workers didn't receive their salary. "We didn't get money from the Department of Transport as per contract as informed by our head office. "The administrator who is the head of the company is doing everything in his power to ensure that people get their salary," he said He added that they don't know the date when workers will get their money. "We hope after the meeting with MEC of Transport in North West today we will come up with a solution and come up with the date when the workers will be paid. "We want to clarify with the MEC and labour and then we can confirm when we can start operating," he said.
