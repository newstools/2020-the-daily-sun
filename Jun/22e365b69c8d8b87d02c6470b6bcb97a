  THORISO Themane’s murder case was postponed by the Limpopo
High Court Monday. This after the legal representatives of some of the minors
accused of killing Themane (28) requested the state to furnish them with
certain information on the case. According to NPA spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi, the
representatives of accused no six and seven said there was information they
needed to give to the NPA, which might also be used during the trial. As a result, the case was postponed to Monday. Malabi said the case would now be held in camera as it
involved minors. “We can’t say what information they want to give to us
regarding the trial because we are still to meet them and understand. After we
met them, we will be able to understand everything and what needs to be done,”
she said. One of teenagers accused of the brutal murder of Themane was
killed at a tavern three months ago. Tiisetso Mphahlele
(15) was stabbed to death in Seshego Zone 1 outside Polokwane after he
allegedly had a fight with another drinker. All the nine minors and two adults facing charges of killing
Themane are out on bail. Thoriso’s mother Maria (56) said the pain of losing her son
still rips her apart. She said she wished her son’s killers could be removed from
society for good. “I need this case to end soon and justice be served for my
son. The community also needs to be safe from such criminals. But I belive God
will answer my prayers,” she said. Themane was killed at Flora Park Dam in February last year. The suspects took a video while attacking him and later
posted it on social media. The minors who are believed to belong to Madhura gang group
were pupils in several schools in town.
