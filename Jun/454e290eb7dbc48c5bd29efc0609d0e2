Like buying the right bra for your boobs, buying underwear isn't an easy thing. Knowing your body shape can help you a lot with understanding which types of garments will look good on you, and this includes knickers. According to reports, lingerie sales have shot up by 60% since compared to last year during the current lockdown. Below are the best underwear types for the bum shape you might have: - Low-cut briefs are perfect for coverage and will suit heart-shaped bottoms best - Thongs are a great option if you have a H-shaped bum as it will create the illusion that you have curves - High-waisted knickers are perfect for cherry-shaped bums and if you have larger hips - Tangas are very flattering for those who have a V-shaped bum - French bikinis are elegant and will balance your shape if you have a trapeze-shaped bum   Illustration from thesun.co.uk
