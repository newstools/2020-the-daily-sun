YOUNG people should be at the forefront of reshaping the country after the coronavirus pandemic ends. That was what President Cyril Ramaphosa said during his interaction with young business people yesterday to commemorate Youth Day. “As young people, we need to ask ourselves: are we prepared to continue living with the inequality that has persisted forever and a day? “I beg for ideas, I want young people to contribute to a new vision. We need to create a new economy,” he said. “Young people are being called upon to build an inclusive economy, an economy that will rid our country of inequality, poverty and unemployment.” Ramaphosa said there had to be life after the coronavirus and the government was looking forward to new ideas. “We want young people to speak out and step forward. We need to set up different ways of running our economy, of the ownership of the economy and production,” he said. He said Mzansi could no longer afford to have a situation where young people in rural areas didn’t have access to technology that would allow them to study. “This pandemic provides us with an opportunity to inject new perspectives into how we can turn our economy around but also how we can re-imagine our very society,” he said. Ramaphosa said the need to support local businesses was even more important than ever. Some young people shared their thoughts on how to build the country going forward. One participant said: “I think we need to go the route of supporting the youth to unlock their business potential by providing direct grants without subjecting them to bureaucratic processes. There is a lot of red tape. “Training must be compulsory for all projects or proposals that are awarded grants to advance or start a business.”
