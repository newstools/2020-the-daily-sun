TROUBLED clothing retailer Edcon says retrenchment notices were sent to staff as the company has not had offers from buyers interested in the company. Executive of corporate affairs Vannie Pillay said the company sent Section 189 retrenchment notices to 22 000 workers, meaning the jobs of everyone employed by the retailer were at risk. The company owns Edgars and Jet and employs 17 000 people full time and 5 000 seasonal workers. “We did send notices to all our staff as per the Labour Relations Act because we have no binding offers that have been received at this stage,” said Pillay. Edcon said before going into voluntary business rescue in April, lockdown caused it to lose R2 billion in sales. The business rescue plan that Edcon published last week suggested that employees would be transferred to potential buyers of the businesses. At the time, the plan said only unavoidable retrenchments would take place if there were staff who were not absorbed by buyers after the accelerated sales. The business rescue practitioners were supposed to get final offers from businesses and parties interested in buying Edcon’s divisions by the end of this month and finalise successful bids by early next month. – FIN24
