TEN families were left traumatised after men stormed their homes with weapons. It happened at Rama City in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, on Tuesday morning. According to the families, the men smashed the windows and doors of their newly-built houses. Community leader Godfrey Legodi (44) said the men arrived in two cars at about 8am. He said he was walking on the street when the men stopped their cars and grabbed him roughly. “They tied me up with cable ties and told me to show them the houses I’ve sold. They forcibly put me in one of their cars and drove away.”  Godfrey thought they were going to kill him as they threatened to make him disappear. He said the men drove with him to the new houses and broke the windows and doors. “They kept saying these people don’t belong here and they should leave.” Godfrey said the families had recently moved in to the houses.  “The houses belong to the City of Tshwane and provincial government. They were built for military veterans, and those are the only people who have the right to stay there. “I’m surprised when the men said those people shouldn’t live there.” Godfrey said they called the police and the men were bust, but they were later released. “We’re now living in fear that the men will come back. Maybe this time they will kill me.” House occupant Ernest Luka (57) said he was hit on the head with a hammer when he tried to stop the men from vandalising his home.  “They barged into my house and I felt a sharp pain on my head when I asked what was happening.” He said the men pointed guns at them. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of theft and assault was opened at Akasia Police Station. “The suspects were arrested and later released on a warning. They are expected to appear in the Pretoria North Magistrates Court on 30 September,” said Masondo.
