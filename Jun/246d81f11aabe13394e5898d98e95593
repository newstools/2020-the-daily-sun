EXPERTS and ordinary people have shared their views on gender-based violence. Many welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech addressing the matter on Wednesday. Others said lockdown had caused cases to spike. Ramaphosa promised the justice system would focus on the matter. Patrick Godana of Sisonke Gender Justice said: “We welcome the president’s commitment in dealing with cases of gender-based violence, and police for doing their best with swift arrests. “Violence against women and children is indeed a pandemic. We need to see implementation in fast-tracking the cases, but prevention is key.” He said justice delayed is justice denied. “We have cases still waiting for prosecution from as far back as 2016. “The journey in seeking justice is long and lonely. That’s why victims drop these cases.” People Opposing Women Abuse counselling manager, Jeanette Sera, said the gruesome killings showed men had a deep hatred for women. “We need justice which will give women and children hope. “Perpetrators need to know the minute they kill, they’ll rot in jail.” Professor Thabisile Buthelezi said: “Bring back old values.” Solly Seerane (50) said: “Since 1994, women have been given too many rights. Men are tired. That’s why there’s an increase in violence.” Elliot Thoka (40) said: “Men must stop abusing women. We can’t make excuses for them such as lockdown or alcohol.”
