UNITED in song, the ANC and EFF put aside their differences to fight for justice. Members of the parties chanted outside the Roodepoort Magistrates Court yesterday, where Muzikayise Malephane (31) appeared in connection with the premeditated murder of eight-month pregnant Tshegofatso Pule (28). Pule was last seen leaving her home in Meadowlands, Soweto on 4 June to visit her boyfriend in Florida. Her body was found the following day hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort with a stab wound to her chest. Malephane made his second appearance in court yesterday.  His matter was postponed to 2 July. Last week, he told magistrate Joseph Baloyi he would abandon his bail application. Malephane, who appeared via a video link from Krugersdorp Prison yesterday, also abandoned the services of a Legal Aid lawyer and requested private representation. EFF provincial chairman Itani Mukwevho vowed the party would attend every appearance until Pule’s family got the justice they deserved. “This cannot be a once-off thing. “We have to attend and show support to the family. “We also need to send a strong message that we condemn all barbaric acts against women and children,” said Mukwevho. Pule’s uncle, Tumi Katake, called for the public to remain calm and allow court processes to unfold.  He said the family was still in deep pain and speculations on social media didn’t make it any easier. “What I’m observing is that the accused is deliberately causing delays. I know that suspects have a right to change their legal representatives, but it’s a stalling tactic,” said Katake.
