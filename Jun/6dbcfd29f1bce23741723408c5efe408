HE thought his kids would always have a place to call home, but after spending 17 years renovating the RDP, Collins Mathabathe was kicked out of the house. The 52-year-old from Klipgat, North West, said they were given the RDPs by their then ward councillor in 2003. “The owners of the houses were not moving in, and the councillor told us to occupy them so they wouldn’t be vandalised,” he said. Collins said he renovated the house over the years, but then he got sick and went to stay at his family home. “I found tenants and put them in the house while I was recovering,” he said. Collins said the tenants stayed at the house from 2014 until 2018. When they left, he moved back in. “One day I was called by the neighbours while I was away. “They said there had been a break-in,” he said. Collins said when he got home, people claiming to be the RDP owners served him with an eviction letter. “They didn’t even give me a chance to take my furniture,” he said. Collins said he had never met the people before. He said although he didn’t own the house legally, he felt violated. “They took my furniture and are using my things. I need my furniture back,” he said. Collins said he left behind a bed, TV, amplifier, DVD, washing machine and two couches. The SunTeam called the new occupants, but with no luck. They went to the house twice, but no one was home. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of burglary was opened at Mabopane Police Station, but no arrests have been made.
