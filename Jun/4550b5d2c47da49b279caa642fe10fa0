ABOUT 100 families are currently rebuilding their shacks after raging flames swept through their shacks. The families from Lacey Road in Overport, Durban said last night they had to sleep at their neighbours homes while others went to a nearby hall after the flames burnt down their shacks yesterday. They said they are still not sure what caused the fire which left them homeless but they suspect that the fire was caused by an electrical fault from one of the shacks.  One of the affected residents Sukumile Ngcobo (59) told Daily Sun that she was at her shack when she heard other residents shouting that there was fire. She said she went out to see and by that time the flames were already close to her three-roomed shack. "I also shouted that my grandchildren to run out of the shack because there was fire. They came out and we all stood outside watching the flames burning down our shack," she said. She said she lost everything in the fire.  "We lost everything including my grand children's school uniform. We are left with the clothes that we are wearing because we couldn't save anything," she said. Another affected resident Ntombenhle Mdlalose (45) said she had to sleep at her friend's shack with her five children. "Today we don't know where we will sleep because we haven't started rebuilding our shack," she said.  She said she also lost everything she had in the fire. "My children and I don't have clothes and food to eat. Everything was burnt down," she said. The eThekwini municipality Executive Council (EXCO) member who paid a visit to the area Thanduxolo Sabela said the eThekwini municipality has given the affected families building materials. "We've been told that 65 shacks burnt down so about 100 residents are affected. Today we brought them building materials and some have started rebuilding. We also brought them food. We hope that by Tuesday all of them will have shelter over their heads," he said. He said the cause of fire hasn't been established.
