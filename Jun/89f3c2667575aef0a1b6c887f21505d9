THEY found the perfect spot in a parking lot between JMPD offices and the Roodepoort Magistrates Court to service clients. But lockdown crippled the magoshas’ business because their clients spent lot of time at home. Speaking to Daily Sun, a 44-year-old woman from Mathole, who has been in business for 15 years, said: “It’s been tough, but at least I don’t go home empty-handed.” She said they now have the extra cost of buying sanitiser. “I apply sanitiser on my thighs and butt and give some to the client to disinfect his hands before we get down to business. “We do one style facing away from the client to maintain some social distancing,” she said. The woman said they felt safer working in that particular street, as there were security guards. Another woman (31) said poverty led her to do the job.  “I had no choice because I had to survive. “I take home R800 on a good night,” she said.  She said she also sanitised before she got down to business, but it was costly as it had to be done with every client. Another woman said this was not an easy job as their lives were at risk every night. “There are a lot of challenges we face here, sometimes a client pays you R350 for a couple of hours. When it’s time to leave, they rob you of the same money they’ve just paid and leave you in the middle of the road in the early morning,” she said.
