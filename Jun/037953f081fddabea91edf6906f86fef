He however didn't not disclose his next move. "Friends, and loyal  listeners of The Eusebius McKaiser Show on 702, I confirm the news that I am indeed leaving 702. I'm deeply moved by your voluminous messages of support and love," he said. Eusebius said he had the opportunity to continue hosting the show, but he has decided to venture into other business projects. "It really isn't deep. I have the irritating trait of  enjoying multiple careers as a writer, analyst,consultant, lecturer and broadcaster, and i want to divvy up my time differently going on forward. It is a strategic decision in the long making," he said. Ending his statement the talented radio host said this is not the end of his broadcast career, people should watch the space. "I am not ending my broadcasting career. I am not self-banishing as an analyst. My voice is not going away. The stakes are to high for me to choose silence and my commitment to my crafts are too central to my identity to let go of," he said. He will be replaced by Clement Manyathela. SEE TWEETS BELOW:
