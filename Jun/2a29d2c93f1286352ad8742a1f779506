The Joburg High Court has found hip hop artist Thulani Ngcobo guilty of culpable homicide. The musician who is popularly known as Pitch Black Afro has been facing ongoing trial for allegedly killing his wife Catherine Modisane, who was found dead at a bed and breakfast in Jozi two years ago. According to TshisaLive Judge J du Plessis told the court the Matofotofo hitmaker presented himself as a poor witness. "He presented himself as a poor witness under questions from the state."

The judge further said the state didn't prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ngcobo had planned to kill Modisane, but added that it was clear from the postmortem report that she died from blunt-force trauma to the head. After hearing the news, Pitch Black Afro did not take it well and claimed he was forced to admit to the crime. "I won't take this lying down. Bayang'sukela. They've wasted one-and-a-half years of my life," he said.
