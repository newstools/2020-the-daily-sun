THE ANC has called on law enforcement agencies and human rights bodies to investigate charges against those engaged in hateful acts against Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This after a picture of the co-operative governance and traditional affairs minister was modified to make her look like an ape. The picture made the rounds of social media. They said the latest attacks on her were a continuation of similar attacks waged against her as minister of health when she took on tobacco lobby groups and pharmaceutical companies. “As a consequence of her bravery, our health system was able to focus on preventive measures that have now enabled the tertiary health sector to be in a better situation to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic,” said ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina. Human Rights Commission head Advocate Tseliso Thipanyane confirmed that investigations were being handled by the commission’s Western Cape branch. The images were widely spread on social media, and it was not yet clear who the perpetrator was. ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte called Danie Herselman, allegedly the man behind the picture, a racist with no respect for human life. Social media users were also disgusted by the picture. One user, @Naldalo84, said: “Please open a case against Danie Herselman. This type of behaviour should be corrected in the form of punishment.”
