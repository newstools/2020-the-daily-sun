AFTER getting calls and messages from people fighting the coronavirus, Khayelitsha Councillor Ncumisa Mahangu has started a support group. About the Together We Can Conquer group, Ncumisa said: “Many don’t have a support system at home.  “Stress and anxiety become heavy if you are alone and dealing with sickness. Some have lost their loved ones, while others are still battling.” There are 20 women in the group. “The aim is to empower women as they’re the backbone of society. We want to curb the spread of the virus and break the stigmatisation of those who have tested positive,” said Ncumisa. Mum of three Phumla Milisi-Somlomo (43) didn’t know what to do when she tested positive. “If people got their results the day after taking the test, it would spread less. The waiting period is killing us,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the group, maybe I’d be dead by now. We also pray together.” Zamahlubi Radebe (52) urged people to take the virus seriously. “Finding out you are positive is stressful. You need every kind of support.” She used flu medication to treat the symptoms. “When you are sick, you use everything. You cannot just wait to die and do nothing. Try everything and pray,” she said.
