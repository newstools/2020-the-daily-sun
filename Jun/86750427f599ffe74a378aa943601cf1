It’s time for the country to look at gender-based violence from the grassroots. South Africans should stop being advocates of social ills only on social media. The hashtags are never enough to tackle the abuse and killing of women. They are not protecting African women. It’s time we stop raising our voices on social media. We must implement measures that will make a perpetrator think twice before abusing women. Our boys should be taught from a young age how girls should be treated. It’s time we put down the hashtags and embark on a fight to create a safer South Africa for women.
