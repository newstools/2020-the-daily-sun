TIED to a tree and severely wounded while the angry mob shouted “burn these dogs”, Sphiwe Kodisang and his friend thought they were going to die. Next to him a man tried to start a fire with a piece of paper. He threw it at the victims, but police showed up and dispersed the angry mob. That’s when Sphiwe (40) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, realised a life of drugs almost got him killed. The incident happened over three years ago when Sphiwe and his friend, who were known as nyaope boys, were accused of stealing. As this week marks Substance Abuse Awareness Week, he shared the story of how he almost died because of drugs and his journey to recovery. Sphiwe said before the drugs he had a job, house, wife and kids. But his life came crumbling down after he lost his job. “I befriended the wrong people and got into drugs. I started with zol and gradually went to heavier ones like nyaope and crystal meth,” said Sphiwe.  His wife left him and took the kids with her. Sphiwe sold everything to feed his addiction. He lived a life of drugs until he saw his life flash before his eyes. “I decided to change my life. I didn’t even commit the crimes I was beaten for. I was a suspect by association,” he said. Sphiwe went to rehab for a year and six weeks after the incident. “I’ve been sober for about three years and 11 months. I was able to get back my family, but unfortunately lost my wife shortly thereafter,” he said. He does motivational speaking in schools on drug abuse. “I help young boys and get them admitted to rehabs through Ikamva Elisha Vosloorus Home-Based Care. I work there,” he said.
