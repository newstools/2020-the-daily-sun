TRACING people who’ve been in contact with those who had tested positive for coronavirus was the weakest link in South Africa’s fight against the coronavirus. In a virtual meeting with the SA National Editors’ Forum, President Cyril Ramaphosa admitted that in Mzansi, two people were traced with each contact whereas in countries such as South Korea, as many as 20 people were traced per case. “Nationally, around 96% of identified contacts are being traced, although this number is significantly lower in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape,” said the president. He said because of growing shortages of testing kits, testing will be targeted. He also said with people returning to work under level 3, government will be expanding the screening effort to places where people congregate. “Our approach to this pandemic has been informed by the view from the scientific community that most South Africans are likely to be infected by the virus, at some point,” said Ramaphosa. “Our strategy has therefore been to prevent a massive spike in infections by delaying the rate of infections, and to simultaneously prepare our health system.” He said with the help of various governments, companies and foundations, the government has been able to mobilise significant quantities of personal protection equipment, other medical suppliers and ventilators. “To date, over 27 000 beds in the public sector have been allocated to Covid-19 patients. The field hospitals that are currently being constructed will have around 13 000 beds,” he said. Ramaphosa repeated that lockdown has helped the government prepare, and warned that the spike is likely to rise in the coming days. He apologised for some of the regulations which he said were not clearly communicated. He said some contrasting messages coming from different ministers could be because of them being overenthusiastic.
