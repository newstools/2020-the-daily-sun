IT’S another tragic day in Mzansi as yet another social media hashtag notes the gruesome death of a young woman whose promising life was snuffed out. A week ago Tshegofatso Pule was hopeful and looking forward to bringing a new life into this world. The eight-month pregnant Tshegofatso went missing for a few days and was found murdered this week. She was stabbed 10 times and her lifeless body hanged on a tree in a horrible crime that defies comprehension. Her family is shattered following the double murder, which we write about on page 4 today. The last person she was seen with was her lover. The scourge of femicide in Mzansi keeps on rearing its ugly head. During stricter lockdown levels last month, over 1 400 domestic violence cases were reported in Gauteng alone. A national helpline to help abused women and kids recorded 120 000 calls during April and last month. We live in a country where violence against women and children has become a norm as shocking cases such as that of Tshegofatso are reported frequently. Laws that have been enacted to stem this violence are only good on paper, yet more women and children are still vulnerable to the other epidemic. The violence visited on many women in Mzansi thrives more in an environment that’s not doing enough to condemn it. Hashtags are useless when you have an ineffective, overwhelmed police force and lack of targeted and swift prosecutions for these types of crimes. Perpetrators know they can beat the system with fancy lawyers who put police investigations to shame. As long as these killers continue to undermine our justice system and view it as toothless, the killing of women and children will not stop. – EDITOR
