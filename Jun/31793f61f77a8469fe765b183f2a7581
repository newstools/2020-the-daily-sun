THE cast of SABC 2’s popular soapie Muvhango has been told to stay home as they will not be shooting until further notice. This came after a staff member at Word of Mouth Pictures came into contact with a person infected with the coronavirus. Sources close to the situation told Daily Sun when the news broke, none of the stars were on set. The source said: “Only admin staff and those working for Word of Mouth Pictures were there. So the person who came into contact with an infected person is not a staff member.” Another source said the case found out they wouldn’t be reporting for duty via text. “There’s a multi-messaging system that is used to communicate with all the cast members, so they were contacted this week and informed not to come to work,” said the source. A third informant told the SunTeam things happened very fast.“There was a meeting with all senior producers where they waited for a decision from the SABC. Within two hours, the offices were empty,” explained the source. Muvhango producer Hebert Hadebe said in a statement that the decision was made to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus. He said the cast and crew was asked to self-isolate until further notice. With the help of the SABC, the set would be disinfected. Word Of Mouth publicity manager Thanduxolo Jindela said although it had not been decided when production would start again, there were enough episodes to air. “As far as episodes are concerned, we’ve recorded enough to last until later in the year, so viewers shouldn’t worry,” he said. Now our priority is ensuring the safety of all our staff,” he said.
