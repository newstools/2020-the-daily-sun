DJ and producer DJ Lesh SA has won the hearts of audiences from abroad, and now wants to win South Africans over. The musician, whose real name is Thulani Nyambe, said his music is recognised in many countries. Speaking to SunBuzz, Lesh from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni said: “I’ve performed in Greece, Belgium, USA, Angola, France, Kenya, United Kingdom and Germany. That’s where my songs are loved the most. “I was discovered by a guy from the United States, and that’s how my name got big. “So I’ve basically been more recognised outside Mzansi. But now I want to win over music lovers from home.” Lesh said his career as a DJ came when he used to entertain his family members during functions. “They started calling me ‘DJ’ because I was entertaining them through music. “I realised I enjoyed playing music for people, so I decided to create my own songs. Some of those songs would go viral and people went crazy over them,” he said. Lesh released a single titled Ndibambe featuring Nhlanhla Dube in February, and is working on an EP. When he’s not making music, Lesh is running his organisation, the Lesh SA Foundation. “We motivate school kids, so they know that their background doesn’t determine their future. “We also buy them school uniforms and other necessities that they need,” he said.
