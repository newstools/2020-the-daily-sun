HOSPITAL staff have called for the name of a nurse who tested positive for the coronavirus to be made public. This has put Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba at odds with staff members at Van Velden Hospital in Tzaneen. The nurse apparently had a private test done, and the results came back positive on Monday. Ramathuba said it was disappointing to see healthcare workers stigmatise a colleague. She said they were being insensitive for making such demands. Staff also demanded that the MEC shut down the whole hospital. Department spokesman Neil Shikwambana said no hospital will be shut down. “We have positive cases at many hospitals and they’re still operating. “If we close every hospital that has health workers testing positive, who is going to take care of our people? “You can imagine what’s going to happen if we shut down hospitals every time a nurse or doctor tests positive. People should stop stigmatising others. This is a very big problem, and why people are afraid to come out when they’ve tested positive for the coronavirus,” said Shikwambana. Apparently, more than 60 people who came into close contact with the nurse have been traced, tested and quarantined while waiting for results. They include the nurse’s family and colleagues. The department said the hospital was disinfected and health services were being provided. Limpopo has so far recorded 198 positive cases, 145 recoveries and three deaths with 50 active cases.
