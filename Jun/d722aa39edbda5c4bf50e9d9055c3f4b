COMMERCIAL radio station Kaya FM has been forced to close shop after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19. A source said employees were sent emails on Wednesday informing them they shouldn’t come to work. According to a statement from the station, management decided to immediately close premises after a confirmed Covid-19 case among staff. “Our priority is the health and safety of all our employees. The Kaya FM building will be temporarily closed while a deep cleansing process is carried out until further notice,” it read. Managing director Greg Maloka said: “I have every confidence in the protocols put in place by our management team and our teams’ capabilities to ensure the safety of our employees without interrupting our ability to broadcast. We will get through this together as a company and as a society at large.” The station has taken special measures since the beginning of lockdown to ensure its workers’ health.
