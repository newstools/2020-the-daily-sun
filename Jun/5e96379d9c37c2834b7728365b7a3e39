CHAOS erupted at Home Affairs yesterday when parents and security guards clashed. Cops were called to Umgeni Home Affairs, KZN, after parents who wanted to apply for their kids’ IDs became furious. Matric pupils from four different schools in Durban were invited to apply for IDs yesterday. But when they arrived in buses, the queues were already very long. This was because scores of parents and pupils who had not been invited had arrived early in the morning. The trouble started when officials and guards took the invited pupils to the front of the line. The parents in the queue stood at the entrance and stopped the invited pupils from entering. Parent Thembi Mkhize (45) said she arrived at 5am to apply for her son’s ID. “I heard from a neighbour that ID applications were being done today,” she said. Officials later came out and calmed the situation. KZN Home Affairs spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said a campaign for pupils, especially matrics, to apply for their IDs was being launched. “We invited four schools and expected about 80 pupils. News spread over social media and there were a lot of people.” He said they explained that they had to prioritise the invited pupils. “We said those we couldn’t help could put down their names and return over the weekend,” said Mncwabe.
