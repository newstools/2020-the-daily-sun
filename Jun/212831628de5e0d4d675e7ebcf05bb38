A school principal has tested positive in the North
West as teachers are preparing for school-reopening next week. On Thursday teachers woke up to the news that a
56-year-old principal tested positive for the virus. The North West Education Department said it cannot
name the school or area where the school principal work because they needed to
protect his identity. “This is a sensitive matter which needs to be treated
with the sensitivity it deserves. This involves the lives of people and we
should remember the issue of stigmatization,” department spokesman Elias
Malindi said. He said on Monday, 01 June 2020, the school principal
reported that he was not feeling well and decided to see a doctor. On arrival, the doctor suggested a test for COVID-19
since the school principal was showing symptoms. Malindi said the results confirmed the positive status
on Tuesday, 02 June 2020, and immediately the principal was subjected to a
14-day self-quarantine. The North West Education MEC, Mmaphefo Matsemela said
she was shocked. “As the department, we are very much shocked to learn
about this news. We are working with the Department of Health who has advised
us to close the school with immediate effect. We will be relying on their
expert advice throughout this period,” she said. Provincial health department spokesman Tebogo
Lekgethwane said his department will begin with contact tracing immediately after
the school principal reveals the names of people he was in contact with. Sadtu spokesman Els Themba said the news caused panic
among teachers but will wait for a proper report on the matter.
