THE World Cup is never short of controversy and the 2010 Fifa showpiece was no exception. From the buzzing vuvuzelas to Suarez’s infamous handball, the tournament had many talking points. Kgomotso Sethusha picks out FIVE of the controversies. German v England match: It could be argued that the Video Assistant Refereeing (VAR) had its genesis right here in Mzansi 10 years earlier. That was when two incidents, which put the spotlight on dubious refereeing, occurred. Frank Lampard’s disallowed goal against Germany and Carlos Tevez’s goal for Argentina against Mexico in the round of 16 certainly revived debate over the lack of VAR. The Jabulani soccer ball: Some said it was a “supermarket” ball which favoured the strikers and disadvantaged the goalkeepers, while others praised its unpredictability. The Jabulani ball divided opinion and some UK newspapers even suggested it might have been the reason for a low scoring rate in the first round. Suarez infamous handball: I doubt Luis Suarez would dare set football in Ghana in this lifetime. The Uruguayan striker earned himself persona non-grata status when he literally stopped an ”African dream”. An instinctive handball on the goal-line prevented Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the last-minute of the quarter-final match and later saw Ghana lose to Uruguayhe on penalties. The French Revolution: From the moment Thierry Henry scored the dramatic winner to secure France World Cup qualification spot against Ireland, the French World Cup story was riddled with controversy. The players boycotted training in protest against the dismissal of Nicholas Anelka who’d been highly critical of coach Raymond Domenech. The Vuvuzela: What would the World Cup have been without the vuvuzela? The noisy instrument courted controversy that it was part of every interview with football officials. But Fifa president Sepp Blatter defended it.
