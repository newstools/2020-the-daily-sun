BY DEFINITION, setting goals means setting the objective of one's ambition or effort. These are the benchmarks we set for ourselves in different parts of our lives, from our careers to our physical bodies, friendships and relationships, but who said we cannot do the same when it comes to sex? Sex has become more than a physical transaction between people. It has become an almost sacred event that involves a cocktail of emotions, and has become a benchmark for relationships, from performance to size and satisfaction. Sex has also become goal orientated, and here we look at how your sex goals should look like.  Gone are the days when the one partner needs to be more satisfied than the other. These days, everyone wants to feel sexually liberated. Like they say, it's twice as nice.  I will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the Outsurance adverts on TV, but I totally love their tagline, "You always get something out", something I believe should form part of your sex goals.

Singer Lira sums it up beautifully when she sings: "I just wanna feel good, everyday. I want to wear a smile upon my face".
