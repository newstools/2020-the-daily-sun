Kaizer Chiefs defender Njabulo Blom says he is recovering well from the injury he sustained playing for the club's reserve side. The talented 20-year-old pulled a thigh muscle against Baroka reserves in February. As the up-and-coming Amakhosi centre-back hopes for a return to football, Blom explained he is no stranger to hard work having grown up in a difficult environment. Blom told the club's official website: "As far as my injury from tight thigh muscle our technical team have been supportive and giving me all the necessary treatment and encouragement, I need. "I am okay now and once we get back to the fields, I should be ready to return to playing." Reflecting on his time with the senior side, Blom recalled a match with Mamelodi Sundowns, where Chiefs won 2-0. He said: "It was my first big match I played since I turned out for the first team. I think I did well on the day and from the feedback I received it really made me proud, I will always cherish that moment. "Most importantly is to use that performance as a yardstick to be repeated consistently going forward. It was a high tempo game and I am glad I helped the team to perform on the day." He added: "It has been hard to reach this point in my career. I come from a disadvantaged family and it is difficult to be accepted in society when you come from a humble background. My mom has been strict and central to avoid getting off the rails. I want to thank her for she has kept me focused on discipline."
