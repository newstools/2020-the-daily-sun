THE QWABE twins are rising stars. Besides that they are doing well in their music career, they are forever in the public eye, not even the lockdown prevents them from being seen in public. They are making sure that they are maintaining the fame that they shot to when they were contestants of Idols SA. Viggy and Virginia Qwabe have been recognised by the KZN magazine NOS Magazine. They made it to the cover of the latest edition of the magazine, which will be on shelves on Sunday. The excited twins took the news to their Instagram page. This happens just after they bought the car. Viggy said that they are excited to be on the cover. "Not everyone made it to the cover of the magazine. We feels like stars and we believe that God is leading the way," she said. She hinted that they are working on an Afro-soul song to be released soon. "Our single Hamba is doing well and we are hopping that our song that we are busy with, will also do well," said Viggy. Read:Â TRENDING SA IS COMING BACK Youthful with the Qwabetwins!
