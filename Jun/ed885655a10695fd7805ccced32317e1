MARITZBURG United are keeping defender Siyanda Xulu… for now. The club have agreed to keep the KwaMashu-born defender until the end of this suspended season, which was stopped in March due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Clubs were given a guideline by Fifa to retain players whose contracts expire at the end of the month and those who have signed pre-contracts with other clubs until the season is completed. But the final decision has been left to clubs and the players. However, the Midlands club were non-committal on whether the centre back, who was named PSL Defender of the Season in 2017-18, will remain at the club beyond this term. Xulu joined the Team of Choice at the beginning of the 2017-18 season on a three-year contract, following his release from Kaizer Chiefs. “Siyanda will stay on at Maritzburg and complete the season and that is the agreement,” said the player’s agent, Paul Mitchell. There have been talks that Xulu, who has been plagued by injuries this season – including missing the Telkom Knockout final in December, is set to leave as he has reported to have got the attention of SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates. When Mitchell was asked if Xulu will stay on beyond this season with Maritzburg, he said: “At the moment, Siyanda is out of contract at the end of the season and he’s staying for now to complete the season. We will obviously look at the situation. “But Maritzburg have always shown an intention of keeping him, and we’ve been talking to them. At the moment, his concentration is to finish the season. He’s finishing the season with Maritzburg and then we’ll sit down with Maritzburg to discuss the way forward.”
