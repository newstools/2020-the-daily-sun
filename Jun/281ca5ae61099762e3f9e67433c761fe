EASTERN Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has announced his province
wants to stop the sale of booze! Speaking during a video interview on Enca ,Mabuyane said his
Provincial Command Council plans to approach the National Command Council and
ask to ban booze sales in the province. “We really want to close down this problem. We can’t be a country
that celebrates alchohol the way we have seen.” Booze sales reopened last Monday at the start of level 3 of
the national lockdown. That day alone 10 people died in the province in car
accidents or as pedestrians who were knocked down. Mabuyane said funerals were still a big problem in the province
in its fight against Covid-19 and that even the 50 limit was not enough if one
person among those allowed at funerals was infected. Weekend news reports of provincial newspapers painted a grim
picture in the province’s private hospitals which are said to be getting full
and are also accused of not protection staff. The Eastern Cape has the second highest numbers of Covid-19
cases in Mzansi with 5974 cases and 101 deaths. Speaking in Mpumalanga earlier ,Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize
said there was no shortage of PPEs in Mzansi and
that in the Eastern Cape a challenge affecting the distribution of PPEs were
the tensions between the provincial health department and health worker unions.
