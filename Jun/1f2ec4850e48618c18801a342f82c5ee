Scores of commuters were left stranded in parts of Gauteng as the taxi industry embarked on a strike on Monday. This resulted in several Gauteng roads being blockaded.  Taxi drivers affiliated to the SA National Taxi Council protested against ‘insufficient’ government relief offered to the industry.  Traffic has now been reported to be flowing in both directions after soldiers ordered taxi operators to open the blocked road on as you leave Soshanguve joining the R80 Mabopane Highway. Police were also reported to have fired rubber bullets at protesting taxi drivers.  The council is demanding R20 000 per vehicle.  The Mabopane highway and R55 were among the roads that were blockaded.  Speaking in an interview on Radio 702, Santaco spokesperson Thabiso Molelekwa condemned the reported intimidation of motorists and commuters. There were reports that commuters were pulled off buses.
