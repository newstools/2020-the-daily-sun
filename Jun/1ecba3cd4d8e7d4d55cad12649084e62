THE family of an 11-year-old girl whose half-naked body was found in a sugarcane field in Dokodweni, KZN north coast on Monday, says they want cops to arrest the culprit. Amanda Mthembu’s body was found eight days after she went missing on 14 June. Her family said she was raped before being strangled. Aunt Snethemba Xulu (30) said they suspected the suspect might be someone Amanda knew very well.  Snethemba said they were saddened by the incident. “Amanda was still very young. She had all her life ahead of her, but the monster chose to cut her life short. We are saddened that such an innocent soul was killed in a brutal manner. That’s why we want the suspect to be nabbed and rot in jail.”  She said on the day Amanda disappeared, she had left her dad’s home to visit relatives at her mum’s home. They found it strange because Amanda always used to walk to the two homes all by herself. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said on Monday, the half-naked body of a girl (11) was found by Gingindlovu cops and the Umhlali K9 unit at Dokodweni Reserve. “She was allegedly strangled. A murder case was opened for investigation.”
