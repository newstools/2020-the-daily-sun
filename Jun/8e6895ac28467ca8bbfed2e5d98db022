WHILE some people are questioning the presence of God, others like Pastor Mandla Tshabalala have unshakeable faith. Mandla (50) is the pastor of House of Grace Ministries from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. He is taking the word of God to malls and shopping centres, and will continue until he sees a positive change. He started preaching on Saturday at Naledi Mall, and he’s planning to go to Chris Hani, Katlehong and Thokoza. Mandla told Daily Sun he has seen how people were losing their faith during lockdown. “This is the time where our faith in God must be strong,” Mandla said. “God promised to come back to earth. He never said He’ll end the world with the coronavirus.” He said people needed to pray for each other and the leaders. Mandla said he’s been helping couples who need to talk about their relationships. “People are not used to being with their partners day and night.” He said he planned to have a double service for his church members and members will have to register to fit into the first or second service. Mandla has been helping families by donating food parcels.
