With AmaZulu currently in danger of losing their status in the top flight, one would think survival is the only thing on any of their player’s minds. However, that is not the case as one of Usuthu’s longest serving players, Tapelo Xoki, still dreams big despite his club’s current predicament. The Khayelitsha-born defender wants to win silverware with the KwaZulu Natal outfit and emulate the man who brought him to the club, George Dearnely. Dearnely was part of the last Usuthu team to win a major trophy, clinching the Coca-Cola Cup in 1992. The ambitious Xoki believes it is high time Usuthu added another trophy in their cabinet that is now probably gathering a lot of dust. “Well, I want to leave a legacy here at AmaZulu FC. A legacy I can be proud of and the one the club can also be proud of,” Xoki told his club. “This includes winning trophies with the team and emulate the man, who brought me to this club, George Dearnely. “When I arrived here I made a promise to myself that I would like to accomplish what George achieved with the team and also win a trophy or two with the club. “I want to set an example for future generations, who will also play for this club by making my mark and leave a legacy.” The 25-year-old, who has captained Usuthu during his time at the club, is a key member of team now having spent six years with the KZN side. Xoki has made 21 appearances across all competitions for AmaZulu this season. “I want to leave a legacy here at this club,” Xoki added. “I want to leave a legacy that I can be proud of and one the club can also be proud of.” His immediate goal, however, will be to help AmaZulu stave off relegation when league action resumes. Usuthu are currently second from bottom with 23 points from 24 matches, just three points clear of bottom team Black Leopards.
