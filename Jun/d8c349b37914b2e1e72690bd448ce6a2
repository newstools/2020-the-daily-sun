ARREST the political kingpins implicated in the VBS scandal! That is the call going out after the arrest of eight VBS officials on Wednesday by the Hawks. The VBS scandal has implicated former ANC Limpopo treasurer Danny Msiza, and deputy chairwoman Florence Radzilani as the masterminds who ensured municipalities illegally invested in the mutual bank. Provincial PAC chairman Pitso Mpasha said they were hoping the second phase of arrests would net kingpins who used their political power to order municipalities to invest andofficials who submitted to illegal orders by political kingpins. DA Limpopo leader Jacques Smalle said The Great Bank Heist Report commissioned by the Reserve Bank outlined how ANC officials and politicians, as well as leading EFF politicians, were linked to the crimes. “According to the report, ANC Limpopo treasurer at the time, Danny Msiza, was allegedly the kingpin of the scheme that would see politicians and officials receiving commission for ensuring municipality deposits and keeping funds at VBS,” he said. Kickbacks to ANC members – allegedly including provincial party heavyweights Radzilani, Gilbert Kganyago and Kabelo Matsepe – and the looting resulted in eight municipalities losing more than R1,2 billion.
