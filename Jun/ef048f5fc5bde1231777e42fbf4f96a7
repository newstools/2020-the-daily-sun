HE tried to scream for help, but it was too late. Thabiso apparently fell asleep and kicked the parrafin heater. When he woke up, the fire was too strong and he burnt to death. The incident, which happened at Phelindaba in Mangaung on Sunday night, left many residents shocked. When the SunTeam visited his home, no relatives were there and neighbours said the councillor had promised to help with his burial. A neighbour said she heard Thabiso’s screams but unfortunately no one could help him. “As the fire became stronger, his screams got louder. The neighbours did everything they could but no one could get inside the house to rescue him. By the time the fire truck arrived, we could no longer hear him. His remains were found inside the house,” said the neighbour. Another neighbour told Daily Sun that the councillor promised to help bury Thabiso if his family couldn’t afford the funeral cost. Councillor Nozimanga Matetha said: “We’re still waiting for the police to complete their investigation. When they’re done, we will see how we can help the family.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said Kagisanong police have opened an inquest docket after a fire at a house in Phelindaba. “It’s suspected that a parrafin heater could have caused the fire. The victim burnt to death.”
