DENELLE Witson, an operational manager at Junction Mall in Philippi in Cape Town, said out of 400 customers, less than 100 went to the supermarket yesterday for essentials. “We were shocked to see most of them going to the liquor stores on the first day of level 3.” She told Daily Sun: “We only take 400 customers as soon as we see the ones inside left our premises.” Of the two entrances at the mall, they only opened one. “At first we opened all of them, but some customers tried to force their way in when we opened for those driving.” Witson said they were stressed about people not maintaining social distancing when queuing outside. “We’ve been telling them about the importance of social distancing, but outside they don’t apply it. We make sure when they get inside we stick to our plan. “We’ve used trolleys to make sure there’s space between them, even inside the shops.” Watson said they knew people would come in numbers but didn’t know they’d only buy booze. “Since we’re having long queues at the supermarkets, we thought we’re going to have those, but it wasn’t to be.” Witson said now with level 3, they were expecting more customers. “We’re ready and prepared,” she said. Monwabisi Malindi (40) said: “We’ve been waiting for this day since the beginning of the second month of lockdown. Some of us visited the supermarket because we didn’t have a chance to go to liquor stores. Now that they’re open we’re free,” he said. Zodumo Ntuntwana (37) said: “The sad thing about this virus is that you can catch it anywhere. We’re buying booze so we decrease the stress of being infected.”
