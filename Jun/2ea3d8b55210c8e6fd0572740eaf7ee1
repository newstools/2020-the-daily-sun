SOME people have thrown the lockdown rules and regulations out the window. We're on level 3 of the lockdown, but some individuals don't practice social distancing or even wear masks. But when it comes to businesses, it's the owner's responsibility to ensure that the business is complying. JMPD spokesman superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun that officers responded to a complaint coming from Hillbrow. Minnaar said the person was complaining about the problem of social distancing. "When officers arrived at the scene, the shop was overcrowded inside and outside the shop," said Minnaar. He further stated that when officers approached the manager,Â  he said that it is not his problem. "He further emphasised that people should be responsible for themselves because their health is not his problem," he said. The business was shut down immediately for contravening Covid-19 regulations. "The business will be monitored when they reopen, to see if the business is complying with the Covid-19 rules and regulations. I hope this is a lesson to all business who're not complying," said Minnaar.
