THREE suspects were arrested in a foiled robbery on Tuesday after
they were found in possession of firearms and a BMW with cloned number plates in Midrand. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said they
received information about a gang that was going to commit a robbery around
Glen Austin and President Park. “The police kept close observation in the area and
noticed the suspects changing the number of plates in a BMW that matched the
description given. “The suspects were confronted and upon searching them,
police found two unlicensed firearms loaded with ammunition. It was established
that the newly fitted number plates are false,” he said. Masondo said the suspects were charged with possession of
unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “More charges might be added, pending the investigation.
They are expected to appear at Midrand Magistrates Court in due course,” he
added. ALSO READ: WATCH: TSHEGOFATSO PULE MURDER ACCUSED APPEARS IN COURT! Meanwhile, six suspects were also arrested last night in

been opened, the complainant and other personnel were approached by six
suspects in two vehicles, a white Ford Fiesta and a Toyota Hilux bakkie. “The suspects pointed the complainant with a firearm while
the other personnel pressed the panic button to notify security services. The
suspects fled the scene, but were later apprehended by police members,”
