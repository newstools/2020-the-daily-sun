POLICE Minister Bheki Cele won his court case against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane yesterday. The North Gauteng High Court declared the public protector’s report that the SAPS should provide personal protection to two witnesses invalid. Mkhwebane released the report in 2018. It accused Cele of gross negligence, improper conduct and maladministration for failing to protect the lives of Thabiso Zulu and Lesley Stuta, who were corruption whistle-blowers in Umzimkhulu Municipality. Cele’s spokeswoman, Lirandzu Themba, said the minister always had serious reservations about the public protector’s findings. “This is the very reason why he decided to take the report under judicial review,” she said. Themba said in the report, Mkhwebane claimed there had been undue delay on the part of Cele and the police in providing protection to the two men. “Mkhwebane stated that failure by the minister and the police to act exposed the duo to assassination attempts,” she said.  She said Cele welcomed the outcome, which restored the integrity of the SAPS. She said the report had affected the public’s opinion of the police by saying the SAPS was dragging its feet in protecting whistle-blowers.  Cele said: “It has always been clear that while protection of witnesses is paramount, it remains the sole responsibility of the National Prosecution Authority as stated in the Witness Protection Act. The Public Protector should have known this.”
