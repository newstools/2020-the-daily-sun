MBONGENI Ngema has produced a new version of the popular Sarafina title track Freedom is Coming Tomorrow. The song, due for release today, features Emtee, Reason, Gigi Lamayne, Tamarsha, Blaklez, Saudi and MJ Machaba. Mbongeni said he made the new version because he felt the youth needed motivation. “I was inspired by the youth of 1976. They had a goal to liberate themselves and I felt like the youth of today needed something to look up to,” he said. He said he chose the featured artists based on what they were doing at the moment. “My creative team and I looked at people who are doing great and checked what they could contribute to the song. “We had many people in mind but couldn’t choose everyone because it’s a four-minute song,” said Mbongeni. When asked what fans could expect from the song, he said: “It will be an interpretation of today’s sound. I didn’t dictate how the featured artists should do their verse, so it will be diverse.” Emtee said he was honoured to be part of the project. “I’m honoured to be part of such an iconic song. I never thought I’d be in a studio with a legend. It’s been very exciting.” Gigi said she made sure the female voice was heard on the track. “My verse is about girls doing big things. “It’s about us doing what we want to do, when we want to do it. “It has very strong male rappers, so I had to make the female voice heard. “People will enjoy the video and I think it’ll grab a few number one spots on the charts,” said Gigi.
