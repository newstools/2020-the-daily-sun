IT HAS been a devastating two weeks for the Madhovoyo family after the disappearance of their father and husband! The family from Cosmo City in Joburg said the last time they saw Johnson Madhovoyo (47) was on 9 June. They said Johnson was a fire technician who specialised in fire alarms and detection systems. When he left home he was going to a briefing session at the Sonop Old Age Home near Brits, North West, to check fire compliance. His daughter Noreen said he was driving a white Chevrolet bakkie and was wearing a navy-blue golf shirt, blue jeans, blue cap, and a navy-blue bomber jacket with orange takkies. She said they were surprised when he didn’t come back home as he normally did. His phone was off. “We also searched for him and spoke to his friends and colleagues, but no one had seen him,” she said. “We then reported him missing.” Noreen said two days later the cops called. They were hoping the police had found Johnson, but were told they found his burnt-out bakkie outside Tshwane. “It has been difficult coping without knowing if he is still alive. “We are calling on whoever can help in locating his whereabouts to inform us,” Noreen said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a missing persons case was opened at Honeydew police station. .
