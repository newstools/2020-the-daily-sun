 THEY WENT looking for scrap metal in the outside toilet. But they got a lot more than they bargained for. HANGING FROM THE ROOF WAS A SKELETON DRESSED IN A KAIZER CHIEFS JERSEY! Nontobeko Mjoli (41), who lives in the house in Lamontville in Durban that has the outside toilet on the property, told Daily Sun she had not used the toilet for many years. “That toilet is far from the main house and is vandalised,” she said. “It’s far from the house and I’ve never bothered going there or cutting the grass around it. “We stopped using it when new toilets were built in the area.” She said men looking for scrap metal told her on Sunday morning there was a dead person in the toilet. “I was too scared to go and look,” said Nontobeko. “I called the cops and they took the skeleton away. “I heard the skeleton was wearing a Kaizer Chiefs jersey.” She didn’t know where the owners of the house were. A resident said he’d heard about a strong smell coming from the toilet and people had said it might be a dead dog. “Because of the dense bushes people sometimes throw cats or dogs in the bushes,” he said. “I was shocked when I heard that it was a dead person. “Whoever this person was knew very well that if he hanged himself nobody would find him.” Resident Luvuyo Peter (46) said nobody in the area reported that they were missing a family member. “It’s a pity that nobody could recognise who it was,” said Peter. Another resident said it may have been a soccer fan. Lamontville Kaizer Chiefs branch chairman Siyabonga Zwane told the People’s Paper: “I’ve checked with all the members in my branch and they’re all alive. “It’s not a member of my branch.” Councillor Nolubabalo Mthembu didn’t know anything about the skeleton or the toilet. “I’ll find out,” she said. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed to Daily Sun that a skeleton was found hanging from wire. Mbele said Lamontville police had opened an inquest docket.
