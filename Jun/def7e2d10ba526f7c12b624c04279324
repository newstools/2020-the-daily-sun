THE house of famous photographer Sam Nzima is going to be turned into a museum. It was announced on Saturday by the Sam Nzima Foundation as the house in Lillydale, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was handed over by his family. Nzima took the famous picture of Hector Pieterson in the arms of Mbuyisa Makhubu during the 1976 Soweto uprising. Foundation chairman Thulani Nzima said the move aimed to preserve Sam’s legacy. “There’s a three-hectare piece of land where Sam was buried, where we want to build the museum,” he said. “It will house a school of excellence, where we’ll teach photojournalism. We’ll also have a cultural centre and exhibit his work.” Sam’s wife Thelma handed over the house with her blessings. “Sam lived in this home after he ran away from apartheid police in Joburg. “He had nothing as police wanted him dead, but the only job he knew was journalism. “This time everything is going to change. This office is going to serve as a museum.” Foundation member Conny Mametja said: “We see the spirit of ubaba Nzima in this structure. We’re going to unlock all these opportunities to bring them to this community.” Boitumelo Nzabukelwako of Khunjulwa Foundation said: “We partnered with this foundation to honour our hero ubaba Sam Nzima through sponsorship and donations to two centres.”
