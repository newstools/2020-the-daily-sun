Bob Cuts Hair Salon owner, Geraldine Kganakga, has owned up to her mistakes following allegations of staff abuse on e.tv’s Checkpoints. Last month, Geraldine, who is a salon entrepreneur broke the internet after her former and present employees exposed her illegal labour practices on e.tv's expose show, Checkpoint. In the show, the employees accused her of ill-treating them and short-changing them on their salaries. But Geraldine says she has never ill-treated anyone and would never do that, however she takes full responsibility for not paying some staff members.

When President Ramaphosa announced the closure of  all business, it negatively affected our cash-flows and we were unable to make payments,” she says. Geraldine adds that for someone who took herself through school, she would never look down upon anyone because she understands the struggles of being an entrepreneur and hustler. “I was shocked how I was portrayed on TV, instead of interviewing me the TV cast went and interviewed disgruntled staff that used to work for me over two years ago,”  she adds. Geraldine who started Bob Cuts five years ago says she would like to apologise to her clients and staff members who were affected by the TV scandal. “The whole thing hurt a lot of people and I apologise profusely. I am ambitious and have an entrepreneurial drive, I’ve been working since I was 16 years old.  Sadly, this is spoiling my reputation in the way it is,” she said.
