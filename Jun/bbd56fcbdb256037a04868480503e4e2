TOP runner Gerda Steyn could be putting the final touches to her Tokyo Olympics preparations. But like many athletes the world over, the local ultra-marathon runner will not be setting foot in the Land of the Rising Sun after the 2020 Olympics were moved to July 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Admittedly, Steyn harboured no Olympics aspirations before, starting out as a social runner few years ago. But she made her Olympic intentions quite clear when she ran an Olympic qualifying time with a 2:27:48 finish at the New York Marathon in November, bettering her previous best by three minutes as she took 11th place overall. The Comrades Marathon champion also rose to fourth place on the all-time South African women’s rankings times at the race in the Big Apple. Colleen de Reuck still holds Mzansi’s record with a time best of 2:26:35, achieved back in 1996. “I remember two years ago someone asking me if I’d go to the Olympics. I laughed and said if they put 100km into the Olympics,” said Steyn. “The Olympics were not always in my mind. They even made the qualifying time a lot faster last year than in the past, but still I thought I’d have a chance of qualifying. So, I gave it my best shot at the New York Marathon and here I am. “Things have happened so fast things have changed I can’t believe how this wild dream has become a reality for me.” Steyn had been sweating buckets in the Lesotho, gunning for a hat-trick of Two Oceans Marathon titles in April before the event was cancelled. The plan has changed as the Nedbank Running Club athlete looks to become the first female runner to win three titles in a row since Angelina Sephooa achieved the feat two decades ago. Confessing her love for the Two Oceans, Steyn said: “I love this race. I have to come back and try make it three in a row in 2021. At an altitude of 3 220m, Lesotho serves as her preparations for tougher courses and it wasn’t surprising to see her moving camp to the mountain kingdom in March.
