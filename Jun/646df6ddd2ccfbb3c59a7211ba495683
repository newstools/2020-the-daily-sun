IT was business as usual as taxi operators kept their word on filling their taxis at 100% capacity. This despite lockdown regulations requiring taxis be filled at 70% capacity. Taxi driver Cebo Ngubane said loading 10 passengers had killed them financially. “When you have 10 people you work for petrol. There was no money coming in,” he said. “The sad thing is that we were unable to pay rent and take care of our children. It will really help that we load 15 passengers.” He echoed Santaco’s sentiments that even though there will be no social distancing, they must make sure people are sanitised and have their masks on. Another driver, Sibusiso Nyathikazi, said: “It’s great because we’re able to make enough money for our bosses.” Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms any call encouraging taxi operators to violate provisions of the law and promote lawlessness.” Mbalula was not the only one who wasn’t happy. Commuter Chantelle Wesi said greedy taxi bosses try to maximise profit at commuters’ expense. “We’re not safe. Sanitising and wearing masks is simply not enough,” said Chantelle. “It’s better when there’s social distancing.” The EFF condemned the decision by taxi bosses to undermine social distancing regulations and operate at 100% capacity.
