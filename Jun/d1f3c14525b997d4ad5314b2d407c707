YET another woman was found murdered on Friday. The body of Sanelisiwe Mfaba (29) was found with stab wounds in Dobsonville extension 3, Soweto. Her sister Xolile (34), from Zola also in Soweto, said the last time she saw Sanelisiwe was when her boyfriend came to pick her up from a funeral service on Thursday. She said later that day, the boyfriend sent her a message saying Sanelisiwe was drunk and he would bring her home the next day. ANOTHER SOWETO WOMAN KILLED AND DUMPED! Xolile said she believed he had already killed her sister when he sent the message. “He allegedly killed her inside his taxi and the tracker indicates he was parked in the same spot for an hour and a half,” she said. Xolile said the boyfriend allegedly later dumped the body in Dobsonville. “I’m so broken because nothing can be done to bring her back to life. I’ve lost someone who meant everything to me. I hope he rots in jail,” she said. Her mum Winnie (51) said she hoped her daughter would get justice. “What kind of a person does this to a human being?” Winnie described her daughter as a respectful and loving child. TSHWANE WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH! Family friend Patricia Monnye (51) said she hoped the suspect would be sent to rot in jail and never saw the sun again. “That’s so brutal. How does a person do this to someone they claim to love? Women keep getting killed and it seems like no one is safe anymore, whether you are in your own house or not,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the suspect was charged with murder and will appear in the Benoni Magistrates Court soon.
