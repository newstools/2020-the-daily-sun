Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga praised the police their vigilance. “We have experienced members at all our ports of entry into the Province. These members are thorough and will ensure that nothing illegal passes through these points,” she said. “Ridding of our communities of drugs remains our priority as these drugs also become generators of crime and have far-reaching consequences when introduced to our youth,” Lieutenant General Ntshinga added.
