White Ndlovu (36) from White City Village outside Thulamahashe in Bushbuckridge was supposed to appear in Mhala Magistrates Court yesterday, but the court heard he wouldnâ€™t be continuing his bail application as he had asked to be kept in police custody until his case was finalised. Ndlovu faces charges of murder and assault. ANC MAN SHOT DEAD IN FRONT OF DAUGHTER! The court heard he allegedly assaulted gogo Thalitha Hlongo (96) to death with a broomstick at her home in White City on 7 June, and injured his sister-in-law after she tried to intervene. The police were called to the scene and found the badly-injured gogo bleeding on the head. Paramedics then declared her dead. The suspect was nowhere to be found at the time.
