SOUTH African midfielder Lindo Mfeka, who plies his trade in the United States, says he’s scared for his life as he believes black people are being targeted by cops.  Mfeka said that racism in America is prevalent and he has no trust in the police system.  As a black person he fears being beaten up by the police. America has seen widespread protests taking place across cities since George Floyd (46), an unarmed black man, died while being arrested by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota on the 25 May.  Footage of the arrest showed a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck while he lay on the ground. Chauvin has been charged with murder.  Mfeka, who plays for RENO 1868 FC in the USL Championship just below the MLS said: “Here in America, it’s tough. We have known that these dudes (police) act like this. I have been scared and I’m scared still and what happened to George Floyd just made it worse. “Police are really targeting black people, they just want to take you somehow. It doesn’t matter if you are innocent or not, like Floyd was innocent, but he died.”
