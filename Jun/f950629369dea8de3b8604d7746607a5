STELLENBOSCH FC coach Steve Barker says while it will feel like a training match to play without fans when the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season resumes, there are benefits of playing behind closed doors. The former AmaZulu mentor points out that the players will be able to hear their coaches properly when they bark instructions from the dugout, unlike when fans are in attendance, which at times makes it difficult to relay messages. Club football in Mzansi was given the green light by Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa on Wednesday to resume after the NSL Covid-19 Health and Safety Directives protocols met the minister’s requirements, and part of those requirements were that matches will be played behind closed doors. The Premiership and GladAfrica Championship were suspended in March due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Barker said clubs who rely heavily on big crowds such as the big three – Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns – will find it tough to adapt. Smaller clubs, who are used to playing in front of almost empty stadiums, will have an advantage when football restarts, he said. “Obviously when you play and there’s a big crowd, it’s not easy to convey messages (to players). But it is 50-50, some players like to get information off the field, some coaches like to give more information from the dugout, others do feel they have done the work during the course of the week and they don’t need to relay the information during the match,” he said. “But to a large extent, it does help (to play without fans). If there are certain things you need to relay to the players, it makes it a lot easier.” Barker promoted the team from the Championship last season and his side look set remain in the top flight next season.
