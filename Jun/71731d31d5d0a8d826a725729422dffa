FACT Durban Rocks will take place this year despite Covid-19. The show serves as the Vodacom Durban July (VDJ) after party and it is normally taking place at Moses Mabhida's People's Park. The organiser DJ Tira said that music fans will watch the show behind doors after watching VDJ on 25 July. He said he decided to go ahead with the plans of organising the show after he had realised that it was possible. "Entertainment fans will be able to watch the show on TV, but let me not mention which station will air the show before we finalise everything. Artists will be performing from different venues. For now, we are still busy putting everything together," said Tira. Read:Â WOMEN ABUSE TRIGGERS GOSPEL STAR!
