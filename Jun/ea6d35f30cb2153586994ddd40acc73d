EMBRACED by some, loathed by others... That is the story of the vuvuzela, the plastic horn which earned its place in the 2010 Fifa World Cup history books as a symbol of the tournament. It may have died a silent death over the succeeding years, but the vuvuzela undoubtedly left a mark in the history of the tournament. The trumpet somehow replaced the famous “shosholoza” ditty, as a tool to inspire Bafana Bafana whenever the chips were down. Who can forget how shosholoza replaced “Die Stem” as the unofficial anthem when Bafana played their first ever match back 1992, or when the team clinched the ’96 African Cup of Nations? To the world though, the vuvuzela announced its existence when the country won the right to host the 2010 World Cup, back in 2004. The instrument divided opinion among the players, coaches and officials as to whether it should be allowed to exist or be culled. Radio and TV shows as well as newpaper columns were dedicated to debates over the future of the horn. It wasn’t long before calls for it’s ban grew, with seething foreign scribes described it as an annoying abomination. But with it’s sheer volume and deafening buzz, the vuvuzela would drown out any objection to it’s existence. The locals maintained it was part of football tradition and it was going nowhere! Fifa president Sepp Blatter concurred. “We should not Europeanise an African World Cup...” argued Blatter. “That is what African and South African football is all about, noise, excitement and dancing.”
