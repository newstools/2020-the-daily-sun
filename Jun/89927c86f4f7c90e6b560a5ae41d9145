CONTRALESA president Kgoshi Mathibela Mokoena is calling for the removal of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Mokoena said it was no surprise that 55 schools in Mpumalanga couldn’t re-open on Monday due to water and sanitation challenges, as the minister had never bothered to visit rural schools in the province. On Monday, parents at a number of schools said they were worried their kids would get sick due to serious water shortages. Pupils at Mmasekobe Secondary School in Thabakgolo Village, near Bushbuckdridge, were among those who were sent home. SGB chairwoman Francinah Malomane said they had to close the school as parents were furious. “All three pit toilet blocks are collapsing. They are a death trap.” Francinah said the toilets were built 30 years ago. Mokoena said many kids and parents were left confused by the minister’s statements. “The president should place her somewhere else. “We need fresh blood to run the department. I think she has lost touch and is not fit to lead that department. She must be relieved of her duties,” he said. Mokoena said several schools under his authority in Oakley and surrounding villages near Bushbuckridge had no running water. “We’re so disappointed. Some kids will be left behind while others continue with their studies,” he said. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department was aware of the issues at some schools. “The MEC will be visiting schools next week to check their state of readiness,” he said.
