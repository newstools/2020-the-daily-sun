 AGNES WAS killed with a grinder and her body dumped in an open field. Her body was found in Sunnyside, Tshwane, last month. And her grief- stricked family now get missed calls from her. Daily Sun published her story on 21 May under the headline:“Shock as woman is chopped with a grinder to death”. But Agnes’ dad was shocked to miss a call from her number even though she was dead and buried. Manze Guni (48) said after his daughter died, the number she used called her mum in Zimbabwe at about 6.57am. He said the number called him as well on 26 May. “The same number called other family members,” he said. “A man answered the phone but kept quiet afterwards.” Manze moved out of Buffer Zone in Mamelodi, where he lived with his daughter (25), to Nellmapius. “I was no longer safe. People I suspect of murdering my daughter have the keys to my former place and are still out there,” he said. “I had to leave. I suspect the people who killed my daughter stole the keys and her SIM card.” He said five days after Agnes’ death, he discovered that his laptop, worth about R5 000, was missing and two pairs of her black boots were missing. “No one else except my daughter and I had keys to our room,” he said. “They didn’t only use a grinder to murder my daughter. A panga was also used. “The suspect confessed at Sunnyside Police Station that he killed my daughter.” Manze said he was not happy with the lack of progress on the case. “I want justice and want those who murdered my daughter to rot in jail,” he said. He wanted the investigator handling his daughter’s case changed. Police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said a man suspected of Agnes’ killing was in custody. “Police are following every bit of information at their disposal and have thus far left no stone unturned,” he said. “The family is being kept informed about developments around this case.”
