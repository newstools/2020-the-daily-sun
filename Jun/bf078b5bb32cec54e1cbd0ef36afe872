Radio personality Anele Mdoda has taken a swipe at government for their silence about femicide, saying the government should direct the same energy into fighting femicide. This follows horrifying reports about women being killed, including one whose body was reportedly stuffed in bag. "We as South Africans demand the same urgency given to Covid-19 by government to be directed to the slaughter of women in South Africa. It is a pandemic and the numbers are even worse. The same power used to ban cigarettes and alcohol will do. "A woman was chopped up. Chopped up like an onion. You told the country not to go out or the army will deal with them. Tell the same country not to kill woman or they will be dealt with then do that, deal with them," she said. SEE POST BELOW:
