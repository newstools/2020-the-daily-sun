Currently only limited research exists on the relationship between alcohol and acne. But several studies do report that alcohol may be associated with an increased prevalence of acne. However, Dr Nerissa Moodley, a dermatology registrar at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, warns that these studies are not conclusive. There are several ways alcohol may exacerbate breakouts. Dr Moodley explains how: 1. Changes in hormone levels Alcohol consumption can increase testosterone and oestrogen levels. When hormone levels increase, your oil glands may produce more sebum which can clog pores and cause a breakout. 2. Bacteria growth Studies show that Cutibacterium acnes (a bacterium that resides in the pilosebaceous follicles and contributes to the inflammatory response in acne vulgaris) metabolises alcohol and uses it as a fuel which may affect acne-prone skin. 3. Inflammation Alcohol consumption can lead to inflammation. Increased levels of cytokines (these send messages to immune cells to fight harmful substances that enter the body, such as bacteria) can predispose individuals to develop acne and play an important role in the early stages of acne formation. How hormones affect acne Your hormones are responsible for producing sebum through the sebaceous glands in the skin.
