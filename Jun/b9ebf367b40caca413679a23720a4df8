A woman is expected to appear in court tomorrow for allegedly
stabbing her babydaddy to death. The Cape Argus reports that Ashley Mbotya was stabbed by his ex and
mum of his two kids in the early hours of Monday morning in Samora Machel kasi
in Cape Town. People close to the former couple described the sometimes violent
nature of the relationship on social media,according to the newspaper. Mbotya was once admitted to ICU after they had a nasty fight and
she allegedly stabbed him according to the posts. Ashley's brother, Thanduxolo Mbotya told the paper that the family
was shattered and was still in shock about the incident. He said Ashley was out when his ex-girlfriend entered his shack
and tore his clothes. She waited for him to arrive and stabbed him in the chest and ran
away, Thanduxolo Mbotya claims. “I ran to check what was happening and saw him lying in a pool of
blood and [she was] still holding a knife. She said she had killed the dog who
didn't want to support his children,” he said. Thanduxolo said he was aware of the toxic nature of his brother's
relationship and their previous fights but never imagined that she would kill
him. Siyabonga Blom, a friend, said Mbotya had scars from previous
fights with his ex and that "we all knew that one day she would kill him
but we kept quiet",reports the paper. Police spokesperson Mihlali Majikela said: "The circumstances
surrounding an incident that took place yesterday (Monday) in the early hours
of the morning at Samora Machel are
being investigated." Majikela said the deceased was stabbed and transported to a
medical facility where he later died of his injuries. A female suspect was
arrested on a charge of murder and is expected to appear in the Athlone
Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.
