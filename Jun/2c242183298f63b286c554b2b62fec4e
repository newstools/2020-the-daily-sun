FAMILIES of the seven men who were shot and killed at Kwamakhutha, south of Durban, last month have pleaded with the suspect to tell them who hired him to kill their loved ones. Speaking on behalf of other families outside the Umbumbulu Magistrates Court today Musa Ngcobo (43), whose son Njabulo Mkhize was one of the victim, said they had no doubt the suspect was a hitman. The 23-year-old accused Sandile Langa appeared for the second time and was supposed to make apply for a bail, but the state asked for a postponement to prepare its arguments to oppose the bail. He faces seven counts of murder.  Two senior investigating officers from the KZN organised crime unit said they’d oppose bail. The matter was postponed to 26 June for a formal bail application. Ngcobo told Daily Sun he hadn’t been able to eat since his son’s death. He said none of the other family members or people in the community knew the accused, so it was clear to them that he was acting on someone’s or people’s instructions. Ngcobo said he knew his son used drugs but nothing could justify the way he was killed. “This boy must reveal his bosses and tell the court who hired him. He is so young to have planned and executed the killings the way they happened. Surely he wasn’t alone. How can one man be able to shoot seven people all in the their heads? He must also reveal other suspects,” said Ngcobo. The bodies of Njabulo, Nhlanhla Gumede, Nkanyiso Hlengwa, Msizu Mhlongo, Talent Kweyama, Menzi Sibisi and Sanele Maphumulo, aged between 19 and 36, were found on top each other in a mud house. They all had gunshot wounds to the head. One of victims Nhlanhla, who’s believed to be the one who was selling drugs, was apparently in competition over customers with other druglords in the area.
