"To me when I was posting that image I was making a joke, like I always do. But I have offended some people with that post. I have received a few calls, about that post, especially from my mentors. "I was told that what I did was really not cool and such terms were used to make people feel small. Myself I have been called uSis Buti all my life, even now. The reason for me for using that caption was solely because of taking back the power away from people who use such terms to make people feel small," he said. SEE FULL VIDEO BELOW:
