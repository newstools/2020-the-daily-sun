INSTEAD of sitting around doing nothing, 18 unemployed village youths have been fixing potholes on an important local road. The volunteers in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, have been working hard to improve the 44km road between Cottondale and the Manyeleti Game Reserve. When the SunTeam visited, the youths were working hard under the hot sun. Team leader Again Mathebula (32) said: “We were hurt to see all the deadly accidents happening on this road. ‘This piece of road is important to tourism and the local economic hub. There were huge, dangerous potholes. “Many cars have been damaged and the government is doing nothing. “We joined hands and volunteered to fix the road. We’re making sure that all safety precautions are followed. “Good Samaritans including local businesspeople, taxi drivers, motorists and the Mnisi Traditional Authority have been helping us with food, water, cement, loads of river sand and tools.” Motorist Rex Ntimane said the volunteers were doing a great job. “All local hardware stores and game lodges in the nearby Kruger National Park and Manyeleti Game Reserve must donate materials towards the betterment of this road project,” he said. Provincial public works, roads and transport spokesman Frederick Dhlamini was shocked when the SunTeam approached him for comment. He said the matter would be investigated.
