Babes Wodumo's management team have reacted to claims made by Tha Simelane, that the Gqom artists used cocaine during an Instagram Live interview on Thursday. The emotionally-charged interview was abruptly ended by the Wololo-hitmaker, who broadcast from boyfriend Mampintsha's Instagram account. Following the interview, a tearful Tha claimed that he witnessed Babes use cocaine during the interview. "Babes won't change. She took cocaine while I watch[ed], while people watch[ed]. I love you guys, bye," he said. During the live broadcast, Babes admitted that she had been drinking alcohol. Speaking to Channel24, Nonduh Simelane, said: "You saw the video and watched it from start to finish. Did you see any cocaine? There was no cocaine, so there is your answer. You didn't see any cocaine; no one saw cocaine."
