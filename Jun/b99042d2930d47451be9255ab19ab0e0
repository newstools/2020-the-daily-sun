WHEN a mum asked her eldest son to look after his two brothers and sister for the weekend, she couldn’t have known that by Sunday they’d be dead. The three brothers died together during the night after inhaling toxic fumes from imbawula. The girl is fighting for her life in hospital. Grieving mum Elsie Mathoma (49) from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she asked her daughter Mpho Mathoma (27) to come and look after her younger brothers Mulalo and Murendeni (11), and sister Mashudu Mashawana (15) as she was going to Limpopo. But Mpho couldn’t come and their elder brother Nkhangweleni Mathoma (31) came instead. Mpho said she spoke to Nkhangweleni on Saturday to check on them. But on Sunday, when their mum called, there was no answer. The mum then contacted a neighbour who knocked on the door, but there was no response. The neighbour then called a relative who lives nearby. The relative broke a window and the three brothers were found dead on the bed.  Mashudu was still alive and an ambulance rushed her to Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane. “I can’t believe I’ve lost my brothers,” said Mpho. She said her siblings were seen by neighbours sitting around imbawula on Saturday night. Sergeant Media Khoza of KwaThema Police Station said an inquest docket was opened. She urged people to not go to sleep with braziers in the house.
