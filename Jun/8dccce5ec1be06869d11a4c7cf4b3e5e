HE has had a few misfortunes in the past few years. He parted ways with business partner George Malehu, his business went downhill and he found himself in debt and unable to meet production deadline. He also attempted suicide six times during this miserable time and lost an investor. But international fashion designer Quiteria Kekana has since picked up the pieces of his life and is aiming for new heights. His brand of Quiteria Atelier is back at work after lockdown, and he believes nothing can get him down at this point. “Oh, we are working so hard to make sure we don’t make the same mistakes,” he said. “I’ve lost money, sponsors, friends, staff members, and people have betrayed my trust, but we keep learning and moving because we know who we are.” “We really took a knock during the lockdown, production had to stop and we had to let go of a few staff members. But we live and learn and we are moving on and learning to work under lockdown regulations,” he added. The Limpopo-born designer has recently announced entertainer, beauty brand owner and influencer Eva Modika as the face of Quiteria Atelier. “Eva is classy. She’s confident and exudes the fire that is within a Quiteria Atelier woman,” he said. “She is not afraid to speak her mind and she’s the new generation of fearless.” Eva said she never imagined being the face of such an elegant brand. “I’ve come a long way from being the girl from Seshego. I’m proud of how far I have come,” she said. “People always painted me as a slay queen because I worked in clubs. But I’m out to show my worth.” Eva is currently studying Law at the University of Joburg. his year Quiteria will be showcasing at New York Fashion Week, Milan, and Paris and fingers crossed the lockdown will not prevent this from happening.
