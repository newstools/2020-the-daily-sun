TWO friends have created a stir on social media. This after pictures of them selling scones in their graduation gowns trended on social media. Thato Mokasi (26) and Perm Stomberg (26) from Soshanguve block XX, north of Tshwane, said they’d been selling scones since last year. Thato, a qualified interior designer, said: “We had to put our pride aside and use what we could to make extra money.” She said people responded positively and the business did very well. “Our costumers support us every day and give us positive feedback,” she said. “Our muffins and scones are always sold out.” But social media users expressed mixed reactions to Thato and Perm’s picture. Some were impressed while others criticised them. But the two ladies insisted they didn’t wear the gowns to show off or look down on people who sold scones. Perm, a qualified somatologist, said the reason was to motivate people, especially the youth. She said a lot of graduates struggled to find jobs. “We want them to know that just because you’re a graduate doesn’t mean you should only look for a job you’re qualified for,” she said. They also wear gowns so people don’t undermine street vendors, many of whom are educated, but struggling. Perm said although baking and selling scones wasn’t part of her career plans, she was happy to have ventured into it anyway. “When we started out, it was just to get by,” she said. “But we now see we can actually make something big with this business.”
