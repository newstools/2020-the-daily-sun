ASPIRING singer LeenconKing’s upcoming single gives hope to the people of Africa. The versatile singer, whose real name is Senzelokuhle Khumalo, released a song titled Africa with Mafia and Princess on Friday. The 21-year-old from Estcourt in KZN told SunBuzz: “Since it was Africa Month and we’re going through the coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to tell people not to lose hope. “I wanted them to know we’ll conquer and overcome this virus. It’s not over. We must join hands and be there for one another.” LeenconKing started pursuing music in 2012. “I decided to record my own song because I grew up wishing I had a song of my own. “I wanted to share a piece of my life and share my thoughts through music. “I’ve been releasing music since then. I worked on an album for a few years, but unfortunately it got lost before I could release it. “My producer’s computer died with my music on it and I didn’t have copies. That was a devastating time for me, but I rose from that.” LeenconKing signed to a record label called Nuz Productions because when he felt it was time for his music to be heard all over Mzansi. The musician is planning to release an EP before the end of the year. “The EP I’m working on is an Afro pop project. “Although I don’t like sticking to one genre, this EP will only be Afro pop. “However, after the EP I might work on an album and that’s where my versatility will be shown.”
