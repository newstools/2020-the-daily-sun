MUGIYO Mabunda has been denied bail. The Mpumalanga man (42), accused of murdering his wife, appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court yesterday. He will stay behind bars until he appears again on 3 August. Mabunda is accused of shooting and killing his wife, Tebogo Mabunda (39) last month. He allegedly shot her 10 times and then shot himself three times, injuring himself in the stomach and shoulder. The two allegedly had a history of domestic violence, and it’s said they had an argument the night before the shooting, which continued to the next day. Mabunda’s attorney, Kort Jordan, told the court through an affidavit that his client didn’t intentionally kill his wife. Jordan said as there were no witnesses, the state has a circumstantial case. He said the accused should get bail because there was no one to treat his wounds, and his health was compromised because of overcrowding in prison. State prosecutor Catherine Mnisi maintained his release would pose a danger to his kids, helper and the community. Magistrate Leonard Ngcangca said it’s a single offence and any accused has the right to bail. “But we’re talking about a murder where the deceased was shot about 10 times,” he said. Family representative, Hendrick Matsane, told Daily Sun the shooting couldn’t have been an instant decision. “This thing has been going on for some time. It comforts us that he was denied bail. This is justice,” said Matsane. “You can see that he wanted to indicate that there was a third force in the scenario but when the paramedics attended the scene, they found him holding a gun.”
