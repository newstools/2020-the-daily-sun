THANYANI Thangoane has been a physical sciences and maths teacher for grades 11 and 12 for 25 years. The thing he misses most is being able to joke with pupils to cultivate an interest in the lesson. “The biggest challenge for me is slow pupils and those with English language problems,” said Thanyani. “They don’t follow the presentation as well as meritorious pupils, and it’s difficult to interact with them.” Another concern is that the lesson flow is quite slow, resulting in a small amountof information shared between the educator and pupils. “Sometimes the slow writers miss parts of these activities, and this may result in pupils losing interest in the lesson,” he said “You also can’t draw diagrams to clarify some of the concepts, and this means some pupils end up failing to understand the activity.” The veteran teacher has some strong words for parents as everyone makes the best of new ways of teaching. “The parents’ motto must be ‘our children’s education first’,” he said. “The parents (mother and father) must help each other to ensure their children are always at home – at home and busy with their studies. “Children must be monitored when they’re busy studying. “Parents must stop their children from getting addicted to TV dramas. “Parents must ensure that a useful timetable is in place.” Thanyani also advised the parents to buy some additional learning materials or data, so that their children may be able to download from the internet.
