LEAVING home is never an easy thing. And it is no different for Lions pace bowler Lutho Sipamla, who is leaving the comfort of his family home in Port Elizabeth for the hustle and bustle of Joburg. But the 22-year-old has more reasons to leave the Warriors for the Joburg franchise, mainly to improve as a player. Like his fellow teammates, Sipamla had been kept indoors by the national lockdown. But he will now run out to the nets after government eased restrictions for non-contact sport to resume training under level 3. “I’m definitely looking forward to my move to the Lions,” said Sipamla. “The whole reason behind it was to improve as a player. I’m looking forward to working on my discipline as a fast bowler as well and making sure I’m more consistent in bowling tight lines. So I am looking to grow in that aspect as a fast bowler. We have been in lockdown for a quite a while now.” Admittedly, it is going to be tough leaving home, Sipamla having spent most of his career with his hometown Warriors team following his debut in 2017. He featured for the Tshwane Spartans in the Mzansi Super League, and was also part of the Proteas team which toured India in January and returned home without playing due to the Covid-19 concerns. “It’s going to be tough of course to leave home but as I said, I want to grow not only as a player. but as an individual as well,” said Sipamla. “I’m really looking forward to the move and I’m excited. Hopefully I can do great things there with the Lions.” He has been itching for action and he would have been back on the crease as early as next week, had the inaugural 3T Cricket tournament, which is supposed to usher in the return of live cricket, wasn’t postponed. Sipamla is going back to the Wanderers, where his best performance for the Proteas came, in the ODI clash against England in February. As one of the country’s prospects, he will benefit more in a team of experienced internationals.
