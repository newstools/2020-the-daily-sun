FORMER Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lucky “Sheriff” Baloyi faces an uncertain future. Baloyi’s contract with Bloemfontein Celtic is due to expire this month and management have yet to decide whether they will renew it or not. The 28-year-old has played an influential role for Celtic this season, having started 17 Absa Premiership matches while coming on as a substitute in three. He has missed only three matches out of 23 games played by the Free State side this season. But his impressive performances, which helped Siwelele occupy ninth spot on the league table with 28 points, seem not enough to warrant him a new contract. Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco told SunSport that they have yet to engage Baloyi about his future due to the coronavirus pandemic that has halted the PSL season. Explained Konco: “We haven’t had discussions with any player whose contract is coming to an end. “The league will advise us on way forward how to deal with this matter.” Konco said all matters related to players’ contract that are due to expire will be sorted out when the team resumes training. Meanwhile, Baloyi could not shed light on whether he will continue his career with Siwelele or seek greener pastures. He said: “There is no football going on at the moment, therefore I don’t want to discuss anything related to the game including my contract with Celtic.” The Mokopane-born player made his professional debut with Amakhosi in 2010 and made 57 appearances. He scored four goals. Due to lack of game time, Baloyi was released on loan to join Moroka Swallows where he made 29 appearances, scoring one goal. Having failed to help Swallows avoid the relegation axe, Baloyi returned to Chiefs at the end of the 2014-15 season. But his frustrations on the sidelines continued until Celtic came to rescue his career in 2017.
