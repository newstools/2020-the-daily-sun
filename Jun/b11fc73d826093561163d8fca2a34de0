MAINTAINING social distancing at Sicelimfundo
Combined School is near impossible. As schools reopened for grades seven and twelve on
Monday and the lockdown regulations stated that there should be social
distancing in all classrooms. But in this school situated in Nquthu, north of KZN
itâ€™s impossible to practice social distancing, there are about 30 pupils per
class. This is because they don't have enough classes to
make sure that social distancing is maintained. Schools Governing Body (SGB) member Charles
Buthelezi told Daily Sun that there are too many pupils while classes are few and
the department has been informed. "We have 341 matric pupils and 73 grade seven
pupils. But the entire school only has 17 classes. So when we divided them into
these classes there are more pupils and fewer classes. We end up having 30
pupils per class," he said. He said another challenge is that the teachers are
less in this school. "We would appreciate it if the department can
bring us seven mobile classes and as well as more teachers," he said. A parent who asked not to be named said as parents
they had no choice but to allow their children to go to school but the fact
that there is no social distancing in classes scared them. "We hope the department will intervene by
bringing extra classes and teachers," said the parent. The KZN Department of Education spokesman Muzi
Mahlambi said: "We are aware of their issue and it's being attended
to."
