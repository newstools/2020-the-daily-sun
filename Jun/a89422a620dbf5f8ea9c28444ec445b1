WHEN he tested positive for coronavirus, he told himself it would pass
just like a flu. The 34-year-old from Umlazi,
south of Durban, said he kept calm despite being one of the first people in
Mzansi to catch the virus. He said he had a tight chest and shortness of
breath. He went to get a test after
being advised to do so by a friend. “While waiting for the results, I told my family
to drink warm water with garlic and ginger three times a day to prevent getting
infected.” He said his results came back
at the end of March and he was put into
isolation at Clairwood Hospital for 14
days. “It wasn’t nice to be away from my
family but I had to get better.” He said the stay in hospital
wasn’t great. He said he and other patients drank lots of warm water. “I left in the middle of
April. Before I went home, my family was
also tested and no one was positive,” he
said. He said he believed his family members remained negative because the
garlic and ginger kept their immune systems strong. “The coronavirus didn’t have
much impact on me but it had an impact on my
family. In our area, people treated them
badly. Even when they went to buy at spaza shops, people didn’t want to take
their money.” He said since he returned
home, he had completely recovered and everything was
back to normal. “Now we wear masks and use
sanitiser. We also drink warm water with garlic and ginger,” he said. He advised people who test
positive not to worry but start seeing it as flu. photo-group
