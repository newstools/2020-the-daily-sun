People on the streets of Dobsonville had a feast this morning when money was scattered all over. This comes after an armed robbery and bombing took place in Jaca street in Dobsonville. The national SAPS spokeswoman, Colonel Athlenda Mathe told Daily Sun that SAPS has launched a man hunt for a group of heavily armed men who robbed and bombed the GS4. "They ordered the three security guards out and bombed the vehicle. They were driving a Gold7, Audi A4 and Ford Ranger," said Mathe Nearby residents told Daily Sun that all they heard was a loud explosive sound and they went out to check when it was a bit quiet. A woman who asked not to be named said she called the police immediately when she heard this noise. "My niece had just left the house and I panicked when I heard this. I hope these perpetrators will be found," she said. Makhosonke Dladla who was there after the scene said he didn't see any of the guys, he was tempted to go and get some bank notes for himself but he was afraid of what might happen if police arrive."We'd be a part of that crime. I'm sure we're not allowed to do that. A couple of my friends ran and grabbed some money for themselves. We're still not sure what happened exactly," said Makhosonke.
