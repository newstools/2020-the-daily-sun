 WITH corona cases expected to rise rapidly in Gauteng, the health department plans to use a ward-based approach to the outbreak. Spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said cases would continue to rise as the province was heading towards its peak period. Over the weekend, Gauteng recorded more cases than the Western Cape, which had been the epicentre of the virus over the past few months.

He said: “We’re extremely concerned that fatigue seems to have set in and South Africans are letting down their guard at a time when the spread of infection is surging. “We see poor or no social distancing in communities. “Masks are being abandoned or not worn properly, and there’s laxity in frequent hand washing. “This will directly influence the rise in numbers in the next two weeks.” Kekana said the rise in Gauteng infections was caused by an increase in movement in the province as the economy reopened. She said makeshift hospitals had been prepared to deal with the increase. “Gauteng has also adopted a ward-based strategy with regards to dealing with hotspots in the province,” she said. “It has improved and continues to improve existing hospitals and has set up five quarantine sites.” Kekana said the military was also setting up field hospitals.
