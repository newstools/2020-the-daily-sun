BIANCA “Nuz Queen” Mbatha is accused of exploiting up-and-coming artists. Club DJs Lungisani Simelane and Simphiwe Magwaza, who call themselves Mutual Frendz, claim they composed and produced hit songs for the gqom artist, but haven’t been paid. Lungisani said they worked as her composers, producers and dancers. “We started working with Nuz Queen in 2018. She used to see our performances in the townships and she approached us to work with her. “Our verbal agreement was that she’d mention us whenever she is performing at gigs. Secondly, we’d get musical rights such as being mentioned as composers and producers of the songs upon registration and lastly, we’d get a certain portion of payment for our work. Unfortunately, none of those things happened,” said Lungisani. The duo from Ntuzuma, KZN, said the first song they made for her was Laze Lavuk’ Idimoni, which received a lot of airplay. “We even shot a music video for this song, but we’ve received nothing in return.” He said they also made Gumba Fire and Ndibeke, which are both on high rotation on various radio stations and available on online music streaming platforms. He said they’d tried to address this with her, but she failed to give them a straight answer and ignored them. “We believe she exploited us because we are new in the industry and that we had no written contract with her,” he said. Nuz Queen’s manager, Sbankwa Nyubuse, said: “I can confirm Nuz Queen worked with these artists and they composed and produced the songs. “But she never had an agreement with them. “If there was a problem, they should’ve approached her and not speak to the media,” he said.
