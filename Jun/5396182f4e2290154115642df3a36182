DON’T judge me by my age. Listen to what I’m saying! That was the message from Mlungisi “Last Born” Mabaso (30), the youngest MMC in the City of Joburg council. As MMC of housing, he is determined to change lives, especially of the youth. “We all know rural people see Jozi as a place of opportunity,” Mabaso told Daily Sun at the Dube hostel he moved into when he was 17. After matriculating he stayed with his aunt in the suburbs, but he needed people around him, so he moved to the hostel. “I became a member of the IFP, not because I’m a Zulu, but because their policies are the same as what I believe in.” Mabaso helped to prepare a memorandum of demands for hostel dwellers. “I was elected to become a committee leader. I led protests. I was recognised as one of the people who led negotiations with the structures, so that hostel dwellers can be built new housing units.” Mabaso said government tricked people into believing vandalised units were RDPs. “Most people living in the hostels don’t work. Of course they refused to pay rent for property they wouldn’t even own.” Mabaso said he wanted to make sure the vandalised units were refurbished and to talk to all indunas from hostels, so they could agree on a way forward. “I want to make sure people are given their houses and they get their title deeds. People shouldn’t live like animals because they don’t have money.” Mabaso wanted to change the lives of as many people as possible. He said he was surrounded by people who’ve been in government and who were prepared to help him. “People should judge me by my work and not by my age,” he said.
