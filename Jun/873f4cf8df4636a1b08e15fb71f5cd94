ANTHONY MARTIAL rocked up to training fashionably late on following his hat-trick against Sheffield United on Wednesday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side got straight back to business at Carrington ahead of Saturday's clash against Norwich. But Martial arrived to the training ground 30 minutes later than the rest of his team-mates on Thursday morning. The Frenchman broke a long-running club curse by scoring the club's first Premier League hat-trick in seven years. He scored twice in the first half and again after the interval as United secured their first win since football returned. It was his first ever hat-trick after 284 games, but he forgot to collect the match ball after the final whistle. Martial, who has 19 goals under his belt this season, is hopeful that it will not be the last hat-trick he scores for the club. He told Sky Sports: "It's special for me because it's my first one and I hope it's not the last one. "It was a long time with nobody scoring three goals. "It was an important win against a team who are just behind us, so it is important for us to keep going and win the next one." Solskjaer's side will take a trip to Carrow Road to face Norwich in the FA Cup quarter-final this weekend. Despite comfortably beating Sheffield 3-0, the United boss has called for his team to be more clinical in front of goal. He said: "At times it was very, very good football. We could and should have scored more goals to put the game to bed before half-time." Solskjaer was spotted cruising into Carrington followed by the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Victor Lindelof. Half an hour later, Martial rocked up for a heroes welcome. - The Sun
