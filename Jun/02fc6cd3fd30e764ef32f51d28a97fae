GAVIN Hunt may be out of a job next season. But the Bidvest Wits coach will certainly not be left despondent, being due a massive payout in the event he is dropped. Hunt is one of the highest paid coaches in the PSL with a monthly salary, understood to be no less than R600 000 a month. He has a year left on his four-year contract and indications are that Hunt won’t be relocating to Limpopo with the club after it was sold to the Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila owners. The Venda-based upstarts are on record as saying they won’t be retaining the head coach’s service due to his huge package. But it is unclear who will pay the termination payment. The university, who held a 40% stake in the club, have since sold their shares. But the institution have confirmed they will be retaining the rest of the Wits teams, which are university entities and not the PSL franchise. “The Wits University Football Club and all other Wits sports clubs continue to operate as usual. They are university entities that are independent of the Bidvest Wits FC, ” said University spokesperson Shirona Patel. Wits are among a few institutions with sound football development programmes and they have a great record of producing players for the professional teams. Their academies have consistently brought up players through the age group levels to the senior team. Among the notable names who went through the Wits factory are Ashley Makhanya, Bradley Carnell, Josta Dladla, Junaid Hartley and Manqoba Ngwenya. Several coaches have also learned their trade at the Braamfontein based club. But it was Hunt who delivered trophies for the club since he arrived seven years ago. Former players and legends alike have lamented the sale of the club, the oldest in the country, with a rich history. The University has also confirmed the club will continue to use the facilities until the end of the season.
