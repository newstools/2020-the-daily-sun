ACTRESS Fundiswa Zwane will be saying goodbye to her fans as she is leaving e.tv’s Imbewu: The Seed. This was confirmed by managing director of e.tv channels Marlon Davids. The star, who plays the role of KaMadonsela in the popular telenovela, will be last seen on the show on 29 July. Marlon did not divulge on the reasons why the actress was leaving the show, but said she would be remembered for her character of being a rural woman who loved and embraced tradition. Reports suggest she was fired for demanding a salary increase. According to a local newspaper, her management asked that her salary be increased but the soapie producers felt different. Sunday Sun understand that when the two could not agree, the producers decided to let her go and replace her with Brenda Mhlongo. Sources close to the situation said the producers have big plans for the character, and that is why they are not killing it. Brenda who was known as Nandi on SABC1’s Generations: The Legacy has already started shooting. When called for comment, Fundiswa confirmed she was leaving, but did not state the reasons. “Being part of the telenovela was a great experience. I thank millions viewers who loved what I was doing on screen,” she said. Fundiswa is among the first batch of actors who started with the show two years ago. Sources say Brenda will start appearing immediately after Fundiswa has left the building. Brenda refused to comment and referred all inquiries to the producers.
