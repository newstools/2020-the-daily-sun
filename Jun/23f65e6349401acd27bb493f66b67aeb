PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa gave churches permission to open if they abided by lockdown restrictions. And with the alcohol ban being lifted from Monday, one would have thought Gabola Church would be back in full force on Sunday, but this won’t be happening. Gabola Church leader and founder, Pope Tsietsi Makiti, said there won’t be church services in any taverns or shebeens across Mzansi until further notice. In a statement sent to Daily Sun, Makiti said: “We cannot afford to put the lives of our beloved worshippers at risk just because places of worships have reopened. “Level 3 allows us takeaways, but that will restrict us of our essential church services. With flu season in our midst, it is also expected that the number of infections will increase and we also need to show the world that alcohol can be consumed peacefully, responsibly and without violence.” He said they loved church, but people’s lives mattered.  Church members said they accepted their leader’s instructions. “We won’t be going to taverns. We’ll drink and pray at home,” said church member Sam Dlala (45).  Another member, Ndu Msimango (39), said: “I was happy when the president said we can pray again. I knew we could drink in taverns peacefully as that’s where we have church. “But our pope says no, so it’s a no.”
