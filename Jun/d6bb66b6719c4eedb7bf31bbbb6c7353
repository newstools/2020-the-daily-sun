THE family of the 17-year-old Siboniso Ntshangase who drowned in the Bhivane dam in eDumbe, north of KZN is relieved after his body was recovered on Saturday. The family had been having sleepless nights since last week Saturday when he drowned, now they are relieved that they found his body and they will be able to bury him. They are puzzled and left with questions of what happened on that fateful day. Siboniso was last seen playing soccer with his friends when they were chased away by cops who were patrolling the area. Speaking to Daily Sun Siboniso's uncle Sabelo Ntshangase said, for now, their focus is on giving him a decent funeral then after they want answers as to what happened. “Ever since the incident happened, we were camping near the dam watching the divers search for his body. This morning one of the family members was there and the divers recovered the body, he called us to come,” said Sabelo. He added that the death of a loved one is not an easy thing, but they are glad that they were able to find his body because other families never find their loved one’s remains. “We are going to meet on Monday to discuss the funeral arrangements,” said Sabelo.
