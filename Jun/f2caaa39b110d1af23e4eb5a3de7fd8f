WITH the release of her album Chosi, The Soil’s leading lady Buhlebendalo Mda hopes to heal broken souls and break generational curses. Buhlebendalo told Daily Sun: “To me, this album means my journey of healing continues. Ninety percent of the album focuses on issues that black women go through on a daily basis.” She was over the moon that her album was finally here after four years of conceptualising. “It has been a journey of unlearning, and I got to face parts of myself that I always overlooked. I believe that it was supposed to happen the way it happened, as it is a continuous journey. ALSO READ:LOVE, MARRIAGE ARE NO JOKE! “It never stops and healing people never stops,” she said. The 31-year-old singer said launching her solo career was not her decision, but another calling. “I believe I was born a healer and that music is my other form of healing. “You know when we grow up we think the arts or doing anything in arts is a hobby or plan B. We don’t see that God and our ancestors have planted a seed, and we have to nurture and water it so it grows and blossoms. “So this was beyond me and music is beyond me. It’s not something I plan to do. It manifests on its own,” she said. Buhlebendalo said her album was inspired by her spiritual growth. “I went for my initiation to be a traditional healer in 2016, and I got to learn about African spirituality and what defines my purpose in life. “During that process, one had to grow spiritually. I was channelled to grow mentally and focus on things that you ignore on a daily basis,” she said
