THERE is still uncertainty on when football will return. On Wednesday president Cyril Ramaphosa announced the easing of lockdown restrictions in some business sectors. Ramaphosa said casinos, personal care services, such as  hairdressers and beauty services, would be opened for business. Non-contact sports such as golf, cricket and tennis would also be permitted. On contact sports such as soccer and rugby, he said these sporting sectors were not to return to sport yet, but athletes were free to resume training. The president said a date for commencement of these eased restrictions was yet to be announced. “In each instance stringent requirements have been agreed will need to be put in place before any activity can reopen. "These protocols are to be strictly adhered to. Announcements will be made in due course for the date these will be permitted,” he said. Ramaphosa said the decision had been taken with "due care’ and ‘seriousness". He said the decision to reopen the industries was taken strongly in mind, with over 500 000 people who had been employed in these sectors before the lockdown. “This is a global pandemic and most countries are facing exactly the same challenges. We must find ways to resolve the dilemmas we are facing,” he said.
