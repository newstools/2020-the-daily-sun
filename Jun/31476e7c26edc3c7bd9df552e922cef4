POLICE had a hard time controlling mourners at the funeral of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu. Although there was a guest list to enter the 16-year-old’s funeral service, which was held at his home in Hambanathi, Tongaat, north of Durban yesterday, residents managed to find a way to get into the tent. But they were chased away by cops.  Some mourners stood in the yards close to Bobo’s home. Speaking on behalf of the family, Sonto Ngidi (33) said: “Bobo was my sister’s child and I loved him very much. He loved money so much and was business-minded. We’re still asking ourselves what he did to be killed like this.” Hambanathi youth representative Slindile Dumakude (26) said they were hurt by Bobo’s killing.  “We will fight for justice for Bobo. We want the killers to pay for what they did.” Bobo’s teacher Regina Khoza said he was full of life. ANC Tongaat chairman Mtho Nene said: “We reported the matter to MEC Bheki Ntuli when we heard about it.  “He promised there’d be arrests and indeed arrests were made.” He said Ntuli promised there won’t be challenges in the case.  “We want the entire management of Tongaat Police Station to be changed because they are not doing a good job. We also want all taxis of the person linked to Bobo’s case to stop operating,” he said. Bobo was kidnapped on 28 April, and was beaten to death for allegedly stealing from a tavern. His body was found in a river near Tongaat.  Suspects linked to his killing are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court tomorrow. He was buried at Tongaat Cemetery.
