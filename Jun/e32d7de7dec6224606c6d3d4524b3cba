OPERATION Okae Molao was in full swing in Tshwane on Thursday, when many suspects were arrested and motorists given tickets. The police operation was introduced by Gauteng commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela after his appointment last February. It is held every Thursday around Gauteng to fight crime. Tshwane district police commissioner Major-General Tommy Mthombeni led the operation in the Pretoria CBD and Sunnyside on Thursday. Law enforcement agencies were joined by the military, health and Tshwane emergency services, Gauteng emergency services and others. Mthombeni said: “On Wednesday, we assembled a team of executives who went on a raid. They dealt with 188 suspects and arrested 182, ranging from 22 bust for gender- based violence, seven for rape, six for assault and domestic violence assault, seven for common assault, two for domestic related-assault, four murder suspects and two for possession of illegal firearms. Mthombeni said the operation was going well, as 126 000 tickets were issued on the R21 roadblock addressing road deaths. He said next to Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre, they issued tickets to the value of R35 000 as they also dealt with Covid-19 regulations compliance. “We tested 54 people’s temperature on the R21, and 590 were tested near the Kgosi Mampuru roadblock.” Motorist Dolly Ramonetha said she was happy after the cops helped her with a flat tyre. “They are doing a great job and should continue doing the good work.” People were also searched. Mthombeni said the arrested suspects will appear in court today.
