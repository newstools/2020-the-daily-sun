WHERE TO for Rhulani Mokwena after he slips on a banana skin? Will he return to Orlando Pirates after his contract won't be renewed by Chippa United, or will he go back into the wilderness where he was before moving to the Eastern Cape? Only time will tell. But what is clear is that his contract, which expires next week, won't be renewed and is expected to hand over his Chippa access card and official car keys back to the club, with immediate effect. Actually, Mokwena will not return to training with the club when they resume training next week, let alone the resumption of the 2019-20 Absa Premiership, which was halted in March by Covid-19 outbreak. Pirates and Chippa entered into a bizarre loan agreement for the Mokwena, "until the end of the season", as they thought Siviwe Mpengesi would not pull the trigger early. “We didn’t renew his loan agreement. Remember the loan agreement is ending next week,” said Chippa COO Lucky Mzinzi on Wednesday. “Mokwena came in here to help us after we got a surprise resignation of Norman Mapeza.” SunSport reported last week that Mokwena is on his way out. On Wednesday Mokwena’s football agent, Steve Kapeluschnik, said he doesn’t know what is next for the former Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach. “We just have to look at other options,” said Kapeluschnik. “I can’t give you an (definite) answer now because I've just seen (media) reports and I’ve just walked in to my office. So you have to give me a little bit of more time.” Pirates have since moved on with German coach Jozef Zinnbauer turning out to become the Buccaneers' fan favourite. He joined Pirates in December last year. Mokwena leaves Chippa after being in charge of of one game – a goalless league draw against Bidvest Wits in March.
