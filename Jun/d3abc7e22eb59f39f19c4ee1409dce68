Kwaito artist Nkiyase is ready to reintroduce herself to Mzansi. The artist, whose real name is Nkiyase Mondlana, has been in the music industry for more than 20 years, but said she had a fear of being famous. As a result, Nkiyase stuck behind the scenes. But now she’s about to reintroduce herself through her single, Nkarhi Wakona. The singer from Alexandra, east of in Joburg, told SunBuzz: “I’ve been in the music industry for too long. I’ve worked with many legends like Trompies, but I chose not to be famous. Fame comes with a lot of problems, hence I stayed away from it. “But now I believe Mzansi people need to know about me. It’s time for people to know that I exist.” The single will be released this Friday. Nkiyase also released a song titled Matlakala featuring Future Majesties. She said the song is relevant to all South Africans at the moment. “Matlakala is a warning to women. Although I released it in March, I feel we need to hear it right now. “On the song I advise women to know men first before they get too serious with them. “Perhaps, this is the reason women are being killed daily. We don’t know the men we’re involved with,” she said. Nkiyase has two albums under her belt, Ka Lebota and Mudar é Bom, which were released in 2009 and 2011 respectively. She said she’s working on her third album. “The album will be about my journey as a musician. I’ve already worked on two songs with Joe Nina. It’ll be released before the end of the year,” she said.
