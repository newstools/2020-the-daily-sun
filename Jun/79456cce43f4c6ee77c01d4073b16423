Itâ€™s sad that politicians are striving for self-glory at the expense of the nation. It is even worse when unions strike deals with clueless politicians. One wonders how did people meet under lockdown level 5 to decide on the reopening of schools. Now some schools are reducing quarantine period to seven days out of desperation to complete syllabuses. How on earth can a third world country like ours compare itself with first world countries such as France? Our leaders have lost it. But blame should be put on union leaders who allowed this to happen. We are in trouble. Realistic first-world countries such as South Korea withdrew when conditions got out of hand. I think we are losing it and we will sink.
