THE silence of Bidvest Wits management has left their star defender Sifiso Hlanti with many unanswered questions. One of those questions is the future of the club if indeed it has been sold or not. Secondly, Hlanti has admitted that his name has been all over the media that he’s wanted by other clubs, but this will only be clear once the future of Wits is known. For now, Hlanti said no one from the club has communicated to them about Wits’ future, but as players they are training via Zoom as usual. However, Hlanti said in life one has to be prepared to take whatever comes as nothing is assured. “What is happening is not nice. But as players we have to stand up and face the reality if the club is sold,” said Hlanti, who has won three trophies with Wits since he arrived in the second half of the 2015-16 season from AmaZulu. “This is a sign that, at some stage, you have to be prepared mentally because in life there are ups and downs, and things will not always be smooth. “But as players, we are still training as normal under lockdown restrictions caused by Covid-19.” Wits hold the aces not only on Hlanti’s future, but also to that of captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, Buhle Mkhwanazi, Haashim Domingo, Deon Hotto, Cole Alexander, Thabang Monare, Gift Motupa, Kgaogelo Sekgota, Phathutshedzo Nange, Ricardo Goss, Brandon Petersen and coach Gavin Hunt. Due to talks that the club’s sale to former Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila chairman Masala Mulaudzi is 90% complete, the players and coach’s future remain unresolved. And other reports say Mulaudzi is looking to make an overhaul and that doesn’t include the players and the head coach Hunt. The 30-year-old Hlanti said if the club is eventually sold, he’ll have to meet the new management to hear their intentions. “We’ll have to negotiate with the new guys,” he said. “But these are not the things that are our main focus right now.”
