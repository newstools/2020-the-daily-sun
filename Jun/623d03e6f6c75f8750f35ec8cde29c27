WHILE reflecting on some of her many childhood memories, singer and songwriter Simphiwe Dana opened up about her ancestral calling. Taking to Twitter, she opened up about her great-grandmother, a fierce sangoma, and how she haunted her to follow suit. “My great-grandmother was famously know for outing and finding abathakathi – ufaku, unyawuza,” she wrote. Ufaku and unyawuza are clan names. ALSO READ:SINGER SIMPHIWE DANA FORGIVES BABY DADDY “She haunts me to take on the baton, but asikho lapho,” wrote Simphiwe. Speaking to Daily Sun about her dreams, she said: “The dreams started when I was 22. I pleaded that I wasn’t ready and perhaps my music was a good enough form of healing others. “Lately they’ve intensified, resulting in scary dream visitations, insomnia and depression. I’m yet to decide what to do. But I have a lot of support.” When she first started having the dreams, she thought it was a grandmum she’d never met. “It was my great-grandmother. She’d announce herself whenever I was around people who had a calling. “Last time she said she was weary and really wanted to pass on her gifts. “The other spiritual visitations are happening with a revived intensity these days. Hence the insomnia.” Her reason for not following her ancestral calling was that it’s a demanding process. “I felt I’m doing the work through music. Healing people, that is,” she said. “But I’m now willing and waiting for guidance.” Simphiwe does believe in the ancestors, and one day she might follow in her great grandmother’s footsteps. “I believe in spiritual guides. I believe in the ancestors,” she said. “But I know that not all ancestors are spiritual guides.”
