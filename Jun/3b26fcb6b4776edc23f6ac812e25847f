BUDDING boxing trainer Pius Dipheko wants the sport to take a leaf out of the Premier Soccer League’s book. He believes a highly experienced boxing figure is required to return the sport to its glory days, rather than a managerial guru. “Look at our soccer administration, it’s successful and well recognised in the world because soccer is run by people who know the sport,” he said. The former fighter suggest that boxing needs a former boxer or someone with boxing knowledge to make boxing popular again. Boxing which was once among the three most popular Mzansi sporting codes, is now regarded as a minor sport. Dipheko blamed the people who has been driving the sport for its decline. “Boxing is not a simple sport, one needs to understand it well in order to run it successfully. I know the office requires good administrators to be functional but that is not all it needs. It would be great if government can allow a former boxer to run the sport,” said Dipheko. “I know boxing is a governed under the act of parliament but politics and sports does not mix, it’s like water and oil. I’m in full support with the government empowering black people but I wish the government was deploying cadres who understand the dynamics of the sporting code they are deployed to,” he said. Dipheko who housed fighters such as former WBF champion Thato Bonokoane and boxing prospect Linda Ntshingila at his Ruimsig based gym says it’s right time for the boxing community to be united and speak in one voice. According to Dipheko they need to make the Minister of Sport Nathi Mthethwa aware that boxing is neglected and not treated as one of the great sporting codes in Mzansi. “The Minister of Sport is not aware of what is happening at ground level. We must make him aware of our needs,” said Dipheko.
