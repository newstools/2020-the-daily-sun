“I’ve never seen a man with six-packs who is a billionaire. He is not there.” These are the words of Pastor Franklin Mondo Mugisha of Empowerment Christian Centre Church International in Uganda. In a video doing the rounds on social media, the pastor said men with six pack are all broke because their brains are in the chest. He blamed them for spending too much time in the gym while dedicating zero time to money making projects. Said Mondo: “Look at boys who spend their times in the gym. I’ve never seen a man with six-packs who is a billionaire. He is not there. They are just bodyguards for billionaires.  They are all broke; they are all using boda bodas and taxis for transport. All their brains are in the chests”. He added: “Look at boys who spend their times in the gym. I have never seen a man with a six who is a billionaire, he is not there!” He said. He added that majority of the men who have gym subscriptions are broke and they only thinking about women and sex while working on their bodies. He advised women: “So going back I don’t think it is right looking for a man who spends 8 hours in the gym, what you think that man is thinking? Sexy! Sexy! Kanyama! Six pack!
