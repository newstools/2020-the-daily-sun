The suspects aged between 32 and 43 appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate's Court yesterday. They were each granted bail of R1 000," police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said. The officers included two sergeants and a constable from the Sydenham Police Station. Few bottles handed in Naicker said the woman who tipped police off about the trio's alleged crimes said they arrived at her Clare Road residence on 23 May and accused her of selling alcohol. "The suspects seized liquor valued at R24 000. They also demanded and received R20 000 from the complainant for her release. When the complainant went to the Sydenham police station, she found that the suspects only handed in a few bottles of alcohol as abandoned and that they had not opened a case against her."
