It is a piano song that was recorded early January at Loudly Comix studios and it was produced by Kush beatz, Tiggyman and Malefetsane Ainne,” said Mshampisto. “It was released in March and people love the song especially the Mamelodi Sundowns fans, it's a hit song and no, we did copy the idea of the Lorch song. I think I'm the first artist to sing about the coach if I'm not mistaken. The reason I chose to sing about Pitso is, I personally think we as South Africans don't give him the respect he deserves, instead we criticizing him for speaking the truth. I sing about Pitso but I'm not even a Sundowns fan, he added. People can get this Pitso Mosimane song to online websites they must just go to Google to search the song because I'm still busy with the digital stores.
