THE sudden resignation of Ajax Cape Town coach Andries Ulderink in February did not affect the team's performance in any way. They were top of the log when he left and they have continued with their dominance under co-caretaker coaches of Calvin Marlin and Dylan Deane. That showed how focused and mentally strong their players are. And now veteran striker Eleazar Rodgers believes the players could show the same character when the league gives the green light to resume and complete the season. When the league was halted in March, due to Covid-19, Ajax were at the top of the GladAfrica Championship, having opened a seven-point gap between themselves and second-placed Swallows FC after 24 matches. With the league set for a return, experienced Rodgers says it is theirs to lose, with six games remaining. ”It was a setback to lose the coach, but Ajax has been a professional club for a long time. Players have shown how strong they are mental,” Rodgers said. ”The squad is dominated by young players the likes of Kegan Johannes, Thendo Mukumela, Abednego Mosiatlhaga, Grant Margeman but they have shown resilience. I, therefore, believe when the league resumes we will finish off and the club win automatic promotion to PSL where we belong. ”It is in our hands whether we lose or win it. But I believe we are in control of whatever that will happen.” This season Ajax bounced back with a bang, following their disappointment at missing out on promotion to the Premiership last season. The Urban Warriors were relegated to the second-tier two seasons ago and had such a poor first year in the GladAfrica where they did not even make the play-offs. However, this season the Capetonians look rejuvenated and seemingly set for automatic promotion. Rodgers has praised how players conduct themselves in the team. He said: ”Rooi Mahumatsa and I are the senior players in the team, we have been playing our role as senior players. Also, there are no egos in this team the youngsters are focused.”
