KATLEGO “Killer” Mphela has finally explained his reasons for leaving Mamelodi Sundowns and joining Kaizer Chiefs at the twilight of his career. Mphela’s move to across town rivals Amakhosi is still criticized even today and is seen and labelled as a career-ending transfer move. “It is simple, but still people do not understand even today,” said Mphela. “Cristiano Ronaldo left the biggest club in the world Real Madrid and joined Juventus. He needed new challenges and that’s why he left the comfort of Madrid to go and slug it out in Italy,” Mphela said. “I was supposed to join SuperSport United again. I had been at Sundowns for six years and I needed a fresh challenge and new environment. It was time to try new opportunities and Chiefs explained why they wanted me and how they were going to use me. What they offered me made sense to me because I was still ambitious – it was just a question of opting for the best contract on the table," he added. “It was about my future and I did not know whether it was going to work on not. I do not regret anything because Chiefs are a big club and at that time, I thought that playing for them was part of my journey,” said Mphela.
