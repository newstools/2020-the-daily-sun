IT is still unclear where Kamohelo Mokotjo will be playing football next season. For now though, the Bafana Bafana midfielder will be allowed to finish the season with his English Championship side Brentford. This is after he extended his contract at least until the end of the season, while he also ponders on his long term future. The 29-year-old is not keen to return home  and is looking to pursue his career overseas where will not be short of suitors once he departs “The Bees” base. Competition in the midfield anchor role in the starting line-up has become stiffer for Mokotjo with Josh Da Silva and Shandon Baptiste keeping him on his toes. But for now he will stay with Brentford, who are pushing for a promotion playoffs spot, until the end of the season as per the League protocol implemented due to the suspension of fixtures because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We are very pleased to extend Kamohelo’s contract, ” said Brendford coach Thomas Frank. ”He has worked very hard to come back from his injury and will be ready and fit for selection against Fulham. We need the General’s experience, coolness and passing ability as we head into the last part of the season. ”He is so reliable and adds so much to the group, both in training and matches. You can see when he steps onto the pitch how it raises the levels of those around him.” Even though he will soon be out of contract, Mokotjo is not the only overseas-based player facing a bleak future. The likes of Percy Tau and Lyle Foster are likely to leave their respective Belgium Pro League teams where they spent season on loans. Tau was farmed out to Club Brugge by Brighton and Hove Albion but is unlikely to return to the English Premiership due to work permit restrictions. Foster, who is in the books of the French Ligue 1 Monaco, has hardly shone during his loan spell at Cercle Brugge.
