AMAZULU management are still mulling over the future of coach Jozef Vukusic. The KwaZulu Natal outfit board of directors were supposed to have finalised last week whether they will continue with Vukusic’s services or allow his assistant Ayanda Dlamini to wrap up the PSL season. The Slovakian coach was put on “special leave” in March due to internal matters management refused to reveal to the public. Dlamini, who was given the job on an interim basis gave Usuthu a lifeline in a bid to avoid relegation when he helped them move from the basement with an impressive 1-0 win over log leaders Kaizer Chiefs prior to the lockdown due to coronavirus. AmaZulu are second bottom with 23 points from 24 matches. AmaZulu General Manager Lunga Sokhela said the board needed one more week to finalise the matter. Said Sokhela: “The board hasn’t finalised (Vukusic’s future) yet, but it should be done by Friday.”
