The International Netball Federation (INF) has released their latest netball world rankings based on all matches that took place prior to the suspension due to the Covid-19 outbreak, including the Vitality Netball Nations Cup that took place in January. That tournament saw the Proteas square off against New Zealand, England and Jamaica. While Jamaica finished as runners-up after losing to world champions New Zealand, South Africa finished fourth after losing their playoff match against Commonwealth champions and hosts, England. According to the latest world rankings, South Africa have retained their fifth position with 148 ranking points. The only country to have moved up is Jamaica who are now ranked third, while England have moved one position down to fourth with both countries on 172 ranking points. “The announcement by INF regarding the world rankings is well received and as Netball South Africa, we are happy that we have not moved down the pecking order. If you look at our ranking points, we have significantly improved there. It is our goal to move up the table, this is a work in progress and I honestly believe that we will ultimately get there very soon. I am very proud of the team as a collective because everyone is working hard to do better and be the best,” said Netball South Africa President Cecilia Molokwane. Due to the current lockdown, the Proteas have also been dealt another blow in their attempt to getting back onto the court and competing on the global stage. On Sunday, 31 May, Netball Australia announced that the Quad Series which was scheduled to take place in September had been cancelled and a new date will be negotiated with all the affected associations. Countries that were due to participate in the Quad Series included New Zealand, South Africa, England and Australia.
