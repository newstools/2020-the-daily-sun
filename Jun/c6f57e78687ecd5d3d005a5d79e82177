AN epidemic of break-ups is expected when lockdown ends. Relationship coach and psychologist Sonja Broschk said many couples were not coping with the stress lockdown has caused. “It hasn’t hit us yet because the focus is on the financial impact of the coronavirus, but divorce courts will be full as the unemployment rate increases. China has seen a spike in divorce rates,” she said. “Before lockdown, couples had the ability to leave their homes and be with friends and family members. When lockdown was implemented, they were left stuck under the same roof 24 hours a day,” she said. Sonja said each day, there were more conflicts as their vulnerabilities were now exposed. “Things they never knew about each other are in the spotlight, including addictions, mental disorders and financial strain.” She said the ban on cigarettes and tobacco was also contributing to frustration, which sometimes resulted in domestic violence. Sonja said when the lockdown was announced, she advised her clients with unstable relationships to live separately. A couple from Randburg, Joburg, told Daily Sun lockdown had been difficult. They said they’d been dating for just over two years when they moved in together in February. The woman said her boyfriend was not helping with chores and played loud music. “I realised shortly after we started dating that his place was often untidy and I didn’t mind helping him clean. I moved in with him when I got a job closer to his place,” she said. The boyfriend said the woman was critical. “I love her and hope we find common ground.”
