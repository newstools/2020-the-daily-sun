  Leonard Mzingeli, the man accused of the murder of 17-year-old Amahle Quku, has confessed, the Wynberg Magistrate's Court heard on Tuesday. "It is a confession to the crime as charged," prosecutor
Jarrod Seethal told magistrate Goolam Bawa. Two witnesses also made statements against Mzingeli who
hugged himself as he stood head-down in the dock. He may face further charges. "Dog!" shouted a woman as he went back into
custody. He will return for a bail application on 7 July. "We will never forgive you," sang picketing
friends outside the court. Amahle was found murdered and naked in Brown's Farm,
Philippi, on Sunday. This, amid #WomensLivesMatter pickets and President Cyril
Ramaphosa declaring the murders of women and children a second pandemic
alongside Covid-19. "We are very, very hurt," said her aunt. Bongiswa Nosandla described her niece as "calm and
pretty". Tears ran over the mask of another aunt, Boniswa Mayile. "She was a good child. She didn't deserve to die like
this." Family and supporters from Ilitha Labantu sat spaced apart
in the court after getting the green light once their temperature was taken and
a Covid-19 symptom check form completed. This applied to everybody entering the court. SOURCE: NEWS24
