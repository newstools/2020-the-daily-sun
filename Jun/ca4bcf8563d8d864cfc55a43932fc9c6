BOTSHABELO section J shops were looted, while others were burnt on Tuesday. This was after the foreign shop owners allegedly killed a man who apparently tried to rob them with his friends. He was apparently using a toy gun. Lesego Matha (20) was found dead with teeth missing and head injuries in the shop. Two foreigners were arrested for murder. But the residents attacked the shops ekasi, looting them and burning others. When the SunTeam visited the area, all the shops in the sections were attacked by the angry crowd. A resident said he was relieved that the crowd only attacked the shop in his yard and not his family home. “The shop owners are accused of brutally killing a resident they accused of trying to rob them. I have rented out a place for them to use in my yard, and I was worried that my family will be attacked. I’m glad the crowd spared us. I was scared that our house will be burnt because they are our tenants. The angry residents looted everything inside the shop,” said the resident. Shop owner Rahim Ishmalah (29) said he ran for his life when he saw the angry crowd approaching his store. “I don’t care about the money and the goods they took. My life is more important. I don’t know anything about the killing of the man,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said cops were called to the shop and found the dead man with missing teeth. Makhele told Daily Sun: “Seven suspects were arrested for public violence following the looting of shops. The two foreign shop owners, aged 42 and 45, were arrested for murder. They claim the victim and two of his friends tried to rob them. The victim had facial and head injuries. His hands were tied up with a rope. His friends allegedly fled and a toy gun, allegedly used by the victim and his friends, was found. A case of attempted burglary was also opened. The suspects will appear in court soon.”
