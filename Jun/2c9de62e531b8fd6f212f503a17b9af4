IT’S only three days until the first episode of SUN’Ceda on Mzansi Wethu at 6.30pm. This Thursday, join Stoan Seate as he goes on a mission to bring more SUNPOWER to SunReaders on TV. The People’s Paper has teamed up with 1Life to help SunReaders who need a leg up to get going again, looking for answers to questions plaguing them, or to see their way through a dark tunnel that only has a light right at the end. “In our storytelling, Daily Sun captures the generous and selfless spirit of Mzansi,” said editor-in-chief, Mapula Nkosi. “Just like SUN’Ceda, we knock on the doors of South Africans who desperately seek help and bring hope and solutions. “Our incredible stories not only shine the spotlight on our social malaise but empower individuals and communities.” Speaking to the People’s Paper recently, Stoan said: “I wouldn’t say it’s sad through and through. We have a happy ending and leave people in a better state than we found them.”
