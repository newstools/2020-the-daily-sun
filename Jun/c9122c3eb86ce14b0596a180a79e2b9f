The Pikitup head office in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, has been closed with immediate effect. The Communications and Stakeholder Relations, Stan Itshegetseng, told Daily Sun that this shut down comes after an employee tested positive for Covid-19. The office will be closed for 48 hours. Itshegetseng said during this shut down, the office will be decontaminated and all employees who were in direct contact with the affected employee will be screened and self-isolate for 14 days. "All employees stationed at the Head Office have been advised to work from home and will return to work on Monday 22 June 2020," he said. A 55 year-old employee stationed at the Roodepoort depot passed away at a hospital during the weekend after it was also discovered that she was Covid-19 positive. This is according to Itshegetseng. "The depot will be decontaminated and all the employees who had direct contact with the infected employee have been advised to self-isolate. The depot will re-open on Monday, 22 June 2020 as well," he said. Itshegetseng further stated that Roodepoort depot, waste collection services in areas serviced by the depot will be provided through augmented services and garden sites in the area will also be operational as employees at such sites did not interact with the deceased employee.
