TALKS are at an advanced stage for Ricardo Goss to join Mamelodi Sundowns! The Bidvest Wits goalkeeper has confirmed he was ironing out a few kinks before he could pen to paper the Brazilians. Goss signed a three-year deal with an option to renew for two more years. If all things go accordingly Goss says he will be ready for the competition that he will face when he joins Sundowns as the club also have former Under-23 international Jody February who will join in July as well as veteran duo of Kenedy Mweene and Denis Onyango. There's also former Kaizer Chiefs goalie Reyaad Pieterse in the Downs goalkeeping department. Talking to SunSport on Wednesday, Goss confirmed that negotiations are going on between him and Sundowns, it is just a matter of time before the deal could be finalized. “I think it’s just about finalizing personal terms now to agree for the move to happen. We are discussing personal terms with Sundowns,” the excited Bafana Bafana international said. He admitted that he will fave a stiff competition as Down but he is up for a challenge and believe he will grow under the guidance of Onyango and other Downs veteran. He started: ”There’s a quality of goalkeepers at Sundowns and I have to fight for my place. It’s not going to be easy, I’m willing to fight and also to learn. ”The goalkeeper is one of many players that are set to leave the Clever Boys at the end of the season as the Braamfontein-based side has been sold to Limpopo businessman and will be named Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM).
