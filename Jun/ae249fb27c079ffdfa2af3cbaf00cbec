PHILLIP, it’s here... Many will remember the slogan vividly this month as the country goes down a collective memory lane to history. It truly feels like yesterday when South Africa erupted into scenes of wild celebration as the 2010 Fifa World Cup kicked off a decade ago. The world... and the doubting Thomases descended on the southern tip of Africa to witness the first ever Fifa global showpiece on African soil, which kicked off on 11 June to 11 July 2010. Ten years may have passed ever since South Africa made history, and the world may have moved on since the football jamboree. But this week, Mzansi will be going right back to the days of “Phillip” and Zakumi as millions reminisce about the event which helped put South Africa on the global map since the dawn of democracy in 1994. Thousands waved their flags, many blew the ear-bursting vuvuzelas as the pride of the nation, Bafana Bafana, stepped out of the tunnel on a chilly day on 11 June at FNB Stadium. And pandemonium elapsed as Siphiwe Tshabalala blasted in the opening goal of the tournament for Bafana against Mexico, literally scripting history. Like many, he touched a dream, a dream of seeing Bafana to the group stages for the very first time in their World Cup history. Well, it wasn’t to be as Bafana drew 1-1 against Mexico, lost 3-0 to Uruguay in Tshwane, but went out of the tourney with a bang as they beat France 2-1 in Bloemfontein. But to many, the event mattered as much and they determinedly supported the tournament to its end.
