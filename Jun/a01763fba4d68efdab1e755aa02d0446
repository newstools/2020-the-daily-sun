THE BMW Z3 M Coupe has become a rare collector high-performance piece of automotive history. It was nicknamed the ‘Shooting Brake’ is based on the BMW Z3M Roadster. The M Coupes built between 1999 and 2000, since the Coupe was discontinued in 2002, we could safely say the M140i took the baton and marched forward. A United Kingdom custom shop BMW & Mini UK Group decided it would be fitting to recreate the looks of the classic. Their project is based on the BMW M140i, like a scene out the Transformers movie, parts of a BMW F87 M2 sprung into action for this transformation.  Thanks to the crashed M2, the M140i widebody was born.  According to builder Dave Cambell, they were satisfied with the factory B58 six-cylinder turbo mill’s performance. The 3.0L straight-six mill makes 249 kW, but the crew did a bit of tinkering to produce a bit more power.
