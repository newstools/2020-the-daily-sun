 Three women have been killed by violent means in just weeks in KwaZulu-Natal, this while the country is reeling from a shocking surge in gender-based violence during the national Covid-19 lockdown. On Monday, police said they found the body of a woman, aged between 18 and 20, with multiple stab wounds in Stockville Road near Giba Gorge. "Police are appealing for assistance to locate the relatives of the woman," police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. She said police were called to the area on Sunday, 7 June to "attend to a complaint of murder". "Upon arrival at the scene, police found the body of a woman with multiple stab wounds on the body. It was established that the deceased was killed in another area and was dumped near Giba Gorge on a foot pathway." Mbele said the body was found by a member of the community coming from work. "The deceased is dark in complexion, has short hair and had a silver slit on two upper incisors. She was wearing a navy jean, white top with blue flowers and a black belt. Mariannhill detectives are investigating a case of murder." The next of kin of the deceased or anyone with a missing relative, should contact Detective Warrant Officer Maluleka on 071 350 0590 or 031 791 3214, or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
