NEW Baroka FC striker Nhlanhla Mgaga is optimistic that Bakgaga, under coach Dylan Kerr, will survive relegation and also challenge for the Nedbank Cup. Baroka are 13th on the log with the same number of points (23) points, with Polokwane City and AmaZulu below them. They are also only three points ahead of bottom side Black Leopards, with only six matches remaining to end the 2019/20 season which has been suspended due to worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. But the 24-year-old, who joined Baroka from GladAfrica Championship outfit Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on a three-year contract in January, said he had been impressed by the Englishman’s style of coaching and how the former Black Leopards mentor treats all his players. Kerr also joined Baroka at the same time with Mgaga in January, succeeding Wedson Nyirenda. “Kerr is an amazing coach and a person,” said the Soweto-born player. “He (Kerr) just wants us to enjoy playing football and he is like a father to all of us in the team. Kerr is always happy and he is a hardworking coach. “He always wants to see his players happy, and he jokes with us everyday at training. “The connection with him is amazing. You enjoy working with him and you adapt fast “As long as he is still with us, I don’t see us getting relegated. All we have to do is listen to him and stay focused when the league restarts after the coronavirus. “We have a good squad capable of helping this team end the season at a good position, and challenge for the Nedbank Cup. All we have to do is to get to the final and then anything is possible.” The 2019 Telkom Knockout Cup champions are still in the Nedbank Cup last four with the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic. Baroka are set to face Celtic in the last four of the competition, which has a R7 million purse to the winners.
