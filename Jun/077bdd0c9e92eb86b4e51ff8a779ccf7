WHEN Mamelodi Sundowns come to select their Player of the Season, one name very much in the frame will be that of midfielder Andile Jali. The experienced Bafana Bafana star made a difficult transition back to the Absa Premiership after four-and-a-half years in Belgium with Oostende, but this season has been back to his absolute best and in sparkling form. The 30-year-old admits that it was a challenge to find his form again, but said the environment at Sundowns has allowed him to flourish. “Having come back home from Europe, I always knew it was not going to be easy. “But Sundowns made the transition easier because I could feel that I did not come back to just any team, but it felt like family. I had all my brothers around to assist me settle in,” Jali told his club’s website. “However, with all the talent we have in the squad, making it in the starting line-up was not going to be a walk in the park. But my mind was set out for the task.” Jali’s performances earned him a recall to the Bafana squad for March’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sao Tome e Principe that were eventually called off, and he is looking forward to resuming an international career that has already see him garner 47 caps. “Another big task I knew I had was to represent my country. “It really feels good to have seen a positive response to goals I had coming back home,” added Jali. “But most of all the South African fans were one of the things I was looking forward to seeing again. Hearing them cheer and feeling their passion from the stands.” – SUPERSPORT
