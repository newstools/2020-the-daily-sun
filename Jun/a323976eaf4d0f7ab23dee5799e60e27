MOST big events were cancelled after the coronavirus outbreak, but the Crown Gospel Music Awards organisers are crossing fingers. They are praying God performs miracles and ends the pandemic before November, the month when the awards are usually held. They have also proven they have hope about the end of Covid-19, by partnering with Africa Gospel Foundation in a competition searching for aspiring gospel singers to perform during the awards ceremony. The competition, Gospel Dreams Africa started on Wednesday and is taking place on Africa Gospel social media accounts, including Facebook and YouTube. Awards founder Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule said the winner will not only sing at the awards ceremony, but will also win R25 000 in cash, a year’s recording contract and the opportunity to market their music. “We’re using digital platforms to run the competition. It’s easy. Aspiring singers will have to record themselves with their cellphones and send it to the Africa Gospel Foundation email.” Zanele said they were praying God made the way for the awards. “We are still not sure whether we will use social media to hold the awards or we will hold them at ICC. We are crossing fingers that God performs miracles,” she said. Africa Gospel Foundation spokesman Larry Mhlanga said they were hoping that by November, everything would be back to normal. “We are having this big competition with Gospel Powerhouse that organises Crown awards,” he said. “With the economy reopening possibly by September, we’re hoping that by November, everything will be back to normal and we will have the prestigious awards.” Mhlanga said the competition also served to motivate gospel lovers, since everyone was affected by Covid 19. The awards attract thousands of gospel fans every year and have launched the careers of famous gospel singers such as Dr Tumi and Betusile Mcinga.
