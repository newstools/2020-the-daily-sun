WHEN popular maskandi star Maqhinga Hadebe released his hit song titled X Yami in 2018, women weren’t happy at all. They accused him of insulting women as his song says his exes are idiots. Now things have changed as controversial Afro-pop singer Zandi Khumalo spread her wings to the maskandi genre to respond to Maqhinga’s song. Zandi, who is Kelly Khumalo’s younger sister, has reworked Maqhinga’s song and says male exes are idiots. Her song was released on Friday and it has received a warm welcome from women. It has also enjoyed airplay on Mzansi’s biggest radio station, Ukhozi FM. Zandi told Daily Sun everyone has an ex. “I’m happy I have released a maskandi song and re-worked Maqhinga’s song to make women’s voices heard when it comes to exes. “Maqhinga’s version was only directed at women and one-sided. “Now it has two sides and I love it. I wanted to show my fans that I can sing maskandi properly and deliver a message,” she said. Zandi said she asked Maqhinga if she could rework his song and he agreed, and also produced it. Maqhinga told Daily Sun he was happy Zandi was a voice of reason for women by reworking the song. “People must not get confused about Zandi’s song. Zandi worked with me on her maskandi song and I like it. I was surprised she could sing maskandi,” he said. The single will be featured on Zandi’s second album to be released next year.
