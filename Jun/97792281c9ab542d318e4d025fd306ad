They
promised desperate people jobs but at a cost. For a
while, they pocketed hundreds of rands from each desperate person looking for a
job. On
Wednesday morning, at least eight alleged job scammers between the ages of 21
and 25 were arrested. Police
spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said they are charged with a case of fraud and
expected to appear at Joburg Magistrate Court soon. Mbele said:
“The suspects defrauded a number of people after promising them jobs. Victims
paid an amount of R450 each to get a job and they were promised office work as
well as cleaning jobs.” The
suspects were operating at Alpa House building, between Commissioner and Von
Weilligh street in Joburg CBD. Mbele
added: “We are appealing to community members to refrain from paying to get
jobs.”
