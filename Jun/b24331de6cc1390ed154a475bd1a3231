Sipho Mavimbela was only 17 years old when his dead body was found at the morgue with a big hole in his chest, lying naked on the floor. Forty-four years later, Sipho’s mom Emily (83) said the month of June still brings dark and painful memories. It was two days after the Soweto Uprising when residents of Alexandra clashed with the police. Emily said she was at work when she received a call that police were shooting at people. She said she rushed home and was confronted by high police presence in the area but there was no sign of her son. The following Monday, three days later since he last saw her son, there was still no sign of him. She went looking for him accompanied by her sister. They went from hospitals, police stations and mortuaries until spotting his body at one of the mortuaries. Emily said: “I will never forget what I saw. Those images still haunt me to this day.” ALSO READ: AMBULANCE VANDALISED IN SOWETO! She said: “Dead bodies were lying naked on the floor, including pregnant women with their babies popped out. “We had to jump one body to the next, searching for him. Ultimately we found him. He was also lying naked on the floor with a big hole in his chest. I shook his leg, calling his name. I wanted him to wake up but he was dead,” said Emily. Emily recalled how she last saw her son alive. She said: “He prepared for school along with his younger brother and we said our goodbyes and I left for work. Little did I know I was seeing him alive for the last time. “I miss him. I can’t make sense of what he did so bad to die in this manner. He was a sweet child, a hard worker and he loved school. He wanted to be a doctor. He often told me that as soon as he starts working, he will take care of me”.
