THREE-YEAR-OLD Ansia Kheha’s body was found stuffed in a plastic bag in Orange Farm, south of Joburg, a week ago. Speaking at her funeral, Teboho Molefe said the man you are running to for help may be your killer. “We will be scared to run to men for help because we’re not sure whether we will be running into our killer’s hands,” she said as she addressed mourners gathered at the Orange Farm Multi-Purpose Hall. “Maybe there is something that we, as women, have done wrong. If we have, can God please forgive us,” she said. “If we have done something wrong to men, we apologise to each and every man who has been hurt by a woman.  Teboho said she felt as if she has lost her own child. “We are not healed. We keep hearing about other deaths happening all the time.” Ansia’s mum, Johanna Nyanjani, thanked Solly Mkhabela, who assisted the family through his foundation. Solly said: “God created men to look after women. This child was killed by a man.  “Are you not ashamed to take a knife and kill a woman? “Women sleep with one eye open as they worry about men breaking into their houses.” He said this didn’t happen in Orange Farm before. Orange Farm TV and radio personality Bujy Bikwa said: “This is disgusting. We have failed as a community, as a nation and as men. We are ashamed.” MMC Margaret Arnolds said the problem starts when people know about something wrong but choose to ignore it.
