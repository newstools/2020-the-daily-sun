SEIPATI Mmekwa has become a shining light in Marikana. Using her husband’s pension money, she opened a soup kitchen to help those in need during the 2014 mineworkers’ protest. She’s continued feeding hungry people in Wonderkop, North West, and surrounding areas. Seipati had to stop when lockdown began, however. “I started catering for 60 people,” she said. “The number has increased and became worse due to lockdown. People are hungry. “Many mineworkers don’t work. Those who live on temporary jobs are suffering. “We struggle to get donations. People come and sometimes I don’t have anything. “I have to make a plan from my own pocket.” Seipati would appreciate any form of help: clothes, blankets and food. She pleaded with government, business and citizens to lend a helping hand. Beneficiary Nomagazi Bokolo said: “Hunger could have killed me if it wasn’t for this woman. She’s the mother of Marikana.” Nomagazi, who’s from the Eastern Cape, said Seipati helped them bury their brother. “We wish this woman could get all the help and support she needs,” said Nomagazi. “What she’s done for the people of Marikana is extraordinary.”
