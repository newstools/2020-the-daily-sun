Mpumalanga police have launched a manhunt for a gang of thugs who made off with an undisclosed amount of cash after blowing up a cash safe and ATM. The incident happened inside the A1 Food Store at Dwarsloop Mall near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Sunday night. When the SunTeam visited the scene on Monday morning, social grant beneficiaries who had come to withdraw their money were shocked when they were greeted by a damaged ATM as the police were busy on the scene. Shocked security said they just heard a loud explosion and alerted the police as the gang dashed out of the shop with the cash. “We just heard a loud bang inside the A1 Food Store, and immediately alerted the police. “But upon arrival, the criminals had already vanished into the darkness with the money. “The police realised the suspects gained entrance to the mall through the fence. “They went to the back of the shop building where they forced the rear door open and entered before blowing up the ATM and cash safe inside the store,” said a guard. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed the robbery. He said a case of malicious damage to property has been opened for investigation. He urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact their nearest cop shop or call CrimeStop on 08000 10111.
