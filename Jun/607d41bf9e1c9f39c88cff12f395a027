HE promised his girlfriend money when he received R7 000 from a stokvel. But he may have paid with his life for not keeping his promise. Tsietsi Machubeni (43) was stabbed to death with a sharp weapon, allegedly by his heavily-pregnant girlfriend. She found him with his other girlfriend, who was also pregnant. It happened at Tsietsi’s house in Ga-Kuranta Village in Bolobedu, Limpopo, on Sunday night. His niece Mahlatse (31) couldn’t understand why the suspect killed her uncle. The two girlfriends apparently knew of each other. She told Daily Sun the suspect called and explained she’d stabbed her uncle. “The girlfriend told me my uncle promised to give her money for clothes. When she realised he wasn’t coming she went to his house and found him with the other girlfriend.” A fight then started. “She got mad when my uncle protected the other girlfriend and stabbed him with a sharp object in the chest.” Family member Mapula Machubeni (50) said Tsietsi had kids with both women. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a 42-year-old pregnant suspect was bust on Sunday and charged with murder. She was released on warning on Monday because of her condition. “The suspect will appear again today for murder. Our investigations continue,” she said. Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale called on couples facing challenges to approach social workers.
