THE Eastern Cape now has the second highest number of coronavirus cases,surpassing Gauteng. Earlier today,Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize gave an update of the latest cases and the Eastern Cape has 4324 cases while Gauteng has 4276. Figures releases yesterday show that the Eastern Cape has recorded 82 coronavirus related deaths while Gauteng has just 33.   The province has been facing criticism for its handling of the outbreak and both Mkhize and President Ramaphosa have visited the provincial epicentre that is Nelson Mandela Bay. The outbreak of the coronavirus was linked to two funerals which were held just before the start of Mzansi's lockdown. East London prison also has been affected with reports showing that an employee who attended one of the two problematic funerals likely spread the virus to colleagues and inmates. Eastern Cape department of Health Superintendent General Dr Thobile Mbengashe was on news channel Newzroom Afrika this evening. He said the province experienced a big spike in infections at the start of level 4 in May whenÂ  a large number of people travelled from the national epicentre of the Western Cape into the Eastern Cape. He also added that there was still a lack of acceptance and understanding of the lockdown safety measures such as social distancing and wearing masks in the rural parts of the province. Mbengashe also dismissed the claims that the province has a shortage of persona protective equipment(PPEs) for health workers.
