I FIND it amazing that the EFF, also known as South African Black Bolsheviks are hell-bent on mentioning Steinhoff fraudster, Markus Jooste, and the biased media coverage whenever the VBS looters are mentioned. For the record, Jooste never knowingly oppressed his own elderly people through stealing from them. He also didn’t add insult to injury by flaunting their stolen funds as the VBS spotlight-lovers did with the money, status and materialism they got through their exploits. Hence the seemingly biased media. Jooste didn’t crave fame and relevance through shallow and ill-gotten earthly commodities to validate himself as an achiever to the fickle public.
