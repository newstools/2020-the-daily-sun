Many people are complaining that staying home came with gaining a lot of weight. Getting rid of it isn't easy as winter has hit already and we will be doing more eating as food is said to make us warmer. Watching what you eat is extremely important as your flat stomach depends on it. Speaking to The Sun, Lisa Borg, nutritionist at Pulselight Clinic, said the majority of excess fat accumulation around the mid-section is due to unwise dietary choices and hormonal imbalances."Especially cortisol, grehlin, leptin, and insulin which are linked to stress, poor sleep, and a high intake of sugars," she explained. Here are the five foods to avoid if you want to get a flat stomach: 1. Give up the grains Grains are a carbohydrate that many people find difficult to digest and can cause bloating. 2. Stay away from booze Alcohol causes the body to retain water and in many cases the gas already in popular beverages such as beer and cider can lead to bloating. 3. Ditch the dairy Most dairy products contain lactose which the body finds difficult to digest. If you want to beat the bloat you should avoid products such as ice cream, cheese and milk. 4. Curb the caffeine While many of us are used to knocking back a couple of teas or coffees just to get through the morning slog, the caffeine you are consuming might be bloating you out. 5. Forget fried foods Most fried foods are junk food.
