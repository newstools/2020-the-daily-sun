English Championship outfit Brentford have extended the contract of Bafana Bafana midfielder Kamohelo Mokotjo. The 29-year-old has been at the club since 2017, joining tem from Dutch outfit FC Twente. The club announced the contract extension on Thursday.  “We are very pleased to extend Kamohelo’s contract," Brentford coach, Thomas Frank said in a statement. "He has worked very hard to come back from his injury and will be ready and fit for selection against Fulham,” “We need The General’s experience, coolness and passing ability as we head into the last part of the season. He is so reliable and adds so much to the group, both in training and matches. "You can see when he steps onto the pitch how it raises the levels of those around him.” Mokotjo was injured when football was halted in March but he's now back in training. The South African international played the second half of Brentford’s friendly win at Arsenal last Wednesday in his usual central midfield role.
