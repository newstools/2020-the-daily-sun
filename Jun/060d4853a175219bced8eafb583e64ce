KAIZER Chiefs and Orlando Pirates supporters are known as Mzansi’s biggest rivals. But they’ve found a common goal: helping the needy. Wearing their team’s T-shirts, five supporters from the Chiefs branch in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, and five from the Pirates greater branch in the same kasi distributed food parcels on Friday. The parcels included canned food, maize meal, sugar, soup, cooking oil and toothpaste. At least 11 families benefitted. They told Daily Sun this was the beginning of a great partnership to help those who were affected by Covid-19. With football being placed on hold due to the pandemic, fans used their savings to feed destitute families. Chiefs fan Thokozani Mafanele said: “We’re still rivals and that will never change. “This is not about football, but people’s lives. “We can’t sit back waiting for football matches to resume when people around us are starving and we have little money to help.” Pirates fan Ishmael Mapetla said they were happy to help. “We don’t have money, but the little we had was able to put a smile on people’s faces,” Ishmael told the People’s Papper. “We’re hoping to get sponsors so that we can reach more families. “We’re all human, and the only time we differ is during the 90 minutes of a football match.”
