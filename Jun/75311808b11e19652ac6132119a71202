THE six suspects linked to theÂ  kidnapping and murder of Hambanathi teenager Andile Bobo Mbuthu (16) would probably have known by now if they are granted bail or not. But they don't know because they are on quarantine. This is after a court police and magistrate tested for Covid-19 and discovered that they were positive. The accused, Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Andile Nhleko (27), Mcedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (22) who are charged with kidnapping and murder didn't come to court today. Last week their matter was adjourned after a cop from the courtroom they had been making their bail application went for testing for Covid-19 as he felt sick. The matter was then remanded for today for results of the test. The results of the cop came out positive and it also emerged that a magistrate has also tested positive for Covid-19. The entire court was therefore closed and at the gate there was a notice written that the court is closed due to decontamination of the building. Court proceedings were conducted at the family court building. But Bobo's six suspects didn't come to court as they were taken into quarantine. The Verulam court manager Reshma Rambarren asked the SunTeam to contact her tomorrow in order to find out the next court date for Bobo's case. She confirmed that the six suspects were taken into quarantine. She also confirmed that a court cop and a Mangistrate tested positive for Covid-19. "The court will be opened on Wednesday. But please call me tomorrow for the next date for Bobo's case," she said. The suspects had started their bail application two weeks ago. The Investigating Officer (IO) Mjabulelwa Thabethe had opposed bail for the suspects. Magistrate Thiloshir Badal was expected to either grant or denied the suspects bail.
