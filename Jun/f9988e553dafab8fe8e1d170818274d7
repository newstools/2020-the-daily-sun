Maritzburg United defender Nazeer Allie has reflected on their dominance over Kaizer Chiefs this season. Chiefs have enjoyed one of their best Absa Premiership seasons in recent years having recorded the most wins (15) which sees them at the top of the league standings. However, Maritzburg have proved to be their hoodoo team this term having recorded two victories and one draw against the Soweto giants. Allie, 35, played all three matches as a key player in the Team of Choice's defence and he has revealed the secret to their success over Chiefs. "We have performed very well against Kaizer Chiefs this season," Allie told SuperSport.com. "You don't need any motivation in big matches against Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, and Mamelodi Sundowns. You are already motivated. "The last game against Chiefs in the league which we won 2-1, we were pretty lucky and fortunately, we got a positive result by winning the match." The 2-1 victory ended Amakhosi's five-match unbeaten run at the iconic FNB Stadium in February 2020. Prior to the match, Maritzburg had eliminated Chiefs from the Telkom Knockout Cup after securing a 2-1 win in November 2019 at the Mbombela Stadium. Before showing good character to come from a goal down to hold the Glamour Boys to a 1-1 draw at the Harry Gwala Stadium in the following month. "In the Telkom Knockout Cup semifinal game, we outplayed Chiefs especially in the first half and we should have scored more goals," he continued. "Then there is the home league game in which we wasted our chances, but we came back from 1-0 down and we drew [1-1] although, we missed a penalty." "So, we have done well over the three games we have played against them. Like I said big games like Chiefs, Pirates, and Sundowns we don't need any motivation. "We have had a good season playing against Chiefs." Maritzburg are placed fifth on the league standings with the current season having been suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic since mid-March 2020.
