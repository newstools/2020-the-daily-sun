COOPERATIVE Governance and
Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has come under fire during
the lockdown for her anti-skyf stance. But one cabinet minister credits
NDZ’s past campaigns for helping him quit booze and cigarettes. IOL reports that Higher Education
Minister Blade Nzimande credits for driving campaigns that helped him to quit
cigarettes and alcohol. He was speaking earlier today
during his visit to the Umgungundlovu TVET College in Pietermaritzburg as part
of his nationwide drive to check on institutions of higher learning’s state of
readiness to comply with regulations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Blade said Dlamini Zuma started
similar campaigns, despite huge opposition, when she was still the Health
Minister. The Tobacco Products Control Bill,
which was passed in 1999 and made it illegal for anyone to smoke in public places,
was implemented during NDZ’s time as Health Minister. “It might have taken a bit longer
because of some people like us, but I stopped smoking in 2012 because of this
ongoing campaign that was ringing in our ears. “I am very proud of it because I am
feeling much better,” he said. He said it was very important that
the government intensified the campaign against smoking and should do the “same
with alcohol”. “I stopped drinking in 2018... it
can be done as I am an example,” Blade said, according to IOL. Booze is still on sale during the
current level 3 of the national lockdown but the sale of cigarettes remains
illegal. Tobacco companies have taken
government to court over the skyf ban. Nzimande said Covid-19 has exposed
society to the need to stop smoking. “Beyond Covid-19 we may maintain
the stringent measures but also we need education to accompany this. “We need a huge, huge campaign
against these two things (cigarettes and alcohol), but we won’t win this
campaign on our own, and we will need to forge a partnership in society,” said
Nzimande.
