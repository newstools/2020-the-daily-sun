Shortly after the show ended, the talented club DJ took to Twitter and shared that he'd be sending a food voucher to the family. "I just got off the phone with Anonymous from Uitenhage. She called our show saying she’s got no food and is depressed. She’s got two kids living with her. No income, no hope. I will be sending her a grocery voucher so that when shops open this morning, her life can feel a bit better," he said. Mo Flava shared more good news: "Psychologist Dr Tshepiso Matentjie has also agreed to connect with anonymous. She’s going through a lot emotionally and psychologically, so mental health wellness is key." SEE POSTS:
