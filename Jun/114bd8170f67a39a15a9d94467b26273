SIZWE “Jahman” Magagula says lockdown has been good to him. The 48-year-old from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he makes lots of money transporting magoshas to their clients. Sizwe first got to know the magoshas through using their services. “When I called they told me they couldn’t get to their clients,” he said. “One of them told me they were willing to pay someone to transport them as long as that person didn’t judge them. “I began transporting them. When a client calls them, they call me and I pick them up. “I charge them between R50 and R100, depending on the distance. I also fetch them when they’re done.” Sizwe said the girls had customers all over Ekurhuleni, and he once made R1 000 in a single day. “People think I’ve found work, but they don’t know what I do,” he said. “If lockdown continues, I may even be able to buy a new car.” Magosha Londy Skhakhane (35) said when Sizwe agreed to help, they started making good money again. “When we go to them we charge extra, and that helps us pay Sizwe. If something happens to us he’ll know where he left us, and with who,” she said. Teddy Nhlapo (30) used to charge between R70 and R100, but now that they were going to clients they charge up to R350. Client Menzi Mbatha from Tembisa (40) got divorced three years ago and didn’t want to be in a relationship again. “The sex workers help me. I felt starved when I couldn’t go to them,” he said.
