Athletics South Africa has written to the Minister of Sport, Nathi Mthethwa, informing him that the athletics body has opted to priotise lives during the current period of the coronavirus pandemic. This follows carefull consideration by the ASA Board who noted that the Covid-19 virus infection rate is rapidly rising in South Africa, making the risk to athletes and other role-players getting infected and facing the grave consequences of death, very real. On 30 May, Minister of Sport Nathi Mthethwa announced the staggered opening of professional non-contact sport and opening of facilities to professional athletes for training. This is in reference to the Risk Adjustment Strategy of Level 3 under National Disaster Act. As a result, ASA has resolved not to host any national activities or participate at international events until ASA deems it is safe to do so or until it is expertly advised by the Department of Sport and World Athletics, that it is medically safe to host events at national and international stage. And once expertly advised by the Department of Sport, ASA will then take the responsibility to assess and decide on the appropriate way forward. ASA has taken comparison to the protocol models of World Athletics, other bodies and other countries, and reached a decision that none of them addresses the current dire scenario faced by South Africa and athletics. “Even though athletics has been classified as a non-contact sport, it has unavoidable dynamics that may not be controlled during the action of competition and therefore making transmission a dangerous reality,” said Aleck Skhosana, the President of ASA.
