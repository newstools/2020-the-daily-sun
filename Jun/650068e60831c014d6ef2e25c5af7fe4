SWALLOWS FC legend Lefa Tsutsulupa says the current crop of players have what it takes to help the team gain promotion to the PSL. The Birds have surpassed all expectations in the GladAfrica Championship since the appointment of coach Brandon Truter, who replaced Zeca Marques in September. Tsutsulupa said Truter is like a great remedy that Swallows needed to restore their pride. He guided them to occupy second spot on the championship table with 41 points from 24 matches, when the season was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Birds are seven points behind leaders Ajax Cape Town, and a point ahead of third placed Uthongathi FC. Said Tsutsulupa: “The players have done well for themselves and exceeded all expectations to challenge for promotion. “I watched a few of their matches and noticed that the coach has brought stability in the team.” The soft-spoken legend said that mental strength will be key for The Birds to fly back to the elite league. “They need to be mentally strong, especially at this crucial stage of the season. If they work hard, remain level headed and keep their feet firmly on the ground I have no doubt they will achieve their goal.” The 40-year-old, who decided to hang up his boots in 2015 when Swallows got relegated from the PSL, doesn’t have the desire to play in the paid ranks again. He made 197 appearances for Swallows and scored eight goals since joining them in 2005 from Jomo Cosmos. The Nedbank Cup is the only trophy he lifted with The Birds in 2009.
