ON this day ten years ago South Africa was abuzz with World Cup fever firmly gripping the country. Key to the success of the tournament were the supporters who packed the various stadia around the country, showing off Mzansi’s colorful side. Famous Supporter Freddie ‘Saddam” Maake, who claims to have created the instrument, recalls the beautiful sounds it produced during the six-week tournament. “I remember I had a chance to speak to Sepp Blatter (then Fifa President) during the Confederation Cup in 2009 and told him they can’t ban the Vuvuzela because it’s our tradition. I am the pioneer I had to stand up for it,” said Saddam. “In the end we hosted the most beautiful World Cup on African soil. I attended 34 out of the 64 games and it was a time I will forever cherish. The sound of the vuvuzela in a packed FNB Stadium is my best memory.” Another super fan, Mama Joy Chauke, said the World Cup made her as she gained fame like never before after the tournament. “I didn’t understand even the language some of the other fans in the stadium were speaking but I could hear them saying ‘Africa De Sud’ when they saw in my nice outfit representing my country,” she said. “It was an amazing experience, even when we were eliminated I didn’t feel it because we still had the spirit of the World Cup, enjoying ourselves.” Masilo Machaka, another one of the most famous supporters, said the tournament brought everyone together. “That was an experience like no other,” said Machaka. “We were all united as a country like never before. People forgot all about their problems and service delivery.” For Dejan Milandinovic, a famous Orlando Pirates supporter originally from Serbia, the World Cup in Mzansi was unforgettable. “I watched both my favourite nations, South Africa and Serbia.”
