EVERYONE who has driven a powerful rear-wheel-drive car has probably had the urge to make it go sideways. Sadly, for this Mustang GT driver, the urge got over him. The owner of this brand new 2019 Ford Mustang GT that he had just bought three days before the incident received a rude awakening in Canada. This after allegedly trying to drift the Mustang GT on a wet road. According to Carscoops, the incident happened in Cranbrook, British Columbia in Canada at a parking lot of a mall where young men usually gather. As the young man tried to drift the 343 kW 5.0-liter V8 on the wet surface he crashed the Mustang GT.
