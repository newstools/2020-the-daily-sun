BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga says 95% of the country’s schools are ready to reopen today. The minister has the backing of teacher unions, who said they’re happy with the phased approach, which starts with grade 7 and matrics returning today. Motshekga said although a handful of schools were not ready, her department was committed to leaving no pupil behind. “Where practically possible, pupils from not ready schools will be moved to neighbour schools that meet requirements,” she said. “The teaching and learning programmes provided online will continue, and parents who are uneasy with sending their children back to school must follow the law to ensure their right to basic education is unhindered.” Motshekga thanked law enforcement agencies for helping to deliver essentials to schools across the country. “Some of the problems that delayed us were issues of vandalism. Now we can say with confidence that 95% of schools have been supplied,” she said. Motshekga said 1 672 schools had been vandalised. Unions said they were happy with the delivery of personal protective equipment, completed water supply projects and the improvement of toilet facilities. “This improvement came as a result of the constant emphasis by the unions and SGBs that water and sanitation were not negotiable,” their statement said. The unions had made several demands and would continue monitoring the delivery of water. They also wanted district task teams to monitor schools, an employee and pupil wellness plan and for TV and radio lessons to be continued with the SABC changing schedules to suit pupils.
