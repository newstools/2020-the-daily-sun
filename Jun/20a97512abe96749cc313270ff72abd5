KAIZER Chiefs and Malawian legend Patrick Mabedi has backed his compatriot and Orlando Pirates striker Gabadinho Mhango to succeed if he gets a chance to play in Europe next season. The 27-year-old joined the Soweto giants this season from Bidvest Wits and became an instant hit, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if some overseas clubs come knocking for his signature. Mhango was in a fine form before the Absa Premiership was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. He is the leading league goalscorer with 14 goals, with the Soweto giants left with seven matches to end the season. Mhango is competing for the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot Award with the likes of Bradley Grobler (SuperSport United), Peter Shalulile (Highlands Park) and Bongi Ntuli (AmaZulu). The trio are two goals behind Mhango. And now, former Amakhosi captain Mabedi believes it’s time for his homeboy to try his luck overseas, among the world’s best. “I am proud of Mhango. He is making our country proud as well,” said Mabedi, who spent nine years at Amakhosi. “I am not surprised by his form this season as I know what he is capable of doing. He is on top of his game and he is enjoy his football career. I wish he can get an offer from Europe.” Added the former Black Leopards assistant coach: “I am praying that this pandemic break won’t affect his sharpness.” Even Mhango’s best friend and Baroka striker Gerald Phiri Jnr shares the same sentiment with Mabedi for their compatriot to try luck overseas. “The sky is definitely the limit for Mhango,” said Phiri Jnr. “I wish a Europe move can come calling for him at the end of the season. It’s everyone’s dream to play in Europe and he should grab that chance if it comes and I am positive it will.” Mhango came to Mzanzi at the age of 20 to join Bloemfontein Celtic in 2013. The Chiweta-born star has also played for Golden Arrows before he joined the Clever Boys.
