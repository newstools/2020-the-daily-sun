THABANG Moroe remains suspended as CEO of Cricket SA (CSA). Moroe pitched up for work on Thursday, understanding his six-month suspension period to be over. But the CSA board have maintained Moroe is still on suspension pending a disciplinary hearing into allegation of misconduct against him. This is despite the board failing to institute a disciplinary process for him to answer to any charges. The board held an emergency meeting on Thursday and later released a statement. "The Board wishes to clarify that the Chief Executive Officer was suspended in December 2019 pending the outcome of an independent forensic investigation into management practices at Cricket SA," read the statement from the Board. "The letter of suspension issued to the CEO explicitly stated that he was suspended until the conclusion of the independent forensic investigation. "This investigation is not yet complete and therefore the CEO remains suspended and any assertion that his suspension was for a predetermined period is without basis. "The forensic investigators have indicated that their report is imminent." Moroe's lawyer Michael Bill has quoted as saying Moroe will again report for duty on Friday as he had a duty obligation to do so upon the expiration of the term of his suspension."Jacques Faul remains the acting CEO.
