BAFANA Bafana right-back Thami Mkhize says he shares the frustration national coach Molefi Ntseki is suffering after the African Cup of Nations qualifiers scheduled for September were postponed. The Confederation of African Football (Caf) in response to world body Fifa’s guideline have postponed the qualifiers following the disruption of leagues worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most league are still being completed while the new season in some countries will only kick-off in September which could mean some players will not have played for their clubs making it impossible for national coaches to assemble their squads. The Absa Premiership is still waiting for the green light to resume after the PSL suspended all football in March. “I feel for the coaches and the players because going back to play after over three months (while we have) been training individually it will take a sizeable time to get back into the rhythm of the game,” said Mkhize, who played all nine competitive matches for Bafana last year. “As for the national team coach Molefi, I’m sure he wishes to have assembled a team this year and (see us) playing.” Mkhize, who made his Bafana debut against Burkina Faso in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in October 2017 at FNB Stadium, has further cast doubts on the Afcon finals taking place in Cameroon. Due to Covid-19 Caf rescheduled the event for January and February. If Caf plans to go ahead with the Afcon in January that means Bafana would have to play all four remaining qualifiers before October. But Fifa have scheduled the 2022 World Cup qualifiers that month. Mkhize says there’s no way the Afcon will take in January and February. “I don’t think it is possible for the Afcon to be played,” said Mkhize.
