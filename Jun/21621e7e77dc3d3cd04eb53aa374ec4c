Rapper Travis Scott is accused of stealing the melody of his hit single, Highest In The Room. A producer name Benjamin Lasnier claims Travis' producer, stole the melody from him. According to TMZ, Lasnier said he is the one that wrote and recorded the guitar melody in Travis' song. "Lasnier claims he got in touch with a guy who works with Travis named Jamie Lepr, who goes by Jimmy Cash on IG, and apparently solicits beats. Lasnier says he sent Lepr a beat pack, which included the guitar melody in question and with no formal deal struck between them. Lasnier claims he eventually heard a slightly tweaked version of his melody on Trav's new song in late 2019. He says a strikingly similar arpeggio appears around 24 times, which he says makes it the meat of the song," read the article.
