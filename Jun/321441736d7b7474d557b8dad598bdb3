Social media users are gatvol, this after an ambulance was vandalised while attending to a case in Soweto. It is alleged that an EMS team was dispatched to Zola 2 around 4am this morning. The Ambulance was vandalized, and broken into while the team was attending to the call. A case has been opened at Jabulani Police Station. No one was harmed, the GPS was stolen, wrote Gauteng EMS on their page. Social media users call for SAPS AND JMPD members to continue escorting the EMS or ambulances must stop giving their services to Soweto people until they learn a lesson. "I remember one EMS driver telling me that they had gone to Zola after getting a call that someone was ill, when they arrived there, they found a gentleman, smoking weed waiting at the gate, on inquiry, he was the patient waiting for the ambulance, yeah muntu," said Lindi Hamilton. Lerato Molefe said:"The same people who will be complaining if they ambulances refuses to come to their area. In my view they  should never attend any cases from Zola. If someone is sick. They must hire a car to take them to hospital. Not that they don't know the people responsible. They live with them. As if we not facing too much as a country right now. Wow Zola people. " "Solution is to stop ambulance services. If community is not ready to fix itself...those will b consequences. We know these thugs, they live among st us but we don't oust them. Unfortunately innocent poor people are gonna suffer," said Rose Kay.
