Chelsea are closing in on a deal to sign striker Timo Werner from RB Leipzig, British media reported on Thursday. The 24-year-old had been thought to to be attracting interest from Premier League champions-elect Liverpool but it appears Chelsea have in fact met the German's reported release clause of some £53 million. Were Chelsea to bring Werner to Stamford Bridge it would be a major feather in the cap of the west London club. For the past year there has been speculation linking Werner with a move to Anfield but time appears to be running out for the Reds, with the forward's release clause expiring on 15 June – two days before the Premier League is set to restart after a coronavirus-enforced break of several months. The Germany international has scored 31 goals for Leipzig in all competitions. Chelsea have already agreed a deal to sign Ajax winger Hakim Ziyech.
