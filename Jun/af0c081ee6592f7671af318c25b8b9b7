LUCKY Tshabalala says having grown up in a violent environment has had a negative impact on his life. The 26-year-old from Emdeni in Soweto told Daily Sun he and his three siblings were raised in Evaton in the Vaal by his mum. Lucky said he was emotionally abused by his siblings, as they didn’t have the same father. He said his family needs a mediator to help resolve the pain and hurt members caused each other. “For as long as I can remember, my family has always been fighting. When my mum tried to intervene, she was called names,” he said. Lucky, who works in the food industry, grew up under difficult circumstances. “We grew up in a three-roomed shack and our mother earned very little as a helper. We used to sell scrap metal to put food on the table,” he said. “Whenever there was a misunderstanding it turned into I fight. I’m constantly reminded I have a different father.” Lucky was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2011. “Whenever they started fighting I’d suffer a seizure. I moved out of the house because the environment was not good. “All I need is peace and for my family to get along and love each other.” His mum Shirley said the family had conflicts in the past but they’d been resolved. “Elders were called for intervention and all our differences were put aside,” she said. Lucky’s sister Rose said he was lying. “Yes, we do argue like any other family, but it’s nothing out of the ordinary. We don’t need a mediator,” she said. “Lucky is a very sensitive child who easily holds a grudge and is very judgmental. We’ve accepted his faults as he’s our brother.”
