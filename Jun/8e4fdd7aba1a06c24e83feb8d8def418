The impact of the Black Lives Matter movement is rippling around the globe encouraging
important conversations about racism that was previously swept under the rug.  Local streaming service Showmax recently
also started to review content on its platform that could be considered to be
racially insensitive. These include a large chunk of films by South African
filmmaker Leon Schuster. Netwerk24 was
first to report that six films of the 69-year-old comedian was removed from
Showmax and is currently being reviewed. Those include You Must Be Joking, You Must Be Joking Too, Oh Schucks…It’s Schuster, Sweet ‘n Short, Schuks! Pay Back the Money,
and Frank and Fearless. According to Netwerk24 other films by Schuster
including Mama Jack, in which Schuster
used blackface, and Mr Bones and its
sequel, in which he plays a white sangoma, have also been removed from Showmax. The films raked in millions at the
South African box office at the time of their individual releases - even
surpassing Hollywood hits like Titanic and Harry Potter. The local box
office success has cemented Schuster’s status as one of the most successful
filmmakers in SA’s history.       He told Wagner: "I'm so sorry that I can't make Mama
Jack 2 . If I had a dream come true, my next movie would be Mama Jack 2. But especially
on Twitter they said stay away from the blackface, it's not on. It was black
people talking to me and you've got to listen. I can't do it because I'll be
heavily criticised. "In the olden days it troubled nobody. But I won't go blackface now, I
can't do it. There's not one actor in the world that will. It's just
racist."  Speaking to Channel24, Leon was
unable to immediately give further comment on the matter.
