TWO zama zamas were killed when a huge rock reportedly fell
on them. The illegal miners were reportedly manually mining chrome at
Atok, Bogalatladi. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the
police were called and on arrival, the bodies were seen trapped under a huge
rock. The Police Search and Rescue Unit and Medical Emergency
Services were then called to the scene and assisted in retrieving the bodies. This after they managed to crush the rock. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the South African
Police Service in Limpopo Major General Jan Scheepers warned all community
members to stop engaging in illegal mining as this is against the law and also
dangerous.
