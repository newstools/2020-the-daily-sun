WHEN it comes to the crowded crossover-come-SUV segment, the idea’s very simple. Basically, the brand that keeps improving the design and performance of its cars gains more market share. And Suzuki finally got the idea. The brand’s latest Vitara has finally upped the game through looks and performance. Although there’s room for improvement in the shape of the new Vitara, the designers have added extra details. The Vitara’s headlights, fog, daytime running lights, front grill upper garnish, bumper accent line, and side fender garnish have a refined looks that earn this Suzuki a lot of admirers. Inside, it looks and feels tactile despite there being enough plastic to make toy-makers jealous. Also, the leather and quality fabrics pick up the slack of the not-so-flattering materials.  The infotainment system pumps out awesome sound, but could do with more USB ports – as CDs are turning into musical relics like their vinyl and cassette cousins. More USBs are also a must. Charging is a thing, after all. The Vitara comes standard with a front-wheel drive configuration and the option of four-wheel drive. Despite being launched four years ago with petrol and diesel engines, the new two-year-old power-plants (109bhp 1L three-cylinder and 138bhp 1.4L four-cylinder) make this SUV a joy to drive. Along with effortless driving, the Vitara delivers an impressive fuel consumption of 5.8L/100km.
