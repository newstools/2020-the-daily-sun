TOMORROW marks the 44th anniversary of the Soweto Uprising. But this year, the celebrations will be strictly online due to the coronavirus lockdown. Soweto-based youth movement #WeUprising, The Box Shop Lifestyle on Vilakazi Street and Soweto Surf, will be hosting their annual commemoration event online. WATCH: JUNE 16 SOWETO UPRISING - HOW IT ALL HAPPENED Mbali Zulu, project director and founder of #WeUprising, said: “We have a duty and responsibility to engage and inspire young people during good times and challenging times. “Due to the pandemic, we’ve had to rethink our entire event programme on the day and we explored digital channels and creative ways to continue commemorating the heroes of 1976 in a safe way.” Sifiso Moyo, the co-founder of The Box Shop, said technology enabled conversations. “Following our successful partnership with the organisers of the #WeUprising movement last year, we identified the need to create a new tourism programme that incorporates local businesses and organisations and aims to promote township businesses,” he said. JUNE 16: THE DAY THAT MADE HISTORY Sifiso said lockdown had forced them to develop new tools such as the June 16Xperience app, which is expected to be ready next year. “We want to encourage everyone to celebrate this special day with us from the safety and comfort of their homes this year. Let’s use this time to reflect and seek practical solutions to our socio-economic issues.” For those who want to commemorate the day at home, classic film Sarafina will be airing on eMovies (DStv channel 138, OpenView channel 106) today and tomorrow at 1.30pm.
