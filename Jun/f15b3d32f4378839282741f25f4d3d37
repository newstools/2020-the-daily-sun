SuperSport United have announced a contract extension for goalkeeper Boalefa Pule that will keep him at the club until June 2023. Pule, 30, has played second fiddle to No 1 Ronwen Williams, but did famously come off the bench for his Premier Soccer League debut in the 2016 Nedbank Cup final where he helped Matsatsantsa to a 3-2 victory over Orlando Pirates. “SuperSport United is pleased to announce that Boalefa Pule has signed a three-year extension which will see him at the club until 2023,” the club said in a statement on Friday. That remains his only ever appearance for SuperSport, but he did have a loan spell at AmaZulu in the 2017/18 campaign when he made 14 appearances in all competitions. Despite his lack of game-time in the local league, he has four caps for Bafana Bafana, picked up in the COSAFA Cup and African Nations Championship qualifiers.
