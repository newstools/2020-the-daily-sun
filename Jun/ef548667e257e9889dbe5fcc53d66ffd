BATTLE lines have been drawn between Sanco in Collins Chabane, Limpopo and acting municipal manager Risenga Shilenge. Sanco sub-region chairman Thomas Manyisa said Shilenge has been acting for over 19 months and during his term, there have been a lot of poor administrative decisions, including the disappearance of R900 000. Manyisa said Sanco was very worried with how things were being done at the municipality. “The municipality issued a Facebook post that it has been upgraded, only to remove it in a day because it was incorrect.” He told Daily Sun Shilenge was victimising everyone, including ward councillors. “He opened a case against the ward councillor, simply for the issuing of proof of residence to the community members.” Shilenge told the SunTeam he was appointed by the council and any complaints related to his appointment should be directed to it. “When the money was transferred, I was not manager. It was only when I took over that I tried to recover the money. The municipality has approached the court trying to recover the R600 000, as the contractor already paid R300 000.” He said some allegations had nothing to do with him, but the council. “I’m surprised why Sanco decided to target me. I didn’t appoint myself. The three months in acting capacity only apply to a vacant position. The position I’m occupying is not vacant. The manager is still challenging the decision of suspending her in court.” He said Sanco should approach the relevant investigative authorities if they suspected any wrongdoing. “Our books are open. We have not sold any tenders,” said Shilenge.
