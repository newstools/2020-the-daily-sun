Women looking for romance on dating apps perceive are
less likely to swipe right if their potential suitor is holding a cat,
according to new research. The study, carried out by scientists at the College of
Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, at Colorado State University,
found that profile photos of men holding cats were seen as 'less dateable' and
'less masculine' by many women. Daily Mail reports that men who held a confident pose and
appeared alone in their profile pic were more likely to attract women, the
survey found. Straight women, aged between 18 and 24, living in the US,
were asked to rate the same man posing with and without a cat on his lap. Photos of two men, both in their early twenties, were
shown to the group. Both prospective dates had dark hair, wore a blue buttoned
down shirt and were photographed against a white background while posing with
and without the same tabby cat. After the pictures were displayed, they rated the men on
attributes including perceived personality, masculinity, dateability and
whether they would consider going out with the person for a short or long-term
relationship. The study found that women perceived the man holding the
cat as 'less masculine' and ultimately 'less datable' in both the short and
long term. The women also scored the cat-lover higher on neuroticism
- which forms part of the Big Five personality traits.
