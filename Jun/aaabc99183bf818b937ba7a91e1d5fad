EASTERN Cape Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe and her department won’t hold back in cancelling the operating licences of the taximan accused of killing his ex-girlfriend in Chicken Farm, outside East London. This comes as the rate of gender-based violence cases and femicide led to President Cyril Ramaphosa describing the scourge as an epidemic Suspect Welcome Yose (61) made his first court appearance on Wednesday on charges of kidnapping and murdering Lindelwa Peni (43). He is expected back in court again on Saturday for bail application. Department spokesman Unathi Binqose said: “On Monday, a K9 search and rescue member received a request for assistance in the recovery of a murder victim in Scenery Park. A female went missing on 10 June and detectives interviewed a suspect, who confessed he killed the victim and dumped the body in the Chicken Farm area. “Investigators could not reach the body as it was thrown down an embankment between dense bushes. The K9 member cleared the bushes and made use of rope access to recover the body.” The body was handed over to forensic pathology members. Tikana-Gxothiwe called on the justice system to leave no room for perpetrators of horrendous crimes to walk free. “We stand behind Ramaphosa’s call that perpetrators of violence must receive sentences that fit their horrific crimes, and we would not even want them to be released on bail, especially when there’s compelling evidence, as in the Chicken Farm murder case.” The MEC said her department would take its cue from the court proceedings on its next move.
