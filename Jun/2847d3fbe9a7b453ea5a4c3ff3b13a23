THE Queen actor SK Khoza only got a slap on the wrist after allegedly laying down the law on a traffic officer. According to informants, KZN man in blue, an officer Zondo, got moered for attempting to write a traffic violation ticket for the star, who plays Shaka in the Mzansi Magic telenovela. This after being flagged in Ulundi, north of KZN, for alleged reckless driving. When called for comment, officer Zondo declined to comment on the incident “because it happened while I was on duty”. He referred inquiries to the police. Commented an informant: “The cop tried to give him a ticket for breaking the law and instead got beaten up.” A case of common assault was then opened at Ulundi Police Station in September and SK was kept in police holding cells. But he got off the hook when the case was withdrawn in court. According to KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele, SK got into an argument with the officer before allegedly assaulting the man in blue on 21 September. Said Mbele: “The complainant alleged that on 21 September 2019 at 3pm, he was performing his duties as a traffic officer when he was assaulted by a known suspect. A case of common assault was opened at Ulundi Police Station for investigation.” According to the colonel, SK was arrested and appeared in the Mahlabathini Magistrate’s Court. SK could not be reached for comment. Khoza is not the first actor of The Queen to be in trouble with the law for allegedly violating traffic rules. Khanya Mkhangisa also got herself in a similar situation after a video showing her swearing at traffic cops was leaked last year in May.
