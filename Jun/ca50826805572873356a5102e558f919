TV production man Samuel Ntsanwisi is working hard to break into the industry! He’s targeting film festivals for his Tsonga creations, Kulani and Imani. “During lockdown we made a YouTube movie, Hi luya,” said Samuel. He previously founded Nkowankowa-based organisation, Samsrec Media Productions. Nkowankowa is a kasi outside Tzaneen, Limpopo. ALSO READ: MENZI NGUBANE ABANDONS THE QUEEN! Samuel is not new to a life of hustling. Samsrec organised Miss Nkowankowa for more than eight years, with winners going on to win big titles and modelling for big institutions. “Our first Miss Nkowankowa, Lelo Mkansi, won Miss Limpopo in 2016 and Vutomi Tshabalala was first princess,” said Samuel. His wife Isabel has been supporting him since he founded the organisation. Since then, his events management and media company has branched out into textiles and makes masks, overalls and protective equipment. Samuel said this was a natural move because they both studied art. But they mainly want to produce Tsonga films and TV programmes. “We also wanted to bring quality videos to our province,” said Samuel. He’s manager at Bjatladi Youth Development and manages an NPO, Vanthswa va Xivono, during weekends. Vantshwa va Xivono has been helping poor youth in Limpopo improve their lives since 2009. It’s free and young people are assisted through fundraising initiatives. The textile wing, Xonga Designs, helps people look and feel good in these tough times. “The textiles part was by chance,” he said. “I saw a gap in the market and pursued it.”
