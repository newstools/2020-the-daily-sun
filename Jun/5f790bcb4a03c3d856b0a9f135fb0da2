WHEN an unsuspecting woman (25) from Welkom met a man (32) for the first time on Saturday, she was taken to the bush and raped. He used Facebook to lure her. But the man later called her on the same day to apologise. The cops managed to set a trap for him in Kutlwanong near Odendaalsrus, Free State. It’s alleged the man was wearing a face mask when he met the woman. He had a knife and used it to threaten the woman to go to the nearby bushes at the back of Khotsong Primary School. It’s alleged the suspect threatened her with a knife to her neck while raping her, and later gave her R20 to board a taxi back home. Daily Sun could not reach the woman as her phone was on voicemail. It’s alleged that while she was at the cop shop, the man called the woman asking for them to meet so he could apologise. The cops told her to agree to meet him while they planned on how to capture him. It’s alleged that a personal cop’s car was used and the suspect was spotted and chased on foot. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo confirmed the incident. Mbambo told Daily Sun: “The suspect was tracked strategically on foot from the K9 vicinity of Lengoeleng up until Block 1 where the apprehension was finally done. “The suspect was in possession of a cellphone that he used to chat to the victim, a black beanie head dress and black gloves. “The scene of the crime was visited where other exhibits were obtained to be taken for forensic examination. He was charged with rape and will appear in the Odendaalsrus Magistrates Court.” Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane urged women to be careful when using social media as sex predators use this medium to pounce on the unsuspecting victims. She also praised members for their swift reaction to ensure that the suspect was removed from the community.
