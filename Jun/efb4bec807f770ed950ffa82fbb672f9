AFTER allegedly killing his gogo and three-year-old cousin in October, Small Mngomezulu disappeared. But on Sunday, the 22-year-old was found living under a bridge in Joburg after hobos tipped off the cops. The police said the hobos became suspicious as the accused would struggle to sleep. They said he was haunted by his gogo. When cops showed them photos of the man on Saturday, they immediately recognised him and showed them where he slept. But he wasn’t there and the police returned the next day to make an arrest. Gogo Margaret Mngomezulu (67) and her three year-old granddaughter Busisiwe Jula were allegedly murdered by the suspect after he entered their home through the roof. Both the gogo and the little girl were suffocated with a pillow. When the suspect was caught over the weekend, he allegedly confessed to the murders, but wouldn’t say why he did it. The gogo’s daughter, Ntombi Mngomezulu-Sibanyoni (50), said: “We finally found closure and feel safe now because we feared he’d come back to kill us as well. We just want the law to take its course. We’re happy but also sad.” The gogo’s other daughter, Baby (48), said she couldn’t erase the memory of discovering the bodies from her mind. “I went to church and when I came back, I found the house locked. I knocked but there was no answer.” She contacted relatives, who broke a window and found the bodies in the house. The suspect appeared in the Springs Magistrates Court on Monday and will be back soon in court.
