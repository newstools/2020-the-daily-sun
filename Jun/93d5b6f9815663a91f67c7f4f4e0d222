THE disappearance of the KZN education department’s personal protective equipment has added to their woes as schools prepare to reopen on Monday. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu was very disturbed by the report of the disappearance in three areas in the province. The department said Umlazi, Pinetown and Zululand were affected. Spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said it was not yet clear who was behind it, but the equipment disappeared on the way to circuit offices and schools. “The MEC has asked the head of department to launch an investigation to find out who is behind the disappearance.” Mahlambi said before the disappearance of the protective equipment, the department was 90% ready for reopening of schools as they were prioritising those that were not ready. He said this would set them back. But the unions were not having any of it, saying this was just an act as the department saw the deadline was nearer and they would not be ready. National Teachers Union president Allen Thompson said claims that the equipment disappeared were false. “The department was never ready in the first place, and they were quick to jump to the new reopening date. The big question if the department was ready to reopen on 1 June, why was the equipment still at district offices? We still stand firm that workers should report to work if it is not delivered.” SA Democratic Teachers Union deputy provincial secretary Bheki Shandu said the department should just drop the act. “We are not shocked to hear that claim because we understand the department is far from ready. Most schools in rural areas are still without water. In Zululand, 540 schools still have no water and it could take two weeks to deliver water tankers and get the schools ready.”
