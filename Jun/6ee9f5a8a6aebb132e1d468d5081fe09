The resumption of the sale of alcohol has seen Gauteng recording 18 deaths since June 1. There's also been an increase in the amount of serious and violent crimes that have been reported. On Monday alone, as the country entered Level 3 of the lockdown, Gauteng police opened 124 common assault cases, 76 assault to cause grievous bodily harm cases, 17 cases of sexual offences, 16 of rape and one attempted sexual assault case. These statistics were presented by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko at the weekly Gauteng Provincial Command Council update on Friday. Mazibuko said pedestrians and motorists were included among the fatalities. She added that about 124 people were admitted to various hospitals after sustaining injuries in brawls related to alcohol consumption. Mazibuko said during Levels 4 and 5, they were dealing with home brewed alcohol sales and consumption, but during Level 3 they have to deal with legal alcohol. Mazibuko asked that people avoid going to graveyards in numbers exceeding the required 50 and to allow the grieving families to mourn in peace."People must stop having after-tears sessions, we are in a lockdown. We don't expect any alcohol from Friday until Sunday including those with 0% alcohol. Police are not going to negotiate with you, they are going to take you for carrying alcohol between Friday and Sunday," said Mazibuko.
