NONKQUBELA Buso (46) is thankful to God for saving her family after a car crashed into their home. She said it landed in their sitting room at their house at Leiden in Delft, Cape Town. “I was inside when I suddenly heard a big bang. I saw the cupboard moving and other things. I screamed because I knew we were in trouble,” said Nonkqubela. She rushed outside with her children. “I’m a praying woman and if it wasn’t for God, we would be dead by now. He protected us from this car and for that, we will always be grateful to Him,” she said. Nonkqubela said she didn’t open a case because she was a God-fearing woman. “When the owner agreed to fix my house, I didn’t see a reason to open a case against him. I also wouldn’t want to go and meet more people who want help from the police station because I’m afraid of being infected with corona,” she said. She said the cost of the damages is more than R7 000. Mzwandile Mlungwana (45) claimed the driver was drunk. “The upliftment of the ban on liquor sales is causing problems. People are always drunk. If they are not crashing into other people’s houses, they are stabbing each other,” he said. Mzwandile told Daily Sun that since Nonkqubela decided not to open a case, the residents helped her by making sure the driver didn’t get his car back until he bought the material to fix the house. “We’re glad the driver bought the material to fix the house,” said Mzwandile.
