ARRIVING to find a note at the door stating that the South African Social Services Agency (SASSA) office is closed frustrated residents this morning. The office situated in KwaMashu north of Durban at the Bridgecity Shopping Centre closed down after a Covid-19 case emerged. One of the workers tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday and the offices were closed immediately. 31 other staff members have been taken for testing and will be in isolation while they wait for the results. A note at the door was written that the residents who need urgent help should go to the offices in Phoenix, Inanda, and Durban CBD as this office is closed. But the note didn't state when the office will open. The residents who had woken up at the crack of dawn to get help from the offices with their applications were frustrated when they found the office closed. A resident Nhlakanipho Mkhize (32) who had come to get help with his R350 grant application said he received a message on 22 June informing him that his details were not corresponding and therefore he needs to sort the matter out. "The message stated that I should come to the office today. Now that I'm here I find the office closed. I really need the R350 but as this office is closed it means I won't get it," he said. He said he can't go to the offices in Phoenix and Inanda because he doesn't have transport money. Another frustrated resident Sithobile Dube (23) said she wanted to make an application for a child support grant but she couldn't as the office is closed. SASSA spokeswoman Sandy Godlwana confirmed that the SASSA, KwaMashu local office has been temporarily closed until further notice after an official tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. "The Department of Health has been requested to conduct tests on all affected officials (31). Whilst awaiting results, these officials will be on self-isolation," she said. She said the SASSA management has arranged for the decontamination of the office concerned.
