AMAZULU defender Tapelo Xoki has heaped praise on experienced goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs. Xoki believes Josephs’ impact at the club has been immense, with the former Orlando Pirates goalie’s experience coming in handy for the club. Josephs, who began the season as Usuthu’s third choice goalkeeper, found himself having to fill in as an assistant coach to Ayanda Dlamini after he replaced out of sorts Jozef Vukusic. Xoki insists that Jospehs has proven his worth to the club in this role, making the transition to coach seamless. And during the Covid-19 enforced break, the 40-year-old has ensured that players are in good spirits and keeping fit. “When we were told that he will be working with coach Ayanda, we were very happy with the management’s decision,” the 25-year-old player told his club’s official website. “It was quite easy for Moeneeb to make the transition from player to coach because he is a good leader and motivator. “He has also played an important role during the current situation [lockdown] by making sure that everyone is motivated, and the morale is good in the team.” Xoki believes Jospehs also adds value as player, despite having been reduced to a squad player this season. His leadership skills have been helpful in the team. “Moeneeb is a very positive guy, who always motivates his teammates. It is good to have such a player in the team,” Xoki added. “Whenever he notices that one of his teammates is not having a good day either during matches or training sessions, he always looks to lift our spirits.”
