The announcement was made by the municipality's spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki on Wednesday. Buyeye has sent his deepest condolences to the family of the deceased official, said Mniki. "This was devastating news for the mayoral office and myself personally. We wish his family strength and forbearance in this difficult time of loss and mourning. In his name and those of many others in Nelson Mandela Bay who have lost their lives to this disease, we will intensify our efforts to fight against this pandemic. "I have decided to submit myself for a 14-day quarantine period. This is not just a protocol issue: it is done to protect everyone who works for and interacts with the mayoral office," said Buyeye. Duties Mniki said Buyeye would continue to perform his duties from home, using a variety of communication platforms and interaction strategies. "The municipality is working around the clock to make sure that the workplace is safe for its employees, councillors, ratepayers, residents and any other stakeholders who may be coming to our offices for service. municipal employees have been provided with relevant personal protective clothing and municipal workplaces are consistently sanitised," said Mniki. In municipal workplaces where a positive Covid-19 case or cases have been identified, strict guidelines from the Municipal Public Health Department and the provincial Department of Health are followed without fail, he said.  https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/nelson-mandela-bay-acting-mayor-thsonono-buyeye-in-quarantine-after-bodyguard-dies-of-covid-19-20200617
