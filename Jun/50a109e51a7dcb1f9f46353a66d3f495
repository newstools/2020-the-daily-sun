NEDBANK Ke Yona Team search graduate, Thabiso Lebitso, says he was heartbroken when he received news that the banking giant has terminated their sponsorship of the talent search initiative. Lebitso was captain of the 2019 team and happened to be the only player who got a PSL contract after being drafted to Chippa United. His move to Chippa, where he earned a professional contract, was an indication that he did exceptionally well during the one-month trial period. The Team Search campaign, which started in 2013, used to give about 18 players opportunities to be drafted into the 16 clubs, and their performance would earn them professional contracts. Lebitso was signed by then coach Norman Mapeza. He made his professional debut in February in the Nedbank Cup Last-32 stage, when his side brushed aside reigning champions TS Galaxy 3-0 to advance to the next round. “It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “This means a lot of up-and-coming players will not get the opportunity that some of us got in the Ke Yona Team Search. “The fact that I was the captain for the last group would go a long way in my career. “We did not even have an idea that we were the last group, we only wanted to showcase our talent.” Among notable players produced by the talent search competition include Ian Chikohwa, who used to play for the University of Pretoria, Bongani Sam (Orlando Pirates) and Aubrey Modiba (SuperSport United). Not only players, but coaches as well benefitted from the campaign. Highlands Park assistant coach Victor Tshabalala cut his tooth in the Team Search working, with the likes of Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba.
