THE ongoing rubbish collection strike in Umlazi, south of Durban, has begun affecting businesses as rubbish continues to pile up outside kasi malls. Restaurants and vendors at Mega City Mall are complaining about the rubbish which hasn’t been collected since last week when the strike began. A restaurant manager told Daily Sun today that the strike had begun affecting their business, as the stink had become unbearable. She said the rubbish was between the restaurants and taxi rank, so they had to close shop. Another restaurant manager said flies have started getting into the restaurants and customers are complaining. “Although we have been doing takeaways because of lockdown rules, but we had started preparing to allow customers to eat in after the president’s announcement last week. We are concerned about this and we pray that by the time we are allowed to serve customers inside, the strike would have been resolved,” said the manager. Zandile Mkhungo (35), who sells fruit and vegetables outside the mall, said she was battling to keep flies away from his stall. She said she had started losing profit because of the smell and flies. Municipality’s head councillor for infrastructure, Thanduxolo Sabelo, said the talks with workers to end the strike were yielding fruit. He said he was hoping for an agreement to be reached very soon. One of the workers’ representatives said there was an offer put forward by the municipality and they’d be meeting today with workers to see whether they would accept it or not. The workers went on strike last week as they were demanding to be absorbed permanently since their three months contract ended yesterday. They said only 75 workers out of 300 were absorbed earlier this year. Workers accused the municipality of employing people from outside the kasi instead of them.
