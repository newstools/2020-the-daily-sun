EACH time the students need to use the toilet, they think twice and only go when they’re desperate. The students from Mthashana TVET College’s Nongoma campus in northern KZN don’t have running water. They’ve raised the issue with campus management, but nothing gets done. They’d like the Department of Higher Education and Training officials to visit the college. One student told Daily Sun they were forced to flush the toilets with buckets of water. “A big bucket inside the toilet has water. But that water gets finished early and we end up with a dirty toilet. We’re tired of dirty toilets.” The students said when they began studying on 10 June, they were told not everyone would get laptops, as stated by Minister Blade Nzimande. Another student said the college told them only those who passed would receive them. “We don’t understand why we have to get laptops based on whether we passed. Our college wants to do its own thing.” College spokesman Trevor Nkosi said the Nongoma campus was being renovated, and that was probably why there was no water. “But the entire area has a water problem. We had to bore holes to get water for the students. But I’ll check with the manager and find the real cause for the water shortage.” He said the laptop issue couldn’t be decided by the college. “I dismiss that the college said only those who passed will get the laptops,” he said.
