THE LOCKDOWN seems to have created a trend of people creating fake accounts of celebrities. Even thoughÂ Daily Sun reported on the fake accounts, including Lerato Kganyago's Twitter parody account, people don't want to put an end to it. Now someone has opened a Facebook account claiming to be the daughter of actress Thandeka Dawn King and insulting people. People who have seen it were questioning a lot about it but now it's clear it's a fake account.

"They're tarnishing my daughter's image. It's sick and disturbing. This is what I call black on black prejudice," she said. Some people advised her to open a case. "This is annoying. Whoever is busy with these fake accounts really has time on his or her hands. It's tiring and reporting it on Facebook isn't enough. I'd advise you to open a case against this person. Who knows what he'll get up to next," said Ryan Sithole. Monica Mckenzie said she saw the account on Facebook last week and was wondering why Thandeka's daughter would be so mean. "Now it makes sense. I've reported the account and shared this on Facebook. I hope it'll help," she said.
