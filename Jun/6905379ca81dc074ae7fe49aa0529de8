THE Grand Prix Series consists of six races taking place in six cities – Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Tshwane, and Joburg and the overall winner on points pockets R187 000. But not even a single race was held since the lockdown started in March. Last week, the Soweto Marathon, the biggest township ultra-marathon in Mzansi, also announced they would not be able to organise a race this year. The People’s Race was supposed to be held on 1 November at the FNB Stadium, and the men and women winners were set to walk away with a R250 000 prize each. Last month, the Comrades Marathon, meant to be held on 14 June, was also called off. Winners were to walk away with the prize money of R500 000 each. The Ultimate Human Race organisers were holding out and hoping to stage the event, but mass participation is not allowed under lockdown Level 3. The Two Oceans Marathon was the first prominent race to pull the plug in March, shortly after the national lockdown took shape. The popular Two Oceans event was due to take place in the Mother City on Easter Saturday. Big-name stars are gutted by these cancellations as they lost a massive chance to make money to feed their families. Kesa Molotsane, who won the Spar ladies 10km event in 2017, said she was devastated. Elroy Gelant, who came fourth at last year’s Cape Town Marathon, said: “We’ve been robbed of an opportunity to run and feed our families. I’m gutted.” Gelant become the only Mzansi athlete to finish in the top 10. “It’s like 2020 never happened. All the races that I wanted to run in were subsequently cancelled because of COVID-19. It’s a complete disaster for us runners. We should have made money,” said Gelant. Former Comrades Marathon winner Charne Bosman said: “I had already booked flights and accommodation for both the Comrades and Two Oceans. “I was confident of the top 10 finishes in both events. But I’ve lost money and must live with it.”
