She said the girl came back yesterday and started collecting her belongings from the house. When they asked her where she was going she told them she was leaving because they are nagging her to return school. She said she told the family she was pregnant.The stepmother said: "I was at bus stop going to town when I heard people screaming. I looked around and saw smoke coming from the house and rushed back home. I had left my two kids with the grandmother  and other 10 kids in the house. We found that she had locked them inside before setting the house on fire. We are still shocked although no one was injured as neighbours assisted me in rescuing the 13 people inside the burning house,"  She said. Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the woman was arrested and charged for attempted murder because the 72 year-old gogo was with kids inside the house. She said the suspect will appear at Nongoma Magistrates Court on Monday.
