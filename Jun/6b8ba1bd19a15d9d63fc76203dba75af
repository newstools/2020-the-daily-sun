Freedom party has donated blankets and clothing to a family whose house was
burned down by a pregnant granddaughter on Saturday. The
granddaughter used a paraffin to set alight the house. She
was arrested and appeared in the Nongoma Magistrates Court on Monday and the case
was postponed to 25 June for bail application. The
13 Mabaso family members from Macekane village in Nongoma northern KZN were
rescued by neighbours in the flames. The
72year-old gogo and 12 kids aged between two and 12 years were in the
house. The
19-year-old daughter who is doing matric went on the rampage on Saturday after
her gogo insisted that she returned to school although she was pregnant. NFP
deputy president Jeremiah Mavundla and few members of his party visited the
family and handed over blankets, sleeping sponges, clothing as well as grocery.
He said as the party they were deeply touched by the incident. He said after
local party women's league visited the family on Sunday they informed the party
national leadership that the family desperately needed help because couldn't
take anything out of the house. Mavundla said the family couldn't take even IDs
and kids birth documents as results they can't get their grants. "Apart
from bring blankets and clothing we also came with Eskom officials to re
connect electricity to the outside buildings because the main supply was on the
burnt house. We are busy arranging with Home Affairs and SASSA so that gogo and
kids shouldn't miss their grants," said Mavundla.The pupil's father
Mtsheleni Mabaso (50) thanked NFP for their generosity. He said the family was
very happy to receive blankets and clothing because everything was burnt in the
house.
