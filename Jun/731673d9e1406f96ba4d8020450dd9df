WHEN news broke that neighbouring Madagascar was using umhlonyane to treat Covid-19, South Africans rushed to get it. But gogo Sonto Ndaba (60) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, has had enough of thugs stealing it from her garden. She told Daily Sun she’d always used the herb to help her family during flu season. “We used it when we were growing up in the rural areas,” she said. “When I moved ekasi, I brought some from the rural area for my small garden. “Whenever someone had flu, I’d give it to them and they’d heal.” When people heard it could help treat corona, they started asking her for it. “I’ll give to people who ask nicely. My problem is with those who steal it.” The gogo used to have six bushes of the herb, but now has two. “I want those stealing my herbs to stop. If they finish them we’ll all suffer.” She drinks umhlonyane every day to be protected from the flu. “You don’t cook it. You just pour hot water on the leaves and drink it like a tea. You can fill up a big container and drink from it for days,” she said. Gogo Esther Dlamini (70) from Vosloorus had the same problem. “They took my medicine and left me with nothing. They’re heartless.” Sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye said: “Traditional doctors have always used it. What I love about herbs is that they mostly don’t have side effects.”
