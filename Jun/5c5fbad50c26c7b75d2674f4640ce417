STAFF at George Masebe Hospital in Mokopane, Limpopo, downed tools on Monday. They said they would not return to the hospital until the health department intervened. According to workers, the hospital pharmacist manager has been acting as CEO for years and was abusing doctors, nurses and general workers. A worker said grade 1 doctors were being appointed to management positions, and were abusing those in higher grades. “It concerns us because there are many doctors with higher grades who are being undermined,” said the worker. The worker said they couldn’t tolerate such poor management. The worker said managers also denied union representatives their rights at meetings. “It’s appalling that many doctors are just being suspended without a valid reason. We’re tired of working under such poor leadership. A data capturer at grade 4 was appointed as a community liaison officer, which requires grade 10.” Another worker said they were being given unauthorised warning letters. “We’re also being put on forced leave without payment,” claimed the worker. The workers staying on the hospital premises said they were told their families couldn’t visit because of the coronavirus. “We are surprised that we’re being told this at level 3, as visits were happening at higher levels too. “Some can’t go to work as they have to look after their kids alone now,” said the worker. Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said all staff met the set hiring criteria. “The department will, however, look deeper into this matter, so action can be taken if there was indeed a misuse of power,” he said.
