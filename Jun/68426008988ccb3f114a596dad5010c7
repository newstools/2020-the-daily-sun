SHE grew up in a family of izangoma who were good at healing and prophesying. However, gospel singer Princess M chose not to be a sangoma, but to worship God. She told Daily Sun: “A stranger once said I’m supposed to be a sangoma, but I dismissed the idea and stuck to gospel. “Gospel is what I know best and it makes me complete.” Princess M, whose real name is Princess Mnisi, said gospel is her true lifestyle. “I’m a child of God who believes in the word. I live by it and it changes many lives. “Even drunkards connect with certain gospel songs when they’re drunk. It’s how they comfort themselves.” The 37-year-old from Shihoko Village in Tzaneen, Limpopo, said her new contemporary gospel album, The Crown, is a testimony of the difficulties she went through and how she overcame them. On the album, Princess not only sings, but ministers, preaches and worships. The album was produced by Ntokozo Malinga and the live recording was produced by Bheka Mthwethwa.
