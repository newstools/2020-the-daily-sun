WITH Mzansi celebrating a decade of hosting the first ever Fifa World Cup on African soil, only the exact opposite can be said about what the six sides from the continent offered in the field of play. It was supposed to be a scene where African teams should have showed the world what they capable of. However, the world football showpiece provided yet another rude awakening to African teams as they dismally failed to impress. South Africa’s Bafana Bafana became the first hosts to fail to progress to the knockout stages of the tournament. Bafana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Algeria and Ivory Coast all crashed out in the last 32 of the tournaments, how disappointing! Ghana are the only African team that managed to qualify for the next round of the tournament, and they made Africa proud. They finished second in their Group D with four points, two behind Germany who won the group with six points. In the round of 16, The Black Stars eliminated USA 2-1 in a match that went to extra time. That saw them setting up a date with Uruguay in the quarterfinals of the tournament which was played on 2 July at Soccer City Stadium. Ghana was carrying the hopes of Africa of becoming the first team from the continent to reach the World Cup semifinals but it never happened. Fine goals were scored by Sulley Muntari and Diego Forlán. The climax to the 120 minutes (extra time) made the night unforgettable with one segue of drama which robbed Africa a golden opportunity. Luis Suarez’s deliberate handball denied Ghana what was going to be their winning goal to the semifinals. Suarez was sent off and Ghana was awarded a penalty. Asamoah Gyan missed the penalty, crashing it against the crossbar. Ghana lost the match 4-2 on penalties after 1-1 draw in 120 minutes. With no doubt that match remain as one of the most memorable clashes of the tournament.
