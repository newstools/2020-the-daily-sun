 A Shoprite
LiquorShop at the Newtown Junction shopping centre in Johannesburg has been
robbed in bizarre fashion by thieves who tunnelled through a solid concrete
floor to gain access. The robbery
took place while the shop was closed due to the Covid-19 lockdown while the
sale of alcohol was prohibited. The manager
of the the store discovered the theft – and a large hole in the ground – when
she entered the store on Friday. She was returning to prepare for the store's
reopening on Monday under the easing of lockdown regulations to Level 3. With
alcohol in high demand during the lockdown, the store was secured throughout
from the outside. But the thieves avoided the mall's main entrance and instead
used electrical and stormwater tunnels beneath the shopping centre to gain
access to the area beneath the store. They then tunnelled through the solid
concrete floor directly into the liquor shop to gain access undetected,
Shoprite said. It was
unclear how the thieves knew where to tunnel and how long it took them to get
through the thick concrete floor, but they returned a few times to steal a
large amount of stock.  According
to Oswald Meiring, the Shoprite Group's loss control manager, the thieves were
first recorded on CCTV cameras on 21 May, just 10 days before liquor sales were
allowed on Monday. Footage
from inside the store shows three suspects, although more may have remained in
the tunnel to help move the large quantity of stolen liquor. Meiring
said the thieves made off with whiskey, brandy, gin, cider, vodka and beer with
an estimated value of R300 000. A R50 000
reward, subject to terms and conditions, has been made available for
information which leads to a successful arrest. People with
