It was raining money in Kagiso! Cash was scattered all over the road after thugs bombed a cash van in Kagiso, west of Joburg. In a series of videos that has since gone viral on social media, people can be seen scooping up the cash from the road and pavements. Police spokeswoman, Lieutenant Colonel Brenda Muridili said the incident happened at about 7 pm on Wednesday morning. She said a group of suspects in at least three cars, a BMW and two Audi A4 sedans were involved in the robbery. “During the attack of the cash van the suspects used explosives to gain access to the cash. The suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of money as well as leaving cash scattered on the road and a Mercedes Benz burning,” said Muridili. Muridili further condemned the act of looting by community members. “It is a crime. Anyone found in possession of the stolen cash might also face criminal charges,” said Muridili.
