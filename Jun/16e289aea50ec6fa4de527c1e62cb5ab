TimesLive reports that despite having done significantly fewer tests than Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape has the third most Covid-19 cases in the country. By Thursday, it had 7,868 cases — behind only the Western Cape (37,422) and Gauteng (7,953) According to figures released on Wednesday night, the Eastern Cape had the second-highest death toll, with 147 deaths. The Western Cape had 927. Mkhize reminded Mzansi that the relaxing of lockdown regulations did not mean the virus had now disappeared but that now more than ever people needed to maintain the necessary rules to stay safe. Mzansi's approach to aggressively test for the virus and applying restrictions in movements was applauded early at the start of the lockdown by the World Health Organisation(WHO) and the country's death numbers are still way below the global average.
