MANY probably remember how villain Luis Suarez broke Africa’s heart with an infamous handball which practically denied Ghana a spot in the 2010 World Cup. But South Africa will never forget how his fellow Uruguay marksman, Diego Forlan, ended Bafana Bafana’s dream of progressing to the knockout stages. The image of Itumeleng Khune in full but unsuccessful stretch to parry Forlan’s thunderous strike in the second match at Loftus Stadium, is one of the most enduring for the Bafana fans. On the cold Tshwane night, the blonde-haired assassin single-handedly dashed the Mzansi’s hope, as his brace accounted for country’s early exit from the tournament they were hosting. It got worse for the first-choice goalie as he received his marching orders for his dubious foul on Suarez, leaving Forlan to add his second of the tournament from a penalty spot. “I’m so happy tonight. I hope this was real in Uruguay tonight,” Forlan said afterwards. Forlan arrived in South Africa almost unnoticed, overlooked by the media and barely mentioned in debates about top finishers. But he left these shores as the Golden Ball Award winner, having enjoyed what he later described as “the best year of my football career”. This was when he went on to score three more, in matches against Ghana and Netherlands. He helped propel Uruguay to their highest finish in 40 years, with a personal goal tally of five. “It is something incredible. I am overcome with emotion and happiness for this recognition that I never could have achieved without the support of the great team that has been formed in the Uruguay squad,” said Forlan. “The Golden Ball Award is as great as it is unexpected. I never ever imagined something like this, nor did I have my sights set on it.”
