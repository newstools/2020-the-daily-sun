Four people including a child died after their car collided
head-on with a truck in Coligny in the North West on Sunday. "Police first thought that [only] three people had died
in the accident, but later confirmed that a child had also died in the
wreckage," police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh told News24. The truck was carrying coal and was travelling to
Johannesburg on the N14, when the incident happened. The cause of the crash is still unclear, however, police are
investigating. The truck driver survived the crash and a case of culpable
homicide is being investigated. SOURCE: NEWS24
