A 12-year-old boy who tested positive for coronavirus in the North West has left villagers with a scare. The boy from Mandela park in Makouspan village has since been taken to a health facility for quarantine. His mother said back at home people do not want to talk to her. She said most do not want to enter the street where their house is situated calling it a “corona street”. The mother who cannot be named to protect her son said everyone in Mandela park knows that her son was infected with Corona virus. She said during the re-opening of schools last Monday, she took her son to the school, later on that day she received a call that her son was showing symptoms and had to be taken to the local clinic for testing. She said after the results came back positive, her nightmare started. “I don’t know how and who told them that fast but everyone was talking about it. It is like we are a disease or something that is not supposed to stay within the community. This is heartbreaking,” she said. A local councillor Ntswaki Monnapula said the situation was getting out of hand. “The whole community is now frightened. They think because that boy was infected they might also be infected because he played with their children and he goes to the same school where their children were going to ,” she said. Ntswaki said the problem with villagers at deep rural areas was that they do not adhere to the lock down regulations. “In this village, villagers only wear a face mask when they get into a bus to town. Otherwise in the village non of the regulations have been practiced. People are living as if the virus is not for them,” she said. Ntswaki said she was going to the local municipality tomorrow a loud hauler so that she can make an awareness and calm down the panic at the village.
