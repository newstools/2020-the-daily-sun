THE wish of former World Boxing Council (WBC) international light heavyweight champion, Ryno “The Lion” Liebenberg, to lock horns with Rowan “Braveheart” Campbell has finally been granted. The seasoned campaigner has been calling for the unbeaten prospect to prove his mettle by fighting him. Their showdown is expected to take place in September once the government has given the go ahead for boxing to resume. All sport in Mzansi was suspended due to the outbreak of coronavirus. “I have been the best fighter locally in my division for a long time ... now Rowan is coming up, I guess this is the right time to find out who is the best. I once told him that one day we will fight and I’m happy that it is finally happening,” said Liebenberg. The lanky fighter said the youthful Campbell will be his last opponent locally. “This will be my last fight in South Africa, and I plan on going out with a bang. After knocking him out I will be left with one international fight, then I’m done with boxing forever because I ‘ve had my time in the ring,” he said. According to the 36-year-old fighter, the national lockdown has forced the cross town rival to fight him. Campbell, who is the International Boxing Organisation (IBO) Africa title holder, was scheduled to challenge for the IBO world title in March. But that contest was cancelled due to Covid-19. “They did not want anything to do with me because they know what is going to happen,” Liebenberg said. Meanwhile Campbell, who has been eliminating some of the top local talents on his way to international stardom, would be happy to add Liebenberg’s name on his list of victims. In his last three fights, he has claimed victories against light heavyweight champion Nicholas Radley, Patrick Mukala and Yanga Phetani. He has an impressive record of 12 victories after the same number of fights, while his vastly experienced counterpart has been engaged in 28 battles of which he has lost seven and drew one.
