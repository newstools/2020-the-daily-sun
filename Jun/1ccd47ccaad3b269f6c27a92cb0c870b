A 27-years-old man was hit by an aeroplane wing in Graskop
outside Mbombela, Mpumalanga on Monday, at around 7am. The man whose name can't be disclosed now until his next of
kin has been notified allegedly shouted and warned to his colleagues before being
hit by the wing of a light aircraft. According to the three men who have been working with the
deceased at a Graskop based construction, they were walking to work on a runway
(aeroplane route). "He was shouting and warned us to move away from the
run-away as the aircraft was landing. We believe that the victim thought he had
shifted enough to give the plane enough space to pass," said the shocked
men. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: "We confirm that a man
was hit by an aircraft whilst walking with three others to a construction
site.'" However, Hlathi indicated that the matter is yet to be
investigated by civil aviation authorities and the police. An inquest has been opened.
