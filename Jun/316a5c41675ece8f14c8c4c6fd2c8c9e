AmaZulu winger Sphelele Magubane has vowed that he will do everything in his power to help his side escape the deadly relegation axe hovering above them. Usuthu currently find themselves in danger of dropping to the GladAfrica Championship. They are second-from-bottom on the Absa Premiership table, level on points with Baroka and Polokwane City, who are 13th and 14th respectively. Magubane is aware that his side have their work cut out for them when the league resumes from the Coronavirus enforced break. He believes the KwaZulu Natal outfit can pull off an escape in the remaining matches. "Well, every family goes through a rough patch or tough season in our case. So, we are facing a struggle to survive in the league," Magubane told the official AmaZuluÂ  website. "However, it is about how we overcome the challenge we are facing or how we handle the situation, we are currently facing. "Definitely, we are winners and we do not quit. "I have no doubt that we will stay up in the PSL when the season resumes. We have a good squad with a lot of quality players." Magubane, who joined Usuthu from KZN rivals Golden Arrows, has finally overcome his struggles with fitness. He is hoping to kick on and help Usuthu retain their top-flight status. "I have not performed badly this season, but I know that I can do even better and help the team," Magubane added. "The thing is I was out of action for quite some time. So, I'm still lacking match fitness which is something that I will work on."
