Deputy police minister Cassel Mathale said police were ready to deal with crime as the country moves to level 3 today. Mathale said this during his visit in Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. He was accompanied by Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala and provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma. During his visit, a roadblock was conducted at the busy and dangerous R40 road in Orpen outside Acornhoek and Hoedspruit, which borders Mpumalanga and Limpopo. A suspect in a hijacked car was arrested. “Police are ready to deal with crime, whether it’s across border or inside the country,” said the deputy minister. “We have men and women in blue who are called to task to respond to any crime.” Mathale said there was a huge problem of people transporting illegal cigarettes, alcohol and drugs that cross through the borders. They also visited Acornhoek Mall to check if people were complying with lockdown regulations. Mathale pleaded with management at shops to ensure that the elderly, people living with disabilities and pregnant women didn’t stand in long queues to avoid seeing anyone collapsing. MEC Shabalala said it was important to continue teaching the public about Covid-19, so they could protect themselves. Lieutenant-General Zuma said since the start of lockdown, they arrested more than 10 000 suspects and would continue working tirelessly to ensure criminals were brought to book. Taxi driver Lucky Ngobeni said they were pleased to see the police visiting the area more often, to ensure the public was safe at all times.
