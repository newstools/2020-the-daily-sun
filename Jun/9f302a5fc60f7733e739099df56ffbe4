Ultimately one of the greatest singers of all time, the late Luther Vandross once sang: "When you call on me, baby, that's when I come running." I might be naughty to quote him out of context, but this line underlines the fundamentals of being a booty call. Your'e simply an emergency service and when called upon, you should come running to respond to the emergency. This might sound amazing because you're like an emergency service worker, but in the long run this tends to harm your chances of playing in his/her first team, in other words being in a relationship with someone because you are only seen as a booty call. So we take a look at some reasons why you might just be a booty call:  If your dates consistently change from planning to watch a movie to actually doing the movie in his/her bedroom then you might be just a booty call. Should most of your dates involve sheets and birthday suits, then somebody is just an essential service provider minus the lockdown.  If your sole form of communication with him/her is texting then you might be just a booty call. https://www.dailysun.co.za/LIfestyle/sexting-will-be-a-thing-now-20200330 If sexting is all you do, then you know which lane you need to stick to.  If he/she has never hinted at introducing you to their parents then you know that what you have is a booty call relationship. If all you only see or hear of his/her through pictures take a hint, your'e not in the first team.  When days are dark and he/she is hardly around. Take a hint, you are the bottom of his/her priority list. Being a booty is like calling a call centre, your call may or may not be attended.
