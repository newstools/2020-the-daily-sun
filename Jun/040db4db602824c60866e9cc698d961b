THEMBU king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo officially started his duties yesterday. After a long meeting at Nkululekweni residence in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, Traditional Affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha handed over a brand-new BMWX4 and cellphone to the king. Namhla Siwahla-Dlulane, a director responsible for traditional leadership, said the MEC was assigned by Premier Oscar Mabuyane to reaffirm Buyelekhaya as Thembu king. “Correctional Services sent a notice to former king Azenathi Dalindyebo in October that the king would be released. “The acting king was given notice in October, so his acting duties should’ve expired in January.” On behalf of Buyelekhaya, Prince Langalibabele Mthunzi Mngonyama said the aim of the meeting was to reaffirm the king. “We experienced the delivery of working tools such as a brand-new car and administration staff. “We hope to work very closely with government in the near future on anything affecting our kingdom,” he said. Mngonyama said Azenathi was challenging Buyelekhaya’s reinstatement. “The king is back and no one can claim he wasn’t notified. It was a temporary arrangement,” he said. Responding to Azenathi’s claims of him not going anywhere, Mngonyama said Bumbane Great Place was the only place Buyelekhaya could work. He said: “When the king goes back to court on the 30th, we’re going to ask that the eviction letter preventing the king from accessing Bumbane can’t be made permanent.” The king wants to carry out his functions at Bumbane.”
