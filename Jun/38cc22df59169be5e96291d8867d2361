THE Bolsheviks Party of South Africa in Limpopo wants the Sekhukhune Municipality to clean up its illegally dumped sewage at Five Morgan Village. According to party leader Seun Mogotji, the municipality has been dumping kak illegally near Five Morgan outside Groblersdal. Mogotji told Daily Sun that drained human waste from more than 900 toilets was being disposed of in the village. “This clearly shows the municipality does not care about the people’s lives,” said Mogotji. He claimed the municipality appointed a contractor to drain pit toilets at Thabakhubedu Village with no proper sewerage for dumping. “The contractor does so in a manner that poses serious health hazards for residents,” he said. Mogotji said Five Morgan residents did not have proper running water, and relied heavily on underground water. He said the dumping of human waste in a hole could contaminate the underground water. “The municipality should act fast on this matter and instruct the service provider to stop dumping human waste in the illegal hole,” said Mogotji. Villager Mokgadi Seleme (54) told the People’s Paper: “We are forced to stay indoors because of the bad smell from the sewage.” Municipality spokesman Moloko Moloto said the municipality was aware of the shocking matter. “This is indeed disappointing, because that was not what we agreed on with the service provider,” said Moloto. “The municipality gave the service provider 30 days to clear the area. “We will definitely terminate their contract if they fail to do so.”
