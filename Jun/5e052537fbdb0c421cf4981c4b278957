MARITZBURG United rising star defender Rushine De Reuck says coach Eric Tinkler has discovered the beast in him. De Reuck, who has been the star turn of the team in this suspended season, says when Tinkler arrived at the club in January last year he told him that he was lazy. But that woke him up as he’s now one the most sought-after footballers in the Absa Premiership, having featured in all 24 league games before the season was suspended in March due to Covid-19 pandemic. “Coach Eric has helped me quite a lot. He told, me ‘You, Rushine, the talent is there, you are the best player I have seen. I just need you to work really, really hard.’ “You can see this season maybe I have [picked up only) one yellow card in 24 games, I have bettered my positional play. I’m talking about the way I read the game, the way I see the game, the way I study opposition players. I know what to do in certain areas and I know my strength. “I’m also not scared to go one-v-one, I’m good in the air. Tinkler has helped and improved my game quite a lot.” When De Reuck arrived under coach Fadlu Davids a few season ago, he was clumsy and fans at the Harry Gwala Stadium used to get on his back, signalling for him to be taken him off. But this term, De Reuck has produced many polished displays. This has seen Maritzburg wasting no time to tying him down to a longer contract. The club handed him a five-year deal (four years with an option to renew) recently. Whether he remains at the club for the duration of his contract remains to be seen. He has made it clear that he wants to go back abroad. He got a taste of European football in Portugal with Pacos Ferreira’s B team under now AS Roma coach Paulo Fonseca when he was 19. “I see myself going back to Europe, I feel I have unfinished business there,” said De Reuck. “I think now I know what it takes to go there.”
