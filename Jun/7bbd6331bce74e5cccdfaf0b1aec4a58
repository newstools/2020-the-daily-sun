 Mzansi's very own local film, Losing Lerato, has done it again. This time the highly successful film scooped the best Screenplay gong at Rams International Festival in the UK. This after taking home all six awards it was nominated in, earlier this year at the Idyllwild International Festival Of Cinemas Awards in Psalm Springs, California. The star-studded movie is the brainchild of actor Kagiso Modupe, who used money from his own pocket to produce it. In a previous interview with the Daily Sun, he said he would ensure everyone, who took part in the movie, gets royalties. The star said even cleaners and security guards would be paid, because he knows the pitfalls of the industry and appreciates everyone who was involved in making his dream a reality.
