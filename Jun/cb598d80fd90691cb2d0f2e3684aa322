Dear MizzB I’m a 20-year-old guy in a relationship with a 15-year-old girl. I’m wondering if it’s okay to have sex with her. She’s pushing for us to get intimate and  threatens to leave me if I don’t have sex with her. I don’t want to lose her.  Please help! Dear Brother Being with someone younger than you is a big challenge. By law, a child under age 16 is a minor even if she agrees to have sex. That’s statutory rape and her parents can open a criminal case. Please stay away from this child and stop any communication with her. This will get you in very serious trouble with the law, should her parents find out. I hope this clears up your concerns.
