NEHAWU has called on members working in hospitals to stay home if they don’t feel safe. The union’s secretary in Limpopo, Jacob Adams, said the health department was not doing enough to protect workers. This comes after several reports of frontline workers becoming infected with coronavirus at the WF Knobel, Van Velden and Pietersburg hospitals, as well as at a clinic in Waterberg. “All our frontline healthcare workers must be protected at all times. “We encourage our members and workers not to work when they feel their lives are in danger. “The Limpopo health department has an obligation to defend and arm the soldiers it sends to war.” He said the department urgently needed to fumigate and disinfect all healthcare facilities, test and screen all workers on a regular basis and ensure workers who come into contact with someone who is positive are quarantined. “We will be seeking an urgent meeting with the department to sharply raise these issues,” he said. “The safety and health of workers is sacrosanct and no effort must be spared in ensuring that they’re protected at all times. We need all hands on deck to defeat the virus.” Premier Stan Mathabatha’s spokesman, Kenny Mathivha, said the union had been invited to several meetings to play an advisory role. “It’s unfortunate that they refused to be part of saving employees’ lives,” he said. “It is therefore regrettable that they missed an opportunity to play a role in fighting the global pandemic.”
