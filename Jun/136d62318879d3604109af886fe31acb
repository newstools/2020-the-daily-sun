NFP KZN leader Sphamandla Ntombela believes the thugs who broke into his house wanted to kill him. Ntombela’s house in Newlands East, north of Durban, was broken into on Monday night and his VW Polo, money and cellphones belonging to his wife and kids were taken. He told Daily Sun he wasn’t home when the incident happened. He said he received a call notifying of the incident from his wife, who had borrowed a phone from one of their neighbours. He said his wife told him six armed men entered the house and ordered them to lie down. He said the men ransacked the whole house before demanding the car keys. Ntombela, who was recently appointed party provincial treasurer, said he believes he was the target. He said there were many neighbours whose cars were parked outside and their houses were not fenced. He said his house had a high wall and a gate, but thugs chose to break into his house. “I believe they came for me. It’s not usual that six armed men can hijack a car or break into houses. These were hitmen who came to kill me. Why did they target my house whereas there were a lot of neighbours’ cars parked outside?” Ntombela’s incident follows the recent killing of Philip Mkhwanazi, an IFP councillor in Mtubatuba and ANC youth league branch secretary Kingdom Gcabashe in Mpumalanga township, west of Durban. The incidents have brought fears that political killing may be returning to the province. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the Newlands East cops were investigating a case of house robbery. She said a group of armed men entered the house and demanded cellphones, car keys and also stole a safe with a firearm.
