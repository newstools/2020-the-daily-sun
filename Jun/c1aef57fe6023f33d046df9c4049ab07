Former Kaizer Chiefs coach Stuart Baxter has finally landed a new job after resigning as Bafana Bafana mentor in August last year. The Scotsman opted to hand in his resignation following the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Egypt in which South Africa knocked out hosts in the Round of 16 before Nigeria sent Bafana Bafana packing in the quarter final. Nearly 11 months after his second stint as Bafana head coach, Baxter - who has previously worked in Japan, Sweden, Finland, Turkey and England - will now head to India. The 66-year-old has officially been named as the manager of Odisha FC in the Indian Super League on a two-year contract. "Odisha FC is delighted to announce that Mr. Stuart Baxter has been appointed as the new Head Coach on a two-year deal ahead of the seventh edition of the @IndSuperLeague," the club announced on their official Twitter account.
