PRASA security officials seized stolen cables and other rail equipment worth almost R10 million on Monday. This huge bust happened at a scrap metal dealership in Mmakau, Ga-Rankuwa, in Tshwane. Prasa has been struggling to run its trains smoothly because of theft and vandalism. Prasa administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo said their business intelligence teamed up with cops and bust the suspects at Jooste Scrap Metal in Tshwane. “The arrests come after surveillance and monitoring of the scrap dealership indicated there may be Prasa scrap metal on the premises.” Mpondo said they pounced on the premises and bust three suspects, including the dealership owner. “Security reported a worrying increase in the number of reported cases of infrastructure vandalism ranging from overhead electrical lines, electrical substations and station buildings,” he said.  Mpondo said they recorded losses of about R364 million last year due to the burning of trains in the Western Cape and Gauteng, the vandalism of power stations and stealing of electrical cables.  On 8 February, cables worth more than R2 million were recovered and three Prasa employees were bust at a house in Ratanda, Heidelberg. Mpondo urged communities to watch out for vandalism and report those acts to help protect their infrastructure.
