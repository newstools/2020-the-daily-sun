WE are all living in a confusing and anxiety-riddled time as the coronavirus pandemic holds the whole world to ransom as it wreaks havoc in its wake.  While Mzansi’s lockdown restrictions have eased to level 3 since 1 June to allow for the economy to slowly crawl back and recover, retrenchments and increased levels of poverty have been immediate results of a lockdown period that literally stopped our economic activities. Life during a time of coronavirus has been harsh and unforgiving. From constantly worrying about keeping you and your family safe to struggling to put bread on the table, the pandemic continues to take a toll on all of us. It is even more difficult for people who test positive as many do not have access to quality health care. Today on page 4 we’ve published a story of how a community in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, is responding to the challenges of living in the age of the coronavirus. To deal with stereotypes and discrimination heaped on people who test positive for this virus, a caring ward councillor, Ncumisa Mahangu, opened a support group to help people have a safe home to share their anxieties, experiences and fears. The group also shares health information to motivate those who test positive to take better care of themselves. In a regular news feature called Life During Corona, we will publish your stories in your own voice every Monday. We are looking forward to interesting conversations with you on how you, your family and community are coping as you keep safe and sane during this extraordinary time. – Editor
