GOSPEL mucic entrepreneur Sipho “Big Fish” Makhabane has urged lovers to resolve their issues and to not kill each other. The award-winning singer led a protest against the abuse and killing of women in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. “We’re asking partners to sit down and resolve their problems,” he said on Tuesday. “Decisions people take when angry are bad. That’s why we have a high rate of women killings. This must stop!” Big Fish pleaded with Mzansi to follow the mind and not their heart. “The best thing to do when one feels angry is to get up and go,” he said. “I’m pleading with our brothers not to take wrong decisions when angry.” He called on partners to be patient with one another. During the march in the streets of Mbombela on Tuesday, he was joined by 12 fellow gospel musicians including Donny Ngwenyama, Indumiso Gospel Group and Selby Mhlongo. The march was also in solidarity with the youth of 1976. Big Fish retired in 2010 in a much-publicised event to focus his energies on developing young talent. He established his own label, Big Fish Music, and has groomed or produced a host of young gospel stars over the years.
