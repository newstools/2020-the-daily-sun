BEING in Cape Town is worrying on its own. These were the words of concerned Ajax Cape Town midfield sensation Grant Margeman. There have been 10 confirmed Covid-19 cases by Absa Premiership sides Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, Stellenbosch FC, Bloem Celtic as well as GladAfrica Championship side TS Galaxy. And more cases are expected as teams are conducting preliminary tests in line with PSL protocols ahead of all clubs' return to training in the coming weeks. Magerman, who has a goal of helping Ajax Cape Town win automatic promotion before moving to Mamelodi Sundowns says as much as he is staying indoors he dreading the Covid-19 test results. Margeman said: “Western Cape is the epicentre of this pandemic, according to the statistics. And being in Cape Town is scary.” “But we have to continue to be safe, take precautions to stay home and wear masks when we go out.” South Africa is currently sitting on over 100 thousand cases and Western Cape as recorded more than 55 thousand of those cases. Like most people, the player is hoping that with the Premier Soccer League having taken a step closer to resuming the 2019-20 season when the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, confirmed their protocols for a return to play have approved. The 22-year-old is hoping to complete what he started with the club at the beginning of the campaign.When the football was postponed in March, Ajax were top of the GladAfrica table. The South Africa international is confident they will be able to continue where they left off. He said: “With all the challenges we are currently facing, the objective will remain the same when we go back to the field of play. We want to win the league. “It is also my personal goal to help the team win promotion. We have been trying to keep fit following program that we were given by the team but it is not the same training without teammates.”
