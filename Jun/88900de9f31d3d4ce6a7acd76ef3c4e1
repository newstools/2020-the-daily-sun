MATJHABENG Local Municipality executive Mayor Nkosinjani Speelman has been asked to resign. He has also been told to publicly apologise to the Coloured community and all South Africans. This is after he was found guilty by the African National Congress disciplinary committee of contravening certain provisions of the partyâ€™s constitution. In April a video of him calling the Coloured people "Boesman" went viral. He told the army that were meant to patrol the streets during lockdown at parade: "In Bronville, jy weet mos party van die Boesmans. They take some chances. Don't hesitate. I talked to them yesterday, but when you close them, they get out and drink again." Speelman jokingly said the soldiers must "skop and donner" if necessary and they will get his support. This video did not sit well with residents who said it was a hate speech and the matter was taken to the Human Rights Commission. Daily Sun published the story of the mayor in hot water over "Boesman" comments on 9 April. He then issued an apology and the story of his apology was published later. Daily Sun contacted his spokesperson Tshepo Davids but his phone rang unanswered. The message was sent to Speelman asking for his comment but his phone rang unanswered. Free State ANC spokesperson Thabo Meeko said they were aware of the judgment but they were still checking if it was okay to release it to the public.
