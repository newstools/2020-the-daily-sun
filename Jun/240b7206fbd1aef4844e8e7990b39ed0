THEIR big mistake was to discuss their salaries on a WhatsApp group, complaining about not being paid enough. Truck driver Steven Moyo (57) and three former colleagues are now jobless. Steven said they were not paid their salaries for last month. He said the WhatsApp group was created for them to talk about work issues, since they couldn’t meet face to face. “We’ve been working hard since lockdown and were expecting to get more money. “But when our salaries for April came, it was not what we expected. “We talked about this in our group and we didn’t mean to hurt anyone. “I went for a disciplinary hearing in Cape Town. After the hearing I was told to go to Joburg, where I was told I had been dismissed from work for misconduct.” He said he requested his May salary but was told to bring back his work suit and boots. “They money would be deducted, but the little they were supposed to pay me didn’t come. I want to be paid what’s due to me,” he said. Another dismissed employee, Sithe Tsotsi (41), said he had not received his provident fund money. “They told us we’re paying for training and other equipment,” he said. “I’m surprised because we didn’t resign but were dismissed.” Walter McGregor of Anderson Transport said the four were dismissed by an external chairman following a procedure and a fair hearing. “The employees are fully aware why they were dismissed and what process they can follow to create a dispute,” he said.
