JM Mosiane primary school pupils in Lomananyeng village in
the North West were excited to see a group of military team arriving at their
school to supply them with water. The school has been using water filled in a Jojo tank for
years. Parents of the pupils draw the water with five litre bottles to flush
the toilets after the children are done relieving themselves. On Friday, it was like the water that the South African
Defence Force team has brought was different from the ones they usually drink. “It tastes like chocolate,” one of the learners showed his
appreciation while telling the military general after taking a sip from a glass
of fresh water that the Sandf team had just delivered. Sandf’s Brigadier General Bruce Motlhoki said water was
essential in a fight against Covid-19. “We are going to deliver water based on the requirement of
the department of education. We are not going to allow our people to die whilst
we are looking and folding our arms,” he said. So far the military team has delivered water to ten schools
around the North West. School Governing Body chairman Tumisang Motsumi welcomed the
assistance the school received from SANDF. “The school survives on refilling a tank of 10 000 litres
and has hired workers who take five litre bottles to flush toilets after they
have relieved themselves,” he said. He said they SGB spend R3 000 every month to refill the
water and appreciated what the Sandf has done.
