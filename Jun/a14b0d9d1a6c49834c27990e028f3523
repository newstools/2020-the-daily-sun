for bail while horiffic details have emerged on how he allegedly terrorised his
girlfriend’s family.   The Mercury reports that Constable
Eugene Mchunu, (37) a cop from Umlazi is accused
 of attempted murder, after he
allegedly poured boiling water on her and pepper-sprayed her face and genitals  He appeared in the Umlazi
Magistrate’s Court today. The cop is said to have kidnapped the woman
and took her to his home.  The paper reports that the states argues
Mchunu forced a firearm into her mouth and told her she was going to die. “He allegedly ordered her to strip
naked before tying her hands with cable ties, poured boiling water on her and
pepper-sprayed her face and genitals.” “He then allegedly locked her in the
room and went to report for duty at the uMlazi police station. Once there, he
requested permission to use a police vehicle which he used to drive back to his
home and then to take her to Prince Mshiyeni hospital.” The State has opposed Mchunu’s bail
application. Mchunu denies the state’s version of events
and wants R1000 bail to go continue his job. But the investigation officer revealed
that the cop has a history of abusing the woman’s family. “Officer Wayne Unger said when he
visited the woman in hospital, she had told him that she was “terrified” of him
(Mchunu).” “Members
of her family have asked for interdicts. There was a criminal case against him
but it was withdrawn. The accused punched the victim’s father on his mouth and
he lost his teeth. On three occasions he went to a female family member asking
where the victim was and assaulted her. And, on one occasion he put a firearm
to her head, on another he used a Taser gun on her because he thought the
family member was hiding the victim,” he said.
