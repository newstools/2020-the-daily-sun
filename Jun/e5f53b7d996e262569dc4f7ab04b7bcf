WHEN
her family realised they haven't been able to get hold of their daughter on her
cellphone they became worried. The
next thing they did was to go and look for her at the flat she stayed in with
her friend on Saturday. But
they didn't find the 24-year-old daughter, Minenhle Gwamanda originally from
Pietermaritsburg but stays in the Durban CBD. Her
uncle Mnqobi Mkhize (45) told Daily Sun that Minenhle's flat mate told them
that Minenhle left on 3 June and told her that she was going home. She
said she only took her hand bag and nothing else. "We
were shocked to find out that she wasn't there. We had been trying to get hold
of her on her cellphone with no luck. That’s why we went to look for her at the
flat. This started to worry us even more," he said. He
said they searched for her at all their relatives’ homes but nobody had seen
her. "Even
her boyfriend last saw her on the 3rd of June. At the call centre in Umhlanga
where she worked they too last saw her on the 3rd of June," he said. He
said now they don't know where to look for her. "We
hope to find her alive. This is a really hard time for the entire family,"
he said. The
KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said police in Durban Central are
appealing to the residents to assist with regards to a missing person. She
was last seen by her roommate on 3 June leaving their apartment after informing
her that she is travelling to her home in Pietermaritzburg. "She
has not been seen since her departure and did not reach her home. She was
wearing blue denim jeans and a white sweater when she was last seen," said
Gwala. Gwala
said anyone with information on her whereabouts is urged to contact the
investigating officer, Warrant Officer Lucky Khanyile on 072 428 3758/ 031 325
4075.
