Chippa United coach Rhulani Mokwena has not ruled out a return to Orlando Pirates to lead the side one day as he describes chairman Dr Irvin Khoza as a “father-figure”. Mokwena has an unhappy short spell in charge of the side earlier this season following the shock departure of Micho Sredojevic, and has now been sent to take charge of Chippa for the remainder of the campaign. But, with strong family ties to Pirates that includes his father Julius Sono and uncle Jomo Sono, he says it remains a dream to lead the side again one day. "The Chairman [Khoza] is and will always be a father figure to me. I will always be appreciative of Orlando Pirates giving me the opportunity to start my head coaching career at the club,” Mokwena told the SA Football Journalists' Association (SAFJA). "The lessons I learnt under very difficult circumstances at Pirates have shaped me and made me strong. I am a better person, honestly, than before I arrived at Pirates. I'm less emotional and have a thicker skin because I made a lot of mistakes and learnt from them. "But if I was not given that opportunity, I don't think I would have learnt those lessons anywhere else. So I'm very sober in my thinking, but we've seen these things happening before. "We've seen Mourinho leave Chelsea and come back, so I cannot close the door to that. But I don't have control over it. “What I do have control over is my own capacity and growth as a coach, whether that means growing with or away from Pirates, the most important thing for me is that I continue to grow." -SUPERSPORT.COM
