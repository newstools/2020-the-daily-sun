MANY people ekasi associate monkeys with witchcraft. But when Mojalefa Thulare first saw his pet monkey, John Cena, he fell in love with it and never feared what people would say. And John Cena is now part of his family. This after the 31-year-old from Klipgat in the North West found the monkey trapped on a fence with an injured leg two years ago. He built a cage for it, and it has been his pet since.  “I decided to put it in a cage outside because it was going to be weird for people. They were going to think I was using it for evil deeds,” he said. Mojalefa said his neighbours were surprised when they first saw it. “Many people asked me if I wasn’t scared to be labelled as a wizard, but I knew I was not doing anything evil and didn’t have to hide the animal,” he said. He said people got comfortable with it. “It’s always in its cage and I make sure it plays and enjoys itself. People around the area come to see it. Some even take pictures,” he said. He said his wish was to get a bigger cage.  Mojalefa said he loved that John Cena was very smart. “It doesn’t eat rotten things and eats like a human. It enjoys fruit and vegetables. John Cena is like another member of the family, but the only problem is that it doesn’t talk,” he said. Mojalefa loves animals. “I grew up around animals. I have three dogs and when I find a sick dog on the road that looks homeless, I take it, rehabilitate it and then give it to someone,” he said.
