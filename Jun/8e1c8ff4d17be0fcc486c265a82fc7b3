FIVE of the teachers who take up their places behind microphones every day acknowledge that teaching via radio presents new challenges. But every one of them is proud and enthusiastic. They each have more than 20 years’ experience and use every bit of that experience to reach out to pupils stuck at home during lockdown. Mashudu Marubini was chosen in 2014 as the South African maths teacher of the year. Besides the radio lessons, this passionate teacher assists his pupils via a WhatsApp group. Pupils ask questions and he gives them homework. “I also recorded a few lessons on Facebook, especially for term 2 topics,” he says. Mashudu, who’s been in the teaching profession for 24 years, says radio lessons are complicated. “It needs special skills for presentation because you have to present everything in a chapter in less than an hour,” he says. “You should also have good knowledge of your work so you know what to pick up with pupils. “You should also be able to explain in such a way that pupils can visualise what you’re teaching.” He misses the interaction with his pupils. Teaching maths is no longer a job but a way of life. Mashudu says: “It’s everything to me – it’s my work and my entertainment at the same time. “The world has changed completely. “The world we’re in is based on technology. “It’s high time pupils all have smart phones, data, a conducive environment and proper food. A child can’t learn if he or she is hungry. “To parents I say this: ‘Monitor your child’s study timetable and support with any study materials’. “Actually, when your child is in grade 12 you’re also in grade 12.”
