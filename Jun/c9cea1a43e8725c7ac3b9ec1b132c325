THE suspects in the murder case of Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu appeared in the Verulam Magistrates Court yesterday. Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Andile Nhleko (27), Mncedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (27), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Malusi Mthembu (27) were applying for bail. Asked where he was on the day Bobo went missing, Thabethe said: “It was my birthday. I arrived at Magagula Tavern in Hambanathi, where my five co-accused were.” Alcohol had been stolen and someone blamed Bobo. “I then asked accused number five, Lindani Ndlovu, to drive me to the place where Bobo was.” When they got there he asked Bobo about the alcohol. “I slapped Bobo a few times. He wasn’t injured,” he said. “We drove to a house and found the alcohol. We took it and left.” Thabethe said after Bobo gave the booze to him, he told him never to set foot at Magagula again. “That was the last time I saw him,” he said. “I left the tavern to go buy meat. My co-accused and I wanted to braai.” Thabethe then went back to the tavern to find out why they hadn’t come to the braai. “I saw three women related to Bobo. I asked if Bobo was still there,” he said. When his lawyer Chris Gounded asked him about his arrest, he said: “My mother told me police were looking for me. I found them at the Shell Garage at Fair Breeze and they arrested me.” He said he had no reason to kidnap Bobo.
