AJAX Cape Town’s development structures arguably rank as the best in the country given the number of players they have produced for the local and international market. The Urban Warriors, who adopted the highly successful youth development strategy of their parent club Ajax Amsterdam, are reaping the rewards. The leading GladAfrica Championship outfit continue to produce some of the finest young players in the country, who usually go on to ply their trade in Europe and represent their country at international level. Since the club’s inception in 1999, they have been at the forefront of youth development in the country, producing stars like Steven Pienaar, Thulani Serero, Daylon Claasen, Hashim Domingo and Keagan Dolly. More recently, the likes of Grant Margeman, Jody February and Brendon Petersen have been unearthed from the famous Ajax academy. And in keeping with their rich history of promoting promising young players to the senior team, the Urban Warriors have promoted six youngsters ahead of next season. Ashley Cupido, Rushwin Dortley, Khaya Mfecane, Chumani Butsaka, Cole Schoeman, Dale Wakefield are the latest in a long line of players to make the step up at Ajax. These youngsters are expected to save Ajax a fortune in the market, especially during the difficult economic times brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are in testing times right now, so we are lucky that we can turn to our youth department and pull talent into the first team ranks,” said first team manager Thabiso “Shoes” Mekuto on the club’s website. “The reality is that there are huge financial issues in the South African football future so we need to look at reliable youth options going forward.” Ajax are currently leading the race for automatic promotion to the top flight, seven points clear of Swallows FC at the top of the Championship table. They have six matches remaining to confirm their return to the top flight after a three year absence.
