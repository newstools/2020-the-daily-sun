POLICE have launched a manhunt after a dangerous inmate stabbed a cop to death, took the keys and stole money before disappearing into thin air. A 57-year-old warrant officer was brutally killed on Friday at Mutale Police Station during his normal visits to the cells. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the officer was routinely visiting the cells when he was attacked by the suspect, who stabbed him several times. “The suspect further took the keys from the deceased and stole money from the safe before escaping. The suspect, previously incarcerated for other crimes, was earlier today arrested on charges of rape, kidnapping and violation of a protection order.” Mojapelo said provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba instructed a 72-hour activation plan be carried out immediately to track down the dangerous escapee, who faces charges of murder, robbery and escaping from lawful custody. Nyadzani Muvhuso (pictured) is requested to avail himself at Mutale Police Station or the nearest police station as it’s believed he will assist in the investigations. Anyone with information is requested to contact Colonel Chris Mabasa on 082 469 0739, Crime Stop at 0860010111 or their nearest police station. Any information will be treated with confidentiality.
