Jacob Zuma’s arrogant request that the deputy chief justice must recuse himself from the State Capture Commission is not only legally absurd, but politically preposterous. Zuma has over the past 15 years played poker with the legal system, played chess with various legal challenges, and now is attempting to play Russian roulette with Zondo. His legal team can learn from Zondo’s quiet dignity, temperate disposition, passionate commitment to justice, unfailing fairness and humility in wearing the privilege and power of high judicial office without ever succumbing to pomposity or arrogance. He has a commendable grasp of legal principles. His record clearly demonstrates that when adjudicating cases, he has no judicial timidity and applies the law as he sees it. Over 2 400 years ago, Socrates gave his well-known iconic description of the essential qualities of a good judge. Socrates said that four things belong to a judge: hearing courteously, answering wisely, considering soberly and deciding impartially. These are Zondo’s supreme qualities. He’s a brave jurist with an incisive and independent mind. Zuma is a drowning man, yelling for help after puncturing his life jacket. History has proven time and again that the truth will ultimately prevail over falsehoods. Never in our recorded history has one person usurped, maligned and abused our legal system at such a colossal cost to the taxpayer Letter by Farouk Araie Joburg
