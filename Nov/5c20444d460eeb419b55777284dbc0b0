ALTHOUGH in South Africa Halloween is not a thing, some of our celebrities took it upon themselves to join in on the international celebrities Halloween celebration with photos on Social media. Halloween or Hallowe’en, also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Eve, or All Saints’ Eve, is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October – the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows’ Day. Some international celebrities go out of their way to recreate or create their favourite costumes and this year with all social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, the parties seem to have been with close friends and families indoors. Bonang Matheba is one of those who attended a Halloween themed party hosted for Shashi Naidoo’s birthday celebration. One of our favourite, that even got a nod from Kim Kardashian herself, was Ayanda Thabethe’s recreation of the recent Kardashian sisters’ perfume advert. OMG THE BEST!!!!!!! https://t.co/IqoDB6k9BC  Here are local celebrity looks we loved: 1.Ayanda Thabethe Thank you to each and everyone of you for your love and support! We loved this body of work and couldn’t wait to share it with you. To see how well you’ve responded to it makes me so very happy and made the work so worth it. I take Halloween simply as a day or an opportunity to celebrate our artistry as South Africans from hair, garments , makeup , photography , our beauty etc. we are TRULLY world class. This was fun and I’m obviously buzzing from the fact that it was appreciated by @kimkardashian herself, TRULLY made my day and reminded me that anything is possible for a willing heart. Couldn’t do this without the team @cinnelstore who comes up with these crazy ideas and I guess I’m always just crazy enough to say - yes let’s do it. We make a great team. Happy Halloween everybody !! Lots of love ?? ...
