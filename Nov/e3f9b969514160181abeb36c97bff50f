PSL Chairman Irvin Khoza wants the newly-launched #NoExcuse movement to go beyond the 16 Days of Activism. ”We want all our members to set an example e for the rest of the nation. The mission is to make sure that the movement becomes a national continuous movement,” said Khoza. The PSL on Wednesday announced the partnership with the movement, launched by Carling Black Label. The initiative focuses on driving positive change amongst South African men. The movement’s holistic approach to be a “ lighthouse for positive masculinity” is aimed at driving awareness, creating meaninful conversations and providing useful tools for men to take positive action as a means of driving change. As one of the most influential sporting codes with a largely male audience in South Africa, on the first day of 16 Days of Activism, the PSL is a strategic partner for the movement. ”We are proud to strengthen our long standing relationship with the PSL, ” said Black Label Brand Director Arné Rust. ”We have witnessed the impact our join efforts have had in empowering Champion fans and we hope to carry this momentum into this partnership. The majority of South Africans’ passion point is football, and we could not have picked a more befitting platform to engage in much-needed conversations around gender-based violence and strengthening our fight against this social ill that truly affects us all.” said Rust. The partnership will ensure that each member of the PSL will undergo the Champions for Change (C4C) Course, either online or through in-person training by the movements’ on-the ground partners, Father-A-Nation which is spearheaded by 2019 Humanitarian of the Year award recipient, Craig Wilkinson.
