REFEREE Skhumbuzo Gaba could find himself in trouble with the Safa Review Committee, following his blunder for allowing Chippa Unitedâ€™s goal to stand, although it was taken from outside the field. Augustine Kwen sprinted to the Chippa bench to celebrate his bogus goal with his coach Lehlohonolo Seema in the 23rd minute of their DStv Premiership clash against Tshakhuma FC at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday. The Nigerian was gifted a golden goal on a silver platter after the ball was dragged from outside of play. He gave it direction past Man of the Match Arubi, who sadly watched Gaba point to the centre to allow the goal to stand. As the saying goes, every bad thing is followed by the good. Five minutes into the second half of the match, Thabo Rakhale netted his first goal of the season for TTM, his first against his former club when he unleashed a razor-sharp shot inside the box, completing an effort by Mbulelo Lukhubeni. TTM can only console themselves by fact that they collected four points in two matches following their 1-0 Limpopo derby victory against Baroka FC last week. Chippa have dropped five points after they lost 2-0 last week to Stellenbosch.
