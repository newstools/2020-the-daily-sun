 BAFANA Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu has lashed out at critics following their 2021 Afcon qualifier against Sao Tome ePrincipe.Bafana beat the Islanders 4-2 in the match that took place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Monday.Percy Tau and Themba Zwane rekindled the chemistry they had when they played together at Mamelodi Sundowns to help Bafana see off the tricky opponents. Zwane and Tau both netted twice for Molefi Ntseki’s side as they gathered six points in their two matches against the minnows. Bafana’s performances, however, have not left too many impressed with some feeling they were made to labour by their less fancied opponents. Sao Tome did hold their own against Bafana, especially in the second match where they rattled Ntseki’s men in the early stages of the match. But Zungu, who was instrumental for Bafana in both matches, was left perplexed by some of the criticisms levelled at the team despite having done the job in both matches. The Rangers man has never been shy to share his opinion, especially on social media and he was quick to come to his side’s defence on Twitter. “We lose, you all complain. We win, you say it is not good enough. What do you want us to do?” said Zungu Zungu was happy with Bafana’s exploits after they collected nine points from a possible 12 to put themselves in a strong position in Group C.They will face Sudan and Ghana next year in March and hope to complete the job and qualify for the Afcon. “So happy we managed to collect 6 points in the last 2 games,” added Zungu.“We keep going.” We lose!! Some of url complain! We win , u say it’s not good enough. ?? kanti nifunani entlek? ??????
