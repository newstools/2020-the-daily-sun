HE is 36 years old, but is still a virgin. And this wasn’t by choice. Women drop him like a hot potato when they see his teeny-weeny 4-5! The tormented man from Eden Park, Ekurhuleni, is now seeking help to enlarge his member. He said he’s spent more than R5 000 trying to enlarge his member, with no success. He told Daily Sun: “I can’t live like this anymore. I no longer ask ladies out. It’s embarrassing.” He doesn’t like going out with friends anymore. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE MEN WITH THE BIGGEST 4-5s? “I’m at a stage where I lock myself up in my room all the time,” he said. He and his more endowed buddies sometimes meet ladies who’re willing to go home with them. “I can’t stand another rejection! Some of my friends know about my problem,” he said. “They do try to keep my hopes up, but I can’t keep hurting myself like this.” The man once dated someone for five months, and she vanished after she saw his 4-5. He said he’d always remove her hand whenever she tried to touch his 4-5. “I’d tell her I didn’t want us to rush into things, but she got tired and emphasised she was ready,” he said. “When I decided to be intimate with her, she asked what was wrong with me when I took my trousers off.” He said she acted as if she understood, but that was the last time he saw her. “She even blocked me on social media,” he said. His brother said he didn’t know how to help him. He said he took him to someone who claimed to be an expert. They paid R1 500, but the man vanished with their money. “I’m really sad for my brother. I hope someone offers him help,” said the brother. A friend said he motivated him to ask ladies out as he wanted to keep his spirits up. “If married men with small 4-5s can get wives, so can he. He just needs to start opening up.”
