MARITZBURG UNITED defender Rushine de Reuck is frustrated! He is worried that things are not coming together at the club. De Reuck is asking himself what else they need to do to get the ball in the back of the net and start picking up points as he says they are playing well. However, de Reuck hopes things will pick up when they face fellow strugglers Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium in their DStv Premiership showdown tomorrow (3.30pm). Both teams have yet to pick up a point in their three league matches played to date. But things are worse for Lidoda Duvha. Not only they are at the bottom of the table, they recently parted ways with their coach Patrick Aussems. De Reuck, who was recently rewarded with a Bafana Bafana call up for the two Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying wins over Sao Tome and Principe says the players share the pain of not having won in the last 10 games in all competitions. “It’s not me but there are a lot of other players who have spoken about this as they went through the same thing (at the start of last season) with the team,” said De Reuck. “We need to work through it and it’s difficult, but we need to keep on pushing because for sure the table will turn.” With Aussems sacked, the axe is now hovering over United coach Eric Tinkler. The beleaguered coach knows if they don’t get a win tomorrow, the pressure will keep piling on him. However, Tinkler, who will be without Riyaaz Ismail and Sibusiso Hlubi who are serving a ban, admitted before the international break that the morale of the team has taken a knock and said getting the win against Leopards will boost the his team’s confidence. “We are looking to try and get back to winning ways so we need to try and go there and win,” said Tinkler.
