INVITATION has been accepted, bring it on. This was a tweet by EFF leader Julius Malema, as he announced that the EFF will paint Cape Town red on Friday. A group of EFF protesters were severely beaten while protesting outside Brackenfell High School in Cape Town recently, following reports of a matric dance from which black pupils were allegedly excluded. The Fighters had intended to take their memorandum of grievances to the school, but were intercepted and beaten by a group of people who claimed to be parents of Brackenfell High School pupils. The group claimed they were protecting the kids who are writing exams and accused the EFF of trying to cause chaos. Cosas members called on the Western Cape Education Department to take action against the teachers who attended the matric farewell. MEC Debbie Schäfer said no action would be taken against the teachers as the event was a private affair and not organised by the school. Two weeks ago, she said: “Whatever one’s views may be, the fact is the event in question was privately organised at a private venue by private individuals. “The school had nothing to do with the organisation or management thereof. It wasn’t supported, funded or endorsed by the school in any way,” she said. “The school didn’t hold a matric ball this year, owing to Covid-19 concerns.” Daily Sun previously reported that President Cyril Ramaphosa had called for calm in the area. He said it was every South African’s right to engage in a peaceful protest and any action to suppress the right to freedom of expression, particularly through violence and intimidation, should be roundly condemned.
