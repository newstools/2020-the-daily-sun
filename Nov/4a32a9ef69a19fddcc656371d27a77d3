The SABC board has suspended the retrenchment process for seven days. This comes after workers threatened to go on strike. In a statement, the SABC said the suspension of the retrenchment process was to buy time for stakeholders to engage and explore further options in an effort to ensure the financial sustainability of the SABC. The statement further said that the public broadcaster was committed to engage meaningfully with all its stakeholders. A source at the SABC told the People’s Paper they were not happy with the manner the board was dealing with the retrenchment issue. “Suspending the retrenchments for seven days doesn’t make any difference. This means after seven days there’s a possibility the process will continue. We are calling for the retrenchments to be scrapped immediately and for all those who received letters to return to their positions and the letters withdrawn.” The mole further said the board must allow engagements to continue. “Engagements were not done properly,” the source said. Another mole said the situation was difficult for everyone. “This suspension is just their way of succumbing to the pressure because of the threats the workers have made about a go-slow,” the mole said. When approached for a comment, SABC acting spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “We have released a statement this morning and we will be adding nothing further until further notice.”
