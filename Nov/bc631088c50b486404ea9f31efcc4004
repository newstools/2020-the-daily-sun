TWO women were bust on Saturday for killing their partners in separate incidents. A 34-year-old from Lulekani, outside Phalaborwa in Limpopo was arrested after allegedly stabbing her boyfriend, Lawrence Mathebula (45), to death. Lawrence was found lying in a pool of blood by neighbours after he was stabbed in the neck. He was rushed to hospital where he later died. His uncle, Bennett Mambane (52), said the family was shocked to learn the suspect was Lawrence’s girlfriend. “He was a disciplined person who was never violent,” he said. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the couple had a fight around 11pm on Friday night that ended in violence and the victim was stabbed. “The suspect will appear in the Lulekani Magistrates Court on a murder charge today. In the second incident, a 49-year-old from Marironi Village in Bolobedu was bust for allegedly killing her Ben 10. It’s believed she arrived home and accused him of cheating. Ngoepe said the heated argument turned into a fight. The suspect allegedly choked the victim before stabbing him several times with a sharp object. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned incidents where couples resort to violence. “We urge community members to help couples with domestic problems to seek professional help,” Ledwaba said. The second suspect is due to appear in the Tzaneen Magistrates Court today charge with murder.
