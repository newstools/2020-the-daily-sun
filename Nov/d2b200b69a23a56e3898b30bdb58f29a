GONE are the days when you had to leave your house to buy groceries. Now people can just click on their phones and have everything they need delivered to their doorsteps. Ronica Ngasama is one of the trailblazers who has introduced this technology to ordinary South Africans through her app called Agriazo Poultry.  The 21-year-old from Gawula Village in Giyani, Limpopo, told Daily Sun: “The app caters to all your agricultural needs. “It enables you to order from home and have produce delivered straight to your doorstep. “Ever seen how hard it is to find a cow or sheep for lobola or a wedding in an urban area? That’s where Agriazo Poultry comes in.” She said customers could order livestock, meat combos and vegetables from her app. “It’s very user friendly and our team is always there to assist online,” she said. “It also aims to encourage youth and tell them being in the agricultural sector is a blessing.” Ronica said she was inspired to create the app during lockdown. “People were uncomfortable to go out and shop. “I felt the need to fill the gap and allow people to place orders for organic, fresh and healthy food delivered from the farm,” she said. “They can place their order by downloading our app, which is available on the Google Play Store.”
