A FIRE attacked Maureen’s house in November 2018. Last year November she managed to escape raging flames again. This year, Maureen Mbatha (58) said she may not be so lucky! She believes she cursed. Maureen from Makause squatter camp in Primrose, Germiston, became a fire victim twice this month. Maureen is terrified she might not survive this November if she doesn’t get help soon. In 2018, she was caught in a fire inside her shack after her primus stove exploded. She sustained burns all over her body and spent more than three months in hospital. She was still recovering when another fire struck in November last year. This time her shack caught fire while she slept. “I was awakened by smoke suffocating me,” she said.  She screamed for help and was rescued from her burning shack by neighbours, but she suffered burns to her face. “I don’t know if this fire is the act of people who want to hurt me, or if it happens by accident. “I don’t want the same thing to happen again this year. I’m struggling. I’m living in fear.” Shack fires apparently happen all the time in Makause. “I’m still in pain. Doctors tell me it’s going to take time before the burns in my skin go away. “I wish someone could remove this curse.”  Maureen collects scrap metal to survive and doesn’t make enough to buy bricks. “I’m appealing to people to donate second-hand bricks and cement so I can build a room I can feel safe in,” she said. Maureen, who stays alone, said her shack also leaks. She’s been living in the squatter camp for more than 10 years. Sangoma Khethokuhle Hlongwane said nasty people send vutha to make household items explode.
