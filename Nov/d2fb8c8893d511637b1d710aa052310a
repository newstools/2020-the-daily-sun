TSHIFHIWA Rabambukwa helps people understand rhumba music better. The 33-year-old singer from Tshipise Tsha Sagole Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, said rhumba in Venda is known as tshingondo. His love of rhumba was influenced by late singer Leonard Dembo of Zimbabwe. “His music will take you on a journey to Zimbabwe and involves dance, percussion and high tempo guitars,” said Tshifhiwa. He said he’s spiritually connected to the genre and sometimes doesn’t even know how he plays the guitar so well. “Maybe I have ancestors in Zimbabwe,” said Tshifhiwa. He started his music career as a band member of Samson and New Stars, led by his brother Samson. “I was their lead guitarist and vocalist. We played in different taverns, and this is where I met rhumba singer Zozo from Zimbabwe,” said Tshifhiwa, who left his brother’s band to join Zozo.

Tshifhiwa’s song Pride aims to make people aware that pride can destroy one’s future. “With Ulivhuwa (Thank You), I acknowledge all heroes and heroines while they’re still alive. “Most people forget those who helped them to become successful.” In 2018, Tshifhiwa won the Best Tshingondo Album at the TshiVenda Music Awards. “I was happy that I won. It shows that I’m planting the right seed. “I wish it multiplies so that future generations will have reference of this spiritual music that’s recognised in both countries.”
