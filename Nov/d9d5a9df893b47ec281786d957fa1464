IT was mission accomplished for Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki after picking up six points in back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe. Despite edging closer to qualification for the Afcon finals in Cameroon, Ntseki is demanding more from his players. He now wants to win Group C and has instructed his boys to beat Ghana on 25 March at FNB Stadium and Sudan on 30 March next year in Khartoum, when the qualifiers conclude. And Ntseki, based on the talent at his disposal with a number of players ruled out of the games against the Islanders including clubless Buhle Mkhwanazi, Sifiso Hlanti who recently joined Swallows FC, Erick Mathoho and Thami Mkhize, with others injured and those who had to withdrawn due to Covid-19 related issues, is confident they can achieve their goal. Bafana, after beating Sao Tome 2-0 in Durban last Friday and 4-2 in Port Elizabeth on Monday, need just a point to book their spot in 2022 Afcon in Cameroon. The six points attained over lowly ranked Sao Tome has seen Bafana collect nine points from four matches. Ntseki wants to complete the group stage with 13 points. “Congratulation to the team to have managed to deal with the pressure, but the pressure is not over yet,” said Ntseki. “We still have to play Ghana and Sudan and the pressure that comes from within us is for us to win the group and qualify for the Afcon finals. “I hope everybody will be available. I know offensively we are going to cause havoc against Ghana.” In the match on Monday, the inter-passing between Percy Tau and Themba Zwane was devastating, tore Sao Tome to shreds to help themselves with a brace each. “These are very good ball players. “I think the balance of Bongani Zungu and Dean Furman (in midfield) gave them the freedom to express themselves,”explained Ntseki.
