I’ve personally lost trust in President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet. That’s after they failed to protect the state’s money, which was meant to tackle the pandemic. How will they protect South Africans against the deadly virus when they failed to protect state funds meant to minimize its spread? Now, instead of dealing with Covid-19, they’re dealing with people who steal money and use state funds to prosecute perpetrators. We’re going nowhere because of such leaders.
