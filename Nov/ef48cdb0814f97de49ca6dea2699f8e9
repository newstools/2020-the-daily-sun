CHIPPA United coach Lehlohonolo Seema believes his young team will only get better as the season progresses. The Chilli Boys are still searching for their first win this season and will be hoping that it comes in their next match. They next face Maritzburg United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday (7.30). Chippa will hope for an improved showing as they look to put their 1-0 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs last time out behind them. “We came across a team that played well on the day, a team that was hungrier than us and I’m not surprised,” said Seema. “We are building a team here and we will have these fluctuations in performances. “This is a young team and we have people who are making their debuts in the PSL.” Seema, however, will know that results have to come sooner rather than later if his side are to avoid fighting for relegation. He is expecting another tough battle against a Maritzburg team that is also struggling. “We are coming up against another tough team, a hard running team,” added Seema. “This will be a real test for this young team, but we will continue working hard. “I can’t fault my players, they are working hard and trying their best. The attitude is right. “But I’m expecting a tough game, they are also looking for their first win like us so it won’t be easy. We need to take our chances when they come.”
