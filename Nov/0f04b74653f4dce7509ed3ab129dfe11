DYLAN Kerr said “it feels great to be back” after he made a return to Black Leopards, charged with the task of helping the team finish in a respectable position this season. Kerr previously coached Lidoda Duvha for seven months in the second half of the 2018-19 season. He left the Venda based outfit in May 2019. Eighteen months later he is back at the club after leaving another Limpopo club Baroka FC. “After the long six weeks which was the worst six weeks in my career it feels great to be back,” Kerr told SunSport on Tuesday. Kerr revealed that he could be on the bench for the first time since returning to the club next Tuesday when Leopards travel to FNB Stadium where they will play Kaizer Chiefs in a league match. “I will be not on the bench tomorrow (Wednesday), probably I will be in charge in the next fixture against Chiefs.” Since arriving in South Africa Kerr, has been in charge of teams (Baroka and Leopards) who are always among relegation candidates. However, the English mentor says he wants to put an end to that as he is challenging his troops to do better finish in the top eight.He stated: “ I cannot say we are going to win the league or we will finish in the top four or top six. “The number one mandate is to stay up. But I think more importantly I’m looking to see what I can do and what I can make improvements to, how we can get some wins with the players. I know most of these players were here when I left. “Now I want to challenge them to get into the top eight. Even if we finish in position10, that would be an achievement.” On Wednesday Leopards will be hoping for a second win of the season when they face Bloemfontein Celtic at Petrus Molemela Stadium (7.30 pm).
