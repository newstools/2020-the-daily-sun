THANDI Nxele has been having sleepless nights since her daughter went missing on 3 October. The 37-year-old from Emdeni in Soweto told Daily Sun Mbali (16) was last seen by a friend, with whom she fought at a graveyard. She said two other friends who witnessed the fight didn’t know what it was about. “She never sleeps over at a friend’s without letting me know. I became worried when she didn’t come home,” she said. Two days after she reported Mbali missing, a friend of Mbali’s told the mum she might have been kidnapped. “I asked her where she got this information. She told me she heard this from the mum of the friend Mbali fought with.” When Thandi contacted the woman she said, according to her daughter, Mbali was apparently taken by a man after money exchanged hands. She said: “Her daughter apparently told her it was some guy from ekasi.

I decided to verify this information myself. I didn’t find her.” She’s now pleading with SunReaders and police to help her find Mbali. Approached for her version, the mum of Mbali’s friend told Daily Sun: “My daughter told me she knows the guy who sold Mbali and is willing to accompany the police.
