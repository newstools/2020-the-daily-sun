LIKE any youngster, Aphelele Fassi harbours aspirations of donning the green and gold of the Springboks. But the path to Test rugby requires the Sharks winger and full-back to knuckle down and sweat. The SA Rugby Union (Saru) have confirmed the Springboks will play three Test matches before their series against the British and Irish Lions in July next year. “Jumping from high school to the Currie Cup helped me a lot. It was a stepping stone. Now I’m eyeing the Springboks,” Fassi said. The 22-year-old has been sidelined by injury, but he is looking to force himself into the reckoning in the upcoming Currie Cup. In fact, the national selectors will be following the competition with uncertainty surrounding the SA franchises international tournaments. Fassi had been earmarked for Boks selection against Georgia before the match was cancelled due to Covid-19. He has undergone shoulder surgery. “It’s been tough under lockdown. With the squad we have and how we’re playing, the hope was alive that we’d reach the Super Rugby final. Unfortunately, things ended the way they ended. But hope was there,” he said. But the Bok dream remains for the promising full-back, likely to be fit in the new year. Saru has announced Castle Lager as the official title partner of the 2021 British and Irish Lions’ tour of South Africa. The series starts on 3 July when the Lions face the Stormers in Cape Town. The first Springboks Test will be played at FNB Stadium three weeks later. Cape Town Stadium will host the second Test on 31 July before the two teams travel to Gauteng for the final Test at Ellis Park on 7 August.
