BANYANA Banyana kicked off their Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) Women’s Championship title defence on a positive note. This, after they managed to get the better of Angola 2-0 in their Group A opener, played at the Wolfson Stadium in Nelson Mandela Bay on Tuesday. Banyana’s goals were scored by Lonathemba Mhlongo and Karabo Dhlamini as the defending champions signalled their intentions for the tournament. They will be looking to continue the dominance that they have shown in this tournament in the past having won the last three editions in a row. Banyana have won six of the previous seven editions that have been played and have a huge target on their backs this year as a result. Nevertheless, they will be relishing the challenge with a relatively young and inexperienced team. One of the new faces in the team, Mhlongo, who plays for the Durban Ladies, grabbed her opportunity with both hands with her performance as she managed to score on debut. Mhlongo opened the scoring in the 39th minute for Banyana when she guided Hildah Magaia’s cross past the Rita Jose in the Angola goal to settle some nerves. Banyana would have to wait until the second half to make the game safe with substitute Dhlamini getting her name on the scoresheet with a scrappy but important second goal. Banyana coach Desiree Ellis would have been pleased with how her side acquitted themselves in what was their first competitive match in over six months. They will, however, be hoping to be more clinical in front of goal in their next match against Eswatini at the same venue on Friday (3.30 pm). They then face Comoros in their last match of the group, a team they walloped 17-0 when the two sides last met in last year’s edition.
