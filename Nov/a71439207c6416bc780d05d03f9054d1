The Gauteng Traffic Police department has called upon road
users in the province to drive with caution. This comes after the heavy rainfall that plagued Gauteng
since Friday afternoon and continuously during the weekend. Sello Maremane, Gauteng Traffic Police Spokesperson this led
to many major routes being flooded, inaccessible and unsafe to drive through. “Motorists are advised to maintain a safe following distance
at all times. If visibility is hampered due to heavy rainfall, motorists are
advised to switch on their headlamps and hazards,” Maremane said. Maremane said heavy rainfall also led to the destruction of
properties and vehicles, notably in Sharpeville, Sedibeng district where a roof
of Global filling station collapsed. “It is important that wiper blades are in good working
condition before undertaking a trip. There is also a need to adhere to the
prescribed speed limit at all times and continue avoiding heavily flooded areas
by making use of alternative roads, “added  Maremane. He said their department will be on high alert with a
specific focus on low-lying areas.
