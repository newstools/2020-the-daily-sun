STATISTICIAN-GENERAL Risenga Maluleke released the third Quarterly Labour Force Survey yesterday. According to Stats SA, the number of employed people increased by 543 000 to 14,7 million, compared to the second quarter of this year. “Unemployment increased substantially by 2,2 million, which is 52,1%, to 6,5 million compared to quarter two of 2020, resulting in an increase of 2,8 million, which is 15,1% of the number of people in the labour force,” he said. He said the number of discouraged work seekers increased by 225 000, and the number of people who were not economically active for reasons other than discouragement decreased by 2,9 million between the two quarters. “The movement was proportionately more toward the unemployed than for the employed, which resulted in a significant increase of 7,5 percentage points in the official unemployment rate to 30,8%. “The unemployment rate, according to the expanded definition of unemployment, increased by 1,1 percentage points to 43,1% in quarter three in 2020, compared to quarter two in 2020,” said Maluleke. “Formal sector employment increased by 242 000, informal sector employment by 176 000, private households by 116 000 and employment in agriculture increased by 9 000.” He said employment increased in all industries, except in utilities and transport. “Industries which gained more jobs were finance with 200 000, community and social services with 137 000 and private households with 116 000, compared to quarter three in 2019.” Most job losses were observed in trade with 400 000, manufacturing with 300 000, community and social services with 298 000, and construction with 259 000. Maluleke said the results indicated that of the 14,7 million people who were employed in quarter three of 2020, more than seven out of 10, were expected to work during lockdown by their companies. “Those who actually worked were predominantly men, except in the community and social services sector and private households, where the majority were women,” he said. He said working from home was more prevalent in Gauteng and the Western Cape. He added that due to lockdown restrictions, Stats SA collected data telephonically.
