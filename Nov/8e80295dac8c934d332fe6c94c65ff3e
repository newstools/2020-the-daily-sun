MUZI Hlophe fetched his sick mum from KZN and brought her to Gauteng for better medical treatment. Gogo Nora Skhakhane (72) was about to return home as she had recovered. But she tragically lost her life after the wall of a cooldrink manufacturing company in Malvern collapsed on several shacks at the Jumpas informal settlement in Joburg on Saturday night. Eight other people were injured and rushed to hospital. Muzi (44) said that his mum had been in Joburg since 3 October. “She was going to return home sometime this week. We’re deeply hurt.” Muzi also lost his Toyota Corolla after it was flattened by the wall. He said he used the car to go to work as he was living with a disability. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE MEN WITH THE BIGGEST 4-5s? The wall allegedly collapsed as a result of Saturday night’s heavy rain and strong winds, flattening more than 10 shacks and a car. Speaking about the incident, Muzi said: “We were sitting and heard a loud sound from outside. “One of us went to check as we thought there was someone playing loud music in their car. “She came back and shortly after that the wall collapsed on our house. “Neighbours pulled us out of the rubble and we had minor injuries. Unfortunately, gogo didn’t make it.” Clayton Makhubele (32) said he was sorting things in his car when the wall collapsed. He suddenly noticed water running and the wall landing on shacks. “When I went closer, there was a man on top of the shack, shouting, ‘my brother is in there’,” he said. Ward councillor Neuren Pieterson was in the area helping residents. He said they didn’t anticipate that the wall would collapse. “This is unexpected. I’ll ask building control to investigate and see if the engineering specifications were adhered to in the construction of the wall,” he said.
