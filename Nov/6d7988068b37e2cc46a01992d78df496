GRADE 12 pupil Asavela Nxenye from Crossroads in Cape Town is struggling to study after cops beat him up on his way home recently. Asavela said: “I’d been sent by my gogo to withdraw money at the mall.” On his way back a friend called him on his phone, so he decided to run back home. “While I was running I saw a police van following me, but I never thought they were after me.” He said the police blocked his way and he immediately stopped. “It was at about 2pm. They asked why I was running and I told them I was rushing to see a friend.” He said they started beating him up, accusing him of running because he’d committed a crime. “They continued attacking me until I asked to show them my gogo’s Sassa card and the bank slip. After showing them, they stopped and put me at the back of the van.” The cops took Asavela home but left him at the back of the police van when they entered his house to ask his gogo about him. “I heard they asked if she’d sent me to withdraw money. They never told her about the beating and that I was at the back of the van.” They then dropped him and drove off without apologising. “What they did is wrong. I experience headaches ever since the incident, and I can’t concentrate on my studies. I want them to pay for what they did,” he said. His gogo, Mavis Ngqaza (63), said: “My grandchild is in grade 12. They traumatised him and he’s complaining about headaches.” She said the cops never told her why they were asking about him. “They asked if I’d sent my grandson to the mall. I told them I’d sent him to withdraw money. They then went out and drove off.” She didn’t know they’d moered Asavela until she saw him lying in front of the gate. “I was shocked that they didn’t apologise. They must pay for what they did,” said Mavis. Captain FC van Wyk said an assault case was opened for investigation and referred Daily Sun to Ipid, whose Langa Grace said the case had been handed to them. “Investigations are still ongoing,” said Grace.
