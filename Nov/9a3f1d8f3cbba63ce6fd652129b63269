THE four suspects had successfully accomplished their mission. They had stolen money and jewellery, but all their efforts turned to dust when cops arrived unexpected and bust them. Seeing they had no way out, the suspects shot at cops and security guards. But at the end of the day cops came out victorious. Two of the four suspects were bust and all the stolen money and jewellery were recovered yesterday. Now the two men aged 28 and 29 are facing charges of business robbery, murder, attempted murder and hijacking. Captain Kay Makhubele said two armed men entered a jewellery store in Hendrick Verwoerd Street in Nigel, Mpumalanga, where they shot and injured the 35-year old shopkeeper. “During the robbery, two more armed suspects joined the initial two and the suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of cash and jewellery.” “The fleeing suspects allegedly fired shots at a private security vehicle, fatally wounding the passenger.” Makhubele said the suspects then hijacked Ford Figo and sped off. “Police who were on routine patrol in the area noticed the hijacking incident.” Makhubele said a chase ensued, followed by an exchange of fire between the police and the suspects. “Suspects were cornered and arrested. During the arrest, police recovered the hijacked vehicle, the suspects’ getaway car, the stolen cash and jewellery, as well as an unlicensed firearm in the car.” He said two other suspects evaded the arrest and police are looking for them. “Management of the police in Gauteng has commended the members for dealing decisively with the suspects, urging all law enforcement officers in the province to intensify efforts geared at bringing down the high volumes of violent crime as the festive season looms.” Makhubele said the two suspects will appear in the Nigel Magistrates Court soon.
