THE police in Eersterust, Tshwane, are looking for the family of a woman who can’t talk or use sign language. The distressed woman was found wandering around the streets on Monday morning by concerned residents who called the police. Attempts by residents and police to identify the woman failed. Esmare Jacobus (38) said when they failed to communicate with the woman in Sesotho, Afrikaans or English, a woman who uses sign language was called. “She couldn’t communicate with her either. “We even gave her a piece of paper and a pen thinking she might write down her names and where she’s from, but she couldn’t,” she said. “She was shaking and looked afraid and never answered.” Esmare said they were afraid something bad might have happened to the young woman. “Not a single sound came from her. Maybe she might have been through a traumatic experience. “It’s impossible that she can’t speak or use sign language. “Something is not right about her,” she said. Anyone who might know her should call Constable Mbangata on 012 806 1020 to help the young woman reunite with her family.
