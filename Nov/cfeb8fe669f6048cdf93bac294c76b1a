A MUM, who needs help finding her missing son, prays he’s still alive. Matshepi Molepo (43) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the last time she saw her son, Koketso (27), was on 25 September. He was on his way to work. She said Koketso went out with colleagues after work. “He went to a pub in Barwa Section in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, with two of his colleagues. They had fun, but he took a different route when it was time to head home,” said Matshepi. She said Koketso told his colleagues he was going to Daveyton Central. “I wasn’t worried too much because he sometimes goes out with friends and comes back after a day or two. But days passed by and I’m not coping right now, I’m worried,” she said. Matshepi called his workplace to check if he was at work, but they hadn’t seen him. “I asked his friends, their families, neighbours and everyone I know, but no one seems to know anything about his disappearance.” Matshepi told Daily Sun this wasn’t the first time Koketso disappeared. He disappeared four years ago, but some people knew his whereabouts and he also sent people to tell her he was okay. “I’m worried as this time no one knows where he is. I hope to find him safe,” said Matshepi. Gauteng SAPS spokesman, Captain Kay Makhubele said a missing person’s case was opened.
