Dear MizzB I’M a 29-year-old married woman and I have two kids with my husband. I’ve organised a festive family trip for the four of us. My husband is angry that I didn’t include his two kids from his previous relationships. I feel that it’s not my responsibility.Their mothers should plan such for them. Am I wrong?­ )Sista Dear Sista Communication is always important, because it will help you understand what your husband’s expectations are when it comes to his kids. Be open about how you feel regarding the inclusion of his kids in your trip. Set clear boundaries so that you guys can avoid having unnecessary conflicts.
