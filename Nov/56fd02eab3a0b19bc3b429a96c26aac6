CARS and house windows were badly damaged when a hail storm hit Polokwane and Seshego, Limpopo very hard on Tuesday night. It all started with a dusty wind before the atmosphere got covered with dark clouds and there after the hail storm started. Cars that were parked at the Seshego Circle Center (Mall) were severely damaged. The hail from the storm were the size of a human fist, continued to pour for about 15 minutes causing extensive damage. Most cars were damaged from the rear windscreens and lights to the roof. Sharon Mohale (44) from Zone 4 in Seshego says she had just got back from work when it stated to rain. She told Daily Sun that the sound of the hail storm on the roof of her house was so scary, as it felt like there was a person with a hammer banging the roof. "I was so scared that I will die with my kids inside the house. There is only two windows that got damaged but that's nothing compared to our lives." She said.
