MURDER accused Dumisani Mkhwanazi has pleaded not guilty to killing and burying UJ student Palesa Madiba. He also pleaded not guilty to robbery with aggravating circumstances, obstruction of justice, possession of unlicensed firearm and possession of illegal ammunition. Mkhwanazi appeared on Wednesday 11 November at the South Gauteng High Court, where his murder trial was set to proceed the next day. The state was expected to bring in evidence and witnesses to testify in the matter that dated back to 2013. Mkhwanazi pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which didn’t surprise Palesa’s family. Family spokesman Thabiso Tsoledi said: “We’ve all been witnessing a lot of court proceedings on TV. It’s not only expected that he would have pleaded not guilty, because he’s always stated he is not guilty. “We will leave that to the court to prove and hopefully, justice will prevail.” After numerous delays and postponements, there seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel for Palesa’s family. Tsoledi said: “We’re happy the trial is beginning. This is a step on a very long road we’ve walked, a step that is beginning to give us closure. We are quite happy that court proceedings will start tomorrow.” Judge Prince Manyathi said: “The matter will be postponed to tomorrow. The state will start tomorrow to bring evidence and witnesses to come and testify.” He said the defence would also want to consult with the accused. “Mr Dominic Thinane has indicated he started consulting with you (Mkhwanazi), but there are certain things he wants to clarify with you. The matter is postponed to tomorrow and will proceed tomorrow with the witness.” The matter has been delayed several times because of Mkhwanazi’s failure to secure legal representation. His lawyer Thinane was absent twice due to non-payment issues. The judge told the accused if he didn’t sort out his legal representation, he ran the risk of representing himself.
