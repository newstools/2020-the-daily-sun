Media personality Somizi Mhlongo-Motaung has pledged to help start-up businesses by offering free advertising on his Instagram page. In a lengthy video, the Metro FM radio presenter said he realised how important it is to support local businesses. He gave credit to DJ Sbu and said the idea was inspired by him. The talented DJ and businessman also promotes local businesses on his Twitter account. “I have realised that I have a platform that is powerful and that I have a huge following, which I can use to support and promote undiscovered businesses that cannot afford to pay for advertising,” he said.

Don’t just present anything for the sake of submitting,” he said. “Work on the presentation, make it look buyable and appetising, so that it can spark an interest in people.” A post shared by Somizi (@somizi)
