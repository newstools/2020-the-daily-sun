A man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend as well as two of her relatives has been sentenced to three life terms, plus 21 years imprisonment. Simon Dlamini (29) from Embalenhle in Mpumalanga appeared before Judge Thando Mankge at Mpumalanga High Court seating in Middleburg on Thursday, 12 November. Also, he was found guilty of two counts of attempted murder and arson on 5 November. The court heard that Dlamini allegedly bought petrol and stored it in a portable container after his girlfriend, Xolisile Mokoena (19), broke up with him. He waited for Mokoena’s family to go to sleep and broke into their home at Grootvlei near Embalenhle on 5 October 2013. He sprinkled petrol all over Mokoena and two young girls before setting them alight. Mokoena’s uncle and another family member were woken up by smoke and flames that had engulfed the house. They tried to rescue the girls but Mbali Mokoena (14) and Carolina Mofokeng (11) didn’t make it, while Mokoena was rescued and rushed to Heidelberg Hospital. She was later transferred to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where she unfortunately died. Dlamini fled the scene and went into hiding but the police made a breakthrough in September last year and sniffed him out from his hiding place in the Free State and arrested him. Judge Mankge sentenced Dlamini to three life imprisonment for murder, eight years for each count of attempted murder and five years for arson. The court ordered that count 4, 5 and 6 will run concurrently with the three life sentences.
