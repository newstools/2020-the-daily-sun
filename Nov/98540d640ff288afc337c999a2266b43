SEASONED campaigner Jackson “M3” Chauke cannot afford to slip up in his upcoming fight against Luyanda Ntwanambi. Defeat would be a serious setback for his aspirations to challenge for the WBC world title. Chauke is set to put his two belts – SA title and World Boxing Council (WBC) international flyweight – titles at stake against East London’s Ntwanambi on 6 December. Chauke, who’s rated seventh by WBC and 12th by the World Boxing Organisation (WBO), said losing is not an option. “My preparations have been going very well I’m working hard in the gym because I’m expecting a good fight from Ntwanambi. “I will give everything I have to retain my titles. Defeat is the last thing on my mind. “I want to continue getting positive results and that will keep my dream of challenging for the WBC title alive,” he said. The former Commonwealth silver medallist said he is inspired by his stablemate and WBC world cruiserweight champion, Ilunga Makabu Jr. He said Makabu Jr’s achievements have motivated him to work harder every day. The 35-year-old said his boxing career picked up last year after he experienced inactivity. Like any other athlete, the Covid-19 pandemic set his career back. But last year was a busy one for the former amateur with three fights under his belt. Chauke scored a ninth round stoppage against Thabang Ramagole to win the national flyweight crown in April last year. “For me, my career has been on a right track. I made my first SA title defence three months after winning it and retained the title with a first round stoppage,” he added.
