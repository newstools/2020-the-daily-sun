ZODWA Wabantu’s ex-boyfriend, Vusi Ngubane and his fiancée Thenjiwe Mpanza opened up about their relationship. The couple met in Durban in May and Vusi had just broken up with Zodwa.  He told Daily Sun: “I’d already broken up with Zodwa and don’t think I wasted her time in anyway. I regret nothing, in fact we should both be grateful it didn’t last. What is more important is that we both found true love in our current partners.”  “I met her at Spar in Florida Road, Durban. I offered to load her groceries into her car. She wasn’t keen, but I insisted and she agreed.  He said he and Thenjiwe have been through hell. ALSO READ:MOSHE AND PHELO’S HAPPY ENDING!  The couple had dated for four months when Vusi popped the question.  He paid lobola last month.  Thenjiwe said Vusi had just come out of a messy relationship when they met.  “I believe our relationship was written in the stars. He came at the right time as I was concentrating on growing my law firm. The proposal came much quicker, but I’d already made up my mind that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him,” said Thenjiwe.
