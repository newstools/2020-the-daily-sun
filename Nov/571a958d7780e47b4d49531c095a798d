IT'S job done for Bafana Bafana as far as this international break is concerned. They have collected six points out six in their back-to-back 2021 Afcon qualifiers against Sao Tome ePrincipe. They got their second win in as many meetings against the Islanders when they thumped them 4-2 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Monday. Bafana had beaten the visitors 2-0 in the first leg played at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. They are now in a strong position in Group C with nine points from four matches. Themba Zwane and Percy Tau were the top perfromers for Bafana as they both bagged a brace. Bafana did not get off to the best start as they went down from a corner kick nodded in by captain Pontes. Zwane equalised for Bafana just before the halftime interval with a calm finish from just inside the box. Tau got into the action as he put Bafana in the lead in the second half. But Sao Tome would not go down with a fight as they clawed their way back through Harramiz Soares. But Bafana were just too strong for the Islanders as Zwane put them back in front with a simple tap in in the 87th minute. Tau wrapped things up a minute later with a lovely finish following a bursting run.
