THE Khoisan have dug a hole at the Union Buildings and buried the names of President Cyril Ramaphosa, ministers and premiers next to their tent. King Khoisan SA, the leader of the group, told Daily Sun they’ve decided to “bury” Ramaphosa and his team because they have failed them. The Khoisan have been staging a protest at the Union Buildings in Tshwane since November 2018. “We still need what belongs to us as the first nation. “The land and its wealth is ours. The land on which we have erected our tents belongs to us,” he said. “Our demands are to be recognised as the first nation of South Africa. “Our language must become official and our ancestral land must be returned to us.” King Khoisan said he was disappointed that Ramaphosa had not bothered to address them. “Nothing will move us. Not even the deadly virus. We use plants like garlic and others found in the Union Buildings gardens to boost our immune system,” he said. “We will move only when the government adheres to our demands and deal with our issues. It’s about implementing the demands given to him.” He said even today there were no resolutions or talks regarding the issues. Meanwhile, he said they were still standing tall even during the Covid-19 pandemic. King Khoisan said police recently took their weed, which they used with another herb to clear their lungs. He advised people to use herbs. “We sorely rely on our indigenous medicines and herbs,” he said. The president’s acting spokesman, Tyrone Seale, said Ramaphosa met the group in 2018 and followed up by several interactions. “Progress has included the enactment of the Traditional and Khoisan Leadership Act, which seeks to transform traditional and Khoisan institutions in line with constitutional concepts such as the Bill of Rights and restore the integrity and legitimacy traditional, and that Khoisan leadership in line with customary law and practices.”
