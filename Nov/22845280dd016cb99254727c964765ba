Orlando Pirates have received a significant boost with the news that last seasonâ€™s top-scorer Gabadinho Mhango has returned to full training after injury. Mhango has not featured since he was replaced at halftime of the 1-1 DStv Premiership draw with Stellenbosch FC on 28 October. His return is welcome news and provides added competition up front for coach Josef Zinnbauer, with forwards Zakhele Lepasa and Tshegofatso Mabasa already among the goals this campaign. Mhango netted 17 goals in all competitions last season and, along with his single strike this campaign, has 18 in 25 starts for Pirates since his arrival from BidVest Wits at the start of the 2019-20 season. Meanwhile, Thembinkosi Lorch is continuing his rehabilitation from injury, but the club has not put a date on his return. Pirates are next in action at home to Baroka FC on Saturday. The club has taken eight points from a possible 12 in the DStv Premiership so far this season. -SuperSport
