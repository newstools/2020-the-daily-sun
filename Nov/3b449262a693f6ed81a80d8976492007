AS DEPUTY Chief Justice Raymond Zondo deliberates on former president Jacob Zuma’s application for him to recuse himself as Zondo Commission chairman, a law expert weighed in on the implications of his decision. Zuma will know on Wednesday, 18 November whether he’s successful in his application for Zondo to recuse himself. In a brief sitting on Tuesday, 17 November, Zondo said he had hoped to deliver the judgment on the day, but needed more time as there were documents he needed to go through carefully. “I’m going to use today (Tuesday) to work on the judgment. So we’re going to resume tomorrow. If I’m not ready for 10am, communication will be sent to all concerned. It might be 11am, but I’ll aim for 10am. I’ve already communicated this to counsel.” Zuma’s lawyer, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, told the commission Zuma had a death in the family and requested to be excused on Wednesday. Zondo granted permission and said he hoped Zuma would be back on Thursday for the proceedings, depending which way his decision would go. Law expert Stephen Tuson said the matter rested on what he called two double reasonability tests, one where a reasonable person would believe Zondo was biased against Zuma. “The second test is facts that Zondo is biased against him, not fanciful things like we were born in the same village. In my opinion there were no grounds for recusal.” Tuson said it could come down to two alternatives for Zuma if the judgment was not in his favour. “Either he takes the stand and exercises his right not to answer questions, or takes the commission to a review.” He said in the unlikelihood of Zondo recusing himself, the commission would have to call witnesses to give fresh evidence before a new chairman, an exercise that would cost even more millions of rands.
