IF you don’t have WhatsApp on your cellphone, you can’t get a job in extension 38, known as Smarties in Mahikeng. This was the concern of a group of angry youth at this RDP settlement. They were concerned that the majority of the people who live in that area did not benefit from the solar installation project in the area. The youth said the Mahikeng Municipality undermined them and treated them like illiterates. They say they will not allow people from outside Mahikeng to benefit from a project that should be benefiting them instead. The municipality has a project where they install solar geysers in two RDP settlements in Mahikeng. Resident Maikutlo Mothibi said it was unfair. “We hear that people were invited for training via WhatsApp. We are not working and having a smartphone is a luxury to us. Why didn’t they use loud hailers to notify interested people so that this can be fair to all of us,” she asked. Another resident, Papi Malefane, said the problem with local municipalities was that they undermined people of the Smarties because the majority are unemployed. “They must not treat us like fools. Yes, we are poor but we are not illiterate and we have skills and are willing to go for training. We want to benefit. The municipality has been deceiving us for a while. This must come to a stop!” he said. Mahikeng municipal spokesman Jonny Nkoane said if the residents continued to disrupt the project like that, they will end up giving those solar to other people. “They cannot hold us to ransom. We can’t allow them to do that. People who are complaining are the ones who wanted to benefit from the project. Where were they when it all started? They must not hold us to ransom or we will give it to other people,” he said. Nkoane said the process of appointing people who were to work at that project was communicated thoroughly, through all communication channels. Nkoane said those complaining were just bitter that they reacted late in seeking for a job in that project.
