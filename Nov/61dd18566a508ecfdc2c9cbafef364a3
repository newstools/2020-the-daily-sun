ONLY two days after three boys died in water-filled trenches, another boy has suffered the same fate. Eight-year-old Tshiamo Hleza from extension 19, Kanana in Hammanskraal, Tshwane drowned on Monday morning after falling into a trench. His sister, Dimakatso Hleza (25), said Tshiamo was sent to the shop before he fell into a trench dug by a housing contractor. She said his friend was trying to get him out after he fell in. A motorist saw them and tried to help. “Tshiamo’s friend was also being over-powered by the water and residents had to save him. When they went to save my little brother, it was already too late.” Aunt Paulinah Maema (47) said there was no warning signs at the trench and think the boys didn’t know it was there. “The people who were responsible for the hole must account for Tshiamo’s death.” She said the construction company must also bury the child, because his parents were unemployed. The boy’s uncle, Phillimon Hleza (49), said Tshiamo was a smart boy. “He wouldn’t have gone there if there was a warning sign. The community needs to stand up and fight constructors who put our children in danger.” City of Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams said he has given instructions that legal action must be taken against the contractor. He said it was found the site didn’t have adequate security and there were no barriers. “I consider this to be negligence on the contractor’s part. It’s clear that the contractor didn’t take the necessary precautions,” he said. “I will also immediately be calling upon the ward councillor, community liaison officer and site managers to explain their responsibilities in relation to the incident and site management.”
