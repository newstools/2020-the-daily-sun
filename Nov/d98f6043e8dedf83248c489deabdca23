The South African Football Association (SAFA) and the Sao Tomean Football Federation have agreed that the home and away 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers between Bafana Bafana and Sao Tome and Principe will be played in South Africa. The first match between the two countries will take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Friday, 13 November (7pm) with the second following on Monday, 16 November (3pm). "The two countries mutually agreed that due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, it was in the best interest of the two that they do everything in their power to safeguard the interest of players and officials. Therefore, both parties agreed that the first and return leg matches will all be played in South Africa," a statement read on the official SAFA website. "The two nations agreed that this historic arrangement that has since been relayed to CAF, was precipitated by flights restriction within the African continent and health dangers posed by the coronavirus pandemic."
