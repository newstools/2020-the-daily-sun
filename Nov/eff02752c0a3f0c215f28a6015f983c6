SINGER and songwriter Dr Tumi has poured cold water on the claims that he is homophobic. This after social media users called out the gospel singer, accusing him of homophobia. They are alleging that the You Are Here hitmaker pulled out of a concert in 2018 after it was announced that Somizi will be the host. Taking to social media, Dr Tumi shared a video of himself denying these allegations. In the lengthy video, the gospel superstar and professional medical doctor said the allegations are a misconception and they are bothering him. “Right from the onset, I just want to let you know that I am not homophobic. I truly have no reason to hate anyone. I don’t hate anyone or discriminate against anyone in spite of their sexual orientation, race or any other thing,” he said.

I want to represent Christ well because Christ loves everybody.” Dr Tumi said on the rumour: “That lie was based on something that was not even true and actually, the people involved know the truth.” He further said he was saddened by it. “I was so saddened by it, seeing a few comments about it today because I don’t like discrimination or when people are treated badly. I don’t believe in that because it is not godly in the first place to hate on anyone.” Dr Tumi said he has addressed this matter before. “I hope this video brings clarity and peace, even though I have said it before on radio interviews about the incident that happened. But I know that information doesn’t get to everyone and some people might really be in the dark about this. Some people don’t even know it at all, but I love everybody.” Part 1/2NoToHomiphobia Thought I should tell you my heart pic.twitter.com/mQlBIpQGdo
