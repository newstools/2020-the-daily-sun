KAIZER Chiefs just can’t seem to get going and pick up momentum in these early stages of the season. Their struggles continued after they were held to a goalless draw by rookies TS Galaxy in their DStv Premiership clash at the FNB Stadium on Wednesday night. Amakhosi, who were looking to restore their pride following a comprehensive 3-0 defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Orlando Pirates at the weekend, were lucky to earn a point. This after Galaxy dominated the Soweto giants for the better part of the match and created the clearer chances, however, they could not convert them. Gavin Hunt's men looked nothing like the team that ran Chippa United ragged in their 1-0 win in the last league match and more like the side that was embarrassed by Pirates at the weekend. Hunt decided to hand the returning Eric Mathoho and Kgotso Moleko starts against Galaxy following their struggles with injury at the beginning of the season. The Rockets coach Dan “Dance” Malesela made just one change from the team that beat AmaZulu last time out with Tshegofatso Nyama preferred to Mokete Mogaila. And it was a change that seemed to work as Nyama and Lindokuhle Mbatha tormented the Chief's fullbacks, eventually earning a penalty for The Rockets. But Galaxy wasted that golden opportunity to pile more misery on Chiefs when striker Wayde Lekay blasted his penalty kick against the woodwork. Chiefs tried to get themselves back into the match in the second half but try as they might, they could not get past the staunch Galaxy defence. They will now turn their focus to the second-leg of the MTN8 against Pirates hoping to overturn their three-goal deficit.The match will take place at the FNB Stadium on Sunday (3pm) Galaxy, on the other hand, will only be back in action on 21 November when they face Swallows FC at Dobsonville Stadium (8.15 pm).
