BANYANA Banyana duo Thembi Kgatlana and Ode Fulutudilu were star performers for their respective teams this weekend. Kgatlana was the match winner for her Spanish side Eibar as they beat Espanyol 1-0 in their Spanish Primera Iberdrola clash at Ciutat Esportiva Dani Jarque on Saturday. It was the 24-year-old’s first start for Eibar since she joined the club a few months ago from Portuguese outfit, SL Benfica. Having scored one goal in three appearances from the bench, Kgatlana was finally handed a start by coach Iker Dorronsoro, which she grabbed with both hands. The 2018 Africa Women’s Footballer of the Year now has two goals to her name in four appearances for her new side and is proving to be a valuable asset for the Spanish outfit. Kgatlana’s Banyana teammate, Fulutudilu, also had a weekend to remember as she played a starring role in her side’s latest victory. Banyana’s Democratic Republic of Congo-born striker has been in fine form for her Finnish side Aland United this season, producing impressive performances to help her side push for the league title. Fulutudilu was on the scoresheet again on Saturday, scoring a brace to help Aland to a 3-0 win over KuPS Kuopio. Aland have returned to the summit of the Finnish Naisten liiga log and will be eager to stay there until the end of season. Fulutudilu will be expected to continue playing a crucial role if Aland are to win the title. She will be hoping to add to her seven goals in 15 appearances this season, 14 of which have been starts. Aland face FC Honka in their last match of the season on Sunday, hoping to hang on to top spot and clinch the title. They need to win the match and hope that rivals TiPS slip up or do not better their result as the two sides are only separated by goal difference at the top of the standings.
