IF there is an African football federation president who
must be happy today then it must be Safa's Danny Jordaan, following his
national teams' success lately. Despite having lost 1-0 to Zambia in their final Cosafa
Under-17 Group match in Port Elizabeth on Thursday, Amajimbos have achieved
their goal of going through to the Under-17 Cup of Nations finals, which serves
as World Cup qualifier. South Africa will now face Zambia again on Sunday for theÂ  Cosafa Under-17 title. "Congratulations, the first objective to qualify for
U-17 Afcon has been achieved. Now for Caf Afcon qualifiers for Fifa World Cup
in Morrocco," Jordaan said on Thursday. "Well done to head coach, players, the entire technical
team and head of delegation. "Qualification for Afcon in Morrocco serves as
qualification for Fifa World Cup." He was further happy that the women's side are also a match
away from qualification to the Fifa World Cup too. The South African U-20 Women side, Basetsana, are three
steps away from qualification to the Fifa World Cup, a feat they must be proud
of. The Olympic team, under David Notoane, qualified to the 2021 Tokyo Olympics Olympics. "Well done to them all," he said from Cairo in
Egypt. Banyana Banyana, who've won Cosafa Cup four takes on the
trot, will start their Afcon qualifiers next year while Molefi Ntseki's Bafana
Bafana are second on Group C log, which is a qualification position for Afcon
in Cameroon.
