MATRICS said they enjoyed writing their first business studies paper yesterday and couldn’t wait for the second one. Speaking to Daily Sun, grade 12 pupils at Masedibu High School in Zone 2 Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo, said the paper was easy. Koketso Mmalodi (19) said he enjoyed it. “The paper was good, compared to the one we wrote during trial exams. I’m hoping to get 80% because I practised a lot.” Kgethego Nkadimeng (18) said she would go over her work and then write and mark the test to check how much she remembered. “The paper was fair and I enjoyed writing sections A and B, “ she said. “I believe I passed and can’t wait to write the next paper. “I just wish all the papers were as good as this one because then most of us would pass with flying colours.”
