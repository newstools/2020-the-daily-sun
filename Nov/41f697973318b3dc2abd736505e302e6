THE Molepos are heartbroken and shocked after David Molepo (52) was murdered in a village near their home. David’s sister, Elizabeth Molepo (43) from Klipgat in the North West, said last Monday a resident called her looking for him. Later, she received a call from a family member who was asking where he was. “She told me she heard people saying he’d been shot at a tavern,” she said. She said police came to the house and told them when they got to the scene they found a woman who claimed she found her brother there and he’d been killed. She said the body was taken to the mortuary without informing the family. “The police were told where my brother stayed and they didn’t call the family,” said Elizabeth. She said they don’t know what happened that night and were heartbroken. “How are we going to get closure if we have no idea how my brother died, where he died or the reason for his death?” She said they want to know the truth. “My brother didn’t deserve to die. Whoever was responsible for his death must be arrested,” she said. Police confirmed that a murder case was opened. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said the man was with his girlfriend when three armed men approached them and robbed them of their cellphones. “The man tried to fight them, and they allegedly shot him and ran into the bushes,” she said. She said no arrests were made and the investigation continues.
