COURIER company Pharmacy Direct has been made to pay back the money. This after they claimed unemployment insurance funds using details of employees, but never paid them a cent. The EFF intervened and met CEO Gavie Erasmus yesterday in Centurion, Tshwane, to discuss the matter and other issues the staff complained about. EFF leader Julius Malema said: “It’s a very simple message. Anyone who took workers money have two options – pay it to the workers or back to the Department of Labour. No one is going to enrich themselves using workers money.” Malema also issued a disclaimer that the party wasn’t a union, but intervened on issues that were of public interest. “It was a very interesting meeting. We’ve agreed with the company that it will pay back the money it received from UIF,” he said. Malema said adding the money to workers’ salaries would be illegal. “The best way is to return it to UIF, so that they don’t get affected in future,” he said. Erasmus, who was caught on camera threatening employees, has since apologised to them. “That’s not how I normally do things. “I think we’ve all been stressed out during this Covid-19 period. I apologise for the way that I may have come across,” he said. “We had a good meeting with the EFF and we got to a very good outcome. We are very happy with the way forward. “We will ensure the company continues to move forward and that people get a decent income from it,” he said. Erasmus said they would manage the relationship between management and staff well, to ensure that it remained healthy.
