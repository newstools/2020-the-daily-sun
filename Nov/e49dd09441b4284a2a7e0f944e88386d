MAMELODI Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana has been nominated for the prestigious 2020 FIFA Puskas Award. Fifa have revealed the nominees for the 2020 edition of The Best Fifa Football Awards ceremony. Kekana’s strike against Cape Town City on 20 August 2019 was among the candidates for the Puskas Award. Kekana is nominated with another 10 best goals for this year’s prize, including former FC Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, ex-France international Andre-Pierre Gignac, Tottenham Hotspur forward Heung-min Son as well as Zlatko Junuzovic of SK Rapid Wien. This is the second time Kekana has been nominated for the coveted award after being nominated IN 2016 with a long-range screamer for Bafana Bafana against Cameroon, but Malaysian Mohd Faiz Subri got the nod. The following year, 2017 Baroka FC goalkeeper became the first South Africa to be in the top three of the Puskas for his last-gasp equaliser with a bicycle kick against Orlando Pirates. Masuluke missed out on the award for best goal of the year to Arsenal and French forward Olivier Giroud.
