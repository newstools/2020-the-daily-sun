KE SUMMER and the heat wave has hit our South African shores. The scorching sun brings with it a variety of things, including headaches. Heat-induced headaches can also be caused by dehydration. When you’re exposed to higher temperatures, your body needs more water to make up for what’s being lost as your body sweats. Dehydration can trigger both a headache and a migraine. Doctors agree that painkillers may be the solution, but the addiction and side effects that come with painkillers can be dangerous. Here are some natural ways of getting rid of that pounding headache: 1. Sex According to medical journal Cephalalgia, sexual activity relieved the pain of migraines or cluster headaches. 2. Cannabis Weed fans may jump up for joy when they read this. Inhaled cannabis reduces self-reported headache severity by 47,3% and migraine severity by 49,6%, according to a recent study. 3. Cold water Grabbing a good old-fashioned cold glass of water can help as much as an electrolyte-containing beverage such as Pedialyte, Gatorade or Powerade. 4. Herbal tea The warmth and comfort of a steaming cup of herbal tea makes it an excellent way to wind down at night. Those same soothing qualities can have pain-relieving effects.
