MARITZBURG UNITED defender, Rushine de Reuck, is frustrated! He is worried that things are not coming together for the team. De Reuck is asking himself what else needs to be done to get the ball in the back of the net and pick up points. He says they’re playing well. But de Reuck hopes things will change for the better when they face fellow strugglers Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium in their DStv Premiership showdown tomorrow (3.30pm). Both teams have yet to pick up a point in their three league matches played to date. But things are worse for Lidoda Duvha. Not only are they at the bottom of the table, they recently parted ways with coach Patrick Aussems. De Reuck, who was recently rewarded with a Bafana Bafana call-up for the two Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifying wins over Sao Tome and Principe, said the players share the pain of not having won in the last 10 games. “It’s not me but there’re many other players who’ve spoken about this because they went through the same thing (at the start of last season) with the team,” said De Reuck. “We need to work through it and it’s difficult. We also need to keep pushing because the table will turn, for sure.” With Aussems sacked, the axe is now hovering over United coach Eric Tinkler. The beleaguered coach knows if they don’t get a win tomorrow, the pressure will keep piling on him. Tinkler, who will be without Riyaaz Ismail and Sibusiso Hlubi who are serving a ban, admitted before the international break that the team’s morale has taken a knock. Getting the win against Leopards will boost the his team’s confidence, he said. “We’re looking forward to trying to get back to winning ways, so we need to try and go there and win,” said Tinkler.
