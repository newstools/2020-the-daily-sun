Kaizer Chiefs forward Khama Billiat has spoken about the importance of Amakhosi being back in African competition. Chiefs landed Douala, Cameroon on Saturday afternoon. They will face, PWD Bamenda on Sunday in the first leg of the preliminary round of the CAF Champions League competition. Amakhosi will be eager to return to Mzansi with something to boost their morale as they have not been perming in the Dstv Premiership since the season started.Billiat, who is not new in the CAF Champions League, having won it during his time at Mamelodi Sundowns, is looking forward to the competition and wants Amakhosi to continue challenging themselves.“I have played in the Champions League before with a couple of the guys and the team has played in it before, I think it is nothing new," Billiat said. "It is just that the way we are going to approach each and every game is very important. "Every result, it has to have a meaning behind it and we have a good team and I feel like we need to go out there and challenge in Africa and take this team back where it belongs, and I think it starts now and we needed this, we needed to test ourselves with big teams out there." Chiefs will be returning to the African stage for the first time in four years.
