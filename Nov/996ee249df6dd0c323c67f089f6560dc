Former Banyana Banyana stars have paid tribute to deceased teammate Makhosi Luthuli who succumbed after a long battle with cancer. She was 46-year-old. Luthuli died in hospital in Scottburgh in KwaZulu Natal on Monday afternoon. She had lived with a large cancerous growth on her face since 2011 which doctors had diagnosed as Adenocarcinoma, a form of glandular cancer. Luthuli underwent a successful operation to remove the growth two years ago. The former Banyana star, who played with the likes of current coach Desiree Ellis, Portia Modise and more, lost her battle with cancer having put a brave fight for over seven years. Several former Banyana stars have paid tribute to the stalwart on social media. "One of our own has fallen," said Amanda Dlamini on Twitter. "Former Banyana Banyana stalwart Makhosi Luthuli had been fighting cancer for more than 7yrs. "You were always so positive and never showed any fear. Your story of bravery and courage on and off the field will live in our hearts forever."
