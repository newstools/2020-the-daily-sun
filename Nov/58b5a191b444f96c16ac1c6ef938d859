IT'S just a matter of time before Maritzburg United chairman, Farook Kadodia, wields the axe. Having gone 10 games with a win, Kadodia might very soon run out of patience with coach Eric Tinkler, like he did with his assistant Vincent Kobola. Kobala was shown the door last week in a dramatic turn of events. Despite having hit Maritzburg United for three, Chippa United's hitman Eva Nga Bievenu has credited their 3-1 win against Eric Tinkler's side to team work.Â "I'm very happy for the three points at home, which bring confidence. I want to say thanks for this opportunity to the coach," said Eva Nga.
