THE Department of Basic Education has been left disappointed after the leakage of Mathematics Paper 2 being written on Monday, 16 November. In a statement released by spokesman Elijah Mhlanga, he said they became aware of the leaked paper early on Monday morning, hours before the paper could be written. He said the source of the leak was not clear yet, but the matrics who had access to the paper seemed to be in Limpopo and Gauteng. “The department verified the content of the paper and found it to be the same as the question paper that was written,” said Mhlanga. He said they were investigating to find the extent of the leak and early sources pointed to the confinement of the leakage to a few pupils in the two provinces. The investigating team was gathering evidence and a report would be submitted shortly. “The department will enlist the support of law enforcement to assist with the investigation,” he said. Mhlanga said the department would investigate this matter fully and use the mechanisms at its disposal, which were part of examination protocol to identify pupils that may have had access to the paper. “An appeal is made to all candidates to remain focused on the examination papers still to be written and be assured the culprits at the centre of this despicable act will be dealt with harshly. Anybody with information regarding this matter must contact the department and anonymity will be guaranteed,” added Mhlanga.
