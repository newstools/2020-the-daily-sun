For the umpteenth time Gavin Hunt has tried to turn Kaizer Chiefs' fortunes around, but he seems to be unable to get it right. The rotation of players with each game could be his weak point as the former Bidvest Wits coach is still struggling to find winning combinations with the players he has in his ensemble. But Chiefs fans must just accept that they're stuck with Hunt until infinity when his contract expires, but whether he would have won them trophies remains a subject for another day. Listen to what Mathews Mpete analyses Chiefs under Hunt, NOT that it was a trap, but it'll take time to heal Amakhosi's open wounds.
