PARENTS are worried the Penny Penny tradition is slowly dying. Penny Penny occurs once a year, when kids ekasi dress up as old people, knock on doors, and dance to collect tips. It was Guy Fawkes Day on 5 November. The annual commemoration happens mostly in Britain. But only a few kids were spotted doing it in Soweto. Some parents even pushed their kids participate, but they refused. Sophie Masilela (38) from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she used to participate in the day’s events until she was 18. “It was fun. Plus, we used to do it in groups, so it brought a spirit of togetherness,” said Sophie, whose kids have never taken part in Penny Penny. “I no longer bother asking them to be part of it. Last week, they were just sitting around the house playing with their iPads.” Gladys Motseki (43), also from Wattville, said she gave her kids two options: either they participate or won’t eat out for two months. “They laughed at me and went for the second option. My 16-year-old daughter told me Penny Penny is out of fashion, plus her boyfriend would dump her. I’ve given up,” said Gladys. “These kids just sit in corners with their fake friends and smoke hubbly bubbly. This makes me wonder what else they do since they don’t even hide when smoking this thing.” Ayanda Mazwi (37) from Naledi in Soweto told Daily Sun she’s only saw two kids participate in Penny Penny ekasi. “I got excited and suggested my kids be part of it,” said Ayanda. “They laughed at me and told me it looks ridiculous and would never do it,” She explained the reason behind it, but they still didn’t buy it. “My son told me he doesn’t want to trend for being a clown.” Ayanda’s son, Liam (14), said his mum explained the story behind Guy Fawkes Day. But he still saw no reason to look funny for a few coins. Said Liam: “My mum does everything for me. I don’t need to do this. “It looks like an extreme sport that will make me a laughing stock. I’d rather do Halloween.”
