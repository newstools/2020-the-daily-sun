Percy Tau is expected to also be sidelined this coming weekend for his Belgian club Anderlecht after a muscle pull meant he missed out in the ‘classico’ against Standard Liege on Sunday. The much anticipated highlight of the Belgian season ended in a boring 0-0 draw with both sides heavily panned for their performance. Tau escaped the criticism and is also expected to be absent for this Saturday’s clash away against Zulte Waregem. Tau, who has four goals for Anderlecht this season, has been a regular for his new club this campaign after his loan move from Brighton and Hove Albion. Last season he won the Belgian league with Club Brugges. -SuperSport
