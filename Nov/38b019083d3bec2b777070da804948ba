I thought I was going to die,” said Wendy. Wendy escaped and ran to the satellite cop shop near the Philippi Train Station and was told to go fetch a mask. She said she was sent away despite being soaked in blood. She had cuts all over her body and stitches to her lips and face. When she asked the police to escort her to a nearby hospital, they also refused to help. Later on Monday, community leader Pam Nodumba took her to open a case. Pam said cops had endangered Wendy’s life. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident: “A case of assault GBH was opened by a 22-year-old woman. She’s encouraged to lodge a complaint with police management or Ipid, so her allegations can be investigated.” “The alleged behaviour by our members will not be tolerated and we will take appropriate action if the allegations can be proven.”
