THEMBA Zwane fears for his life and needs help finding the person who tried to kill him. The 62-year-old from Meadowlands in Soweto told Daily Sun he had been experiencing a number of problems lately, but did not expect an attempt on his life. “I’ve been battling with family problems that left me depressed but now a hitman is also after me,” he said. Themba said on Wednesday, 11 November, he was on his way to work at about 4.30am when the incident took place. “I was walking next to Thembalethu Primary School in zone 10 when a green Mazda without registration numbers stopped,” he said. Themba said he became uneasy and soon after, a black man came out of the car with a firearm in his right hand. “I ran back into the direction I had come from without saying anything. He fired three shots. Two missed me and the third grazed my left buttock,” he said. Themba said he ran to a nearby taxi rank and an unknown taxi driver took him to hospital. He was discharged the next day. “I don’t have any enemies and I don’t understand what I could have done to someone to push them to want to kill me,” he said. Themba said he had been having family problems, leading to his family leaving the house. He said he was now worried about their safety. He said he changed the locks after the incident but on Saturday, 14 November, someone got in and he returned home from work to find strange couches in his living room. “I don’t know if this is a joke or what. When I asked my neighbours if they had seen anything, they said they had not,” said Themba. He said he called some of his family members, but said they knew nothing. “I don’t understand what is happening and I’m scared. I reported the matter to the police and I really hope they follow up,” he said. Meadowlands police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Dikopo confirmed a case of attempted murder was opened. “There are no witnesses. The suspect is unknown and no arrests have been made yet,” she said.
