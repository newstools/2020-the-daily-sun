TAXI operators brought the capital city to a standstill on Wednesday 18 November, leaving commuters across Gauteng stranded. The operators went on a national strike after the National Taxi Association (NTA) and the government bumped heads over Covid-19 relief funds.  Some members blocked roads in a convoy while others marched from the old Putco depot in Marabastad, Tshwane, to the office of Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. Others marched to the Union Buildings. The taxi industry wants the government to fast track the payout of more than R1 billion in relief funds announced by Mbalula in June. They also want the country’s borders to open again.  NTA general secretary Alpheus Mlalazi said the minister failed to recognise the association at the taxi lekgotla held last month. He said other associations were allowed to speak, but NTA wasn’t given a chance.  The operators said they lost taxis because they couldn’t pay their monthly instalments. Taxi owner Themba Mtshali said the government had disrespected them. “They told us we should sanitise and ensure people wore masks and observed social distancing. We did all that, but got a slap in the face in return,” he said. Deputy transport minister Dikeledi Magadzi was booed by NTA members when she asked them to observe social distancing and sanitise their hands. She was also booed when she accepted the memorandum of demands.
