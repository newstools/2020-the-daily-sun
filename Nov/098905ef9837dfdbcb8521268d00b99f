RISE Against Hunger partnered with Tastic Rice to pamper the early childhood development centre, Mother’s Love in Diepsloot, north of Joburg. Tastic served a variety of rice dishes inspired by the recipes of businesswoman Basetsana Kumalo, media personality Somizi Mhlongo-Motaung and Former Miss South Africa, Rolene Strauss. Rise Against Hunger South Africa CEO Ntokozo Mbambo told Daily Sun the campaign was aimed at inspiring people to give to the needy and show their own spirit of ubuntu. “It was a beautiful day, filled with the sounds of laughter and wide smiles from the children at Mother’s Love,” she said. Ntokozo said it was important to spread love and generosity during the pandemic. Rise Against Hunger Africa CEO Brian Nell said their campaign was supporting more than 70 000 kids and over 30 000 families. “The majority of our beneficiaries are children between the ages of one and six. These developmental years are critical for a child. “We distribute meals through early childhood development centres. “We work with unregistered centres and help them become compliant with the necessary registration,” said Nell. He said they’ve distributed more than 6,4 million meals across all nine provinces since lockdown started. “We’ve been engaging with other NGOs and disaster relief organisations to ensure we reach the most vulnerable. “We’ve built meaningful partnerships and hope to continue working with these partners as we continue to battle hunger in Mzansi,” Nell added. Thembi Sehloho, marketing director for rice and pasta at Tiger Brands, said: “As a brand with generosity at its core, it comes naturally for Tastic to give back in this manner and sustainably make a difference to improve the lives of communities around the country by nurturing young minds through nutritious food,” said Sehloho.
