Salute officer. A female officer has accepted the John Vuli gate challenge which has taken the country by storm. Mzansi has been dancing to John Vuli gate song by Mapara A Jazz since October. But the video stood out for many who were pleased to see a sexy cop in full uniform jiving next to a police van. Some people are happy to see a cop so joyful, some think she should invest her time in catching criminals. Mampho Mokoena said besides the fact that this video looks wrong, she's sending the wrong message to people. "We don't have a problem with her having fun but that's the police uniform. I don't think this is allowed, it's annoying," said Mampho.  Khehla Ngcobo said this is the only thing most police are good at. "They will invest their time in things that won't take them anywhere. It's the disrespect that shocks me. We shouldn't be seeing such. There's a lot we're dealing with as a country," said Khehla. Teddy George said the cop looks great but hopes she's this good even when she's on duty. "We love seeing this side of police but we hope she's closing that van with suspects inside," said Teddy. Another happy person, Boitshepo Mogohu said everyone deserves to be happy and have a pleasure of doing whatever their hearts desire. "I don't understand all these negative opinions, if you don't want to participate in such them don't but stay away from rubbishing things that have got nothing to do with you" said Boitshepo.
