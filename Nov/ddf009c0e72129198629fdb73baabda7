WHEN a player is going through difficult times, as a coach you don’t turn your back on him. That is what Bafana Bafana mentor Molefi Ntseki did to off-form Kaizer Chiefs forward Lebogang Manyama. Manyama surprisingly started in both Bafana’s recent Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier wins over Sao Tome and Principe. He struggled with confidence in the 2-0 win in Durban and was given another start in Port Elizabeth on Monday, which Bafana won 4-2, and Manyama was again wasteful in front of goals. Ntseki decided to haul him off and replaced him with Kermit Erasmus in the 69th minute. While the score locked at 2-2, Ntseki was looking for someone to affect the game and Erasmus did just that. With Erasmus’ instant impact, it left many people wondering why Manyama started in the first place. However, Ntseki, looking at the bigger picture of next year, with the Afcon qualifiers ending in March and 2022 World Cup qualifiers resuming in June, he said Manyama needs support to get over this phase. “If someone’s confidence is a bit low, you are there to help the player,” said Ntseki “You are not there to punish. If a player makes a mistake then you become punitive, it means you have lost that player. We felt whoever we brought to the camp, that player needed our support.” At Chiefs, Manyama was given the captain’s armband by coach Gavin Hunt in the last few matches and that had added more responsibility on his shoulders. Ntseki hopes that Manyama, having played in these two Afcon matches, will help him get his form back. “You always want to see Manyama score goals,” said Ntseki. “These are the type of players we need because playing with the right attitude, playing with confidence, having a tactical understanding, they’ll do the job for you. “He’s got the ability to get into goal scoring positions. But we don’t question his ability, we don’t question his attitude, especially when he’s wearing the national team jersey.”
