Stellenbosch could hand a debut to Nigerian striker Stanley Dimgba in their DStv Premiership clash at home to Chippa United on Saturday after confirming the player has received his work permit. The forward arrived from Enyimba last week, but has swiftly sorted out his paperwork and will add experience to a forward line that has managed just two goals in three games so far this campaign. Stellies also confirmed that their other two recent arrivals, experienced former Bidvest wits midfielder Phathutshedzo Nange and teenage centre-back Mswati Mavuso, are also fit and available for action. Meanwhile, Argentine midfielder Junior Mendieta and ex-Wits midfielder Solly Khunyedi could be set for their first starts after coming off the bench in the 1-0 loss at SuperSport United last time out.
