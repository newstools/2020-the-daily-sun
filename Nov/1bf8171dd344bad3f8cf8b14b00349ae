THEY finally have electricity after more than 20 years! Luyolo Zanazo (45), a resident of Shukushukuma squatter camp in Mfuleni, Cape Town, said they never thought this day would come. “We’re so happy! People were getting tired of us. We’d often offer to pay them if they connected us illegally.” Another resident said they’d save money because the izinyoka who connected them charged more. “Sometimes electricity would go off while we were cooking,” said the resident. “And when we asked them to come fix it they’d say the electricity was finished.” The electrification project started in August. City of Cape Town energy MMC, Councillor Phindile Maxiti, was pleased with progress made in Shukushukuma. “The project immediately improves living conditions and opens new doors for education,” said Maxiti. “Pupils no longer have to do schoolwork by candle or lamplight.” The city had spent about R600 000 connecting to the grid 200 residents from 67 households. Maxiti told Daily Sun: “We thank the project teams for their hard work and dedication in helping us provide electricity to homes in city-supplied areas and on city-owned land. “Almost all informal settlements in the Metro have been connected to electricity, where it’s possible to do so.”
