POLICE in Tshwane came out in large numbers as part of Operation Okae Molao as the festive season approaches. Tshwane district police commissioner Major-General Hilda Mohajane was leading the operation in Olievenhoutbosch and Wierdabrug, Tshwane. According to Mohajane, the police have started the festive operations. She also gave tips to motorists and said they should not stop in dangerous places. “In residential areas people must look out if they are not being followed by thugs before opening their gate,” she said To liquor outlets, she said owners must ensure that they comply with the Liquor Act and Disaster Management Act.  “We will be checking whether people are sanitising, there is social distancing and the wearing of masks,” she said. Mohajane said they were experiencing some challenges when they got to liquor outlets as there would be a lot of people not adhering to social distancing and wearing of masks. She said police will be in full force monitoring crime and gender-based violence. Mohajane said they will deal with those who try to bribe police officers. She said in Olievenhoutbosch, police closed four shebeens, while two suspects were arrested for possession of dagga, and one vehicle was scraped. Mohajane said the police conducted roadblocks to check motorists driving under the influence of alcohol, stolen vehicles and unroadworthy vehicles.
