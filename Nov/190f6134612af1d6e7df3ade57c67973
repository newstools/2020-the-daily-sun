THE Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders is furious that initiation practices will remain suspended under lockdown level 1. Chairman Nkosi Langa Mavuso claimed they were never consulted before the announcement. He said they were still optimistic government will withdraw the decision. He said the deputy minister jumped the gun by taking this drastic action. Mavuso said they were not forcing everyone to undergo this rite of passage. “We’re saying those who’re ready to go must be allowed to do so,” he said. Ingcibi Mlondolozi Mkono was surprised by Cogta’s decision. “We were already prepared for December,’ he said. “I was already buying PPEs for the resumption of initiation school.” KILLER WOMEN SRIKE AGAIN! Mvusiwekhaya Scwetsha of the Eastern Cape premier’s office said they noted the announcement by traditional leaders, who said they’d proceed with ulwaluko. “We wish to inform and remind all the people that anyone embarking on ulwaluko while it’s still suspended will be embarking on an illegal action. “We’ll continue to close down illegal structures set up for ulwaluko, and those responsible for breaking the law will be prosecuted. “Government is looking into the matter and a decision will be communicated.” Eastern Cape Contralesa secretary Mkhanyiseli Dudumayo said: “We want President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire Deputy-Minister Obed Bapela.” Deputy Minister Bapela said earlier this week the country had to prevent exposure of initiates to dangerous conditions. “We’re urged to do more to contribute to the fight against Covid-19 and to protect initiates from exposure to this unrelenting brutal virus,” he said. “Government will not tolerate bogus initiation schools.” He said those caught running illegal initiation schools will face the full might of the law.
