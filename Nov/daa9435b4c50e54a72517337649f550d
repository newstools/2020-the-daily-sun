A SUSPECT is behind bars for allegedly robbing a cash-in-transit van. According to Colonel Brenda Muridili, eight firearms and four vehicles were recovered in separate incidents. Muridili said the immediate implementation of the 72-hour activation plan to mobilise relevant resources following two cash-in-transit robberies on Tuesday, 24 November in Gauteng has resulted in the arrest of one suspect, the recovery of seven rifles and one handgun as well as four vehicles. Muridili said this morning an attempted CIT robbery was reported to have taken place in Dobsonville, at Elisa Motsoaledi and Braamfischer roads. “A security cash van was allegedly shot at by unknown suspects. The security officers retaliated,” said Muridili. She further stated that a police vehicle in the vicinity sustained bullet holes, but no member was injured while a community member, a woman in her mid-20s, sustained a gunshot wound on her hand during the crossfire. “She was taken to hospital for medical attention. No money was taken. The police arrested one suspect and recovered six rifles and ammunition as well as three vehicles,” said Muridili. The suspect will be appearing in court soon.  In a separate incident, later in the day at about 11am, police responded to a CIT robbery that occurred in Westonaria on Edward Street. “A security officer had just collected cash from a store when he was shot at by an unknown suspect who grabbed the money bag from the security officer and fled the scene on foot,” said Muridili.     She said the police recovered a handgun with ammunition and a vehicle with a rifle with ammunition a few metres away from the scene of the crime. She emphasised that cash-in-transit robberies are a priority to the police.  “We are appealing to anyone with information on the whereabouts of the other suspects to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or to send tip-offs via the MySAPS App,” said Muridili.
