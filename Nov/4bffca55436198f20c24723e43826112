BANYANA Banyana will take some stopping in this year’s Cosafa Women’s Championship, it appears. The defending champions issued out another strong statement by thumping Comoros 7-0 in their final group game played at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Sibulele Holweni was the star of the show as she netted four goals to help her side to another emphatic victory over the Islanders. Banyana, who are one of the favourites to win the tournament, sent out a strong statement to their next opponents as they finished top of Group A. They managed to get nine points from their three matches, scoring 15 goals and conceding none. Banyana, who have won the last three editions of this tournament, are now a step closer to clinching their fourth. They made their intentions clear as they made light work of Comoros, a side that they had walloped 17-0 in their last meeting. Holweni got Banyana off to the perfect start as she found the back of the net as early as the 8th minute. The 19-year old was not done there as she grabbed her second goal in the 30th minute before Hildah Magaia got into the action as she scored Banyana’s third. Desiree Ellis’ charges were even more ruthless in the second half, scoring as early as the 48th minute through the impressive Holweni who grabbed her hat trick. Nomvula Kgoale was next to get on the scoresheet with a stunning free-kick. However, no one could outshine Holweni on the day as she scored her fourth and fifth goal in the match. Comoros could not bother Kaylin Swart in the Banyana goal as they kept their third straight clean sheet. Banyana will now turn their attention to the semi-final where they will face the winners of Group C.
