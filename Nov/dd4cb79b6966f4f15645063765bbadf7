THEIR mum was allegedly killed by their dad with a hammer. Now the family is struggling to cope. Her 25-year-old daughter said she had visions of her mum wearing the clothes she was buried in. “I try to reach out to her, but she moves backwards and will not say anything,” she said. The dead woman’s daughter from Soshanguve block TT, Tshwane, told Daily Sun her mum was killed on 31 August in front of her 12-year-old sister. She said her dad handed himself over to the police. “My younger sister is still traumatised, even though she’s is going through counselling. “My mum’s death has even affected her schoolwork.” She said her dad was released on R3 000 bail on 15 September and will be back in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court today. “The law has failed us. My sister lives in fear that our dad will kill her. We want justice and for our dad to rot in jail as he doesn’t deserve to live freely,” she said. The first-year office administration student said her mum’s death affected her studies too. “I was writing exams in October when I saw my mum’s reflection on the question paper. I cried for almost 20 minutes. I’m heartbroken,” she said. “I hate my dad and will not forgive him for killing my mum.” She said her dad allegedly abused their mum in front of them. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “A murder case was opened and a suspect was arrested and appeared in court. “He will be back in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court on Friday, 6 November.”
