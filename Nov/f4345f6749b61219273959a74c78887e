NEW GladAfrica Championship side Bizana Pondo Chiefs will play their home games in Durban at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium. The newbies’ management said this is a result of not having a suitable stadium in the Umtata region in the Eastern Cape. The Mount Ayliff Stadium, used by the club last season in the ABC Motsepe League for home games, was ruled out as it didn’t meet the PSL requirements. The club then approached the Ethekwini municipality who agreed to accommodate Bizana to play their home games in Umlazi. The club believes relocating to Durban will not be an issue because the drive from Bizana to Durban is only two hours. The club said it will be easy for fans, whenever they will be allowed back to the stadiums, will not have problems to support the club in Umlazi. Matches have been played behind doors following the Covid-19 pandemic that forced the suspension of football worldwide in March. “The problem is Umtata Stadium was vandalised a long time ago and in our region, we don’t have a stadium. We looked at Matatiele and same thing no venue met the PSL standards. We had no option but to look for an alternative and then King Zwelithini Stadium came up tops,” explained Bizana general manager Loyiso Jongela. However, the club hopes to play the first round only in Durban and the second half at the Umtata Stadium but that will depend on the stadium getting the necessary refurbishment. “We are busy engaging with our municipality to fix Umtata Stadium to meet the PSL’s requirements because we want to play the second round there,”  revealed Jongela. Bizana do not have a game this weekend when the 2020-21 Championship season kicks off. They were given time to sort out their internal issues required by the PSL along with other newcomers, Pretoria Callies, after the conclusion of the GladAfrica Champions play-offs a few weeks ago. Bizana’s first game of the season will be against the University of Pretoria on 5 December at Tuks Stadium.
