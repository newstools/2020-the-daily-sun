IT LOOKS bigger, bolder, and aggressive. Yes, it’s the Nissan Navara I’m talking about – don’t get any ideas. At first glance you’d think it’s an American pick-up truck. The newly introduced PRO-4X looks like a perfect beast to rival the Ford Ranger Raptor, Toyota Hilux, the upcoming Volkswagen Amarok which will be based on the Ranger, the new Isuzu D-Max, and the Mazda BT-50. The facelifted Navara seems like Nissan is implementing the Titan Warrior design language, as it has become rugged, bolder, and more exciting with a host of new upgrades to both design and technology. The Navara’s front fascia has been renewed to be unique and easily recognisable, with the new “interlock” grille. The new grille was first introduced in the latest Nissan Titan, making it look bold and beastly. On the sides it has become thicker and vertical in shape. It also comes with new high-tech C-shaped quad-LED projector headlamps, increasing brightness and adding a level of sophistication to the rugged design.   “For the first time in history, the full model line-up of the next generation Navara will be produced on home soil, made in Africa for Africans,” said Nissan South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa managing director, Shinkichi Izumi.  Izumi said he is proud to bring this amazing pick-up to the plant in Rosslyn. “With this major R3 billion investment, Nissan is continuing to actively pursue the Nissan NEXT transformation plan in Africa, and this vehicle embodies our passion for excellence and our commitment to bring the very best products to our customers,” he said.
