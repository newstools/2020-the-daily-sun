FORMER Orlando Pirates winger Thabo Rakhale has found himself a new home. Rakhale has been a free agent ever since he parted ways with Chippa United before the bio-bubble finished during the 2019/20 season. He was previously linked with a switch to Kaizer Chiefs but their transfer ban imposed by Fifa pretty much poured cold water to those rumours. Instead, the 30-year-old has put pen to paper for DStv rookies Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Rakhale confirmed to SunSport that he has indeed joined the Limpopo side. He will be hoping to help his new side improve their start to the season which has seen them pick up just two points from their three matches so far.
