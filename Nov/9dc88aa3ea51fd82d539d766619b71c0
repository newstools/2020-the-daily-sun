SAFA president Danny Jordaan has praised the association’s Vision 2022. But he has also admitted the much-touted vision has not entirely achieved its objectives. It was back in 2014 when the new Safa leadership unveiled the grand masterplan to take the senior national team back to the top. The Vision 2022 was touted as a fundamental rebuilding of the structures of Safa at all levels to create the conditions that will bring about the sustained international success for the national teams. Its long-term development plan is to achieve the goal of always being in the top three in Africa, and in the top 20 in the world rankings. But as far as Bafana Bafana are concerned, the goal has not been entirely achieved as they have only qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals, and could not make it to the 2018 Fifa World Cup. Their world ranking has dropped from 56 to 72, and they remain in 13th spot on the continent. “When we introduced Vision 2022 in 2014 we had just ended the worst period in SA football history. “Bafana Bafana were ranked 86th at that point,” said Jordaan. “We set the bar to change the fortunes of Bafana by actually focusing on the juniors, U-17, U-20 and U-23s must qualify for major competitions, so that we can have a Bafana team with these products of 50, 50, 70 caps before they come to Bafana. “Over that period we’ve gone to the U-17 World Cup, the U-20 World Cup finals twice, and have qualified for two consecutive Olympics. “However, the breakthrough of those players into Bafana is not at the pace we would like.” In fairness, progress has been made in various junior structures, including the women’s team, as we as the development of coaches is concerned. But the judgement of the Vision 2020 will always come down to the success of the senior national teams, mainly Bafana.
