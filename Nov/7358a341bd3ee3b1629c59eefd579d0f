I TAKING the stand at the South Gauteng High Court, Matshidiso Mkhwanazi spoke about her last moments with her friend Palesa Madiba. Tshidi told the court she was getting ready for work on 12 August 2013 while Palesa was in her pyjamas, making the bed. Palesa had spent the weekend at the Mkhwanazi home in Phiri, Soweto. Tshidi lives with her gogo Thandiwe, mother of the accused Dumisani Mkhwanazi. Dumisani is accused of killing Palesa and burying her body in a shallow grave behind the back rooms at his home. Detailing what happened that morning, Tshidi said her gogo got up first and left the house at about 6.30am. “Palesa was awake, but in her pyjamas. I was getting dressed and getting ready while we were talking.” She said when she left she told Palesa where to put the house keys on her way out. “She knew the spot where we put the keys in the garden. “Palesa would then leave at about 9am to attend classes at the UJ Soweto campus.” The prosecutor asked if there was any contact between the two of them after Tshidi had left for work. “I called her at about 9am, but her phone was on voicemail,” said Tshidi. She said when she left the house, Palesa had her purple Blackberry phone with her. When she couldn’t reach her, she thought maybe it was because of a network problem. Said Tshidi: “I called her throughout the day. I wasn’t able to reach her. I found that strange.” Tshidi said when she returned from work she told her gogo she couldn’t reach Palsea on the phone. She found out through her gogo that her uncle Dumisani had not gone to work on the day Palesa went missing. When she couldn’t find Palesa, Tshidi said, she and her gogo went to her family to find out where she was. They later went to the police station to open a missing persons case.
