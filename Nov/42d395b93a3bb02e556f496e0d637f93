POINTING a gun at a 13-year-old boy was only the beginning of the family’s ordeal. On Sunday, the suspect allegedly told the boy to go and buy bread for him, but the frightened boy ran to his home to tell his 37-year-old stepdad what had happened. The next day, the suspect went to the boy’s home in Mayfield, Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, allegedly to apologise. But an argument broke out. Instead, he shot the father four times in full view of the boy. The suspect then walked away, got into his car and disappeared. Police are now looking for him. The boy’s stepmum said his dad had sent him to buy Russian sausages. But the boy met the suspect. “The boy tried to explain that he had been sent somewhere, but the suspect shoved a R100 note in his hand and threatened him with a gun,” she said. She said the boy took the R100 note and told the suspect he wasn’t going to buy bread. One of the boy’s cousins later returned the cash and they thought it was over. Then the shooting followed. “We’ll get revenge somehow,” she said. Sergeant Rider Ubisi of Putfontein police said the 37-year-old man was at his house when two men came into the yard on Sunday. An argument ensued between the boy’s stepdad and the suspect on Monday. “We’re told the suspect started assaulting the victim before he left,” said Ubisi. He said the suspect came back minutes later. He took a firearm out of a bag and shot the boy’s dad four times. The victim was certified dead on the scene by paramedics. The dead man had wounds on the upper body and the head. Four empty cartridges were found at the scene. Ubisi said the suspect has not been bust and cops are looking for him.
