SECURITY guards working for Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi are unhappy about the way he allegedly treats them. More than 30 guards gathered outside his office at Cape Town Station on Monday to show their displeasure. They claimedtheir boss, the owner of Chippa United Football Club, owed them. The workers claimed they were owed wages for one and a half months and had been forced to borrow money to get to work. Fundiswa Sivovo (37) claimed their boss had not been fair to them. “We rent our homes and now it’s a new month and we didn’t even get pay last month. “Landlords want their money and we need to take care of our families,” he said. Sekelelwa Kuka (41) said she had been working for Chippa for seven years. “We love our jobs, but the problem is we have to push our bosses to get paid,” she claimed. Sekelelwa said they didn’t care how their boss spent his money, but he needed to remember charity began at home.  Earlier this year, workers spent weeks occupying Chippa’s offices after going months without salaries. Company manager Themba Yawa said the workers were paid on Monday. But Sekelelwa claimed they only got half their pay. Sekelelwa claimed getting paid had always been a struggle. “We don’t have a fixed day we get paid. The employer pays us whatever amount, whenever he feels like it. “I have two kids and I don’t know if I’ll have money to buy them something for Christmas” Yawa said: “ As service providers within Prasa we have endured periods of non-payment of our invoices, resulting in cash flow issues, but we had an agreement with our employees with the outstanding owed salaries paid yesterday, and they resumed their duties today
