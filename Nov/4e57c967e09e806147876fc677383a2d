ISAAC Marakalla thanks God he wasn’t home on Saturday. This is because lightning struck a big palm tree in his yard. He said he almost lost his two-bedroom shack and thanked his neighbours who fought the fire in the rain. The 45-year-old from Phomolong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he suspected someone bewitched him as lightning normally didn’t strike people’s homes. He said although he didn’t have enemies, there were jealous people out there. “I liked that tree. Maybe people are jealous of my beautiful big palm tree. The tree protected my shack from strong winds,” he said. “I need strong prayers to remove evil spirits from my home.” Isaac said the tree was damaged and would have to be cut down. The father of four kids said the incident reminded him of the time he was shot in the stomach in 2017. He said he still didn’t know who shot him until this day. His neighbour, Phineas Mashabela (42), said it took them almost 30 minutes to kill the fire. “There was a powerful thunderstorm and lightning hit my neighbour’s home. “I opened the door to check what was happening and saw a fire on the tree. I screamed for help,” he said. Phineas said he suspected evil people were fighting his neighbour. Sangoma Majoko Hlongwane said: “Isaac should consult a sangoma to cleanse his home. If that’s not done, lightning will strike again.” Deputy chief staff officer at Tshwane Emergency Services, Roland Hendricks, said: “I received confirmation that we were not contacted about this incident. None of our resources responded.”
