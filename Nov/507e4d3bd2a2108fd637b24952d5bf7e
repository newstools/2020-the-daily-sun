MUSICIAN Shawn Payne has released a new single, Ndibona Wena, featuring Mlindo The Vocalist. This is a great move for the youngster who gained prominence back in 2015 with his track Bum Dance. Speaking to SunBuzz, Shawn said: “Ndibona Wena is a vibey summer song that I’m hoping becomes an anthem for this summer. “It’s about appreciating the beauty of an African woman and a man expressing that he only has eyes for one woman.” The 28-year-old musician said he challenged himself a lot with this song. “I love to challenge myself by doing different sounds, so when I heard the beat I stepped up to it. “The beat is an Afrobeats/Naija side of things, but my aim was to find a way to bring it home to the South African market. Hence the use of different South African languages on the song,” he said. The Mpumalanga-born star said he’s grateful to have worked with Mlindo. “Although, I never got the chance to be in studio with him, technology played its part and allowed us to collaborate on the song. “The fact that I can say I have a song with Mlindo is enough for me. “It’s also an honour because I have been a fan of his since he started in the music scene. I am extremely grateful for that,” he said. Shawn also said he’s not in a rush to release a full project. “I am working on singles and building a solid brand. I don’t want to rush into making an album. “The time for that will come. For now, you can expect more music from me,” he said. Although he has achieved a lot, Shawn Panye said that he doesn’t think he has received his big break yet. “I wouldn’t say I’m at my big break yet, I believe there’s still a lot more that I have to do before reaching that point. “But the journey thus far has honestly been painful, but also amazing,” he said.
