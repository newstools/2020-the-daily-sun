FORMER SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni continued to refuse to answer questions in her second day at the Zondo Commission today. Evidence leader, Kate Hofmeyr, asked her about the letter written by six of 10 board members to former public enterprises minister Malusi Gigaba. In the letter, in which she was copied, they accused her of gross management at the broke airline. The basis of their complaints was that Myeni changed board resolutions without their consent. Myeni responded: “Chair, may I not answer the question just in case I incriminate myself.” Hofmeyr read out Myeni’s answer in an email responding to the board members and she said the allegations were a “whitchunt” and meant to “demean her”. Asked to elaborate on her email response, Myeni refused for fear of incriminating herself. She took issue with being asked if she knew the roles of a chairperson and a CEO. “I have hired CEOs. I cannot be asked at my level if I know the role of a chairperson and of a CEO,” she said.
