MOTORISTS on the N1 North Freeway going towards Polokwane in Tshwane were traumatised when an unknown man hanged himself in full view of the public. Gauteng Traffic Police said the man committed suicide on Tuesday, 17 November. Spokesman Sello Maremane said it happened between Petroport Garage and Wallmansthal Bridge, and the circumstances surrounding the incident were still unknown at this stage, while police investigations were underway. He urged road users to use alternative roads and to take the Sefako Makgatho Drive offramp, or use the old Warmbaths Road instead of the N1. He said the scene had not yet been cleared, with only the right lane being used to allow free flow of traffic. Police also noted with concern motorists taking pictures of the dead man as they passed through the scene. Maremane said: “Gauteng Traffic Police condemns the reckless behaviour by some motorists passing along the N1, especially those taking the pictures of the dead man. This behaviour is unwarranted and punishable by law, since the deceased’s family is not yet notified. Anyone found with the pictures or to be circulating them will face the full might of the law,” he said.
