New mum Yolanda Vilakazi is breathing fire. This after people created fake Instagram accounts in her daughter’s name. Kenya Elihle Vilakazi, who was born on 11 November, and already there are five Instagram accounts in her name. Yolanda, who just gave birth to her second child with rapper Kwesta, took to Instagram to share how irritated she was and asked people to help her report the accounts. “My child is barely a week old. Who told you I needed help creating a page for her? If I was going to, which I absolutely wasn’t and won’t, I’m quite capable of doing it myself on my own terms as her mum,” she said.

Please, don’t follow fake accounts and I won’t be posting any of his images as a results of this,” she said. A post shared by YOLANDA VILAKAZI (@yonessalvv)
