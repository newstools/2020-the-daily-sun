ON the day the remains of the slain Palesa Madiba were discovered, murder accused Dumisani Mkhwanazi refused to go to his family’s house when called by police. He apparently told his family that he didn’t want to be attacked by the community and opted to meet at the local police station. This was according to the testimony of Palesa’s friend and Dumisani’s niece, Tshidi Mkhwanazi, who took the stand as a first witness in the South Gauteng High Court on Thursday. Tshidi told the court, “He said: ‘I didn’t want to come there and be assaulted by the community’.” She said he was not arrested on that day as the police said they didn’t have sufficient evidence. Palesa’s remains were discovered on 16 December 2015, behind the backrooms at Dumisani’s family home in Phiri, Soweto. Tshidi said when the remains were found, she and her grandmum arrived in Phiri and the streets were packed with onlookers in the community, as well as the media. She said she wanted to get in and see the remains, but was told that the area is currently not accessible, as it was a crime scene. Judge Prince Manyathi postponed the matter to Friday after Dumisani’s lawyer, Dominic Thinane, asked to be excused to attend to personal matters. The state is expected to call more witnesses today as the trail continues. More to follow.
