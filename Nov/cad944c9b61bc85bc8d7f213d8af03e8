SALVATION isn’t for sale! These are the words of Dr Abraham Akih, leader of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon. “But pastors and prophets have turned the gospel into a business,” he said. “The Word of God should bring hope. It should fight poverty and bring joy and happiness to the poor.” Akih told Daily Sun government should examine Bible schools to see if they have accreditation and check the level of education of the teachers. KILLER WOMEN GANG STRIKES AGAIN! “There are so many fake theological schools in Africa that don’t have accreditation from government. Yet they train ministers while they themselves aren’t properly trained,” said Akih, who studied theology at the University of Pretoria. He said many pastors and prophets get special powers and use it to deceive innocent people. “They make up things and say God has spoken to them while they’re deceitful. Theirs is to make money,” he said “I don’t allow the congregation to put my pictures in their cars, houses or cellphones. I don’t allow people to take pictures of me as I’m not God.” He said fake pastors and prophets must stay away from church. HITMEN SAVED ME! “You’re not welcome. There’s no place for you in our church,” he said. He said good ministers don’t blow their own trumpet to attract people to come to church. “Let’s care about the homeless, abused children and women,” he said. “These are challenging and difficult times. If you have a calling from God, you won’t go into dirty business and get powers from dark places.”
