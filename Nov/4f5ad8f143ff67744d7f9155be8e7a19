A WARRANT of arrest has been issued for two fugitives, Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary Bushiri. This was announced by government spokeswoman Phumla Williams. She said the warrant of arrest, which the state was applying for, formed the basis of the documentation that it would submit to the Malawian government to extradite the Bushiris. She said they remain on track and that process is underway. “Once we have submitted the documentation, we will also share it with South Africans,” she said. Government has reiterated that the extradition process could be lengthy but when the Bushiris return to South Africa, they could face additional charges for absconding the court instructions. Bushiri and his wife fled the country unlawfully and defied their R200 000 bail conditions. They are facing charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to R102 million, together with three other accused. They alleged that they fled South Africa to seek help from the government of their home country, Malawi.
