AN ALLEGED rapist was held by police after part of his tongue was bitten off. A 65-year-old gogo from Tsomo Mission in the Eastern Cape bit off the tongue of her alleged would-be rapist when he attacked her at her home on Saturday, 7 November. Police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci said: “It is alleged that gogo was sleeping alone in her home when she was woken up by a 33-year-old suspect who entered through the window and instructed her to take off her clothes. “The suspect attempted to rape the woman and tried to kiss her. She managed to bite off his tongue and throw the piece on the floor,” she said. “After the ordeal, the victim fled the scene and went to seek help at Cofimvaba Hospital. Police arrested the suspect on Sunday at the hospital where he was given medical care. He is under police guard,” she said. The suspect will appear in the Tsomo Magistrates Court soon, facing a charge of attempted rape.
