FOUR men aged between 21 and 33, accused of kidnapping and attempted murder of boy (13), will spend Christmas behind bars. The four and their co-accused, aged 21, briefly appeared in the Mhala Regional Court on Thursday, 19 November, where Magistrate Elmarie Theron postponed the matter to 25 January for witnesses and trial. This comes after prosecutor Kedibone Bareng told the court that the five were facing two counts of kidnapping and attempted murder of a boy, who’s now under the protection of police and social workers. She said the accused placed the boy’s leg on large stones before hacking it off with a panga down the valley outskirts of Athol Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on 31 October last year. The boy was rescued by a motorist, who rushed him to hospital. He was released from hospital in December and placed under protection. His badly decomposed leg was later recovered by police dumped behind the Thulamahashe Plaza after one of the five accused led the cops, who sent it for DNA testing. One of the accused was released on R1 000 bail in July.
