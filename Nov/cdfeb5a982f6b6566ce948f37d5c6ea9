THE families of the seven people killed in a house in Gugulethu, Cape Town, held a service to collect their spirits on Wednesday 11 November. This after friends Lindelwa Mafuya, Lumka Hlotywa, Phindiwe Yawa, Mzikayise Mngeni, Xola Hayiya, Dumisani Nongwana and Zama Mabusela were shot at Lumka’s house earlier this month. Their families and residents prayed and lit candles in the house, while church leaders prayed for the families and comforted them.  “Let God power you to accept the situation you are in. Let God give you power to walk during these difficult times. Their lives were not taken in the right way. It was not God’s time, but let us accept the situation we are in,” said church leader Dorothea Gopi. Reverend Zama Mfihlo said the families were going through difficult times and prayer would comfort them. “That’s why we are here to help them collect their loved ones’ spirits,” he said. The families were asked to hold lit candles and say a short prayer before putting out the candles. Phindiwe’s mum, gogo Thozama Yawa (74), called on the other parents to forgive the killers. “Our grandchildren may end up being murderers themselves because they might hold a grudge of what happened to their parents. Let us pray so these killers change their ways. Let’s forgive them.” She said she would look after Phindiwe’s three children.
