WITH busy schedules, trying to maintain a balance between work and personal lives, people tend to experience headaches every now and then. When your body is feeling burdened, it finds a way to release the toxins that cause exhaustion. Many times it is through headaches and tiredness. Although it’s not something serious all the time, a person should not ignore them completely. Headaches are a cry for help and it could show that there’s a bigger problem going on such as brain tumour, tension headaches or even migraines. Over the counter medication is available at pharmacies and this can also make our lives easier. Should the headache continue popping up and even lasting for longer periods, consult a medical professional to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Prevention is better than a cure. So it’s vital to play it safe instead of taking risks. Take care of yourself and treat your body well. Exercise regularly, drink lots of water and get enough rest.
