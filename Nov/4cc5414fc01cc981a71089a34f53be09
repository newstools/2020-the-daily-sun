“I’M John Vul’igate, and I don’t understand the controversy surrounding the song,” said John Mokgosinyane. He told Daily Sun he came up with the John Vul’igate concept. The 30-year-old from Meadowlands zone 3 in Soweto said people ekasi called him John Vul’igate long before the recent hype. He said the name is derived from a scene in the award-winning movie Tsotsi, where the hijack victim says: “John, vul’igate. The remote isn’t working.” John said he’s friends with Scara Chilli Ya Baba, with whom he apparently brainstormed the song concept. “Mapara A Jazz are not my friends. I met them at Corner Chilli Lounge in Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane. John Vul’igate is my concept and named after me. “The concept came about while we were discussing the name of the song. “I told Scara Chilli Ya Baba we should call it John Vul’igate. “Mapara A Jazz should stop telling people it’s their song. They stole it from my friends, Scara Chilli Ya Baba.” John is no musician, but hangs around them. “I’m angry and disappointed. I didn’t get a cent from Mapara A Jazz, not even a cold drink. They’re selfish and greedy.” He said Mapara A Jazz should stop playing the track and come clean. Scara Chilli Ya Baba have since opened a case of theft against Mapara A Jazz. Dominic “Matanta” Baloyi of Scara Chilli Ya Baba said: “When I win the case I want to clean them out and get every cent they earned from the song.” McMillan “Man Malaya” Nephawe of Mapara A Jazz said: “I know John. He visited Scara Chilli Ya Baba when they were in the studio. “He didn’t come up with the concept. He’s just looking for fame. “I want to tell the truth. John doesn’t own the John Vul’igate concept” Man Malaya said people are jelous of the song’s success.
