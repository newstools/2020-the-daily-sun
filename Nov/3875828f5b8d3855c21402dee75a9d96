BAFOKENG queen mother Dr. Semane Bonolo Molotlegi has died at the age of 77. The royal family hasn’t yet released many details on what led to her death. Director of operations in the office of the Bafokeng nation, Bashi Makgale, said she died suddenly on 28 November. Makgale said Mmemogolo – as she was affectionately known – played a pivotal role in making the Bafokeng nation a model traditional community. “She established Bafokeng Women’s Club and Thuto Thebe educational fund, which is focused on education and community development advocacy in memory of her late husband, Kgosi Edward Lebone, and her firstborn son Kgosi Mollwane Lebone II,” he said. She’s survived by her four children, Kgosi Leruo, the present king, Prince Bothata, Princess Motswana, and Princess Tirelo, as well as her grandchildren. Makgale said further details and arrangements will be communicated in due course.
