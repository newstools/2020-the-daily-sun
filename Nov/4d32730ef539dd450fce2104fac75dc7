THERE has been a breakthrough in the fight against HIV with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Wits University researchers revealed on Tuesday, 10 November, that their trials for an HIV prevention injection has been found to be 89% more effective in preventing HIV in women than the daily PrEP pill. PrEP is a term used to describe the use of medications used to prevent the spread of disease in people who have not yet been exposed to a disease-causing agent, usually a virus. The term typically refers to the specific use of antiviral drugs as a strategy for HIV/Aids prevention. The study, led by HPTN (HIV Prevention Trials Network), tested the antiretroviral injection given every two months and it was found to be better than the current standard oral pill, Daily Maverick reported. “This is the first time the world has seen such significant HIV prevention results for women,” said Wits’ Dr Sinead Delany-Moretlwe, who headed the trial. She added: “We know that adherence to a daily pill continues to be challenging, and an effective injectable product such as long-acting cabotegravir is a very important additional HIV prevention option for them. We are grateful to the women who volunteered for this study and the research staff. This study would not have been possible without their commitment to HIV prevention.” The injection will have to be registered by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority before it can be made available in Mzansi.
