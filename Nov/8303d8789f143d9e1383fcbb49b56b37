MATRICS had mixed reactions to Afrikaans paper two on Tuesday, 24 November. Pupils at Mmakgetsi High School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said the exam was difficult as they didn’t use the language in everyday conversations. Goitsione Mpete (18) said he was not feeling confident after writing. “I tried to study but it was difficult because no one at home understands Afrikaans and they couldn’t help me,” he said. Boipelo Rammala (18) said the exam was not difficult, but Puisano Tladi (18) said they didn’t have enough time to study. “I just hope I pass but I don’t know if I will pass well,” he said. Kwanele Msibi (18) of Meridian High School in Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in the North West, said: “I enjoyed writing Afrikaans. It was really fair,” he said.  Meanwhile, the Basic Education Department is investigating yet another exam leak. The department said the Council of Education Ministers had an urgent meeting on Monday, 23 November after physical science paper two was circulated before the exam that morning. Department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations was investigating last week’s leak of a maths paper. He said the investigation was at an advanced stage and progress would be shared with the public at the right time. Minister Angie Motshekga said: “We want to reassure the public that we’re hard at work to ensure that we protect the exams.”
