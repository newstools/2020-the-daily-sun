Many people are in prisons and others hospitalised because of irresponsible drinking. Young people have dropped out of varsity because of the bottle. Many people’s lives and marriages have been ruined and kids orphaned, thanks to irresponsible drinking. Deadbeat dads run away from responsibility and opt to spend their money on firewater. What makes me more afraid is that today’s young people start drinking from a young age. I wonder what kind of parents they’ll become. Alcohol is too expensive! There are different kinds of entertainment besides booze. Young people can get together and play games. Such activities will help keep them mentally and physically fit, and agile. When you are drunk you are not well organised to run a healthy relationship with your family, partner and children. There are people out there who drink just because their peers are doing it. That should not be an excuse. You can’t say you’re enjoying yourself when you harm your health, misuse money and ruin relationships with those around you. Letter by Ephenia Kubu Ga-Rankuwa View
