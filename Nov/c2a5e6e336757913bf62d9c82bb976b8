GLADAFRICA Championship side Richards Bay FC received a much needed R4,7 million sponsorship ahead of the 2020-21 season. The KwaZulu-Natal based club also unveiled 10 new players at a function held last Friday. Umhlathuze Municipality, who signed a new three-year deal with the club, handed the club a cheque of R3 million. King Cetshwayo Municipality gave the team R1,5 million, while R200 000 was given to the club from a close friend of the chairman, Sifiso Biyela. Joma, the kit sponsorship, signed a new three-year deal. The club unveiled players such as Lwandile Mabuya, Khanyisa Ndlovu, Thabani Dube, Siphesihle Bhengu, Tsepo Mabua, Victor Bakah, Siphamandla Mtolo (new captain), Sibonginhlanhla Mthethwa, Sakhile Mtshali and former TS Galaxy goalkeeper, Ludwe Mpakumpaku. Biyela said it is high time the club challenge for promotion this season. The Natal Rich Boyz, who also appointed Siyabonga Mdluli as an assistant to head coach Simo Dladla, will open this season’s Championship campaign against University of Pretoria at the Tuks Stadium on Sunday. “We need to get straight promotion,” said Biyela. “Having said that, we have managed to assemble a good team in all departments. We have also got a good technical team with experience.”
