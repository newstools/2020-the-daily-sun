TWO alleged thieves chose the wrong house to break-in. They ended up being shot after the house owner, a cop, found them. The shooting left one suspect dead and the other injured in the cop’s yard on Tuesday. Next to the two suspects, there was a plasma TV belonging to the cop. The incident occurred in Heidedal, Mangaung, at about 2am. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a case of murder and attempted murder have been opened for investigation. Makhele told Daily Sun: “On Tuesday, police responded to a shooting incident at a house in Paper Street Heidedal at about 2am. On arrival, two coloured men were lying on the ground in the yard. One suspect (26) was found with a bullet wound to the chest and was declared dead at the scene. The other suspect (30) was shot on the legs and he was taken to Pelonomi Hospital for treatment and arrested after being discharged. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the two suspects were shot after they broke into a police officer’s house. “A plasma TV belonging to the member was found lying on the ground. The car that was used by the suspects was confiscated after it was found without registration number and a disc. “Further investigation revealed that the car belonged to a girlfriend of one of the suspects. The shooting incident by the officer will be investigated further by Ipid. The arrested suspect will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on a charge of house robbery. “A case of murder, attempted murder and house robbery was registered at Heidedal cops following a house robbery which left one suspect fatally shot and another one injured,” said Makhele.
