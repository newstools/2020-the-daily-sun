FORMER Denel group CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe conceded he breached procurement policy when he approved a single supplier contract, which was awarded to a Gupta company. On Wednesday, 11 November, he told the Zondo Commission he did it because there was an urgency for Denel to deliver on its promise. VR Laser got the tender to manufacture badger infantry fighting vehicles for the South African National Defence Force under Project Hoefyster. Ntshepe said a memorandum of agreement was signed and he was scared that, if Denel didn’t place an order, VR Laser could take legal action. “There was an urgent request that this vehicle be prepared for demonstration. I believe I took the right decision to approve it,” he said.  But head of procurement, Dennis Mlambo, rejected to approve the submission to appoint VR Laser until he was convinced there were good reasons to overlook in-house company LMT, which had the same capability. According to Denel policy, Mlambo was the one who should approve based on sound business reasons. Ntshepe said Denel was competing with other companies and, if they were late to deliver, they’d face penalties either by losing money or business. Three executives – chief executive Riaz Saloojee, CFO Fikile Mhlontlo and company secretary Elizabeth Africa – were suspended and offered settlements. Ntshepe said he didn’t remember reading their settlement agreements. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said: “Tjo! That’s very dangerous.”
