ORLANDO Pirates have a number of injury concerns ahead of their MTN8 second leg semifinal against Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday at FNB Stadium (3pm). Pirates assistant coach Fadlu David revealed on Friday during the MTN8 semifinal virtual press conference that Gabadinho Mhango Bongani Sam and Tshegofatso Mabasa are ruled out for the derby. Thembinkosi Lorch, Thulani Hlatswayo, and Terrence Dzvukamanja are also in doubt for the Sunday clash. Lorch and Dzvukamanja were both forced off during Pirates 1-0 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr. Molemela Stadium on Wednesday evening. “Gabadinho Mhangi is ruled out, definitely not available,” Davids said. “We still await on Tyson Lorch and Dzvukamanja, I will look at the reports later in the day then we will make a decision to do a late fitness test or not.” “Sam and Mabasa are still on course for the rehabilitation program.” Pirates are going to this encounter leading Amakhosi by 3-0 which they recorded in the first leg which took place at Orlando Stadium last weekend. Davids said they are not going to take Chiefs light as anything is still possible. “They have the same squad that nearly won the league last season. They can turn the game around we will not going there undermining Kaizer Chiefs. The approach of the score is 0-0, not 3-0. “They have a quality squad, let’s not undermine that we are expecting a really tough game on Sunday. A winner of the two-legged fixture will face a winner between Supersport United and Bloemfontein Celtic in the final of the MTN8 cup competition.
