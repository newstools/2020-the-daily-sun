CRYSTAL Palace winger Jefferey Schlupp and Red Bull Salzburg midfielder, Majeed Ashimeru, have joined the camp of Ghana’s Black Stars ahead of today’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan. The Group C table-toppers will visit Sudan at the Al Hilal Stadium in Omdurman, Khartoum where they will be looking at stretching their lead to 12 points – good enough to secure their ticket to the 2022 Cameroon events. Schlupp and Ashimeru, who missed the first game in the Cape Coast when they spanked the Sudanese 2-0, have arrived in camp to give coach Charles Akonnor options going into the game against the North Africans. Also expected in camp is Jiangsu Sunning midfielder Mubarak Wakaso, according to the Ghana FA official website. Meanwhile, Confederation of African Football (Caf) has appointed Joshua Bondo from Botswana to handle this Cup of Nations qualifier. The 42-year-old will be assisted by compatriots Mogomotsi Morakile, Kegakologetswe Lucky and Tshepo Mokani as fourth official. Alhaji Babagana Ali from Nigeria will be the match commissioner.
