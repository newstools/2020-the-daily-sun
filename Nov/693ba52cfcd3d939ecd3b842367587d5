JOBURG Mayor Geoff Makhubo benefitted from irregular tenders. This is according to evidence ENS Africa head of forensics Steven Powell gave at the Zondo Commission on Wednesday, 25 November. He said there were several transactions between Makhubo’s company Molelwane Consulting CC, IT company EOH, other companies and EOH employee Patrick Makhubedu between 2006 and 2018. Powell said Molelwane received R570 000 in 2014 for no work. He told the inquiry about an email from Makhubo to Makhubedu in August 2014 asking for financial help. “The ANC Greater Johannesburg requests urgent assistance with the relaunch of its Youth League this weekend. Apologies for the late request, but it’s an imperative from head office. Attached is the accommodation quotation,” read the email. The inquiry heard how Makhubedu sent an email in 2014 instructing Makhubo how to write a letter awarding a tender to EOH. “What we’ve seen is almost a pattern of regular solicitation of donations, coupled with the awards of tenders,” said Powell. “It’s almost as if tenders are granted in exchange for financial benefit to the party and individuals.” Powell said ENS Africa found evidence of wrongdoing at EOH, including unsubstantiated payments, suspected tender irregularities, and other suspected unethical business dealings. He said irregular payments could be as high as R865 million. He said EOH director Jehan Mackay in 2015 made payments to ANC members from his personal bank account. Among those who received payments were former ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa, former ANCYL treasurer Reggie Nkabinde, and Siyabulela Sintwa, former president Jacob Zuma’s personal secretary at Luthuli House.
