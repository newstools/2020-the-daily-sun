AFTER not having electricity for three days, fed up residents took to the streets. The angry residents from N section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, blockaded Ndiyazana Road on Friday morning to demand electricity. They said nobody explained to them why they haven’t had electricity since Wednesday. A resident, Ntombifikile Mchunu (33), said electricity was cut on Wednesday afternoon. “It returned at about 7pm. But at 8pm it was cut again. It returned in the morning at about 5am on Thursday but only lasted 30 minutes Then it came back at 11am. We thought everything was back to normal but in the afternoon it was cut again and it’s been off since,” said the resident. She said they contacted the ward councillor but he said he had no clue what was causing the outages. “The councillor promised he will get the problem fixed but nothing has happened,” said Ntombifikile. Another resident, Andile Mkhize (44), said they wanted the councillor to fix the problem soon or else they would keep the road blockaded. “We pay for electricity and so we don’t deserve this. The councillor we voted for must do his job,” said the resident. When ward councillor Simon Khuboni was contacted, he said he wasn’t aware of the electricity issue in the area. “I’ve contacted the electricity department. They are trying to resolve this. I’m not sure when it will be resolved but they are working on it,” said Khuboni. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said at about 5am, the residents of KwaMashu N section blockaded Ndiyazana Road with burning tyres and rubble. “The police were on the scene to monitor the situation. No arrests or damages were reported,” said Gwala.
