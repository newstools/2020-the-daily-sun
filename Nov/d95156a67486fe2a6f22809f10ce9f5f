Baroka FC have announced the appointment of caretaker coach Thoka Matsimela for the remainder of the 2020-21 DStv Premiership season. That would seemingly end the tenure of Dylan Kerr, who masterminded the club’s relegation survival at the end of the last campaign, but fell foul of chairman Khurishi Mphahlele in the build-up to the new season. Kerr was accused of being disrespectful and implying management interference, and was suspended pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing. Matsimela has been in charge since the opening game of the campaign and led the side to seven points from a possible nine in their first three matches. That includes wins over Maritzburg United (2-1) and Black Leopards (3-1), and a draw with Lamontville Golden Arrows (1-1), where they were just seconds away from another victory before letting their lead slip. Baroka’s next game is a Limpopo derby away at TTM on November 22. -SuperSport
