THE last time Joseph Sibanda (40) saw his mother, his stepfather was chasing her with an axe. The 40-year-old from Letlhabile near Brits, North West, said that was in 1988 when he was only eight years old. “My mum ran out of the house and my dad chased after her. A few hours later he came back alone and burnt everything that belonged to my mother, including some of her documents,” said Joseph. “To this day I’m haunted by her spirit.” ALSO READ:BUSHIRI: WARRANTS DON'T SHOCK ME! Joseph said he was scared of his stepfather and didn’t ask about his mum’s whereabouts. But in 2016 when his stepfather died, an old woman told him his stepdad murdered his mum and buried her in a shallow grave. “Since then, everything in my life has come to a standstill. I quit my job, my businesses began to suffer losses and nothing was going right,” he said. He said he kept dreaming of a woman crying for him to take her home. “The woman, who I think is my mother, told me she wanted me to take her home so she can be buried among her family members,” he said. Joseph said the only thing he knew about his mother was that her name was Agnes Xakayi, and was from the Eastern Cape. “I need to trace her family so they can help me find my mother and we can take her soul home.” Sangoma Gogo Silvia said until Joseph found his mother’s remains, he won’t find peace. “His mother’s soul is wandering around and she wants to be laid among her ancestors. He needs to find her as soon as possible,” she said.
