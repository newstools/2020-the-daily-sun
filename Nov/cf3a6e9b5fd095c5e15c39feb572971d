ORLANDO Pirates assistant coach Fadlu Davids has warned his side to avoid complacency when they face Kaizer Chiefs despite a 3-0 lead heading into the MTN8 second leg semifinal on Sunday. Pirates will be without head coach Josef Zinnbauer who left after the 3-0 win in the first round to attends family matters with his son recovering from a car crash. Davids revealed that he has been keeping tabs on the usual coaching duties with Zinnbauer while in Germany. Pirates are going to the clash as hot favorites to go through to the final of the tournament. Despite having the advantage, Davids is not going to be fooled that a comeback cannot happen. "We know, we have to approach the game, not going into it complacent,” Davids told the media during the mTN8 virtual press conference on Friday. “We have seen in the (Uefa) Champions League finals scores being overturned. We will approach the game with the score at zero-zero. We do not think we already have one hand in the final, no.” He added: "If you approach the game wanting to score and not immediately going to defend the 3-0 scoreline, that is the approach we want to take and that is how we will start the match.” "You have to look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is Kaizer Chiefs were 20 minutes away, with the exact same squad, from winning the league. "In the last game of the season, they lost the league. And that is how we approach them, we see them exactly as the same team… they only lost one player, George Maluleka. "They have got the same squad. Yes, a different technical team, a different coach but we know their strengths. We know how dangerous they can be and especially with an experienced coach like Gavin Hunt.” The overall winner of this two-legged fixture will face either SuperSport United who are the defending champions of Bloemfontein Celtic who are playing on Saturday afternoon (3pm).
