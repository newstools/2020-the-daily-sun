KAIZER Chiefs put their domestic problems behind them with a historic 1-0 win in Cameroon on Sunday. Playing their first ever match in the West African country, Amakhosi edged Cameroon champions PWD Bamenda in their Caf Champions League preliminary round clash at the Limbe Omnisports Stadium. Eric Mathoho made good use of Lebogang Manyama’s assist in the 84th minute to earn the Soweto giants a massive first leg win. It was a different Amakhosi side to that huffing and puffing team as Gavin Hunt’s men shoulder to the wheel. Itumeleng Khune even saved a penalty in the dying minutes to remind his detractors of his quality. The win will sure go a long towards lifting morale and spirits in the Amakhosi camp as they still battle to get out of the starting blocks in the Premiership. This will host the Cameroonians at home this weekend in the second leg.
