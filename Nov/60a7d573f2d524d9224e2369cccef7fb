TRADITIONAL surgeons are hopeful initiation schools may reopen if government gives in to their demands. The iingcibi said they’d been struggling. They couldn’t work due to lockdown rules. The Eastern Cape co-operative governance and traditional affairs department, as well as Contralesa, are pushing hard for the initiation schools to reopen. Mlondolozi Mkono (40), an ingcibi from Mdlankomo Village in Libode, told Daily Sun he was excited. “Being an ingcibi is a calling from our ancestors, and before you become a traditional surgeon there are rituals you need to perform. “Only traditional surgeons have the authority to promote or appoint someone to do this job, not traditional leaders.” He warned traditional leaders to stop appointing young boys who claim to be traditional surgeons. Mlondolozi said he depended on his calling to survive. He told Daily Sun traditional surgeons, at a meeting recently, emphasised the importance of PPEs at initiation schools. “I’ll buy PPEs and make sure everyone visiting the school obeys Covid-19 regulations,” he said. MEC Xolile Nqatha urged parents, traditional leaders and the community to help save boys lives. Said Nqatha: “Customary initiation is our pride, so it must be protected. No child must die.” The Eastern Cape government is now awaiting approval from national government before the season resumes.
