I watched with tears in my eyes the horrific scenes of violence outside the Brackenfell High School in Cape Town, where EFF members were protesting against alleged racism. It was such a terrible sight to see adults violently confronting each other at an event where violence was not supposed to reign. What hurt me the most was the attack on a defenceless woman who was walking on the pavement. A man carrying a baseball bat hit her about four times on her back, and she kept on walking because she had no strength to defend herself. What added insult to injury was that there was no proper media coverage of that shocking incident, despite Mzansi drowning in a pool of gender-based violence and the killing of women and children. That man must be found by the police and punished harshly. Justice must prevail for that poor woman. Letter by Malphia HonwaneÂ Gottenburg, eManyeleti
