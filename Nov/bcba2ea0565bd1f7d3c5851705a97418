THE new Volkswagen Golf R has been unveiled. It is more powerful, more dynamic, and efficient, another highlight of the new Golf R is the innovative all-wheel drive system featuring selective wheel torque control on the rear axle. The new Golf R offers the best traction characteristics, neutral and precise handling, as well as maximum agility. Corresponding drive output is generated by a 2.0 litre four-cylinder turbocharged power plant in the most powerful version of the EA 888 engine series available for the new Golf. The EA 888 engine produces 235 kW and 420 Nm and will reportedly sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 4,7 seconds with a top speed of 250 km/h. Its high-tech, direct-injection engine is characterised by innovative solutions for individual details, such as integration of water-cooled exhaust gas routing to the turbocharger in the cylinder head or variable valve timing with dual camshaft adjustment.  The first Golf R32, introduced in 2002 with its 3.2 litre six-cylinder engine generating 177 kW, was the most powerful Golf that Volkswagen had built up to that point. It was also equipped with an all-wheel drive and raced to 100 km/h in only 6.6 seconds. It sold three times as well as had been anticipated, from mid-2003, it was the worldâ€™s first Volkswagen available with a dual-clutch gearbox (DSG). A technological benchmark in the compact class.     In 2005, the second Golf R32 made its debut, and with 184 kW it was even more powerful and superior. Four years went by until 2009. Volkswagen celebrated the world premiere of the successor on the basis of the sixth Golf generation, changing from a V6 naturally aspirated engine to a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine (TSI) that was 21% more efficient. The R32 became the R and with it, the output of the third generation increased to 199 kW.
