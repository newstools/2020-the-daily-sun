ILLEGAL electricity connections continue to claim more lives. Another life was lost in Lenasia, south of Joburg, due to this problem. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena confirmed that the city has received reports that a person was electrocuted along Lenasia Drive. “The area is known for illegal connections where the nearby informal settlement taps into our network and that belonging to Metrorail,” said Mangena. He said that people have been warned against the dangers posed by the spiderweb of exposed wires in the area and have embarked on countless operations to remove the illegal connections. “We have sent a team to the area to investigate and gather more facts,” he said. Mangena told Daily Sun that last month illegal connections claimed the lives of two children and an adult in Kanana, Rabie Ridge. “Now it’s an adult from Lenasia. Last week a child was electrocuted in Alexandra 11th Avenue. We extend our condolences to the families of the deceased,” Magena added.
