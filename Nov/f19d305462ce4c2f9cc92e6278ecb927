MANY children are often left alone as their parents work night shift or are out partying. So Zandile Dambile is offering to look after them and she only charges R50 per child. The mum of two from Boystown in Cape Town posted on Facebook that anyone who needed a night-shift nanny could bring their kids to her. “Some people don’t trust me because of the amount I charge. I want them to know I’m doing this for the love and safety of the kids,” she said. Zandile said she was currently looking after three kids. “I started looking after them when they were only six months old,” she said. She told Daily Sun there were no creches for parents to take their kids at night. “Many kids have burnt to death while their parents went out to party. “We can’t continue having these kinds of incidents.” Zandile urged parents to put their kids’ safety first. “I don’t charge much because I know people don’t have money. All I want is for the kids to be safe at all times,” she said. She said people shouldn’t fear anything as she was a God-fearing woman. “Some people asked why I specified I am God-fearing on Facebook and I told them it was an assurance that their kids will be safe. But some said they don’t trust Christians because some do evil things,” she said. She said that anyone who’s interested in leaving their kids with her can contact her on Facebook. Resident Anelisa Poswa said she liked Zandile’s idea. “I wish parents who go out partying every weekend see this because some leave their kids alone. They must take them to her. She doesn’t charge a lot of money,” said Anelisa.
