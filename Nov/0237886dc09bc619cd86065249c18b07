A FAMILY of seven from H section, in KwaMashu, north of Durban, was left stranded after their house burnt down on Sunday, 15 November. They were forced to spend the night at their neighbour’s house as raging flames burnt down their entire house. Now they don’t know where they will sleep. Family member Thobekile Siphika (60) said she was watering her flowers outside when she saw smoke coming from one of the bedroom windows. “I was busy watering the flowers as we were not at home since Friday because we had attended a relative’s funeral in Ulundi. So as I was watering the flowers, I saw smoke coming from the children’s bedroom window,” she said. She said she ran into the house and woke up her husband, who was sleeping in their bedroom. “My three children were sitting in the dining room and I called out to them to come out. We all went outside the house. We tried to take out some furniture but the flames just got bigger. I also tried to get inside to fetch a bag where I put all our important documents, but I couldn’t,” she said. She said the fire had started in a bed in the children’s bedroom. “I don’t understand how the fire began because in that bedroom the plugs are not working and there was nobody in there. In fact, this is still very confusing to us,” she said. She said they watched as their three-bedroom house burnt down. “We are left with the clothes on our backs and we spent the night at our neighbour’s house. I don’t know where we will sleep tonight,” she said. Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi said he will meet the family to see how he can assist them. “Unfortunately, the municipality cannot build a house that is paid through the bank. But I can try and get them temporary shelter, food and clothes for now,” he said.
