“AUNT Mato said it publicly that I have pressure, I shouldn’t talk too much as she wants results,” said Golden Arrows coach Mandla Ncikazi as he gears up for a tricky DStv Premiership duel against TS Galaxy at Mbombela Stadium. Ncikazi said his journey to make the chairlady happy carries on Saturday against Dan Malesela’s team as he aims at a top eight finish. Ncikazi, whose side finished 12th last term, added Madlala might have not said it, but he knows she also wants to see her club win trophies this season. The last time Arrows won a trophy was in 2009 when they annihilated Ajax Cape Town 6-0 in the MTN8 final at Orlando Stadium where Ncikazi was the assistant under then coach Manqoba Mngqithi. This remains the biggest cup final score in the PSL era. “Every boss wants their team to survive relegation. They also want to get into the top eight and win something. She doesn’t say it, but I know in her heart she wants that,” said Ncikazi. Ncikazi was appointed on 16 October after coach Steve Komphela left to join Mamelodi Sundowns. “I want to do better than before. Win a cup and why not the league if it’s possible. Leicester City did it (won the English Premiership in 2016) and why not Arrows?”
