RESIDENTS of Motherwell pleaded with Health Minister Zweli Mkhize to bring back the lockdown. Mkhize was on the second day of his visit to Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape on Friday, 27 November as part of government’s efforts to mitigate the province’s resurgence of Covid-19. Mkhize, accompanied by Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba and Nelson Mandela Bay Acting Mayor Thsonono Buyeye, visited Livingstone Hospital, Dr Elizabeth Mamisa Chabula-Nxiweni Field Hospital and Motherwell Shopping Centre. The centre has been singled out as a hotspot in the city. Ntombizanele Majamana said: “Minister, people are dying in Motherwell and Nelson Mandela Bay. I feel it is high time that government brings back lockdown before it is too late. “The number of people attending churches and social gatherings need to be reduced because gatherings are a super-spreader of the coronavirus.” Mnikeli Peter said: “People are not observing regulations. It is time that government thinks otherwise about our situation in Nelson Mandela Bay. We need to be placed on tight lockdown just to control the situation.” Mkhize said: “Our intervention in the metro is to make sure that we delay the curve, more especially now that we are going into the festive season. We received reports in these areas and we will discuss these reports at national level and take necessary steps. “We need an approach that will help us to contain the outbreaks both in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape. The use of masks, sanitisers, hand washing and social distancing is going to be a big area of focus now that we are approaching the festive season. “We need to enjoy the festive season responsibly and not share drinks in bottles and share glasses. People need to take Covid-19 seriously. We believe our visit to Nelson Mandela Bay was helpful,” said Mkhize.
