AMAZULU coach Ayanda Dlamini aims to get back to winning ways when his side host Cape Town City in their DStv Premiership clash at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Saturday  (8.15pm). But the Usuthu coach, whose side go to this game after losing 4-3 to defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium last weekend, is under no illusions about City’s toughness. He said Jan Olde Riekerink’s side will come to Durban high on confidence after they beat Bloemfontein Celtic 4-2 in their previous encounter. “Cape Town City are a quality side. They’ll come with high on confidence, having beaten Celtic,” said Dlamini. “But I’m sure with the quality players we have and playing at home, we’ll be strong.” Usuthu will still be without Bongi Ntuli and Siphesihle Maduna due to long-term injuries. And there’s great anticipation that AmaZulu fans will finally see Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala don his Usuthu jersey after joining the club recently. Dlamini said the former Kaizer Chiefs star faces a late fitness test. “We’re waiting for the medical team. They checked him on Wednesday and we’ll know everything today.” Shabba, who last kicked a ball last May for his previous club BB Erzurumspor in Turkey, has been troubled by a muscle injury after intensive trainingThe former striker also paid tribute to former Bafana Bafana star, Anele Ngcongca, who passed away in a tragic car accident in Mtunzini, Kwa-Zulu Natal, on Monday. The good news for Usuthu is that Siphelele Mthembu is fit and may face his former club.
