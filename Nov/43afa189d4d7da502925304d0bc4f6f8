WOMEN studying at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University have been protesting since Monday. This comes after a woman was abducted by two armed suspects while walking to a shop a few metres from her off-campus residence in Pretoria West, Tshwane, on Sunday. Students blocked the university entrance. They demanded management dealt with cases of gender-based violence transparently. The students didn’t want to talk to the media. University spokesman Eric Pule said the thugs forced the student into a car at gunpoint and raped her. “The student was rushed to hospital for medical attention and counselling,” he said. Pule said the matter was reported to the cops. “The university will provide comprehensive and total care to the student until she fully recovers,” he said. Pule confirmed the protest took place and said students had a number of demands, mostly relating to the safety of female students on campus and on residences. “Importantly too, female students have raised the issue of gender-based violence on campus and made several proposals to not only mitigate such incidents, but also for appropriate action to be taken against perpetrators,” he said. He said management was working towards the implementation of a number of measures to ensure the safety of female students on campus. “As the university, we’ll continue providing support to our students,” he said.
