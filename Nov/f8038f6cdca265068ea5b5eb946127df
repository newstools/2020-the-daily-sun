MATRICS said the life sciences paper 2 exam written yesterday was a breeze. Lefa Mabusela (17) from Madisong Secondary School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said he was sure he’d pass. He said the exam paper was simple and the questions easy to understand. “I’m sure I’m going to pass it, but I can’t predict what symbol I’ll get,” he said. Classmate Goitsemang Diale (18) said his strategy for studying paid off. “The exam was way easier than we expected, and I’m certain everyone is going to pass it,” he said. Obakeng Maheso (17) said he hoped he did well so he could go to university. “I studied hard because I wanted to pass and further my studies so I can one day assist my family,” he said. The pupils said they were anxious about their results as the year hadn’t been an easy one. But they believed they did their best and hoped to see their names in the newspaper next year. Matrics at Bafokeng High School in Phokeng, near Rustenburg in the North West, said the exam was very easy. Thapelo Makhoba (19) said he enjoyed the whole paper, especially the questions on DNA and genetics. “I enjoyed it because I was ready,” he said. “I downloaded past exam papers and watched YouTube videos on how to answer questions. I’m happy with myself.” Disang Diale (19) said he didn’t regret the time he spent with his teacher preparing for the paper. “I believe I did very well but I was a bit challenged by question two on osmosis,” he said. “I was ready for the paper because   I practised a lot.”
