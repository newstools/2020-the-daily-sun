THE man claimed to be working for the traffic department. So Madoda Maseko (52) trusted him with his friend’s car papers and also gave him R3 500 to register the vehicle. But the man disappeared with the money and the car’s papers. Now Madoda’s friend has hired an inkabi for him, who is allegedly terrorising him day and night. “They tell me to bring the money and document or die,” he said. Madoda said he regretted trusting the man. “I now live in fear. The inkabi promised to kill me if I don’t bring the documents and money back. I don’t know where am I going to find him.” He said he opened a case at Etwatwa Police Station against the crooked man. But he has not been arrested yet. “My friend just wants his things back and doesn’t care how,” he said. Madoda said he has known the crooked man for sometime. “It’s someone we rely on to perform tasks for us at the traffic department, since he said he’s working there. “But I never thought he’d be this greedy. “I’m no longer free. “Those people think I spent their money for my own needs, which is not true,” he said. Madoda said they have been searching for the man, but with no luck. “We went to his house and he was not there. “It looks like he’s hiding somewhere in the area. “I just want him to give back the car papers and money. I’m tired of living like a rat,” said Madoda. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula confirmed that a case had been opened and said cops were investigating.
