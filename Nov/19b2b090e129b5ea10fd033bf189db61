Amampondomise Kingdom’s main focus is to restore the dignity of the nation, and develop and create opportunities for young people from rural villages. The nation has been without a king since 1904. In the past, it had been working without the direction of a king. But for the first time earlier this year President Cyril Ramaphosa recognised Amampondomise Kingship. On Friday, King Luzuko “Zwelozuko” Matiwane made his first public appearance in Lutuka Senior Secondary School in Tsolo, Eastern Cape. He met with Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa and Chippa United chairman Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi to discuss plans to rescue vulnerable people and fight unemployment in rural areas. The nation is now working towards the official inauguration of King Matiwane, which expected to be held earlier next year. Speaking on behalf of the King in Tsolo, Mvuzo Notyesi said the nation was facing number of challenges, which include high unemployment rate. Mpengesi also took the podium calling on young people to never underestimate their potential even though they come from poor communities.  “I am from a poor background. I didn’t even attend a school and worked as a security guard earning peanuts but I’ve work very hard to be where I am,” he said. Mpengesi said he has starting a programme to help poor people by building and donating houses. “I already started the programme in East London and now as Chippa Holdings we are here to ask for a partnership with OR Tambo District Municipality to help poor people”. Meanwhile, Mthethwa said his department’s responsibility was to unite the nation. He urged traditional leaders under Amampondomise to respect King Matiwane in order for the nation to reach its destiny. The minister further applauded Mpengesi’s selflessnes. Among other things discussed in the meeting was ways to restore a culture of sport in the region, rebuild Mthatha Stadium and to create job opportunities for young people.
