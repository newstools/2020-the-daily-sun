ERNST Middendorp in the Premier Soccer League! The German mentor was confirmed by Maritzburg United as the club new coach following the sacking of Eric Tinkler on Monday. Middendorp recently resigned at Ethiopian giants Saint George in less than two months into his three-year contract to re-join the Team of Choice. The former Kaizer Chiefs mentor is returning to Maritzburg for the fourth time in his coaching career. He coached the club from November 2009 until March 2011, January 2012 until October 2013. In 2015-16 campaign Middendorp saved Maritzburg from being relegated with the last two games to spare. He was then given the two-year deal by the club before the 2016-17 season got underway. Last season the German tactician led Kaizer Chiefs for 21 months, during which he led the club to a Nedbank Cup and League runners-up. WELCOME HOME ??
