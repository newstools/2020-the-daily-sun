BAROKA FC need to pull up their socks and concentrate for 90 minutes! Goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke has vowed the players will learn from their lack of concentration and focus in the dying minutes that has cost them four points in their recent two DStv Premiership matches when they face Orlando Pirates in their league clash at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Bakgaga started this season in impressive form but a lack of concentration in their last two league matches has cost them dearly. Baroka drew 1-1 with Golden Arrows, conceding a goal in the referee’s added time and on Sunday history repeated itself in their 1-0 defeat against their Limpopo rivals Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM, when the Venda-based side scored in the final minute. But Masuluke said they are aware they need to play and focus until the final whistle. “I think we played well in the last two games, but we conceded goals in the last dying minutes of both games, which is not good,” said Masuluke. “But we have talked about this as a team and we know we need to stay focused until the end of the game. We are going to Pirates and our aim is to fight to return to winning ways.” Masuluke, who displayed good form against Arrows and TTM, yesterday told SunSport that it is a great feeling to be back in the top flight. “It’s good to be back. I am happy and I will work hard to help Baroka reach their goals this season,” he said.
