FASHION enthusiasts are known to have a strong eye for beauty and eye-catching trends. This naked eye allows them to explore the beauty in fashion and this has led to the rise and birth of eye-jewellery. The history of this eye-catching art can be traced in the Mediterranean and West Asia. Deemed then the “evil eye”, this look or stare was believed to bring bad luck for the person at whom it is directed for reasons of envy or dislike. The perception of the nature of this phenomenon, its causes, and possible protective measures, differed between tribes and cultures. The evil eye is a talisman that is meant to protect you from these evil spirits. This fashion trend is blowing up in countries such as Turkey, where it is deemed the hub of eye-jewellery. Prominent figures such as Meghan Markle have almost become ambassadors of eye-jewellery. She often wears one, sometimes in the form of a pendant with a blue topaz eye, but she has also been seen wearing a delicate gold evil eye bracelet. Depending on the design and make of the jewellery, one can almost expect to pay anything from R10 000 to R3 000 000. Talk about an eye balling moment, right?
