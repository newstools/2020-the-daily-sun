THIS year’s 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign begins today. The launch by the inter-ministerial committee on gender-based violence and femicide was held in Tshwane yesterday. Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, said this year’s focus will be on the importance of women’s economic empowerment. Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said prevention remained the key element in turning the tide against gender-based violence and femicide.

She said the campaign was also aimed at highlighting women’s ability to leave abusive relationships, which she said they often endure due to economic dependency. “With regard to women’s economic power, we note that actions have been taken to build women’s economic power,” she said. The minister said the first activity on the first day of the campaign will be the raising of the South African flag to half-mast at the Union Buildings and across the nation. This will signify the Five Days of Remembrance of the loved ones and citizens who lost their lives to gender-based violence, femicide and Covid-19. The event will start at 4pm.
