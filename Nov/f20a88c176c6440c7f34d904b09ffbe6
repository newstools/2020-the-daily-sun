TS GALAXY coach Dan “Dance” Malesela has challenged his players to change their mindset, if they want to start winning more matches in what’s their rookie season in top flight. The Rockets seem to have settled pretty well in the DStv Premiership, having picked up seven points from a possible 15. The Mpumalanga outfit’s latest point was courtesy of a 1-1 draw with Golden Arrows at home on Saturday, a match Malesela insists his side should have won. The 55-year-old hasn’t been satisfied with his side’s showing so far this season and believes his team could have done better in the early stages of the season. “I think we need to eliminate unnecessary mistakes that we usually make,” said Malesela. “But the most important thing that we need to fix is our mindset. We need to instil that positive way of thinking in order to create and score gaols. “The thing is, sometimes we need to push people and constantly remind them of the areas they need to be at, but when we start chasing a game suddenly people start getting into the box. “Why not do that early? No one will stop you from doing that. “That’s what it’ll take for us to start winning matches,” he said. Malesela will be hoping to see a lot of improvement from his side in their next match against Stellenbosch FC at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday. The former Chippa United mentor wants his side to start their matches with the same energy and vigour they usually show when chasing games as soon as the opponent takes the lead. “We show character when there’s no need. The character should always be shown in the early stages of the game. “We land ourselves into these scary situations where we might end up losing a match that we should easily win. I don’t want to be in these situations,” he said. “You come into the game playing for three points but end up in a situation where you’re fighting for one. It’s a difficult situation we shouldn’t subject ourselves to.”
