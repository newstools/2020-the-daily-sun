SELF-proclaimed Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, his wife Mary, and three others will know this morning whether they will be released on bail or not. The five were arrested on 20 October for fraud and money laundering amounting to R102 million. The suspects are being held at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre in Tshwane. Thousands of Bushiri followers have already began to gather outside the Pretoria Magistrates Court, with hope that their prayers will be answered and their leaders will get bail. In a twist, Bushiri’s arch rival prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng has also arrived in court to stand in solidarity with Bushiri. He said the members of the Enlightened Christian Gathering came to him and asked him to help them. He said he agreed to support their call for bail, but that does not change the fact that Bushiri and his co-accused mustn’t face the music. He said he agreed to work with them to fix the image of the church. “Why must I keep fighting. If I keep fighting it means I’m getting personal,” he said.
