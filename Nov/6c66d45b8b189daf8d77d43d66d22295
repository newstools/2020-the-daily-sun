  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been elected US President, after what was a nail-biting battle for the White House against Republican opponent Donald Trump, according to vote counts tallied by CNN. Biden clinched victory after Pennsylvania - the state where he was born - put him over the 270 electoral votes needed to win. The former senator from Delaware could be sworn in on January 20, 2021 as the 46th president of the United States. His running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, 56, would be the first woman to become vice president and the first of South Asian descent. Trumpâ€™s reelection defeat makes him the 11th sitting president in US history to lose the White House in a general election campaign. The last president to lose a reelection bid was George H.W. Bush in 1992. Trump falsely claimed victory in the election multiple times this week, and baselessly suggested that the contest is being stolen from him. The US president has provided no evidence to support his allegations of fraud but has mounted legal challenges in battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia, to halt ballot processing. Biden's campaign on Friday said that the US government is "perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House" in response to reports that Trump will not concede. States have historically taken time after Election Day to tally all votes, although in most presidential elections the gap between candidates is big enough that television networks like CNN project the winner and the losing candidate concedes before counting formally ends.
