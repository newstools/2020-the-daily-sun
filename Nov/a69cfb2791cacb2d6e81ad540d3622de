DRU Hill, the multi-platinum-selling musical group, once sang: “But we’re not making love no more We’re not even trying to change Tell me how it slips away Does it ever stay the same? We don’t even talk no more We’ve ran out of words to say Tell me it don’t have to change Won’t it ever stay the same?” On the song, Dru Hill highlights how love is dying out in the relationship, and how we no longer do simple things in our relationships. In other words, the romance has died or fizzled out. According to relationship experts, romance is the most important element in any relationship. Likened to a car, should the engine of the car stop functioning, the car becomes inactive and won’t go anywhere. The same can be said about romance in a relationship. So why have we become unromantic? Experts have narrowed it down to the following: 1. Trust issues. 2. Unresolved feelings. 3. You have your own perception and feelings towards romance. 4. Lack of sexual creativity. Leviticus chapter 6 speaks about keeping the fire burning, and the same principle needs to be applied to keeping the romance alive in the relationship.
