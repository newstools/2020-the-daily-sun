SOPHY Lediga and her family have been living in their house since 2015. But her husband Henry (57) died in July this year. As if that was not enough pain for the mum of two, she now might lose her house to her sister-in-law, who allegedly bullied her. The 37-year-old from Atteridgeville in Tshwane told Daily Sun serious problems started after her husband died. She said her skwiza was calling on the community to remove her from their house as she wanted to claim it for herself. “She swears at me, calls me names and says I’m a witch who killed her brother. My sister-in-law is abusive and I want her and four other relatives out of my house because they hate and disrespect me,” she said. Sophy said before her husband died, he gave them an eviction order as they were stressing him. “I want the police to remove them. I’m not coping as I’m still mourning my husband.  “This is not a family house as I have all the documents that state the house belongs to me and my late husband,” she said. Sophy’s skwiza, Dorris (61), said she won’t move out because it was a family house. She said she shared the house with Henry, but it was now under her as he has died. “Sophy should go back to her home because my brother has died. Where will I go with my grandchild who’s living with a disability? I ask that she stops going around carrying that so-called marriage certificate of hers spreading lies. I won’t say anything further.” Mapula Rikhotso from Atteridgeville Police Station said the suspect was arrested and released by the court. “The police do not evict people from their homes,” she said.
