A TRAFFIC cop is in hospital after suspects who were fleeing shot and injured him. This after the four suspects allegedly robbed a supermarket in Bulwer, KZN, on Tuesday, 17 November. As they escaped, they shot at a Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) cop. It is alleged that the group of armed men entered the supermarket and demanded cash. They apparently took an undisclosed amount of cash, robbed a customer and robbed two security guards of their guns, then fled in their getaway cars. While fleeing, RTI officers had a roadblock and gunshots were fired at them when they tried to stop the getaway cars. A 29-year-old officer was shot and injured. He was taken to hospital for medical attention. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. Mbele said a case of robbery and attempted murder was opened at Bulwer Police Station. “Police swiftly responded to the incident which led them to Sweetwaters in the Plessislaer policing area, where three men were arrested. The fourth man was arrested in the Boston area,” said Mbele. Mbele said police recovered stolen cash and two firearms – a pistol and a shotgun. “Two getaway cars were also seized. During an investigation, it was discovered that the pistol was stolen in Durban Central in 2007 and one of the cars was hijacked this month in Scottburgh,” said Mbele. Mbele said the suspects will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court soon facing charges of robbery, attempted murder, possession of suspected stolen property and illegal possession of firearms. KZN provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula praised the perseverance of the police officers by promptly responding to the incident which resulted in the arrests. KZN RTI spokeswoman Zinhle Mngomezulu said: “We condemn the act of hooliganism. We salute our colleagues from the SAPS for apprehending those thugs.”
