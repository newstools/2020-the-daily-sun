A decision to sleep in the car saved Clayton Makhubele as he
nearly became part of the people who were injured at Jumpas informal
settlement, near Cleveland after a wall collapsed on several shacks. One person died and eight people were rushed to hospital for
medical attention after the wall from a cold drink manufacturing company
flattened their shacks. Clayton said he was saved by deciding to sleep in his car as
he was guarding it because it was parked outside the yard. "I was merely guarding it from thieves that could have
stolen the wheels or anything in it," he said. He said he moved to the area on Saturday just before the
tragedy happened. His shack was a mess as he had not yet packed his belongings
accordingly in his new home. He said where he was going to place his bed, was where the
wall crashed and had he decided to sleep there, he could have been injured or
dead. The wall collapsed allegedly as result of the inclement weather
which has brought heavy downpours and strong winds this weekend. One the flooding hot-spots in Gauteng, Centurion, without
fail was once again flooded. One motor vehicle was swept away by the floods in the area,
however no major damage was reported. According to the South African Weather Services, scattered
to widespread showers and thundershowers are expected over the central interior
of the country as well as over the eastern parts of the Eastern Cape,
KwaZulu-Natal, Highveld of Mpumalanga, and Gauteng as we are nearing the end of
the first school holiday. A warning for heavy rain, which could lead to localised
flooding of susceptible formal and informal settlements. The conditions are expected to gradually clear from the
western parts of the country by tomorrow. However, heavier rainfall can be expected along the
KwaZulu-Natal coast.
