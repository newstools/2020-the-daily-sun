WITH the world facing health and financial challenges, football is not immune and drastic times call for urgent and painful measures. That is how African football presidents are reacting to the challenging times and are calling for regime change within the football administration, especially at the Confederation of African Football (Caf) offices up north in Cairo, Egypt. At the rate in which endorsements are pouring in for Patrice Motsepe, indications are that Ahmad Ahmad’s days at the helm of African football are numbered. Safa president Danny Jordaan, Nigeria FA president Amaju Pinnick, Sierra Leone’s Isha Johansen and Botswana’s Maclean Letshwiti have all endorsed Motsepe to challenge the Malagasy. The elections are set for 12 March next year. WHY SAFA AND OTHERS ENDORSE MOTSEPE Pinnick said he pulled out of the race to make way for Motsepe: “With Motsepe in charge, Caf can become powerful than Uefa. We’ll work night and day to ensure he gets enough votes to be Caf president.” Johansen said she can smell the “winds of change” as they revolt against Ahmad, who has been accused of many corruption allegations. Ahmad has also apparently lost relations with Fifa boss Gianni Infantino. Jordaan said the future is unknown, but they will do what they have to do. “As his vice-president, I called Ahmad to let him know that we will be nominating Patrice Motsepe, and he just responded through text: ‘noted’.”
