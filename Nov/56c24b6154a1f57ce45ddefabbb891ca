A service to pray for matrics was held at Langa High School, Cape Town recently. Organiser Luthando Vimbi said 2020 was very challenging, especially for matrics. “Prayer is everything and with the challenging year we’ve had, the matrics needed prayers for their final exams. We couldn’t let them write exams without praying for them,” said Luthando. He said his church, World Harvest Ministries, was also part of the service. “Some of the pupils are frustrated by their background but with this prayer, we are asking God to be with them and give them strength,” he said.  Principal Mrhwebi Magugu said the prayer was needed as they were going through a lot. He wished them all the best for what lies ahead of them. “Go out there and make us proud. We know the year has been difficult, especially for you because there were times we were not allowed to come to school. We tried our best and we are hoping we did well to prepare you for your final exam,” said the principal. Grade 12 teacher Xoliswa Kedama said even though they prepared for the exams, the year tested everyone. She said some had already given up. Pupil Sinalo Solani (18) said they are ready. “We have to write and do well even though we have been through so much,” she said. She thanked their teachers for being there for them. “They did their best and it is all up to us to perform,” said Sinalo.
