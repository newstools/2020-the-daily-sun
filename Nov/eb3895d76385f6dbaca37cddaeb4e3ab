I went to that river to pray and later on, my friends followed me. They happened to see a crocodile that was holding a leg and they thought it was my leg. So they took a video, went back to their cars and started telling people I was eaten by a crocodile,” he said. “But it obviously wasn’t me that they saw, but they had already shared the video. However, I’m fine, my friends are also fine. Nobody got hurt,” he continued. Moruti said they don’t know who the victim was.
