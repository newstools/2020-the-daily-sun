Deputy speaker of the KZN Legislature Mluleki Ndobe died at his Glenwood home in Durban on Friday night. It is alleged that he shot himself. Ndobe had been in and out in hospital fighting cancer. He was linked to the murder of ANCYL leader Sindiso Magaqa but charges against him were dropped. Ndobe was a teacher by profession. He was also a former mayor of the Harry Gwala District Municipality. ANC spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela confirmed that Ndobe has died. He said Ndobe was a dedicated and a disciplined cadre who had served the movement at various levels. “In all the responsibilities bestowed on him by the organisation he remained an activist focused on turning the lives of our people for the better. He served the political education unit eloquently and diligently in ensuring that we build and mould new cadres who understood their responsibilities,” said Ntombela. In a statement, KZN Legislature speaker Nontembeko Boyce said: “With his passing, our legislature and indeed the entire country has lost an upright leader, a deep thinker and a true servant of the people. In this hour of grief, we find comfort in knowing that Ndobe leaves behind a rich legacy for all of us to emulate.” KZN police spokeswoman Thembeka Mbele said an inquest docket was opened at Umbilo Police Station for investigation. Mbele said the police were called to the house and the deceased’s wife alleged that the family members were all seated in the living room when the deceased went to the main bedroom. “He apparently asked for water and when the wife was fetching the water, she heard a gunshot sound coming from the main bedroom. She rushed to the bedroom to investigate and found her husband seated on a chair with a gunshot wound on his chest,” said Mbele. She said no suicide note was found.
