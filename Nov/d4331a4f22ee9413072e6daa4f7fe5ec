THROUGH his foundation, the Maepa Education Trust (DMRN), Kgosi Maepa donated 8 000 sanitary pads and 10 scanners to four schools in Tshwane last Friday. The ANC regional leader told Daily Sun he donated the pads and scanners out of love. “It’s not a political gesture. It comes from my family,” he said. “This is something I’m doing for the community to show love and care.” The foundation is named after his children, Dimpho, Mashubathele, Rolihlahla and Nomzamo. The donation was made to Orefile Primary School in Olievenhoutbosch, Matseke Primary School in Atteridgeville, and Motsweding, Makgwaraneng and Banareng primary schools in Saulsville. He donated to local primary schools because most of the pupils come from poor families. He said he was touched when he heard about the struggles girls had to go through during their periods. “I hope the donation will make a difference,” he said. Banareng deputy principal, Ngale Mohlala, said the donation would go a long way in helping pupils who don’t have sanitary pads. “It will make their lives and concentration at school better.,” Head of department at Motsweding primary school, Maria Mabasa, said they appreciated the donation. “Our school is in an informal settlement. Poverty is rife here. We are grateful to the foundation and the donation will help the grades 6 and 7 pupils,” she said. “We were expecting only 100 pads, but they gave us 1 280. To us that’s a privilege.” Mabasa said they appreciated receiving the three scanners as theirs are broken. Makgwaraneng principal, Isaac Mahlaole, told the People’s Paper: some pupils performed badly because of the situation. “We are happy. These sanitary pads will help our girls a lot.”
