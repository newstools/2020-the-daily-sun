ANOTHER family is complaining about body parts going missing at the mortuary. Gogo Annastina Mkhwanazi’s family claimed her nipples were ripped from her breasts at Mavuta Funeral Parlour in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni. Angry residents said it was not the first such incident and it appeared as if the mortuary was selling body parts. The 66-year-old’s family made the horrific discovery on 13 November while preparing her body for the funeral. Gogo’s sister Aletta Motsogi (76) said: “The workers didn’t want us to dress the body ourselves, but we insisted. The first thing we noticed was the body was bleeding from the nostrils, but we didn’t take it seriously.” Gogo Aletta said when they removed the clothes, they were shocked to discover the nipples were missing. She said she had helped her sister bath two hours before her death and there was nothing wrong with her nipples then. Niece Thembi Motsogi said the family wanted justice. She said the mortuary also tried to rip them off by demanding R25 000 for a casket. She said her aunt had been paying for a policy with the funeral parlour for years before she died. On 25 September, Daily Sun published the story of how the family of Kwepileni Mtsokoba (74) found his 4-5 had been removed at the same funeral parlour. Manager Joyce Goge said they didn’t cut off the gogo’s nipples. “The family refused to take up the matter with forensics. They said they had already paid for the funeral and would bury her,” said Joyce. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula said a case was opened at Etwatwa cop shop. Johan Rousseau of the Funeral Industry Reformed Association said the unacceptable incident needed to be investigated. Sangoma Mahlinza Dlamini said nipples were used in muthi to attract customers, especially by tavern owners, but the practice was not common among South Africans and was mostly a Mozambican thing.
