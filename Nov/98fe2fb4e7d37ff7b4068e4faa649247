ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has arrived in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court where he will be charged for corruption related to a multi-million asbestos project. Magashule arrived accompanied by NEC members Bongani Bongo, Malusi Gigaba, Supra Mahumapelo, Dakota Legoete and ANC spokesman Pule Mabe. As he made his way in, a scuffle broke out between his supporters and police officers as the supporters were trying to force their way in. The police had to call in for more manpower as the situation was threatening to get out of hand. Eventually a peaceful solution was found and the supporters dispersed. As Magashuleâ€™s arrest was being processed inside the courtroom, his supporters continued singing and chanting outside. The court had warned that due to the capacity of the court, there would be limited space inside.
