WHEN they got hooked on nyaope, they thought they’d never stop. But today, they’ve been clean and drug-free for six months. Nicholas Plaatjie (29) from Mabopane and Hope Diale (27) from Soshanguve in Tshwane toldDaily Sun they struggled with addiction for a decade. They used to wander around the Tshwane CBD in tattered clothes, but managed to beat their habit.

Nicholas told the People’s Paper they decided to stop using drugs to change their lives for the better. “I had already lost a lot and was soon going to lose my life as well. “I had to decided if I wanted to be a nyaope slave or take control of my own life,” he said. Nicholas said when he told Hope he wanted to stop using drugs, he decided to join him. “It hasn’t been easy, but we’re fighting together,” he said. Nicholas said they attended a programme together to help stay away from drugs and started a car wash. “The car wash business keeps us busy. We make money and change our lives around,” he said. The friends said smoking nyaope was no fun. “When we got hooked we thought it was fun, but it was a trap. You live for it and don’t have time for yourself. “The only thing you want to do is get a fix,” Hope said. His advice to the youth is: don’t experiment with drugs. “It’s important to check who you surround yourself with because most of us get into drugs due to peer pressure,” he said. The friends said they wanted to look for jobs and motivate people through their stories.
