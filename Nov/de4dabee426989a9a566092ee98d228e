DEFIANT Chief Khoisan SA said he will not leave the Union Buildings in Tshwane unless his demands are met. And to help him get through this tough time, he has planted a small garden of zol – for the second time! The first zol plant he planted was removed when he was in the Eastern Cape. He believes it was officials who removed it after it had attracted attention in the media. In defiance, he has planted even more zol plants across his camp. He said those who said he had planted the zol in a public space are misguided. “I have planted the zol in my own camp for my personal use. I use it for medicinal purposes. I’m not planning to sell it or distribute it,” he said. He said what he did was not illegal. “It’s not against the law for anybody to plant and use zol in their personal space. We have been using zol as a first nation for many years,” he said. “I’m waiting. My zol is going nowhere. No one will remove it on my watch.” Chief Khoisan SA said he won’t leave the Union Buildings and demanded that the Khoi and San be given the status as the first nation, and for the term “coloured” to be scrapped and for the Khoi and San languages to be officially recognised. “As long as government doesn’t want to implement our demands, we will remain here and to survive we will plant vegetables, herbs and zol,” he said.
