TSHEGOFATSO Puleâ€™s alleged killer, Muzikayise Malephane, is set to appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court on Thursday, 19 November. The matter was previously postponed for the continuation of the pre-trial conference. NPA spokeswoman Phindile Mjonondwane said that the state learnt that the defence team wanted to submit representations to the office of the director of public prosecutions. The matter was postponed to allow them space to exercise that right. Malephane was charged with the premeditated murder of heavily pregnant Tshegofatso, who was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort in June after missing from home for four days. He was arrested on 17 June while travelling back to Gauteng from Mpumalanga.
