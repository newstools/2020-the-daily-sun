A few hours after a farmer (56) and his son (26) were attacked on Friday, police arrested four suspects. They were bust in Phomolong, Hennenman after the police worked around the clock during the night after the attack in Swartpan. However, in the early hours of Saturday morning one of the suspects aged 47 was found hanging in a police cell. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the other three suspects, in their thirties, would appear in Hennenman Magistrates Court soon for murder and house robbery. The farmer was shot dead and his son, who was stabbed, is fighting for his life in hospital. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokeswoman Ndileka Cola confirmed knowing about the alleged hanging incident in the police cells. Cola said: “The matter was reported to the directorate and an investigation has resumed. We will provide detailed information later.”
