The family of a man who was beaten to death allegedly by security guards wants the suspects to tell them why he was killed. Skhumbuzo Myeza (38) from Hammarsdale, west of Durban was found dead on 17 October. Skhumbuzo left home on 16 October and never returned. Then a video of him being assaulted by two men at an undercover parking lot was circulated on social media. His cousin Nkosinathi Ngubane (40) told Daily Sun that after he saw the video, he went to different hospitals searching for Skhumbuzo. “I couldn’t find him. I then reported the matter to the police,” said Nkosinathi. He said Skhumbuzo’s body was found wrapped in plastic with both legs tied in Mount Pleasant Road in Thornville near a quarry and he was badly beaten. Nkosinathi said it was not clear why Skhumbuzo was killed. In an 25 seconds long video, a voice is heard asking: “Ubuwazi kuhlala amantombazane, pho ububalekelani. Ushilo bezoganga” (are you aware that only women stayed there, so why you were running away. You came to commit a crime). KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a missing person’s docket was registered. “With little information at hand, the investigating officer managed to trace the building where Myeza was assaulted at the corner of Loop Street and Chapel Street in Pietermaritzburg. Two suspects were identified at the same premises. It was established that Myeza was accused of theft but nothing was found on him,” said Mbele. Mbele said a case of murder was then opened and registered at Pietermaritzburg SAPS. The suspects appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court last Wednesday and were remanded in custody. They will appear again on 9 November.
