IF YOU’RE wondering what to add to your Christmas shopping gift list, then Sony PlayStation 5 is just what Father Christmas ordered. Should you have R12 000 to spare this festive season, take your gaming experience to the next level with this ultra-high speed SSD machine. If you thought the Xbox Series X was the ultimate size gaming console, the PS5 is absolutely huge and heavy, 9cm taller and 11cm deeper than its rival. Needing sufficient space to keep it cool, this gaming console is not for those who work in small spaces. In terms of features, the PS5 comes with 8-core AMD CPU with 3,5GHz, and AMD graphic processors with 10,28 teraflops. With an 825GB of storage, Sony has integrated the PS5’s storage to make it run faster. Gaming experts say the PS5 offers next generation gaming. From the logos and 4K HDR user interface to its new home screen with game cards that fill your screen and speakers when highlighted, it’s considered a fresh, super-stylish package.
