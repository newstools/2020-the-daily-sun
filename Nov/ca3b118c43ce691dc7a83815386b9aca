FORMER president Jacob Zuma will know tomorrow whether he’s been successful in his application to have State Capture Inquiry chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo recuse himself or not. Zondo in a brief sitting on Tuesday said he had hoped to deliver the judgment on Zuma’s application on the day, but needed more time as there were “quite some documents that I needed to go through carefully” before that. “I’m going to use today (Tuesday) to work on the judgment. So we’re going to adjourn and resume tomorrow at 10am by which time I hope I’ll be ready to deliver my judgment on the recusal application,” said Zondo. “If for some reason I’m not ready for 10am, communication will be sent to all concerned. It might be 11am but I’ll aim for 10am. I’ve already communicated this to counsel on both sides so they’re aware of it.” Zuma’s legal representative Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane submitted that his client would like to put on record a statement that deals with Zondo’s statement, which he submitted disputing claims by Zuma that they were friends. “It may or may not put in dispute some of the things you stated,” Sikhakhane said, adding that he is hoping by the time he delivers the judgment tomorrow, they would be ready with that statement. Sikhakhane also told the commission Zuma has had a death in the family and has requested to be excused on Wednesday as he needed time to attend to domestic matters. Zondo granted the permission and said he hoped Zuma would be back on Thursday for the proceedings, depending on which way his decision would go.
