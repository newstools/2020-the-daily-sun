MAMELODI Sundowns new signing Haashim Domingo is determined to cement his spot and become a regular for the star studded Brazilians. Domingo was one of a host of new marquee signings for the Tshwane giants at the beginning of the season, joining an already impressive team. He has watched the Brazilians dominate the local game and even conquer the continent and now wants to do the same with the club. He has had a decent start to the season, but will be hoping to see more game time in a team that is filled with top talent the country and the continent has to offer. In addition to his hopes to win plenty of trophies with Downs, Domingo also wants to enhance his chances of making it into the Bafana Bafana side. “I want to play regularly, help the team to win trophies, especially the Caf Champions League. By playing that will also help in my chances of playing for Bafana,” Domingo told his club’s website. The 24-year-old Ajax Cape Town youth product brings with him a lot of experience even at his age, having played overseas too. He played for Portuguese outfit Vitória Guimarães SC B alongside former Downs midfielder Bongani Zungu, before having a spell in Norway. He is now looking forward to further enhance his reputation in the DStv Premiership with one of the top teams in the country. “I am enjoying the time I’ve spent with the club since joining, and you know Sundowns have a lot of great players and that is what made me join the team,” added Domingo. “It has been a great time and I am learning every day at training.” Some of the players who Domingo has to compete with are the reigning Footballer of the Season Themba Zwane, Uruguayan wizard Gaston Sirino and the promising Siphelele Mkhulise, among others. Sundowns signalled their intentions for the current season by adding the likes of Domingo, Kermit Erasmus, Peter Shalulile, Gift Motupa, Ricardo Goss and more to an already all conquering squad that won the domestic treble last season.
