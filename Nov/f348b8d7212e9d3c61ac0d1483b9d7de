A North West police officer was arrested for drinking and driving and using a state car without authorisation. This follows an incident in which the officer was captured in a video hitting a pole and struggling to get out of the car, seemingly because he was highly intoxicated. In the video, circulating on social media, the officer struggled to stand steady and his speech was blurred when residents stopped him and showed him that he had crushed into someone’s yard. The officer was then seen holding a plastic bag full of what’s presumed to be booze in it. He was in full police uniform at that time. Residents called the police after the incident, which led to the arrest of the officer. North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said SAPS management was appalled by an unprofessional and unbecoming conduct of a police constable stationed at Wolmaransstad. Brigadier Mokgwabone said a case of driving under the influence of alcohol and reckless and/or negligent driving was opened for investigation.  He said preliminary investigations revealed that the constable wasn’t authorised to drive a state motor vehicle. “As a result, he’ll also face an additional charge of using a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent. Departmental investigation will also be instituted against the member in terms of the SAPS Discipline Regulations,” he said. The Provincial Commissioner of North West, Lieutenant General Sello Kwena, expressed his disapproval of the cop’s conduct. He said all SAPS members were obliged at all times to conduct themselves in a professional manner and adhere to the code of conduct, including using available resources responsibly and taking into account the needs of the community. The arrested cop was released on R500 bail. He is expected to appear in the Wolmaransstad Magistrates Court today.
