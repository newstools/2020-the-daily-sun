MAMELODI Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana has dedicated his Puskas award nomination to Anele Ngcongca as an honour to his late teammate. Kekana will battle it out with the likes of Atletico Madrid’s Luis Suarez and Tottenham Hotspur winger Son for the most beautiful goal of the year. ”As a club, we are still mourning the loss of our brother. In training, we feel it. Amidst the sadness, it is difficult to process this, and I have to dedicate this nomination to my brother Anele Ngcongca,” said Kekana. Kekana has been nominated for the trademark long-range goal he banged in when Sundowns drew 1-1 all against Cape Town City on 20 August last year. Also vying for the Puskas are Caroline Weir of Manchester City, Leonel Quinonez (Universidad Catolica, Zlatko Junuzoic (Rapid Wien), Sophie Ingle (Arsenal Women), Andre-Pierre Gignac (UANL Tigres), Shirley Cruz (Costa Rica women), Jordan Flores (Shamrock Rovers) and Giorgian De Arrascaeta (Ceara SC). This is Kekana’s nomination, having been picked for the goal for South Africa in their 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Cameroon in March 2016. “The winner of the Fifa Puskas Award will be selected by an international jury comprising a panel of Fifa legends and by the fans from all over the world registered on fifa.com. Each of the two groups of voters within the jury has the same electoral weight,” Fifa has explained in a statement.
