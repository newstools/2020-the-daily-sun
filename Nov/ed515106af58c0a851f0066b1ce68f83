VETERAN Moroka Swallows defender, Vuyo Mere, said they have set the bar very high for themselves this season. The 36-year-old insists that they have a strong squad capable of making a serious challenge for the DStv Premiership. The Birds have shown that they mean business since their promotion. They are yet to taste defeat, so far, and are aiming to register their third win against fellow rookies TS Galaxy, whom they welcome at the Dobsonville Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm). Swallows are tied with Baroka FC and Mamelodi Sundowns on seven points from three games, while Galaxy occupy seventh position on five points. Said Mere: “We have a strong team that can face anyone. We don’t rely on individuals because there are guys who are not in the squad to play on Saturday, but they are capable of getting results. It’s not impossible to win the league and we won’t limit ourselves by saying we want the top eight. We want to win it because we have done it in the NFD (GladAfrica Championship). If we restrict ourselves, then we won’t win it. We will do our best, whatever the outcome. We are high in confidence with a positive mindset.” The former Sundowns defender hopes the international Fifa break won’t kill their momentum. “Our preparations have gone well. The break gave coach Brandon Truter a chance to improve on games we played and also welcome new players like Sifiso Hlanti. We can’t undermine TS Galaxy because we saw how they played against Kaizer Chiefs (drew goalless).” Swallows will pin their hopes on striker Ruzaigh Gamildien to swing the game in their favour, while keeping a close eye on winger Lindokuhle Mbatha to avoid defeat.
