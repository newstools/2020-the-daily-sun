THE ANC chairman in ward 11 and the Matjhabeng Local Municipality transport MMC are not on good terms. Tshepo Davids claims MMC Vicky Morris hit him with stones and called him the K-word. He wanted to see his colleague behind bars! A case has been opened with Bronville police in the Free State. “On 5 November we had a mass gathering for a sanitation project in Bronville when Morris attacked me in front of the community,” Davids told Daily Sun. “I was hit by a stone on my back and saved by members of the community.” Davids claimed he was beaten with a sjambok. “The injury is internal and has affected my spine. According to the doctor, it damaged my tissue. “Each time when I approach Morris on his alleged corruption case, he attacks me personally.” He said Morris defamed him in public in November 2016 and he took the case to court.  “I won the case after the court ordered him to pay me R200 000 in damages. “Now he’s assaulted me and used the K-word.” Morris wouldn’t comment. “If you want to talk to me, come and see me face to face,” he said. Morris said the matter is sub judice, but he was willing to provide proof in his own defence. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed that cases of assault and crimen injuria were registered at Bronville cop shop. “Davids alleges he was assaulted with stones, sjambokked and called the K-word. “Investigations continue and nobody has been arrested.”
