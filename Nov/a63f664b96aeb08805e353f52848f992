DYLAN Kerr is a survivor! The Englishman finalised his contract with Black Leopards Tuesday. The former Baroka FC coach was on Tuesday introduced to Lidoda Duvha players as he takes over from axed Patrick Aussems. As reported by SunSport, Aussems was fired on Sunday following three successive defeats in the DStv Premiership. This will be Kerr's second spell with the Venda-based side having helped them survive relegation in 2018-19 season. He resigned in May 2019 to return home in England to take care of his sick mom. He returned to the country last season where he helped Baroka survive relegation on the last day. However, his stay was short-lived since he was sacked last week after he faced the club's Disciplinary Committee. Kerr on Tuesday morning told SunSport that he was due to sign with Leopard: “I am not yet the Leopards coach at the moment. I have spoken to them and hopefully everything will be organised within the next 24 or 48 hours.” If they agree on terms with Leopards boss David Thidiela, he could sit on the bench on Saturday when they host Maritzburg United in a crunch league game at Thohoyandou Stadium. If his permit is not ready, this would mean Aussems' assistant Morgan Shivambu, who helped the club survive relegation via the relegation promotion play-offs, will be in charge.
