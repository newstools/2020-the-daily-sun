PITSO “Jingles” Mosimane has embraced one of the most difficult jobs in African football with ease. The former Mamelodi Sundowns coach entered the lion’s den when he took over the reigns of the African Club of the Century, Al Ahly. But a few months into his new challenge, Jingles, as Mosimane is affectionately known, is going about his business seamlessly. Mosimane has already secured the Egyptian Premier League title for a record 42nd time for the Red Eagles and their fifth in a row. This past weekend, he guided his side into Egyptian Cup semi-finals after their 2-1 win over Abu Qiir Fertilisers. Mosimane will be eyeing a treble with the Red Eagles but for that to happen, he will have to lift both the Egyptian Cup and the Caf Champions League. The Champions League will be the competition on which the Kagiso-born mentor will be judged in Egypt. His side have to overcome fierce rivals Zamalek in the final, set to be played at the Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria on Friday (9pm).  Al Ahly, who have dominated this competition in the past, are eyeing their ninth title while Mosimane will be looking to grab his second. He led Sundowns to their maiden Champions League title in 2016 and was later named the African Coach of the Year. As he prepares for arguably his toughest test as Ahly mentor, Jingles remains humble. “We haven’t won the cup, we’re just in the final,” said Jingles. “It’ll be a difficult challenge. I’m still trying to instil my philosophy into the team. I can see it’s coming but it’ll take a bit of time. And time is something we don’t have.” Ahly are expected to get the better of Zamalek, especially given their history in the competition as the most successful club in the competition. They also won the Egyptian Premier League with a mammoth gap of 21 points over the White Knights.
