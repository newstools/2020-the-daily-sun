FORMER Zambian international Clifford Mulenga has opened up about his drinking problems, which destroyed chances of him becoming one of the most feared strikers of his generation. Once touted as the future Chipolopolo captain, Mulenga could only earn 28 caps between 2005 and 2012, as a result of alcohol abuse. The 33-year-old forward, now clubless, admitted to the local media in Zambia that he could have enjoyed a long successful career had it not been for his long-term ”heavy drinking attitude”. “I think alcohol killed my career. I say this for the love I have for myself. I always had the confidence to the point that I felt I could do anything. But sometimes I forgot and grabbed a bottle when I shouldn’t have,” said Mulenga. Mulenga was first introduced to SA football as a 17-year-old youngster, turning professional with the University of Pretoria back in 2004. He also played for Wits, Thana Royal Zulu, Black Aces, SuperSport United, Ajax Cape Town, Moroka Swallows, Mbombela United and Jomo Cosmos. He also had a brief loan stint with Swedish side Orgryte IS. But Mulenga, voted the 2007 Caf Young Player of the Year for his sparkling performances as Zambia finished fourth the in 2007 Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations finals, never really achieved success at a senior level. He was infamously thrown out of Zambia team at the 2012 Afcon in Gabon after he reportedly went out drinking. “I now sit and contemplate where I come from, what could have been of my career? I feel like I have let myself down. If I could change something about Clifford Mulenga, I wouldn’t have drunk as much as I did,” Mulenga said.
