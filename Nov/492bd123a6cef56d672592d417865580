WAYDE van Niekerk’s returned to Potchefstroom in bizarre fashion on Tuesday despite winning the race. The  world record for the 400m holder slipped at the start of his 400m race. Van Niekerk had to come from behind to win in 45.89 seconds. The Olympic champion took to Twitter after the race to say that he wasn't satisfied with his time. "Far from satisfied with tonight's performance, but a lot closer to where I want to be. It will come together at the perfect time," Van Niekerk wrote on the social media. Van Niekerk holds the world record for the 400m event with a time of 43.03 seconds. In April this year, he told the Olympic Channel that he hoped to run below 43 seconds. "I am hungrier than before," he said. "I still believe I can go sub-43. "I can go way better than what I have in 100m and 200m, that’s where my mind was before the injury and that's where my mind is at for the future."
