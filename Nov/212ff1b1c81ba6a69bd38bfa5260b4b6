THE Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation and Mentoring and Empowerment Programme for Young Women SA hosted young girls and their mothers on Saturday, 7 November. The aim was to have discussions about issues they faced in their kasi of Westbury, Joburg. One of the girls, Lamique Adams (15), told Daily Sun the programme was helpful for girls her age. “When I first came to Memprow SA, I was shy and afraid to speak to anyone. I’ve since learnt to have confidence and courage,” she said. Lamique said Memprow SA was important as it helped girls share their feelings with someone who could help them. The programme’s chairwoman, Gugu Motlanthe, spoke to some the young girls at the event. “I was speaking to them about school. We are giving them hope that we are there for them and care about them,” she said. Sophie Okeke, co-ordinator of Woman of Vision in the area, said it was important to have groups such as Memprow SA. “After realising that so many girls at the age of 14 got pregnant, we decided we need someone to mentor the girls. “We want them to understand that just because things are bad at home, it doesn’t mean there isn’t somebody out there who can listen to their problems,” said Sophie.
