Hawks are yet to confirm if indeed self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his wife Mary have fled the country. Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale said there were unconfirmed reports that Bushiri and his wife have absconded from South Africa, which is in contravention of their bail conditions as set in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on 4 November. She said at this stage, they can confirm that he did not report at the police station as requested and agreed upon, which is also an act of contravention of the court order. “Investigators together with prosecutors have been working tirelessly since it came to light that he did not report at the police station. The current posts purporting to be issued by Bushiri, who is said to be in Malawi are being authenticated and verified,” she said. Mogale said investigation about the failure to comply with the court order was underway. Bushiri was expected to hold a press briefing in Lilongwe, Malawi at 14.00. It was reported it will be streamed live across all media networks.
