HITMAKER Cassper Nyovest has melted people’s hearts with a snap of him and his son. The To Whom It May Concern rapper shared a glimpse of his son, Khotso, on Twitter and Instagram yesterday and fans loved the picture. Khotso was lying on the doting dad’s chest with his face hidden. His fans were impressed and proud of him for being a present father. Back in September, Cassper said he wasn’t going to share his son’s pictures on social media because there are real-life witches who prey on people’s energies on social media.
