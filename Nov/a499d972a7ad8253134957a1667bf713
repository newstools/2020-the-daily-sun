FORMER Denel Land Systems CEO Stephan Burger says group CEO Riaz Saloojee instructed him to award a 10-year tender to Gupta-owned VR Laser. Burger, who was testifying at the Zondo Commission on Tuesday 24 November, said this went against Denel policy. “We went through a process where the highest authority supported this. We thought it was a good idea.” Burger admitted he ignored media reports and advice from former procurement executive Celia Malahlela and former head of supply chain Dennis Mlambo. When he testified last year, Saloojee claimed he was fired after refusing to co-operate with the Guptas to capture Denel. Burger claimed he thought he was doing what was best for the company. “I had the option of cancelling the contract based on media reports and Malahlela’s opinion but I was not sure on what basis I could do it. I thought we had a valid agreement,” he said. In 2015, Denel awarded a multi-million rand tender to VR Laser to manufacture 217 hills for Badger armoured vehicles for the SA defence force under Project Hoefyster. Burger told the commission that Malahlela was against Denel doing business with the Guptas, as he believed it would bring the company into disrepute. “I wanted to make sure when we have a contract with a partner. We do our bit to uphold the agreement. I never thought it was in conflict with the law,” he said.
