TROMPIES and “Sphithiphithi” may have hung up their soccer boots, but they’re still very active. Former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates stars Pollen “Trompies” Ndlanya and Dumisa “Sphithiphithi” Ngobe are among the social golfers who play at different golf courses around Mzansi. The legends were invited by Steve Tshwete Municipality to play in a better ball Stableford tournament at the Mayoral Golf Day in Middelburg, Gauteng recently. Trompies, who plays off a 12-handicap, said: “We had a great day on the course. I finished in fifth place with my partner.” He said he was busy with player development in his home kasi of Daveyton. Ekurhuleni. Sphithiphithi, who plays off an 18 handicap, said they were introduced to the game by former Bafana Bafana coach Clive Barker in 1996. “Clive used to take players to play golf while preparing for matches for Bafana Bafana to take their minds off the big match. That’s when we got hooked. ‘We were soccer players, but we never stopped playing golf. It keeps our minds at ease and we feel relaxed.” He said he and Trompies were in the tournament to represent Mzansi’s soccer legends. “We want to encourage sportsmen and women to play. It is a great way to relax. They must do away with the idea that it’s a whites-only sport. Sport does not have colour and it unites us.” Sphithiphithi said he was now developing aspiring young soccer players and is working with Tim Sukazi at TS Galaxy.
