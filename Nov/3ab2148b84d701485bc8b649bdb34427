COMEDIAN and entertainer Bobo Mbhele is set to release a song titled Ilwa Ntombo tomorrow. But some people have already stolen the song title. On Tuesday, Bobo informed her followers the song and its title had been stolen. “I’d like to clarify that my song is only coming out this Friday. The one which is already out is not mine. “As you can see, I’m not even on the cover, which means I’ve got nothing to do with this song. I don’t know the person behind this song except that what he’s doing is wrong. I’m already pursuing legal steps,” wrote Bobo on Facebook. ALSO READ: BABES LOOKING FOR FRESH STUFF! Bobo’s manager, Mafutha Sokhela, said they were shocked to learn that a song with the same title was already out. “I was informed about this on Tuesday when people called me to verify if the song is out. “This person also made sure he releases his song before Friday. This has also disturbed the release of Bobo’s song,” said Mafutha. But they will still release Bobo’s song and that they have escalated the matter to their legal advisor, Advocate Nombuso Msibi. Msibi said they were trying to get hold of the culprits. “Once we find them, we’ll send a letter to their legal representative, demanding them to pull the song from all social media platforms. “TV presenter and comedian Trevor Noah, Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi, actress Nomzamo Mbatha and media personality Somizi Mhlongo have all used this slogan. “It’d be wrong for anyone to make money from it without asking permission from Bobo’s management. As it is, we’re trying to copyright this slogan for the owner to be able to generate money from it,” said Msibi.
