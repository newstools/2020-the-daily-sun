THE Gauteng Health Department has to be cleansed of all corruption before a new MEC is appointed. This is what Premier David Makhura told members of the legislature during a virtual meeting on Tuesday, 24 November. Makhura said the process of fixing the department was almost complete and a new MEC could be named as early as next week. READ: 4-5 ESCAPES BOILING WATER! He said that after the Special Investigative Unit investigated the department, he received a report from public health commissioner, Mike Seloane. The commissioner highlighting systematic and structural weaknesses in the department. Seloane’s report pointed out that problems in the department were deepening and undermined service delivery. “The fundamental issue is that I could have simply appointed an MEC without dealing with fundamentals, which I now say have been brought in writing to me by very major institutions,” he said. “I had to take into account what we needed to do to address these problems.” Makhura said he consulted with the national health department on many of the issues. The provincial director general met his counterpart in the national department to map out an intervention. The premier said this would ensure that when the new MEC was appointed, there would be public health experts and managers in place to help re-organise the department. “Among the issues are clinicians saying the department is unable to deliver optimal services on the ground,” he said.
