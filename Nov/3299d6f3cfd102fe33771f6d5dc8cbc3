PHUMEZA “Nonkosi Omuhle” Ndawose is changing the lives of young girls in her area. The 30-year-old from the Sihlahleni area in Mount Frere, Eastern Cape, works with 32 kids from Bhislan. She teaches them cultural dance. She also teaches them how to look after themselves. Other activities include acting, poetry, dance and other artforms. Phumeza told Daily Sun she wanted to guide the girls. “These kids are aged between five and 19. The group keeps getting bigger,” she said. “Regardless of their past, kids can change and be great if they get the necessary guidance.” Phumeza has a group for the young ones, a group for the middle-aged kids and one for the older girls. She wants to do more but finances are limiting her. “When we go to an event I pay for everything. I work in a kitchen and don’t get a lot of money, but I sacrifice because I want the best for these kids,” she said. Phumeza said while the parents allowed their kids to join her programmes, they weren’t prepared to part with money for transport or food. “I’d be grateful to get assistance with uniforms and someone who can provide transport and food when we go to events,” she said. Asawela Nokwanele (14) said: “Nonkosi Omuhle has changed us. She taught us a lot of new things. I can dance and she’s helped us understand ourselves as young girls.”
