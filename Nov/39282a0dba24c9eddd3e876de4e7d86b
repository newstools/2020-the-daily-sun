PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has relaxed restrictions on
international travel. The president relaxed the restrictions even though some
countries have been experiencing second waves of Covid-19 spikes. People who want to travel internationally or come into the
country will be subjected to compulsory health protocols and the presentation
of a negative Covid-19 certificate. “By using rapid tests and strict monitoring, we intend to
limit the spread of the infection through importation. We expect that these
measures will greatly assist businesses in the tourism and hospitality
sectors,” Ramaphosa said. GUIDELINES: The traveller will have to provide a valid certificate of a
negative test obtained not more than 72 hours before the date of travel. The
traveller will be required to quarantine him or herself at his or her own costs
should they fail to submit a certificate as proof of a negative test. Daily commuters from neighbouring countries, who attend or
teach at a school in South Africa and who are allowed entry into and exit from
the country, will be subjected to compliance with protocols relating to
screening for Covid-19 and quarantine or isolation, where necessary, and the
wearing of a face mask. Upon arrival at the port of entry, the traveller will be
screened for any Covid-19 symptoms or for contact with people who have been
infected with the coronavirus. Travellers will also need to provide proof of accommodation
address should they need to self-quarantine at the time of arrival in the
country. All passenger ships for international leisure purposes are
prohibited from disembarking any international passengers at any South African
seaport. Passenger ships are allowed to call at any South African
seaport only for the following purposes: Disembarking returning South African citizens and holders of
