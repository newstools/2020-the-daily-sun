SHOCKED pupils had to be moved to another block when their classroom’s roof was blown off during a storm on Tuesday, 24 November. Pupils at Diphetogo Secondary School in Klipgat, North West, had to write exams in another block. A grade 11 pupil said: “Although we were scared and it was raining, we didn’t all rush to the door at once. We didn’t even feel the rain on our skin.” She said once teachers were sure no one was injured, writing continued. “We were almost finished when the roof was blown off, so we only wrote a little while in the other room.” KILLER WOMEN GANG STRIKES AGAIN! She said they were lucky the roof didn’t cave in on top of them, but was blown away. Resident Beauty Chirwa (45) said the school’s buildings are very old. “I went to the school and it wasn’t new then. We need a new school. This is a wake-up call. The education department needs to fight accidents waiting to happen.” Education spokesman Elias Malindi said no one was injured and exams were continuing. “Only one block was affected, and the school is now using the other blocks while affected rooms are still being fixed.”
