Neighbour Pityi Mangcalaza (61) said he was struggling to believe the news. “He was a nice boy who was loved by many. “Even when he was playing overseas, he would come back and hang out with the people he grew up with. He would buy braai stuff for them and assist those who needed help.” Monica Mkhokeli (51) said Anele’s father always spoke fondly of him.  “I really feel for his parents at this point,” she said. Athenkosi Qayiya (20) said he used to hang out with Anele in the local park. “He was not popular then. He was playing for United Aces here before he got a chance to play for Fortune FC. From thereon, he never looked back,” he said. “He ended up overseas but remained humble when he came back to ekasi.” ALSO READ: NO SHORTCUTS ON THE SALE OF BOOZE Athenkosi said he couldn’t believe it when he first saw the news on Instagram. “I went to his parents’ house but I couldn’t see any movement, everything was just normal. It’s still unbelievable. It feels like I’m having a bad dream I will wake up from,” he said. Gugulethu Development Forum spokesman, Vincent Domingo, said it was a big loss to the community. “Many young people here looked up to him for inspiration. “He was still a young man who had a lot to give to his kasi. We are devastated,” he said.
