ZODWA Wabantu is set to be the face of TNS’s new song, Zodwa Wabantu. The song will be released at the end of the month. The song features Phila, Danger and Zodwa Wabantu. “This is a house song. I used Zodwa as the face thereof. The song is not necessarily about her, but she’s used as a symbol,” said TNS. “I decided to use Zodwa because people love her. She’s relevant, especially now that we’re going into the festive season. I’m confident she’ll carry this song through.” TNS said next month he’ll be shooting a video for the song. “In the video, people will get to see Zodwa doing what she does best, which is dancing. “We’re finalising the locations for the video. Thereafter, we shall be starting with the shoot. I’m excited about this one and am sure people will enjoy it too,” he said. ALSO READ: GADAFFIE LEAVES GENERATIONS! TNS described his relationship with Zodwa as professional, but fun. “I’ve known her for sometime now and always wanted to work close with her. She’s one of my biggest inspirations. Working with her on this song was hassle-free because she’s open to suggestions. “Generally, she’s a free-spirited person and always motivates me. I’d therefore say working with her on this song taught me a lot about the industry and about myself as an artist,” TNS told SunBuzz he composed and created the beat for the song. “Basically, I did everything. Zodwa is also an introduction to my next album to be released next year in January,” he said. “This will be a 30-track double album. Those who’ve already placed pre-orders will be receiving a song every Friday until next year January.”
