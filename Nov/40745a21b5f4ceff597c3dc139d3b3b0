SPAR Proteas head coach Dorette Badenhorst has announced her 15-players squad that will face Malawi in the International Test series. The Malawi Queens and Proteas will battle it out in a three match test series starting from Thursday 26-29 November at the Sun City Superbowl in Rustenburg. Earlier in the month, Badenhorst and assistant coach Dumisani Chauke worked with a pool of 30 players during a recently concluded three-day training camp in Sun City. The coaching duo eventually whittled the team down to 15 players with some familiar names and youngsters in the mix. "We have had to look at a group of players to choose from and our challenge was always balancing experience with new blood,” said Badenhorst. Badenhorst revealed that she picked her 15-player squad thinking ahead of 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town. She stated: "The goal is 2023 so we needed to make sure that we pick the best for this series and also make sure that each player that is here will get a run so we can see what they can do. "The mood in the camp is high and I think we pushed ourselves hard today at training." The two nations have met 33 times with Proteas winning 20 times, drew once and lost 12 times. The last time these two nations met in Cape Town last year, the Proteas emerged victorious winning the match 56 – 51. The first Test is set to get underway on Thursday at 7pm. Proteas 15-player squad: Sigrid Burger, Khanyisa Chawane, Izette Griesel, Rome Joubert, Kamogelo Maseko, Phumza Maweni, Tshina Mdau, Sikholiwe Mdletshe, Bongiwe Msomi (captain), Lenize Potgieter, Lefebre Rademan, Monique Reyneke, Nicola Smith, Shadine vd Merwe, Ine-Mari Venter South Africa v Malawi fixtures: Thursday, 26 November - 1st Test at 7pm Friday, 27 November - 2nd Test at 7pm Sunday, 29 November - 3rd Test at 1pm
