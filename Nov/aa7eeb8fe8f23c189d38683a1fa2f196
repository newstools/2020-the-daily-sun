LOVEBIRDS Prince Kaybee and Zola Mhlongo have opened up about their relationship. This is a bold move by the couple who recently revealed that they met through social media when they participated in the “how it started vs how it’s going” challenge. They recently appeared on YouTube series Defining Love. In the lengthy video, Prince Kaybee, whose real name is Kabelo Motsamai, revealed if it wasn’t for social media he wouldn’t have met Zola. “I was in Bloemfontein and she was in Durban. If it wasn’t for social media, I wouldn’t have known her because we were in different cities at the time,” he said. Although Prince Kaybee is a well-known musician, the Gagasi FM radio presenter said she did not know who he was at the time and had to look him up.

Soon after his comment, everyone was excited and asked me if I know who he is, but I didn’t. Then I looked him up and I was like oh my word, this is the guy who released the song Wajellwa. Kaybee didn’t waste time to pursue his princess. Soon after Zola thanked him for the comment, he sent her a direct message. However, the radio presenter revealed that they didn’t start dating then because she was in a relationship. “We didn’t communicate for a while until he became a resident DJ on the radio station I worked for. We would bump into each other every now and then and that’s when things started. When I started falling for him, I was like this guy is a DJ, we don’t fall for DJ’s because they will play you like a disc. “But to my surprise his heart is pure and he’s the type I prayed for. I can definitely say God answers my prayers with each day I spend with him,” she said. Smitten Prince Kaybee revealed he’s looking forward to having kids with the radio presenter.
