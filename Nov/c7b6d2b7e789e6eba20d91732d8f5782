SHE is only 13, but is already committed to healing people. Tshwarelo Letsoalo from Soshanguve block TT in Tshwane celebrated her homecoming on Saturday. She spent over a year at a thwasa initiation school! Family and friends witnessed one of the youngest izangoma in the country showing off her dancing skills. She told Daily Sun she’s going to put her ancestral gift to good use. Tshwarelo said she was taken to ephehlweni (training) a year ago after she encountered problems. She used to faint and collapse when at home or at school. “I’d lose myself and my body would start shaking,” she said. She apparently saw things before they happened, and that’s why her parents decided to take her to Gogo Mapula Rakgale.  Gogo Rakgale said Tshwarelo was a very troubled child when she first came to her. “But she was dedicated to her journey and her ancestors healed her. She excelled in all the tasks given to her,” she said. “Today, as we bring her home, I pray she continues to be as dedicated as she was at my place and may the gods protect her.”  Tshwarelo’s proud mum, Evelyn (44), was happy to have her child back home and healed. “I was worried when she undertook her spiritual journey that she won’t be dedicated to her school work anymore, but I didn’t need to worry,” she said. “She always made time for school. She performed well and even her peers no longer make fun of her.” Tshwarelo loves school! “I won’t have to force her to focus on her books. The modern sangoma needs a good education,” said Evelyn. Tshwarelo’s father, William, said: “Before we took her to gogo Rakgale, we always received phone calls from people telling us she’d collapsed at school or anywhere.” But Tshwarelo has healed is happy now.
