We don’t know where this man is,” said Baliswa. “He could come back for the rest of us at any time.” According to the family, the six victims were killed with an axe.Nomzamo’s mum, Nolungile Sikhundwana, said the killer even cut her daughter’s ID to pieces with the axe. “We don’t know how we’re going to bury six people as none of us is employed. “The worst thing is that he ran away with the Sassa grant cards of all the five kids.” Baliswa said the suspect had been abusing her sister and the kids for years. “A week ago she told me she wasn’t happy and wanted a divorce,” she said.
