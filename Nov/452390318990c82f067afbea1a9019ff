A DA councillor has landed himself in trouble after he allegedly assaulted a police officer and damaged a police car on Thursday. The incident happened in Rammolutsi near Viljoenskroon, Free State, when municipal workers demolished structures erected at empty municipal sites. The police were attending to the complaint when a constable was assaulted, allegedly by David Nzunga, who is based at the Moqhaka Local Municipality. Resident Thabang Seope said he was shocked to learn that a leader was fighting the police. He said: “He’s supposed to lead by example. We should learn from him how to deal with a bad situation. He can’t control his anger and that’s worrisome. I love this party but I’m disappointed. I hope the law will take its course.” Pule Mahloko posted Nzunga’s photo on Facebook and said: “DA councillor in Moqhaka arrested for beating a police officer in Rammolutsi. His name is David Nzunga.” Free State police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele told Daily Sun: “On Thursday at about 3pm, a police officer, who is a constable stationed at Viljoenskroon, attended to a complaint where structures erected at empty municipal sites were being demolished. The suspect started attacking the police, pulling the complainant out of the vehicle. The suspect assaulted the complainant and damaged the rear canopy of the state vehicle. The value of the damage is about R15 000. The 34-year-old suspect was arrested in connection with malicious damage to property and assaulting a police officer. He is expected to appear in the Viljoenskroon Magistrates Court soon.”
