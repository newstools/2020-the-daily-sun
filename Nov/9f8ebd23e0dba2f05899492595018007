IT’S advantage Bloemfontein Celtic in their MTN8 semi-final clash against defending champions SuperSport United. This after Phunya Sele Sele managed to grab an all-important away goal in the first leg played at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday. Their reliable captain Ndumiso Mabena was the man who got the crucial opener while Ghampani Lungu equalised for Matsatsantsa. The away goal gives Celtic a slight advantage heading into the second leg to be played at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (3 pm). SuperSport, however, are not down and out as they will be backing themselves to get an away goal of their own. Celtic coach John Maduka believes his side should have won the match given the number of chances they created. “We managed to get many chances but we were not sharp enough,” Maduka told SuperSport TV. “We should have wrapped it up in the first half but we were not clinical. We missed chances and this always comes back to haunt you. “The weather also affected our style a little bit, but that’s not an excuse.” SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo was not happy with his side’s showing in the first half but was pleased with their showing in the second. “We did not have a good start I feel we were a bit flat in the first half,” said Tembo. “But we gave a much better performance in the second half. We could have done better with the goal we conceded but I’m happy we improved. We take the positives and move on.”
