THE murder case against members of the Mancoba Seven Angels Church has been postponed to 15 March. Andani Monco, Kwanele Ndlwana, Siphosomzi Tshefu, Siphesihle Tatsi and Phumzile Mhlatywa have been in jail since they were bust for the murder of five cops in February 2018. The trial had to be postponed earlier this year, because of the outbreak of Covid-19. At the time, Mthatha High Court was hearing the testimony of witnesses who were at the Ngcobo Police Station when it was ambushed. The trial resumed early in November. Three cops gave testimony yesterday. Among them was Sergeant Bomikazi Ndzamela, who had been an officer for 15 years. He and three others arrested Monco a few days before the incident.  The state asked Ndzamela whether the survivors had been sent for counselling before their statements were taken. She said no one was sent for counselling and described the period after the attack as traumatising. Security was tight at the court, with armed police officers moving around. The court postponed the matter to the week of 15 to 26 March, as one of the most important witnesses could not appear due to illness. When the case resumes, the court is expected to discuss the accusedâ€™s constitutional rights and hear more evidence. The five accused are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery and illegal possession of a firearms.
