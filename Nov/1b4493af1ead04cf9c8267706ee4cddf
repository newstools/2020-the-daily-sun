WOMEN across Mzansi are expected to take to the streets to demand inclusion in the economy. Normal citizens, politicians, religious representatives and businesswomen will take part in the march organised by Women of South Africa. It will happen on Friday, 4 December. Among their demands is making it illegal to pay women less than men for doing the same job. The marchers are also expected to call on banks and other funding institutions to support more women-owned businesses. WoSA, established in August, wants to ensure women own 51,2% of the economy. Spokeswoman Staff Sithole told Daily Sun: “As women, we need to push for a shift in the narrative of our role in the economy. “We have to work hard to reshape the victim narrative and encourage more women to demand their place in the economy.” The SunTeam spoke to some women in the informal and formal business sectors, who said they felt undermined by male customers who sometimes ask them out. Dalphina Msimango from Winnie Mandela squatter camp in Ekurhuleni said she’d been selling fruit and vegetables on the streets for some time. “I often get robbed of my stock and money because I knock off late,” she told the People’s Paper. “I can’t leave early because I only start working and making money late in the afternoon when people are making their way home. “The men try to take advantage of us by asking us out instead of supporting our businesses. “When I knock off I’m always fearful that I might get raped and murdered.” Ice cream seller Zothe Muluvhu said men don’t see them as real businesspeople.  “They look down on us and ask for our numbers,” she said. Jabu Khumalo, who runs a traditional chemist, also said it’s time for women to be recognised. “We also call on government to give traditional shops the same treatment as western pharmacies because we carry out the same duties,” she said.
