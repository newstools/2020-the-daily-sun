Asante Mnene is destined to be a chicken farmer. She grew up at her grandparents’ farm in Nigel, Ekurhuleni, where she learned to take care of animals and grow vegetables and fruit. Asante (22) from Vosloorus said her wish was to own a farm. But for now she’s using her grandparents’ land to start her poultry project.  She said: “I have a business plan and other ideas for broiler production and layer production. I’ve already registered my company but I need funding to get on with it.” Asante completed a farming course at Buhle Farmers Academy in Delmas in September, where her focus was poultry production and farming planning. She said she planned to add to her farming skills and learn more about piggery, vegetation and other types of farming. She share with Daily Sun that chickens are very funny creatures.  “As they grow they become smelly. I loved seeing them as chicks and watching them grow, especially the broilers. Achieving good barn and gut health requires operational excellence and attention to detail. A combination of quality nutrition, veterinary guidance, and increased consideration of barn and bird management will help to ensure birds have the best possible chance to perform at their maximum potential,” she said. Asante, also a performing arts students at the Sello Maake kaNcube Performing Arts Foundation, said she also loved acting. She said she was looking forward to being on stage in the future. “At the academy I have learned how to express myself more effectively,” she said.
