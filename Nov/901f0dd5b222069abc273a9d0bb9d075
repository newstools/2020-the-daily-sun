GOGO is tired of mopping the floor. She said her house gets flooded when it rains. This has been happening since 2000, and she has no one to help her clear the water. Gogo Ellen Mofokeng (69) from Naledi in Soweto has arthritis and lives alone. She’s always stressed whenever the wet season starts. “I know my house is going to get flooded,” said gogo Ellen. She said some people have tried to help her clean up after a storm over the years, but got tired. “People get tired and I don’t know what to do anymore,” she said. Gogo Ellen told Daily Sun the water comes in through the gate and goes straight into the house. “It comes in through the kitchen door. I had some barriers by the door, thinking it would make things better, but it didn’t help,” said Ellen. She said over the years her furniture got damaged. She said her arthritis has become worse and she’ll have to undergo an operation soon. “My granddaughter is here to help me for a few days,” said gogo Ellen. She pleaded with SunReaders for help. “I don’t know what I need to do,” she said. “But something has to be done soon so as to stop this water from coming into my house. “This will end up killing me. I need urgent help.”
