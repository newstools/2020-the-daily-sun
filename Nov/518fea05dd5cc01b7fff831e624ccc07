HUNDREDS of illegal gambling machines were crushed to pieces by cops on Friday, 20 November. The machines, known as Chinese roulette, were confiscated from tuck shops across Limpopo by police and the provincial gambling board. Speaking before the machines were destroyed at Bosveld Scrap Metal in Polokwane, Economic Development MEC Thabo Mokone warned that illegal gambling won’t be tolerated. “Our people who utilise illegal machines should be aware that they can get into trouble,” he said. Mokone said his department would show no mercy. “These people are enemies of our economy. Our economy isn’t doing well, and turning a blind eye to illegal gambling will make it suffer more,” he said. “Through the media, we encourage our people to stop participating in illegal gambling. “But it’s unfortunate that they tend to be ignorant. Such gambling destroys many souls and families.” Mokone said this type of crime mainly takes place in rural areas.  “He said although gambling is a form of entertainment, people need not become addicted. “We encourage our people to be careful because failure to do so will lead to many lives being lost due to stress,” he said. Limpopo Gambling Board chairman, Elijah Tjiane, said: “This is part of the crime we’re experiencing in this province. “The amount of money taken from our province through these machines is huge.” Brigadier Mosima Maila said police won’t rest until they brought all gambling criminals to book. “We encourage communities to give us tips on those running this gambling,” he said.
