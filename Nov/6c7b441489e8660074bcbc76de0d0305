AGNES Mandlazi (51) claims she’s not received her salary because Home Affairs claims she’s dead. “I don’t know what to do,” said Agnes from Violetbank, who works as an admin clerk at Mpumalanga Public Works at the site offices in Dingleydale, outside Thulamahashe. “Everyone can see that I’m alive and kicking. I’m not a ghost.” Agnes, who’s living with a disability and walks with crutches, said she went to apply for a passport in 2015 at Home Affairs in Mbombela to go on a family trip. But she never got the passport. They told her she was sharing her ID with someone in Mamelodi. She was then sent to Bushbuckridge Home Affairs. “The Bushbuckridge officials issued me a confirmation letter and sent me to the Mhala Home Affairs offices in Thulamahashe to apply for a smart card, which I got without a problem.” But last November the problem started again. “I bought a cellphone on credit at the Vodacom shop at Twin City Mall in Bushbuckridge, and they said their systems showed I’d died in October. They advised me to come back a week later for verification,” said Agnes. She sent her husband Winias Shai, who was also told that, according to the shop’s systems, she was dead. “My life is upside down. I’m starving along with my family because my salary was frozen in February. I decided to come to Daily Sun for help,” said Agnes. Mhala Home Affairs manager Robert Khoza said: “Since lockdown services have been affected, but the problem is being resolved now.”
