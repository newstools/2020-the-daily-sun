Mamelodi Sundowns are sweating over the fitness of some of their important players ahead of the resumption of the DStv Premiership this weekend. The Brazilians face a tricky  AmaZulu outfit at Loftus Versefld on Sunday (3.30 pm). Andile Jali and Kermit Erasmus are struggling with minor injuries while Downs will have to asses all the other players returning from international duty. “We are sweating a little bit and are concerned with some of the players,” said Mokwena. “AJ (Jali) hasn’t trained with us but we are getting good feedback from the doctors but we will have to wait and asses him. “Kermit is another one that we have to assess as soon as he Is back from Bafana because he has a muscle injury and these niggles pretty much always lead to an injury. “We also have to check all the other players who played for their countries, their readiness and all but we have good depth to handle anything, whoever will be on the pitch will be ready to represent Masandawana very well.” Mokwena is wary of the danger posed by AmaZulu who have recruited well at the beginning of the season. "AmaZulu have played four matches now and come Into this game with a lot of confidence after they beat Black Leopards convincingly with a dominant and strong performance,” added Mokwena. “They also come with good feelings around their space because they have recruited well, they have signed some very good players and have a lot of quality.  “We should expect a competitive AmaZulu this season. They will come expecting to win, they are In a good space so we have to be humble approaching the game.”
