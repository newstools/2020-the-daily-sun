UP-AND-COMING house vocalist, Red Ro8se, is ready to take the music industry by storm. The musician, whose real name is Tshegofatso Sekwati, just released her debut single Tlogela Piano with Prince Kaybee. Red Ro8se was featured on Prince Kaybee’s #ProjectHope album. She said it wasn’t easy, but she learnt a lot from it. She told SunBuzz: “The first day I worked on the song wasn’t easy. “I was used to working by myself, writing my own music and doing everything since I’m independent. “This time, everything was done for me and getting used to that was difficult. But the second day went easy and we finished recording.

She’s a producer for Yo!TV and a junior producer for SABC1’s the Real Goboza(RGB) show. “My parents didn’t want me to be a musician, so I studied film and television. The TV industry has also helped my music side though. “I recorded the opening jingle for Blue Couch on Yo!TV. I also recorded a song titled Uthandolway, for SABC1’s Makoti. So everything I’ve done has been aligned to music.” Ro8se is working on another single titled Propaganda, which is dedicated to Propaganda, a club in Pretoria. Red Ro8se said: “This is a soulful amapiano single about a girl who leaves home to go study in Pretoria. “When she gets there, she discovers Propaganda, which she loves and enjoys going to. “I wrote the song because I love the place. You meet amazing people from different walks of life. We don’t have a release date yet though.”
