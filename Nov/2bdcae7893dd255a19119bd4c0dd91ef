WHEN four nyaope thugs broke into gogo Magauta Maake’s house to steal her pots worth R6 000 on Friday, she chased them off. But the incident led to the 64-year-old collapsing and dying from a heart attack. Instead of getting help, the heartless thugs used the opportunity to ransack the gogo’s home in Emaphupheni in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni. When three of the thugs left the scene, the fourth stayed behind to steal some more. He was disturbed by residents and hid inside a box. They saw his legs sticking out and moered him before handing him over to the cops. The gogo’s sister, Tina Maake, (66) said it was not the first time the thugs had broken into gogo’s house. “They previously broke the window to steal blankets and her set of pots. Last week, they came back for her new pots and R800 pension grant. “My sister said she told neighbours four thugs were stealing from her, but they didn’t take her seriously because she had mental issues and was forgetful. “When I visited her, I advised her to open a case, but she was not keen,” said Tina. “She said she left everything to God. I’m heartbroken that my sister had to die like this. I’m praying for justice. “They had turned my sister’s house into their playground.” Resident Virginia Nkosi said violence against the elderly was a big headache. “As neighbours, we should look after the elderly and the disabled,” she told the People’s Paper. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula confirmed that one suspect was arrested for housebreaking on Friday and would appear in court soon.
