A FLORIDA in the USA mum, Julie Dennis, shared that she earns $20 000 (R309 000) selling her breast milk to strangers online and some people are bashing her for it. According to Julie, she started her business venture after giving birth to a surrogate baby and after six months, the baby no longer needed the milk, so she decided to offer it for sale online, Elite Readers reports.

She said that she has been criticised online by people who asked her why would she sell something she was getting for free, but she said she simply charged for her time and the pumping.  The mother of two said she spends hours a day hooked on to the breast pump, which takes up most of her time. “I wouldn’t go into a store and assume I can get free formula, so it baffles me why people expect free breast milk. Even charging one dollar per ounce, I get paid less that minimum wage once you add up all the time spent on it. That’s not to include the replacement of pump parts every six to eight weeks, the cost of bags and the cost of sterilisation units that I use.” ALSO READ: HOW TO NATURALLY GROW YOUR BREASTS?
