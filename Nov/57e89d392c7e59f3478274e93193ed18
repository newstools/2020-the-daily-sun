DURBAN-BASED comedian Bobo Mbele (19) has made a huge comeback with his line, “Ilwa ntomboo… ungavumeli ukuba mubi”. Bobo is currently trending for this line, which can be translated as, “Fight, girl... refuse to be ugly”. Last month, he posted a video clip on his Facebook page and captioned it: “Ilwa ntomboo, ungavumi nje ububi buwine kukhona ama make-up. Sis ilwaa bo,” which can be translated as, “Fight girl, do not let ugliness win. Put make-up on and fight for your beauty.” In response, social media user Ncamie Mntungwa wrote: “Yes girl, we are going to fight harder.” Lindelwa Ntomb’ika Du Jaca wrote: “The slay queen has arrived, it’s going to be hot ntomboh.” Nosipho Sibiya wrote: “We’ll do that ntomboh.” The “Ilwa Ntombo” line is buzzing on social media. Women are using this line to pamper themselves. Bobo’s manager, Mafutha Sokhela, told Daily Sun the line was meant to encourage women to be independent. “Wherever we went we would notice how women depend on men. He then came up with this to encourage women to be self-dependent. “It was not necessarily about beauty but about women empowerment. But we are excited that women have heeded the call,” said Mafutha. “We wanted to encourage women to be self-dependent. Now it is used to encourage women to be beautiful, to put on make-up, weaves and be glamorous,” he said. According to Mafutha, this trending line has managed to get Bobo back into the spotlight. “As it is he is preparing to release a song titled Ilwa Ntombo. This will be his debut song and it will be released this coming Friday,” he said. “He’s always wanted to do music and now it’s his time. What is also good is that he’ll be able to make money out of the song. Otherwise he’s not making any money right now despite his popularity,” he said.
