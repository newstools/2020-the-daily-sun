VISUAL artist Percy Marule hopes to meet comedian Leon Schuster, the muse behind his latest artwork. The 25-year-old from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, drew Mama Jack to pay tribute to Leon Schuster. Mama Jack is a character the comedian played in the movie with the same name in 2005. Percy started working on the painting three weeks ago. He told SunBuzz: “I was watching Mama Jack three weeks ago and became nostalgic. “I remembered how Schuster made our childhood great. We’d watch his films at other people’s houses because we didn’t have TVs.

I’ve tried reaching out on social media, but to no avail. “When I started working on the painting I posted on Facebook, hoping someone who knows him would see it and show him. “I haven’t been lucky yet, but I really hope he sees it.” Percy started painting at a young age, thanks to his dad. “My dad was very artistic. He used to paint and put his work around the house,” said Percy. “So I grew up curious, also wanting to paint. I started experimenting with crayons to do my work. “Once I was old enough to understand, I realised painting gave me peace I never got anywhere else. I haven’t stoppe.” The artist said he’s planning his first ever exhibition. “The exhibition will definitely happen late next year,” said Percy.
