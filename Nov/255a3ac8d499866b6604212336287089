TWO suspects aged 28 and 41 were arrested after they allegedly robbed unemployed people out of their cash with the promise of a job without attending interviews. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, the team of investigators acted swiftly after receiving the case of the victims who together were robbed of R26 000 by scams promising them employment. “It is alleged that the victims saw an advertisement for employment and they applied by sending their CVs. “The victims were called and informed that they were hired and had to send money for cold drink into the bank account number given to them. “They were ordered to pay between R500-R3 500 per person. They were promised that if they sent the money, they would not attend interviews and would instead start their duties immediately. “Deposits were made but the suspects started ignoring their calls. They tried by all means to locate them without success until they decided to report the matter to the police.” The investigation was handed over to the Hawks, who used intelligence-driven operations to investigate and arrest the suspects on Thursday, 26 November. “The two suspects, a male and a female, are in custody and are expected to appear before the Middelburg Magistrates Court soon on charges of fraud and money laundering,” said Sekgotodi.
