SINGER and songwriter Botlhale Phora has released a new single, Ke Godile. This is a stepping stone for the talented singer who gained prominence when he was on Idols SA’s 2017 edition. Speaking to SunBuzz, Botlhale said: “The track is about growth. It’s basically about starting a new chapter in life and allowing yourself an opportunity to start afresh.” The 24-year-old artist said working on the song was fun and challenging at the same time. “It was fun because it was my first attempt to write music in Tswana and challenging because I had to step out of my comfort zone and think of words that would best suit the song without losing people in translation.” The Tshwane-born star said he hopes the song will make people believe in change and growth.
