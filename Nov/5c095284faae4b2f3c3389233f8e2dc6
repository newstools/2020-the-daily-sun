ANOTHER horrific school violence incident took place this week. Last week, it was in Edenvale and this week it’s in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. And again, Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi will be visiting the school. The big people are asking is if the violence at schools will ever stop. In the latest incident, on Monday, 16 November, pupils of Hoerskool Elspark were involved in a fight. They were captured on video as they exchanged blows. It was white vs black. It was reported that one pupil was stabbed during the incident. In a statement, the Gauteng Education Department said it was not sure what might have sparked the fight. “However this is strongly condemned and necessary investigation and swift action against all perpetrators is required,” said the department. MEC Lesufi said he was disturbed by the incident. He’s expected to visit the school today.
