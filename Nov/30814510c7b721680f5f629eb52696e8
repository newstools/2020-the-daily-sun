SOMAGWAZA Institute chairman Sikelela Zokufa says initiates should learn about gender-based violence when they go to the mountain. “It’s important to address this important subject when the boys transform to become men. “When they come from the mountains, they should know it’s their responsibility to protect women. “They should know their role is to protect their mothers, sisters and all other women.” He said the institute was started to address the well-being of initiates, since many parents were losing their children, among other concerns. He said for Mzansi to win the fight against abuse of women and children, the subject should be tackled at every level and it was important to target young men. Sikelele said young people should respect themselves first in order to respect others. “The issue of gender-based violence goes along with self-respect. “You have to respect yourself as a man and this will help you respect every woman you meet,” he said. The organisation’s leader said some things men do make women lose respect for them. “Women can’t be proud to look up at us as husbands when men rape. No woman will proudly stand next to a rapist and say, this is my man. Never. Women are ashamed of us. “So, it’s our responsibility to change that,” said Sikelele.
