NYAOPE is sold openly at this hostel. Residents were worried seeing their children getting wasted because of the drug. They then tipped off the police. On Wednesday, 11 November, cops arrived unannounced at Madala Hostel in Kagiso, Mogale City and searched some rooms where they found nyaope and rock. “They searched one of the rooms and found 82 packs of nyaope and 23 rock foiled packets,” said Captain Raymond Sebonyane. The other members proceeded to the other rooms and found 380 nyaope wraps. “A 34-year-old woman was found in possession of the drugs.” She and another male suspect were arrested for dealing in drugs and were detained at Kagiso Police Station. Sebonyane said the woman tried to bribe the cops with R500, but an additional charge of bribery was added. The estimated value of drugs confiscated is R7 000. Cops also found cash at the premises.  The residents said they believed the arrests would send a strong message to those who are planning to start selling drugs. “Our children are doomed because nyaope and they steal from us when they want their next fix,” said resident Kedibone Molapo (40).  “We appeal to the police to work with us to fight this drug,” said another resident, April Ngwenya (34). Both suspects will appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon.
