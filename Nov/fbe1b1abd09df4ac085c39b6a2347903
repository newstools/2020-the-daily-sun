A TAXI boss was gunned down execution-style a few metres away from his home. Two gunmen allegedly opened fire before escaping on foot yesterday. Bhutiza Mbatha (47) from Richmond Farm near KwaMashu, north of Durban, died on the scene. A resident, who lives close to where the incident happened, told Daily Sun he was in his shack when he heard several gun shots. “I saw that Mbatha’s car was shot at and blood was coming from the passenger’s seat. There were bullets in the windscreen and passenger window,” he said. He said Mbatha was leaning toward the passenger seat. Another resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “It’s sad because he had just left his home when they shot him. The way he was shot shows the people wanted him dead. There was so much blood inside his car, it was so sad.” A family memberat the scene refused to speak to Daily Sun and asked the Sun Team to go to the house. But when the Sun Team got to the house, believed to be Mbatha’s wife refused to speak. Mbatha was a well-known taxi boss and belonged to several taxi associations. He had taxis operating locally, in the CBD and long distance. KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, confirmed that a 47-year-old man was was attacked by two unknown men. “They fired shots at him and he was declared dead at the scene. He sustained injuries on the head and body,” said Mbele. He said the motive for the attack is unknown at this stage. “A case of murder is being investigated by Ntuzuma police,” said Mbele.
