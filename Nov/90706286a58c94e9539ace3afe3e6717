FORMER president Jacob Zuma was expected to appear before
the Zondo Commission on tomorrow. He was issued with a summons in October to give evidence
before the inquiry chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. However, Zuma’s lawyers have since filed an application to
have Zondo recuse himself over what they claimed was a conflict of interest.
The 100-page application brought about doubts that Zuma would appear. Zondo recently came out to clear the air, stating he had a
child with Zuma’s sister-in-law in the 1990s.  On Friday 13 November, commission secretary Itumeleng Mosala
released a statement on the matter. “The summons issued by the secretary of the commission was
served at Jacob Zuma’s homestead at Nkandla on 22 October 2020,” it read. “The summons required Mr Jacob Zuma to appear before the
Commission at 10am from 16 to 20 November 2020. It was made clear in the
summons that if Mr Zuma made arrangements to give evidence by way of a video
link and subsequently appeared before the commission using the video link, he
would be deemed to have complied with the summons.” The statement said attempts by the commission to get
confirmation on whether Zuma would appear were unsuccessful. Zuma’s attorneys
told the commission he had not told them whether he would obey the summons.
However, the commission made it clear Zuma had no choice but to appear. “On Wednesday 11 November, Mr Zuma’s lawyers lodged his
application for the recusal of the chairman of the commission. That application
will be heard on Monday 16 November,” the statement read.
