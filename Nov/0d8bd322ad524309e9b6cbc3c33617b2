FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s lack of respect for the State Capture Commission will be investigated by the police. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo told the hearing on Monday, 23 November he’d instructed the secretary to lay a criminal complaint. Zuma left the commission during tea break on Thursday, 19 November without permission from Zondo. This is a criminal offence. His behaviour could send the wrong message to witnesses who’re uncomfortable with testifying. “The summons directing Zuma to attend and remain in attendance was at the time of his departure from the commission still valid and binding and had not been set aside,” said Zondo. Zuma was at the commission to hear his application to have Zondo recuse himself from hearing his evidence when the incident happened. When that bid failed, his lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane told the inquiry they’d excuse themselves. Evidence leader Paul Pretorius then told them they had to be excused by the chairman. “The decision by Zuma to leave without permission is a serious matter. It impacts on the integrity of the commission, the rule of law and public accountability,” said Zondo. Zuma couldn’t have been confused about the need to ask for permission as he had done so on Tuesday, 17 November to attend a funeral the following day. The secretary will make an application to the Constitutional Court to compel Zuma to follow summons when he attends and not to leave without permission. Meanwhile, the commission announced Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo will appear on Friday, 27 November. He allegedly received R30 million from the city for acting as a broker in a contract awarded to Gupta-linked consultancy firm, Regiments Capital.
