THE SA Football Association have endorsed the candidacy of Patrice Motsepe for the CAF presidency. Motsepe has thrown his name in the hat for the highest office in the leadership of continental football. Safa president Danny Jordaan confirmed the association will be thrown their weight behind the reknown businessman and Mamelodi Sundowns president. Motsepe has also received the backing of Botswana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria as well as the Council for East and Central Africa Football Association (Cecafa). ”Our nomination of Patrice Motsepe for the Caf presidency moves from the boardroom to the dressing-room, ” said Jordaan. ”We will work night and day to ensure he gets elected. I can tell you that Patrice Motsepe will become the president of Caf, ” said Nigeria FA president Amaju Pinnick. But crucially, he has reportedly been endorsed by Fifa president Gianni Infantino to challenge incumbent president Ahmad Ahmad, who is vying for a second term. The Mamelodi Sundowns president is not new to international football, having formed part of the Nelson Mandela-led delegation that went to Zurich for the 2010 World Cup bid announcement in 2004. Ivory Coast’s Jacques Anouma is also in the running.
