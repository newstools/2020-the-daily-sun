TOP South African striker, Percy Tau, has told SunSport he enjoys working under Manchester City legend Vincent Kompany. Tau, who is on loan to Belgium outfit Anderlecht, from English Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion, said the former defender’s experience at the highest level has rubbed off him. Tau enjoys playing under the former City captain who was appointed by the Belgium giants as their head coach this season. The 26-year-old, who played in 18 games in all competitions this season, has scored five goals. Anderlecht disappointingly lie seventh in the Jupiler League. “It’s great to be working with him,” Tau told SunSport. “He’s teaching the team so many things and is a great coach. We’re also learning a lot from him. He played at the highest level for so many years, so he’s trying to give us some of the lessons he learned while playing.” During the recently ended Fifa international break, Tau scored three goals for Bafana Bafana in the back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe. These goals saw him move into the top 10 of the all-time Bafana scoring list, with 12 goals in 29 appearances. Meanwhile, Tau, who is in his third loan spell since he left Mamelodi Sundowns in 2018, still dreams of playing for The Seagulls. There are talks that he might be recalled by Brighton in January, depending on the looming Brexit situation that’s likely to change work permit regulations. The work permit regulations have been a stumbling block for Tau as he was sent out on loan once more by Brighton this season. But when asked about the possibility of being recalled by Brighton, he said: “I’m not aware of that. “I think I’ve been doing well. I’ve been trying my best in every game while on loan for (the past) three seasons now,” said Tau. “I think there’s progress in my game. I went to Club Brugge (last season) and won the league. “It’s never been about my talent. It’s just other issues that are forcing me out,” he said.
