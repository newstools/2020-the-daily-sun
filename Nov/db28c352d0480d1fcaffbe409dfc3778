A 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of his 54-year-old partner at Ga-Motsepe section in Tafelkop village, Limpopo. Ivy Chikane was found by her brother on Friday night, lying in a pool of blood and "severely injured on her face at the yard outside her room", police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said the brother allegedly broke open the burglar door to the deceased's room and found the suspect asleep. He said the suspect then left the scene and went to his home. "The police and emergency services were summoned to the scene and swiftly responded," Ngoepe said. Chikane was certified dead by emergency services. "The police started with the initial investigations, which led to the arrest of the alleged boyfriend. The motive behind this killing is still not clear at this stage but domestic-related violence may not be ruled out," Ngoepe said. The suspect is expected to appear in the Motetema Magistrate's Court soon.
