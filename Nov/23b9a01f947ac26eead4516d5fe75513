Mamelodi Sundowns have been handed a bye through to the second round of the African Champions League this season but Kaizer Chiefs face two tough ties if they are to make it to the group phase for the first time. Sundowns will take on the winner of the Jwaneng Comets of Botswana or the Comoros Island champions US Zilimadjou while Chiefs were drawn in the first round against PWD Bamenda, who are the champions of Cameroon and if they win that tie will then have to take on Angolan champions Primeiro Agosto. The draw was conducted in Cairo on Monday by the Confederation of African Football. Clubs play two knockout rounds before the 16 remaining clubs are drawn into four groups of four for the group phase. In the Confederation Cup, there are three knockout rounds before the group phase. Orlando Pirates have been handed a bye and will meet the winner of the tie between Angola’s Sagrada Esperance and Eswatini’s entrants, who have yet to be named. New boys Bloemfontein Celtic will play against AS Maniema of the Democratic Republic of Congo in a rude baptism of fire for the Nedbank Cup winners. Trips to DR Congo are notorious for the poor hospitality and Spartan conditions imposed on visiting sides. Should Celtic advance, then they meet either Futuro United from Equatorial Guinea or River Kings from Nigeria in the second round. There is a third round of knockout games in Confederation Cup when teams eliminated from the Champions League drop down, After that, the 16 remaining clubs participate also in a group phase. CAF have yet to confirm the dates for the kick off of the two competitions, which were originally set to start at the end of November. -SuperSport
