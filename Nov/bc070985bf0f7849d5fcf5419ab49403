FORMER president Jacob Zuma has failed in his bid to have chairman of the state capture commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, recuse himself. Zondo ruled this morning that the applicant has failed to raise proper grounds for the recusal. In his ruling, he questioned the timing of Zuma’s complaints. “The applicant can’t be allowed to raise this issue so late in the day,” said Zondo. Some of the issues the former president raised were his friendship with the chairman and that he was treated differently from other witnesses. He claimed that Zondo called media conferences to portray him as “uncooperative” and “guilty at all cost”. He said the chairman refused to believe that his failure to appear at the commission earlier this year was due to his travel to seek medical attention. Zondo said Zuma made an undertaking in July last year that he would furnish the commission with his affidavits giving his version, but failed to do so. “It can’t lie in the applicant’s mouth to say that the commission has ignored the matters he raised in his evidence,” said Zondo. His lawyer, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, told the commission that they will lodge a complaint with the judicial services commission that Zondo made himself a witness and a judge. Not only will Jacob Zuma no longer participate in the Zondo commission, he also walked out with one final insult. The former president left without being excused while the commission was on tea adjournment.
