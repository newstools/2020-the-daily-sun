SUPERSPORT United medical staff are working around the clock to ensure key striker, Bradley Grobler, passes a late fitness test ahead of their DStv Premiership clash with Orlando Pirates tomorrow (6pm). The game is set for Orlando Stadium. Grobler started training with Matsatsantsa a Pitori on Wednesday while nursing an ankle injury, having last played on 7 November when they lost 1-0 to Bloemfontein Celtic in the MTN8 semi-final second leg. SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo said they will make a final assessment on Grobler today together with other players who were away on national duty. “But it won’t be a train smash if he won’t be available because we have enough quality players upfront like Gabuza (Thamsanqa), Lungu (Ghampani), Rusike (Evans) and Iqraam Rayners, who are ready to do the job,” Tembo said while still in his casualty ward that includes influential defender Clayton Daniels, who is still recovering from a car crash. As if that was not enough, Botswana international defender Thatayaone Ditlhokwe will also miss the match as he has yet to return from national duty. Said Tembo: “Clayton is important to us. We don’t doubt his ability. But it’s important for Fleurs (Luke), who played alongside him, to show what he can play regularly. We believe in him. He is young (20) and this will pave the way for him in the Olympic team and give him the opportunity to play.” Nonetheless, Tembo is bracing himself for a tough-as-teak clash with Bucs: “We need to go out there and ensure we play well, and match them through hard work. “It’s always good to score early, but that should not be our benchmark. It’s key to focus and play the entire 90 minutes, not do well for only 10 or 15 minutes.” Meanwhile, Pirates will play without winger Thembinkosi Lorch, who has been ruled out for five weeks after undergoing surgery, but speedy winger Deon Hotto and Terrence Dzvukamanja will be there to attack.
