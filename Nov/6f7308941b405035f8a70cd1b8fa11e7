THE Mzansi motoring industry has been under pressure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it’s showing a high level of resilience. As the world reels from various levels of a second-wave lockdown, manufacturers and dealers have worked hard locally to meet an apparently changing demand from the South African consumers. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), 38 752 new vehicles were sold last month. This represents the fourth consecutive month of sales growth by volume since reducing levels of lockdown, albeit that it is 25,4% lower than October last year. Head of marketing and communication at WesBank Vehicle and Asset Finance, Lebogang Gaoaketse said combined with low-interest rates, banks’ lending appetites have supported this market growth. “What is intriguing, however, is that levels of sales and levels of demand experienced at WesBank seemingly don’t compare.” Although market volume increased by 1,516 units over September, sales were relatively worse off in October year-on-year. September sales were down 23,9% by comparison. Segment performance faired more evenly. Passenger car sales were 25.4% down in October 2019 to 26,793 units, a relatively better performance than in September. Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) sales were worse off, down 27,8% to 9 644 units compared to October last year, and a September performance that was only down 8,2%. Gaoaketse said the interest rates were expected to remain low for quite some time as government continues to make every attempt to stimulate the economy.
