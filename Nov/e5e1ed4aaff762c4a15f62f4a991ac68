PUBLIC Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to appear at the Zondo Commission on Monday, 30 November to be cross-examined by former Sars commissioner, Tom Moyane. The questions will relate to Gordhan’s testimony that Moyane laid a criminal complaint against him to advance his own interests in state capture. Gordhan said Moyane was incompetent and wanted him to take responsibility for the massive failure of integrity and governance at Sars. Commission chairman, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, ruled last month that Moyane may cross-examine Gordhan, subject to certain conditions. Moyane’s lawyers had wanted the cross-examination to have no conditions, saying Gordhan’s allegation was unsubstantiated. The commission will also hear testimony from former Sars employee and partner at Bain SA, Athol Williams.
