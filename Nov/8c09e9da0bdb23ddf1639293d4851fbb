SOUTH Africa now has its own concept of the BET Awards. The Northern Cape Awards are set to honour and celebrate black excellence in the province. Matodzi Makananisa founded the awards after he saw a lack of community development, especially in the arts in the Northern Cape. “For the longest of time the arts have been underrated and overlooked. “People have worked hard to put their provinces on the map. But they never get the proper recognition. “So we thought it’s high time we changed that and gave them recognition.” Matodzi said one of the challenges he faced was resistance to his project. “Challenges will always be there. When you’re new in a province and want to do business, there’ll be resistance from locals. “But fortunately, I’ve travelled a lot and I’m used to this kind of resistance, and it didn’t discourage me because I know my end goal, which is community development.” ALSO READ | BIG HONOUR FOR CONNIE Matodzi said the awards have over 30 categories. “Our categories are so broad. The awards are similar to the BET Awards. We’re honouring all fields, from radio, visual art to community media. I hope the awards will make winners feel appreciated for their hard work.” “We have also kept the nominations as simple as possible. We’ve pushed them back to 2017 for all music categories. All those who released material during that period can qualify,” he said. Matodzi, whose awards ceremony is supported by the National Lottery, said winners will go home with smiles. “Winners will be decided by a public vote, and all winners are walking away with cash prizes. The premier award winner will walk away with a brand new car,” he said. The ceremony will be held on 13 December at the Northern Cape Theatre, Kimberley.
