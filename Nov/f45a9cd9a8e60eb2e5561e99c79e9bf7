PEOPLE have been left homeless in the OR Tambo District in the Eastern Cape after a heavy storm destroyed a number of houses on Tuesday, 17 November. About 10 of the victims were rushed to Mthatha General Hospital and some of them were discharged on Wednesday, 18 November. Schools such as Holy Cross Education Centre and Ngwayibanjwa S.S.S were also affected. Nikiwe Jebe (49), who was injured but has now been discharged, is the owner of Maksibone Hostel in Highbury. Nikiwe said: “I am glad that I was the only one who got injured. All the pupils were not injured. Life is not replaceable, but this hostel can be replaced at any time,” said Nikiwe. “Being at Mthatha Hospital and seeing other people affected by this storm was painful, but we are thankful that we are alive.”  She said the affected Holy Cross Education Centre pupils need counselling as they are still traumatised by what happened. Some of the Holy Cross Education Centre pupils escaped through the window, running for their lives.  Nikiwe said she built the hostel for close to R1 million last year and it started operating in January this year, accommodating more than 50 pupils from Holy Cross Education Centre.  Mbuyiselo Dyalvani, another victim who is still shocked, praised his ancestors and God for protecting his family. “The storm destroyed almost everything – the couches, fridge, the stove and other furniture.” Mbuyiselo said the estimated damaged caused by the storm is more than R60 000.  It’s alleged that there are people who lost their lives after the storm. On Wednesday, 18 November, King Sabata Dalindyebo Mayor Nyaniso Nelani visited some of the victims at Mthatha General Hospital.
