EXCITED matrics told the SunTeam on Monday Maths Paper Two was a breeze. Floyd Shabangu (20) and Daniel Makhubela (21) of Godide High School in Rolle near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, enjoyed the paper. Meanwhile, pupils at Grenville High School in Rustenburg, North West, said it was fair, but they felt it could have been better. They said the paper was for a total of 150 marks and had 10 questions, including geometry and statistics. Thembi Ngobeni (17) said although the paper was fair, she experienced some challenges, as most of the questions were new to her. “It was challenging for me as some of the questions were covered during online interactions while we couldn’t go to school. And I was unable to go online. “But I think I did well,” she said. Tshegofatso Mogotle (18) said she only enjoyed the last three questions. “For me, the paper was okay. But the method of questioning was new to me. I tried answering all the questions. “I also enjoyed questions eight, nine and 10. I’m positive I passed it with 60%,” she said.
