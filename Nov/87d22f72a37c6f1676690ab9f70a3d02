A ZIMBABWEAN woman, set alight after stealing meat worth R25 from a shop, is recovering from her burn wounds in hospital. The woman claimed she was moered by employees and the manager of the shop in Musina, Limpopo, on Tuesday, 10 November after they accused her of shoplifting. Her brother, Bernard Chivu­gare, said she tried to run away after being caught by employees but they beat her, poured methylated spirits over her and set her on fire. “She said she didn’t deny stealing, but why did they handle the matter in such an inhumane way? “She told me she had no food and that was why she went to steal,” he said. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said two employees of the shop and their manager were arrested for assault GBH. “Norman Radali (33), Vhutshilo Tshikwatamba (27) and John van Loggerenberg (40) appeared in the Musina Magistrates Court and were granted R1 000 bail each. “The case was postponed to Thursday, 26 November while police investigations continue,” he said.  The EFF condemned the attack, which they said was racially motivated. The party spoke out after a video of the victim showing her burn wounds trended on social media. Provincial party leader Jossey Buthane said the woman was humiliated in front of customers and other shop workers.  “If, indeed, she was caught stealing, management should have opened a case with the police,” said Buthane. “This shameful and racist act against our people is just one of many that continues to happen in Limpopo and the country at large.”
