Goalkeeper Keylor Navas and centre-back Presnel Kimpembe joined Paris Saint-Germain’s lengthening injury list on Friday, adding to the absences of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Marco Verratti. Head coach Thomas Tuchel revealed on Friday that Navas and Kimpembe will miss Saturday’s match against third-placed Rennes at the Parc de Princes. Navas has struggled with ongoing “muscle problems” as the result of the busy fixture calendar and Kimpembe suffered a foot injury, Tuchel said. Kimpembe was named in Didier Deschamps’ France squad for the upcoming international fixtures and the 25-year-old is due to join up with the national squad on Monday. Elsewhere for PSG, Pablo Sarabia’s fitness is touch-and-go as the winger battles a muscle strain. The Spaniard has picked up two goals and four assists in his last four league games for the side. Leandro Paredes, who was an unused sub for Wednesday’s Champions League 2-1 defeat to RB Leipzig, is available for selection after two weeks out.-AFP
