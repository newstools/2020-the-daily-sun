THREE children, including a five-month-old baby, were burnt to death on Saturday, 21 November around 8am in in a shack fire in Northam outside Bela-Bela, Limpopo. Siblings Sinenhlanhla Tsotetsi (5 months) and Jabulane Tsotetsi (2) and their cousin, Katlego Mogale (2), were allegedly left alone by Sinenhlanhla and Jabulane’s mum when she went to buy some food at a local spaza shop. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said she was informed while on her way to the shop that her house was burning. She ran back and her shack was already engulfed in flames. “The police, firefighters and emergency services were summoned to the scene and she said there are three children in the house. They managed to remove the victims but unfortunately, all three boys were certified dead,” he said. Ngoepe said the cause of the fire is still unknown at this stage but police investigations are ongoing.
