SELLO is nursing his wounds. He was allegedly beaten with sticks by five ANC members in Cullinan, Tshwane. Sello Dikotope (38) from Kameeldrift told Daily Sun the incident happened during a community meeting on relocation. They were discussing development of plots 174 and 175. Municipal officials were giving them feedback. “I didn’t approve of the list of beneficiaries,” he said. “The ANC brought a list that didn’t benefit the community, and it was unfair.” Sello said more than 1 300 people should have benefitted, and not fewer than that. He said: “They hit me on the head, hands and all over my body. “I went to the doctor and paid R450 for treatment.” Sello claimed some ANC members had said they were not done with him. He said: “I’m no longer safe, and I’m scared something bad will happen to me.” Sello said the ANC members should stop interfering. “Political parties should stop politicising allocation of stands,” he said. Sello said that he and fellow residents wanted a recount of the beneficiaries. Police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said a case of assault was opened. ANC NEC member Dakota Legoete told the People’s Paper: “We want our members to refrain from allocating sites when there are authorities and councillors who’re tasked with that responsibility. “We want to state in no uncertain terms that if anyone is found to have attacked any member of the public or of another party, the offended person should lay criminal charges against that person.” He described such acts as pure criminality!
