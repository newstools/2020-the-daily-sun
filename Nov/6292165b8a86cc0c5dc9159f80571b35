So-called prophets abuse church members in many ways. Poor people donate their hard-earned money and are told they’ll achieve more. Some are told they’ll own cars. People should smell a rat when they get poorer and the so-called prophets get richer. Do we go to church to spend or worship God? A church donation is supposed to be what I can afford, not a certain percentage of my money. Jesus came to Earth to make life easier than in the Old Testament, but in some cases we refer to the Old Testament to suit our needs. I know of poor people who’ve been hypnotised by these pastors and told that before they use their money, they should start by giving a portion to the church. I’m also Christian. But what God has given me I can’t give to someone while my family goes hungry. Let’s be wise and notice when we’re being used. Is it a normal thing to be told to eat grass in order for the Holy spirit to be near you? Let’s realise when we’re being taken for a ride. Letter by Mah Gilmour, Diepsloot
