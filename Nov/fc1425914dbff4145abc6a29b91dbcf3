They stopped a house and they started shooting at everyone who was inside the house. Two people were rushed to near by  hospital after sustaining serious injuries. When the Sunteam arrived at the scene, bodies of the deceased were scattered in the house, as shocked residents looked on. “I have never seen such a scene in my life, this is terrifying. It sounded like a warzone for a few minutes as gunshots went off. I locked myself inside the house because I did not know what was going on,” said a woman who stays a few houses away from the murder scene. According to another resident who spoke to Sunteam, the gunmen shot everyone who was in the house. Three women and five men were shot. Cops spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa confirmed the incident but said cops are still establishing what could have happened. "Western Cape Organised Crime detectives with other crime scene experts are on the scene combing for clues where seven people were killed and two injured in a shooting in Gugulethu on Monday afternoon".
