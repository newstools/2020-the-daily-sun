ARSON and inquest cases have been opened for investigation. This after two people died in separate incidents in Philippi, Cape Town. One of the victims died in Lower Crossroads around 1.50am. Nkosinathi Mahamba (57) said they were still shocked and don’t know what caused the fire. “The deceased was looking after the shack while the owner went to the Eastern Cape. We don’t know what caused the fire,” said Nkosinathi. “He was a God-fearing man. He neither drank nor smoked.” Khayalethu Magaca (34) said they tried to help the victim but it was too late. “We tried everything but it wasn’t to be,” he said. In another incident, a woman died in a shack fire. Family member Nosipho Siyekuyi (31) said the victim used a candle after the electricity box malfunctioned. “We were waiting for the City of Cape Town to come and fix our electricity box. That’s why we used candles for lighting,” said Nosipho. She said the victim tried to escape but couldn’t. “Residents did everything in their power to save her but the fire was too strong,” she said. Captain FC van Wyk said an arson case was opened at Philippi East SAPS for investigation after a shack fire at Lower Crossroads and an inquest case has been opened for investigation at Nyanga SAPS after a shack fire at Browns Farm, where a 41-year-old woman died. “The cause of fire is not known yet, investigations are continuing,” said Van Wyk. The city’s Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Jermaine Carelse said the crews arrived and found a single structure engulfed by flames in Lower Crossroads where a 20-year-old man was discovered inside the structure. “In the second incident in Browns Farm, a woman sustained fatal burn wounds,” said Carelse.
