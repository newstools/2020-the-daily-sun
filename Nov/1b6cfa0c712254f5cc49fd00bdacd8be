D-DAY has arrived for former president Jacob Zuma to appear before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Zuma arrived in Braamfontein on Monday, 16 November, however it is not clear if he is going to give evidence at the State Capture Commission. Zuma’s relationship with Zondo seemed to be fine until the former president’s previous appearance before the commission. Through his lawyers, Zuma filed an application for Zondo to recuse himself due to conflict of interest. The application is expected to be heard on Monday, 16 November, which might contribute to the former president not giving evidence with Zondo being the presiding officer. However, Zuma’s loyalists seem to have made their way to Braamfontein where the Zondo Commission is sitting. Among those who are present are MKMVA spokesman Carl Niehaus, former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo and former four-day finance minister, Des Van Rooyen. Scores of supporters are expected to gather outside the venue. Police presence has been beefed up ahead of the proceedings. More than 27 organisations have called for Zuma to account before Zondo. In their statement, they said: “We condemn all attempts aimed at frustrating and delegitimising its work. Given the national importance of the work of the Zondo Commission in probing state capture, we believe that its findings and recommendations will be critical in dismantling corrupt networks that over the past decade have eroded our democracy. “The commission has its roots in the ‘State of Capture’ report (2016), published by former Public Protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela. The remedial action contained in the report instructed then president Jacob Zuma to ‘appoint, within 30 days, a commission of inquiry headed by a judge solely selected by the Chief Justice, who shall provide one name to the president.’”
