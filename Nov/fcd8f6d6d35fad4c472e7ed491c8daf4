MANY of us have that one pair of shoes that we are attached to because of how comfortable they are. But wearing the same shoes every day allows bacteria to build up on your feet and that might end up causing infections such as athlete’s foot and toenail fungus. Medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus and ingrown toenails can also increase your risk of foot infections.Fungal foot infections can be prevented by keeping your feet clean and dry, and by washing them every day with soap and water and allowing them to dry. It’s better to change your pair of shoes almost every day because your shoes absorb the sweat from your feet. This is a normal process, but your shoes need enough time to dry again afterwards. If you wear the same shoes every day, they don’t get the chance to do that and that can cause them to lose their shape. Changing your shoes also makes a big difference when it comes to the durability of your shoes: alternating your pairs of shoes makes them last longer.
