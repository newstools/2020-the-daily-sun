LISTENING to their teachers’ advice helped matric pupils at Bokgoni Technical Secondary School in Atteridgeville, Tshwane to write their Zulu exam on Monday, 9 November. Pupils said it was difficult to prepare during lockdown but with their teachers’ help, they managed to write well. Basetsana Mlangeni (17) said everything they studied for was in the exam paper. She said they were a bit scared because of everything that happened this year and weren’t sure what they should expect. “Our teachers helped us study and when I saw the question paper, I was happy because I knew I’m going to pass.” Khensani Dlamini said he wrote well and was sure he was going to pass. “The paper was easy, easier than I expected. I’m excited to study more.” Amanda Ngobese (18) said the paper was fine for her and she would pass. She said the teachers played their part well in getting them ready.  “Covid-19 or no Covid-19, we will surely do well,” Amanda told Daily Sun. Meanwhile, education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the department, in conjunction with that of Health, agreed to allow pupils who tested positive for corona to write exams under special conditions. “The important part is parents or guardians of candidates who tested positive for Covid-19 are obliged to inform the school principal immediately.” He said plans could be made for pupils to write exams at isolation venues which complied with regulations. “Candidates should refrain from attending social gatherings and strictly observe protocols relating to social distancing, wearing of masks, and sanitising.”
