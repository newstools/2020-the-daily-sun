Cricket South Africa (CSA) has confirmed that a Proteas player has tested positive for coronavirus
and two more are in isolation after being in close contact with him. The Proteas will prepare for a three ODI and three T20I
series against England in Cape Town, where approximately 50 Covid-19 tests were
conducted prior to them entering a bio-secure environment. Cricket South Africa on Wednesday evening confirmed that one
player has tested positive, while two others who were in close contact have
been placed in isolation. All three players are asymptotic but are being closely
monitored. They will likely be in isolation for 10-14 days, meaning they could
miss the start of the series on 27 November. The players won’t be replaced in the squad for the series
but two players have been called up for the inter-squad practice match on
Saturday. South Africa squad for England series Quinton de Kock (captain), Temba Bavuma, Junior Dala, Faf du
