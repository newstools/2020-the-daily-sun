HER move to Gauteng in a quest to seek more fight opportunities is paying dividends for former WBF international female bantamweight champion, Matshidiso “Scorpion Queen” Mokebisi. Mokebisi moved to Gauteng earlier last year in a bid to take her boxing career to the next level. She followed in the footsteps of other Free State fighters such as WBC Silver featherweight titleholder Lerato Dlamini, Doctor Ntsele and Anthony Moloisane who also moved to Gauteng to advance their careers. The 31-year old seasoned campaigner from Kroonstad in the Free State believes leaving her home province was the best career decision she has made. Mokebisi was crowned the Gauteng junior welterweight champion over the weekend after she outpointed Kholosa Ndobayini. Their sterling performance earned the fighters a R50 000 bonus on top of their purses after their contest was declared the best fight of the night. Mokebisi took home R40 000, while her opponent pocketed R10 000. “I’m happy with the way things are shaping up. Lack of fight opportunities forced me to leave the Free State and also I did not have a good trainer. The future looks bright here and now I’m gunning for the South African title,” said Mokebisi. Since the former SA woman bantamweight champion has joined hands with top Gauteng boxing mentor Manny Fernandez, she has registered three straight victories, including a fifth round stoppage against Zimbabwean fighter Sindisiwe Mncube and a points victory over Gabisile Tshabalala. She said her recent triumph was one of her hardest nights. “It was a tough encounter but with all the hard work I put in during the preparations, I managed to pull through. I’m happy with the R40 000 incentive,” added Mokebisi.
