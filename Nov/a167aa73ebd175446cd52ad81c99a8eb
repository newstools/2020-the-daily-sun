THE Confederation of African Football could allow some African Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers to played in front of small crowds on condition they get their government and the continental controlling body’s approval. But with qualifiers kicking off this week including Bafana Bafana’s two “home” games against Sao Tome it is expected most will be played behind closed doors due to Covid-19 restrictions. Bafana, and the rest of nations, were supposed to resume their Afcon qualifiers in March but they were postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Caf released a statement of the protocol’s to be followed which read: “Each match must be played if the team has at least 11 players (including a goalkeeper) and four substitutes. If a team cannot travel to the host country and or venue of a match due to any travel or other restriction relating to Covid-19, the team in question will be considered to have lost the match 2-0. If a team does not have the minimum number of players required the team in question will be considered to have lost the match 2-0. “The number of authorised substitutions is limited to five players per team. Each team will have three opportunities to make these substitutions during the match. According to Caf’s Covid-19 protocol, all matches must be played behind closed doors, without spectators. “However, if the government of the host Association wants spectators to be present, then the Association in question will need to obtain Caf's approval.” Caf added  “these specific rules may be revised according to developments of the health situation in the world and specifically on the African continent”  ahead of the last qualifiers which will be played in next March. Bafana have already struck a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Sao Tome in response to the pandemic. Both qualifiers will be played Mzansi. The first will be played in Durban on Friday and the second three days later in Port Elizabeth.
