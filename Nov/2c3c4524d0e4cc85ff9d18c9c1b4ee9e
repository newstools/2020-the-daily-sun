 GAUTENG's Pretoria Callies and the Eastern Cape's Bizana Pondo FC have been promoted to the GladAfrica Championship. The two sides managed to reach the final of the ongoing ABC Motsepe League playoffs and as a result, earn a spot in the second tier of Mzansi football. Callies, who won the Gauteng stream, defeated Mangaung Unite in their semi-final while Bizana, winners of the Eastern Cape stream, beat Umvoti FC. Bizana were the first team to reach the knockout stages and have now made it into the final where they will be looking to walk away with the whole thing. Callies, on the other hand, seem to be peaking at the right time and will hope to continue on that note. The final will take place on Saturday.Sammy Troughton, coach of Callies, wants his charges to focus on the final before they celebrate their promotion. "Getting to the Gladfrica Championship is a life changer for these boys," said Troughton. "Let's go to the final and win it. That's the cherry on top." Thabiso Nkoana has been a key player for Callies with his experience and quality showing during the competition. The former SuperSport United striker bagged a hat trick against Mangaung Unite to send his side to the Championship. Troughton was pleased with his forward's showing. "He has that ability, he hasn't always given us this kind of performance and he can really frustrate you but will go down in Callies history now," added Troughton. "We should have scored double figures but we became sloppy."
