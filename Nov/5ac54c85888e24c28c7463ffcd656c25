Distruction Boyz member Goldmax has finally released his solo debut album, Music Saved Me. The member of the award-winning gqom duo said the album has made him brave. Music Saved Me, which dropped two weeks ago, features Zanda Zakuza, Skyewanda, TNS, Shwi Nomtekhala and Madadon, among others. Speaking to SunBuzz the musician, whose real name is Zipho Mthembu, said he was scared to release the album. “I thought people wouldn’t love it because it’s not a gqom album,” he said. “People are used to me producing gqom, which is why I didn’t think they’d enjoy it or support me. Regardless, I gathered up the courage and produced it. “The reason I released it even though I was scared is because I noticed a lot of producers go through the same thing. We think people won’t love our new music because we’ve changed. “But now people will know I can produce everything and anything.

That’s what kept me going.” Goldmax said he’s glad people are impressed by his album so far. “A lot of people are amazed that I produced this album. They didn’t expect this, and that makes me proud,” he said. “I’m grateful to the guys I stay with. They helped me. It’s a success because we worked together.” Goldmax said he and Que haven’t split, but are trying to find their sounds. “We wanted to take time and find ourselves. This way we can avoid the pressure of having to release new music frequently,” said Goldmax. “After some time though we’ll come back together and release new music.”
