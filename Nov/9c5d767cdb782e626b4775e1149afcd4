I firmly believe that one can tell a lot about a woman by taking a trip through their bag. It therefore makes sense that women indeed carry their lives in those bags, so the question is: What exactly do they carry in those bags? According to international security check survey, these were some of the weirdest and craziest items found inside a woman’s bag during a security check: 1. Ostrich eggs  When this matter was threatened to be taken to the Kenya Wildlife Service officers since it is illegal to carry ostrich eggs without a permit, the woman confessed the eggs were part of a good luck ritual. 2.Crocodile teeth Some may call it witchcraft, but this particular woman referred to herself as a witch doctor who carries magic wherever she goes. 3.The remote control In a matatu in Kenya, one woman couldn’t access money in her handbag and had to turn it inside out and guess what fell out? 4. Dildo According to a new survey of 1 100 adults by lingerie and erotic retailer Ann Summers, 85% of British women travel with sex toys. Most of them in particular carry dildos for self-catering purposes.
