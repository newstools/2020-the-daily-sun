THE rising number of football players losing their lives in road fatalities has become a serious cause for concern for the South African Football Players Union (Safpu). This is in light of the death of Anele Ngcongca, the former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns defender, who died in a car crash on the N2 highway in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. Ngcongca, who was 33 years old, is the latest statistic in a growing list of footballers to have lost his life behind the wheel. In a bid to curb the fatalities, Safpu will be embarking on a drive to educate footballers on advanced driving. “We are concerned. We have decided to embark on a road education of issues of advanced driving,” said Safpu president Thulaganyo Gaoshubelwe. “We are not saying we will avoid accidents. They do happen. But we are raising these issues based on the incidents that have happened to empower our own people. “We need all stakeholders to lend a helping hand to ensure that our players can stand for themselves and have the community at large abide by the rules of the road. Any life lost is one too many.” Ngcongca’s death comes hot on the heels of another car crash, involving Sundowns striker Gift Motupa, who fortunately survived the accident. It was a similar story with Bloemfontein Celtic duo of Jabulani Ncobeni and Andile Fikizolo, who also survived a car crash. Gaoshubelwe reckons they have seen enough deaths, not only of players, but of motorists on South African roads. “Two weeks ago, Celtic players were involved in an accident, fortunately, they survived. But it is a cause for concern. “All of us as South Africans need to be careful when it comes to using the roads because without paying proper attention when we drive, we can end up with a situation of losing talent,” added Gaoshubelwe. “As a nation during this time we lose a lot of people on our roads and we need to be extra careful.”
