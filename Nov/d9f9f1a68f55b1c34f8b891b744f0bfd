PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has warned people against dropping their guard during the festive season, saying it would reverse all the gains made so far. In his weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa said the second wave of coronavirus infections should be prevented and people should keep observing health protocols. “We are pushing ahead with economic reforms in energy and telecommunications. Plans are converted to action and commitments are reflected in jobs and opportunities. “It is all the more critical at this time, more so with the festive season approaching, that we do not become the architects of our own undoing,” he said. Ramaphosa said the economic recovery plan was being implemented, where plans were being converted to action and job opportunities created. He said vigilance was needed to ensure the second wave didn’t strike the entire country. “A resurgence at any scale will not just dramatically reverse our health gains, it will choke the green shoots of economic recovery that have emerged, and take us back from spring to winter. “To prevent a second wave, we must observe public health guidelines. When we fail to wear a mask at a social gathering, when we attend crowded events, we are not only putting ourselves and others at risk, we are also putting our economic recovery in jeopardy. Let us all continue to play our part,” said the president. Ramaphosa said emergency measures put in place in response to the pandemic laid a firm foundation on which to rebuild the economy. And as government focused on implementation of the plan, the priority was to stimulate growth and create jobs. Already there’s been progress in certain areas and new funding commitments for infrastructure development after a project roundtable last week were being seen. “Employment programmes under the Presidential Employment Stimulus have started. “We are pushing ahead with economic reforms in energy and telecommunications,” added Ramaphosa.
