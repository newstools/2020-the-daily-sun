Prince Nhlanganiso and Prince Lethukuthula Zulu were planning to go to the CRL Rights Commission, which is investigating various matters related to Kwasizabantu Christian Mission, and give their testimony. This was revealed by Prince Nhlanganiso during Lethukuthula’s funeral at kwaKhethomthandayo in Nongoma, northern KZN on Friday. He said they were also students at the mission. “We were there when it was closed down. My brother and I were planning to give our testimonies after we saw it being called to the commission,” said Prince Nhlanganiso. He said he won’t go because his brother was no more. “My brother was my witness. I fear they won’t believe me alone,” he said. Prince Lethukuthula was laid to rest at Emahhashini Cemetery in Nongoma. He was found dead on 6 November at his Northwold apartment in Joburg. An inquest docket was opened but cops are now investigating a case of murder. The CRL Rights Commission is investigating various matters related to Kwasizabantu Christian Mission. Since last month several witnesses, including rape victims and those who were pastors have testified about their experiences at Kwasizabantu.
