Cape Town City will lock horns with Bloemfontein Celtic in a DStv Premiership match at the Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3:30 pm CAT. The Citizens were licking their wounds during the Fifa break after recording their maiden defeat of the season in the league when they lost 2-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns at home. The defeat left City placed 10th on the league standings, having accumulated four points from three matches including a 1-0 win over Maritzburg United. Jan Olde Riekerink, the City head coach, is wary of Celtic, who secured their place in the 2020 MTN8 final after defeating SuperSport United in the two-legged semifinals. "Bloemfontein is a team that performs very well at the moment," Riekerink said. "They qualified for the MTN 8 final against Pirates so it's going to be a very challenging game. "They will come full strength. The final is too far away to be distracted by it. They will see our game as a very good opportunity to get three points." Meanwhile, Celtic snapped their four-match winless run across all competitions when they edged out SuperSport 1-0 in the MTN8 semifinal first-leg match just before the Fifa break. Phunya Sele Sele find themselves in 14th spot on the league standings, having collected one point from three matches including a 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates in their last league game. John Maduka, the Celtic head coach, will look to his influential midfielders Given Mashikinya and Lucky Baloyi, who caught the eye in their victory over SuperSport. "It's good we have the right balance in the midfield‚ because most games are won there," Maduka said. "You have got to make sure that whoever comes in gives their best to their ability. And Mashikinya has done exactly that‚ and Baloyi has done that. "So, we have the right balance in the midfield. And I'm very happy to have the midfielders who I have in the team." SuperSport
