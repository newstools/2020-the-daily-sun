GOSPEL legend Sipho “Big Fish” Makhabane says he doesn’t want to die before discovering a gospel gem in his province of Mpumalanga. He said this has been bothering him for many years. In KZN, he discovered top gospel singers such as Hlengiwe Mhlaba, Thobekile Mkhwanazi and Pastor Ncanda. In the Eastern Cape, he discovered Veliswa Skeyi and Malibongwe Gcwabe, who died in May. In Gauteng, he found Israel Mosehla, and Tshepiso Motaung, and from eSwatini, he discovered Shongwe and Khuphuka, Ncandweni Christ Ambassadors and France Dlamini. “All these artists are from different provinces and the others from the neighbouring country. I don’t want to die before discovering a big gospel singer in my province,” said Big Fish. He said he was giving away R50 000 to the lucky gospel singer.

The prize money plus a recording deal will be won at the Mpumalanga Can Sing auditions on 28 November at Mbombela Civic Centre in Mbombela at 7pm. He said the winner would come either from Enhlazeni, Gert Sibande or Enkangala district. He said there were 18 contestants from the three districts of Mpumalanga. Those who don’t walk away with the prize on the day will join Mpumalanga Praise. “I really want to leave a legacy. I have been singing since 1988.” Big Fish said people from Mpumalanga are excited about the talent search initiative. “In this initiative I’m trying to establish solo gospel artists under my theme discover, develop and expose,” he said. Big Fish said he would continue discovering more talent in the country and his wish was to take the talent search nationally. “Young people from other provinces say I have left them behind but because of lack of resources I can’t go national. I’m still knocking on the door for help so that I can take this nationally,” he said. Big Fish is grateful for the support from the National Lottery Commission, Mpumalanga Department of Culture, Sports and Recreation.
