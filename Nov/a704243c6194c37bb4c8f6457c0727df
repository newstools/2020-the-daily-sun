IF you can imagine it, Fine Bakes can create it! Images of the company’s work have been trending on social media. Many people can’t believe they’re real cakes. Owner and founder, Kurhula Makhuvela from Rotterdam in Giyani, assured Daily Sun this is the real thing. The self-taught cake artist and baker started the business in 2018 and operates from her home in Clayville in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. “People create round cakes, so I decided to transform the themes of the parties and events and make the cakes stand out “Just tell me what you want and it will be done,” said Kurhula. She said people ask her to make special cakes. “When people celebrate their businesses, I make a cake based on the theme. “For example, if someone is opening a mogodu restaurant I can make a mogodu cake.” She said people are surprised when she delivers a cake to an event. “Often, people aren’t sure if these are cakes or not,” she said. “We’ve created a Bathu Sneaker cake, sculpted the face of President Ramaphosa as well as Cassper Nyovest, a Chicken Licken box, Xibelani cake and creamy samp, among others.” On social media, people say they love her cakes.
