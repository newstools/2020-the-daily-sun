PREMIER Soccer League Young Player of the Season, Goodman Mosele of Baroka FC, has been rewarded by getting his first call up for the South African Under-23 squad. The 20-year-old midfielder is expected to get his chance to impress coach David Notoane when the SA U-23 side face Saudi Arabia later this month. The Olympic team is scheduled to play two back to back friendlies against the Saudi’s on 14 and 17 November in Saudi Arabia. The squad is expected to report for camp on Saturday afternoon and they will depart to the Middle East next Tuesday. Notable locally-based players not in the squad are the likes of injured SuperSport United midfielder Sipho Mbule and Promise Mkhuma of Mamelodi Sundowns But Notoane explained that they are giving more players a chance to prove themselves before the final stages of their Olympics preparations. “The idea is to try to bring in some of the promising players who have not had a chance to represent the national team,” said Notoane. “The likes of Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, Njabulo Blom, Mosele whom I rate very high, we want to see them going far even reaching the senior national team level.” FULL SQUAD: GOALKEEPERSDarren Johnson, Sifiso MlungwanaDEFENDERSTercious Malepe, Katleho Mohamme, Thabiso Monyane, Njabulo Blom, Sifiso Ngobeni, Sibusiso Mabiliso,GivenSiyabonga NgezanaMIDFIELDERSAthenkosi Dlala, Goodman Mosele, Lelethu Skelem, Kabelo Mahlatsi, Shane Roberts, Jammie Webber, Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, Siphephelo SitholeFORWARDSLyle Foster, Fagrie Lakay, Zakhele Lepasa, Keletso Makgalwa
