KAIZER Chiefs will be desperate for revenge when they face TS Galaxy. Amakhosi, who were embarrassed by minnows TS Galaxy in the 2019 Nedbank Cup final, will hope to put that right. The Rockets beat Amakhosi 1-0 in that final to become the first team from the second division to win the competition. And now they are in the top flight and will be looking to prove that their win against Amakhosi was no fluke. Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi, however, is expecting a different result from the last time these two sides met. “They might still have that confidence and momentum with them having beaten us before but for us, it’s not about history, it’s all about now,” said Akpeyi. “I’m sure they will be very well prepared for us, especially considering what happened at the weekend. “But we have learnt our mistake and we are coming out stronger.” Amakhosi will be hoping to bounce back from a painful defeat to arch-rivals Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby at the weekend. They were thumped 3-0 by their rivals and are currently on the brink of exiting the MTN8 “We put ourselves on the back foot,” added Akpeyi. “But we have all realized where we are going wrong. All we need to do is to put everything into the next game to make up for the loss to Pirates. “And for us, the sooner we get our points the easier it will be as the league continues. “For me, every game matters. It’s important for us to do better than the previous game in every match we play. “But we didn’t do that against Pirates. I hope we come out and do better against Galaxy.”
