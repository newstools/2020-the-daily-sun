Summer is deemed the weather for the outdoors and keeping things cool and fresh. In keeping things cool and fresh the outdoors are seldom complete without a cooler box to keep the beverages cold. Now, here’s the Coolest Cooler deemed the 21st Century Cooler. Regular cooler boxes are boring, break easily and are a hassle to move around. This cooler comes with a built-in ice crushing blender and makes breaking the ice the coolest thing ever. It has a waterproof Bluetooth speaker and a built-in USB charger port. This is indeed the real plug and music to outdoor chillers’ ears. If you are out at night the built-in LED lights and wheels make moving around easier. Also included with this R195 000 product is integrated storage of plates and knives, bottle opener and cutlery divider.
