MAMELODI Sundowns are rarely quick off the starting blocks. But this time, they are making their intentions of defending their league very clear, as seen when they picked up their second win in three matches with a 2-0 win over Cape Town City in Cape Town last night. Goals from Lyle Lakay and Keletso Makgalwa ensured victory against a team which is often a hard nut to crack for Sundowns. It was their first win four league matches against the Cape side. They are second with seven points with two wins and a draw from three matches, and trail leaders Baroka FC by two points. The DStv Premiership is a marathon and lots of twists and turns can be anticipated in a season, played under strange Covid-19 conditions. But Manqoba Mangqithi and his Sundowns coaching crew seem to have found the right combination, picking the best starting eleven from their array of stars. Hlompho Kekana started off the bench, with Mngqithi making only two changes to the team which played in the last match against TTM. Kermit Erasmus led the frontline alongside Peter Shalulile, who hasnâ€™t missed a match so far. But the defence has remained the same, as is the midfield which again included Andile Jali, who picked up the man of the match. Jali was again at his industrious best, assisting Makgalwa for the second goal. While the Citizens stuttered to their first league defeat, Sundowns looked like the home side as they took control of the Cape Town Stadium park. Lakay opened the scoring with a freekick straight out of a training session, turning deceptively to ram in a low shot past Peter Leeuwenburgh. The scrappy affair could well have ended with a draw for Sundowns, as they missed chances to wrap up the match quite early. Constant loss of possession remains a concern for Mngqithi. But he can be happy with a third clean sheet, as a result of a solid defence.
