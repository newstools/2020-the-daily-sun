Shame on those sick pastors who rape church members. We’ll never stop shaming them because what they’re doing is disgusting. The gruesome acts by so-called pastors is disturbing. Pastors who take advantage of their congregants don’t deserve to be called such. They should be treated more harshly than other rapists because of their position. We’re having more and more evil and horny men of God who prey on innocent congregants. These monsters do this cruel action and convince these women not to report cases. They lie that having sex with them will heal and solve the victim’s problems. Pastors are supposed to lead by example and treat congregants like their own children, but some don’t do that. Churches in Mzansi should have zero tolerance against gender-based violence. There should be systems in place to ensure that women and children are protected at all times. It’s always shocking when it’s pastors who’re accused of committing this crime. Letter by Rachel Molema Theresa Mews
