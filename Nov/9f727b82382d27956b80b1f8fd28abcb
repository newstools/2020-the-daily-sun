A COUPLE has been granted R10 000 bail each after they were charged with fraud, theft and money laundering. The accused (35) and her husband (36) appeared before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on Friday, 20 November. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi, the couple was arrested last week for alleged tax evasion. “The woman was charged in connection with fraud, theft and money laundering in contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act as well as the provisions of the Tax Administration Act. “During April 2017, she fraudulently submitted false tax returns to the South African Revenue Services (SARS), culminating in SARS losing an amount of approximately R2.2 million. “After she received the money, in a futile attempt to cover her tracks, she reportedly transferred the money into her personal bank account and into the bank account of her husband,” said Sekgotodi. They were each granted R10 000 bail. The case has been postponed to 2 December.
