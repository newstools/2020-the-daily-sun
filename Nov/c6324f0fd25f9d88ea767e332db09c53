NORTH West Legislature employees felt insulted by the newly implemented structure that has demoted most of them from their senior positions. On Monday, 16 November, workers picketed outside the legislature building demanding that the institution’s management must step down. This after management’s new restructuring process, which was implemented in July, failed to favour the majority of them. One of the aggrieved workers, Mary Mahlakeng, who worked for the legislature for 11 years, said she felt insulted. She said she was furious two weeks ago when she received an appointment letter that cut down some of the benefits she used to enjoy. “For me this new structure has created a lot of stress for all of us. We feel as if we are not valued while we were such dedicated employees,” she said. She said they were assured that no employee would be negatively affected, but people’s jobs have been downgraded, others upgraded while others were redundant. “I’m one of the people whose positions were abolished. I’ve been coming to work for two months without knowing what exactly I’m doing. We were requested to choose the position that we would feel comfortable to take but to my surprise, I received the placement letter which indicated that I don’t have car allowance on this new package,” she said. Another employee, Tshepo Lekoma, said he has never seen such a weak administration. . “As it happens now there are disparities caused by Mr Mosiane’s management. You cannot take the decision to put the divisions in one directorate and pay them unequally. That doesn’t show leadership,” he said. Secretary for the legislature, accounting officer Oageng Mosiane, said they have applied to the CCMA for reconciliation on issues relating to the implementation of the new structure. Nehawu’s provincial deputy chairman, Leonard Choenemang, said they were giving the legislature until Friday, 20 November to suspend management officials who came up with the structure.
