After the reopening of liquor sales in level 1, many car crashes on the roads have led to drivers of certain car models being mocked. They’re said to be the root cause of the whole situation. It sounds unfair, especially if you’re a disciplined driver yet drive those car models. Liquor is the main concern here as people drive under the influence. Booze and driving don’t mix, no matter how much experience you have or what kind of car you drive. Don’t get behind the wheel when you’re drunk, even when you’re only tipsy. Stay sober. Stay alive.
