FARMERS and surrounding residents woke up to news of murder and attack on Friday. This was after a 56-year-old farmer and his 26-year-old son were found in a pool of blood in Swartpan farm near Hennenman, Free State. A domestic worker received a call from the farmer’s wife that her husband was not answering his phone and asked her to go and check on the farmer. The domestic worker made the gruesome find at the family home and called neighbours and relatives. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the farmer was found shot in the head and his son stabbed. Makhele told Daily Sun: “A case of murder and house robbery is being investigated following an attack in Swartpan farm, which left the farmer dead and son injured. It is alleged the farmer was attacked in the house and shot in the head, while the son was overpowered on his arrival and stabbed in the back. It is suspected that two to three handguns were stolen during the robbery. It is not known how many suspects were involved and if they used any mode of transportation to flee the scene.
