Covid-19 marked a setback for the academic year. Back in 1976, the youth protested and triumphed against apartheid education. This year, that 44-year-old legacy was challenged by a pandemic that forced a sudden shutdown on educational institutions. If we’re not careful, this phenomenon will not only shutdown school activity – dreams and lifesaving careers might be crushed as well. Now is the time for the youth to stand on their own two feet and guarantee their future by not allowing Covid-19 to take away their appetite for education. Let’s use the exams as a platform to triumph. You might not have the power to stop the virus, but you have the power to stop it from causing your resilience and zeal for education to rust.
