FILM-MAKER Sonnyboy Ndlovu has been asking TV channels to give up-and-coming film-makers and production companies a chance. Sonnyboy from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun it breaks his heart that TV channels don’t open opportunities for new people. He recently shot a drama series called Isenzo Somubi – starring Macdonald Mathunjwa, Siphiwe Nkosi and Sipho Manzini – but was not able to get it onto any channel. He’s the executive director of Lahope Production. Sonnyboy told the SunTeam: “I’ve shot my drama series and it’s ready to be aired. However, channels are failing us because they don’t want to licence and commission us. “Even though we have made things simple by shooting and took a huge risk to prove we’re not after money, they’re still not helping. “I’ve been in the film industry for 17 years. I’ve now started my own thing and no one is opening doors for me.” Sonnyboy said channels kept commissioning the same production companies, which produce boring stories. “Many productions have fresh content and new talent, but they’re sidelined. We hope our plea will help open doors for other production companies.”
