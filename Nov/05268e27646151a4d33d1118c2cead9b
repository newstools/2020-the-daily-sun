SOUTH African-based DR Congolese World Boxing Council (WBC) cruiserweight champion, Ilunga Makabu Jr, is set to return home for his maiden title defence. The talented fighter will put his WBC crown on the line against highly regarded Nigerian Olanrewaju “God’s Power” Durodola in his homecoming fight on 19 December in Kinshasa, DRC. Their historic clash will see two African fighters battle for a WBC world title for the first time in boxing history. This is voluntary title defence for Makabu Jr who won this most sought after belt by outpointing his Polish opponent Michal Cieslak in January. His trainer Damien Durandt said they are expecting a competitive clash against the United States-based challenger. “I have watched Durodola fighting, he will bring a good fight. I’m expecting a good performance from Makabu who has the opportunity to fight in his home country again, which is great, he is very popular in DRC. It’s a great opportunity,” said Durandt. He added: “Makabu was well-received by the President of the DRC after winning the world title. The President also attended the fight. Makabu appreciates the fact that he represents his nation when he gets into the ring but also represents Africa as well.” Durandt, who is the youngest trainer to guide a fighter to a prestigious WBC world title, said his charge has inspired lots of youngsters in DRC. The young boxing mentor and his charge are in camp in Germany preparing for the battle ahead. “He inspires the youth, and gives hope to boxers in DRC that they can make it to the top,” said Durandt. Meanwhile, the 40-year-old Durodola, who is based in Kansas City, America, won the African Boxing Union (ABU) crown in February. He is rated third on the WBC world rankings, while South African fighter Thabiso Mchunu sits on top. Durodola has a record of 34 wins, seven defeats, while Makabu Jr has 27 victories and two losses.
