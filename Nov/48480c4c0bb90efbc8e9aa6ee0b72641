MAMELODI Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi has set a target of 71 points this season. Mngqithi, whose side has won the league in the last three seasons, wants to match the points record which Sundowns achieved in the 2015-16 season under former coach Pitso Mosimane. Mngqithi, who is helped by co-coaches Rhulani Mokwena and Steve Komphela, wants to emulate the feat of four years ago and says similarities between the 2015 squad are starting to show in this team. “The group is slowly coming together and we are slowly, slowly getting into the condition where the team got 71 points,” said Mngqithi. “We are trying very hard to push for that benchmark.” Sundowns were superb in 2015-16 season claiming the double and winning the Caf Champions League. They also set their own domestic record of unbeaten in 18 games from September 2015 until March 2016. The Tshwane giants are normally slow starters but this season things are different. They are at the summit of the log table after winning three of their four DStv Premiership matches and drawing the other. Themba Zwane, who scored a hat-trick in their 4-3 league win over AmaZulu at home last weekend, is forming a good understanding with the club's two new signings, strikers Peter Shalulile and Kermit Erasmus. The trio, who have scored seven league goals between, are becoming a potent force to be reckoned with. Mngqithi said losing the MTN8 quarterfinal at the hands of Bloemfontein Celtic was a blessing in disguise. “I think it helped us when we bombed out of the MTN8 because that was a big surprise for the team. We really wanted to go through,” said Mngqithi. "However, I still believe we deserved to have won that game, but in football, these things happen. "I think that setback galvanised us going to our first league match against Kaizer Chiefs (Sundowns won 3-0) and we have kept that momentum going. It is important for Sundowns to keep on collecting points in the early stages of this season."
