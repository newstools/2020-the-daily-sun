STRESSFUL times lie ahead for AmaZulu coach Ayanda Dlamini as injuries have decimated his squad. Dlamini will be without a recognised striker for their next two DStv Premiership matches, Lehlohonolo “Major” Majoro. He was sent off in their 1-1 draw against Cape Town City at the Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Saturday. This means Usuthu won’t have Majoro, who has been playing a starring role this season, scoring three league goals, including a goal against City, will miss the next two games. With the former Orlando Pirates striker suspended, it means the ambitious Durban side don’t have a proven goal scorer as Bongi Ntuli is still nursing an injury. Towering striker Somila Ntsundwana, who returned on loan from Royal Eagles, also picked up an injury in training prior to the game. “It’s bad to lose Majoro for the upcoming two games because he has been in top form by getting the goals for us,” admitted Dlamini. “To lose him at this stage, is bad for the team. But we have a good squad and other players will come in. They’ll have to do the job for us while he’s not around.” As that wasn’t enough, Usuthu were dealt further injury blows as Mbongeni Gumede, Sibusiso Magaqa (both injured against Mamelodi Sundowns last weekend), Mario Booysen, Samuel Darpoh and Butho Ncube also suffered injuries at training. Captain Siyabonga Mbatha also picked up an on Saturday. Mbatha was replaced midway by the inexperienced keeper Neil Boshoff. But there’s no concern in the goalkeeping role anymore. AmaZulu have signed Chippa United skipper Veli Mothwa. Dlamini, whose main task this season is to finish fourth, is hoping the doctors will give him better news before their upcoming game against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. “We had quite a few guys who were unavailable. We can’t afford to be losing players in this way,” said Dlamini.
