Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison is calling on all motorists and drivers to settle their outstanding traffic fines or face arrest. The department’s general manager for transport regulation, Sibandiso Nkuna, announced that a team has been set up in order to track down and arrest 15 motorists and vehicle owners with most warrant of arrest notices. “Traffic summonses are issued to motorists for various offences while on the road and vary in line with severity offences committed. These summonses are issued in terms of Criminal Procedure Act,” said Nkuna. “The top offender has 11 warrants of arrest and seemingly no efforts has been made by the offender to settle the summonses amounting to R24 000.” The team would visit the top 15 offenders by 13 November. “No efforts will be spared to bring offenders to book. We will even visit various workplaces in our endeavour to bring the serial offenders to book. We want to advise motorists not to wait for warrants to be issued but settle as soon as fines are issued and those with warrants of arrest will have to pay the outstanding fines or will be arrested immediately”, said Nkuna.
