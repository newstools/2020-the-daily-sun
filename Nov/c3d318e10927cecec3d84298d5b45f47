SUMMER is here and as we gear up for the holidays, many of us will be rushing to local swimming pools and attending pool parties to keep cool, including those lucky enough to be heading to the beach. Before diving in, here are some ground rules: 1. Covid-19 is still with us We are still living with this global pandemic and it remains of utmost importance that all precautionary measures must be observed, from maintaining social distancing to sanitising in these environments. 2. Invest in proper equipment and outfits Bring your own swimming towel, sunscreen and body lotion. It is also important to invest in a proper swimming costume. Ladies, mismatched bikinis and guys’ boxer shorts and briefs are a no-no. 3. Avoid boozing while swimming Alcohol and water are a dangerous combination and many drowning cases are caused by drinking and swimming. 4.Have lifeguards around Have people who know their way around water safety during these parties to ensure everyone’s protection.
