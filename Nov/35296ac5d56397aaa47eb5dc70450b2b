Actor and musician Zuko Vanyaza has returned to music after a 15-year absence. Zuko, who’s known for his role as Vuyisile on Mzansi Magic’s 2017 Xhosa drama Isikizi, released Nkosi Singabantwana Bakho last month. He said he felt the song would be his perfect comeback single. He wrote it the early ‘90s. “I wrote the song after late president Nelson Mandela’s release from jail. “It was a time when there was black-on-black violence in South Africa and the Rwandan genocide. “Because many other songs became popular during that time, including Boipatong by the late Brenda Fassie, I decided not to release it then.” ALSO READ | GOGO RELEASES AMAPIANO SINGLE Through the song, Zuko addresses issues surrounding Covid-19 and gender-based violence. “With everything that’s been happening this year, I saw it necessary to release the single at this time.” He said he used lockdown to learn more about music. “I’ve noticed that artists give away their lives and sign with labels that rob them. I didn’t want to be one of those. “So, I’ve been learning about the business side of music. I’m also working on my own streaming service and a music book.” The actor is also working on building his own production company. “I’ve been acting for over 30 years. It’s time I do my own thing and became my own boss. “We’re shooting a movie titled Ndenzeni. We recently finished the radio drama version. “We’re working on the movie. I belong in showbiz.”
