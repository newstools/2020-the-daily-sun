A 45-YEAR-OLD man made his first appearance in court on Monday, 23 November after allegedly raping two minors on Friday. His video has been trending on social media oat the weekend when he was accused of raping two Tshwane girls aged 11 and 13. In the video, a group of people are heard cursing him and asking why he allegedly raped the girls. He can also be seen on the video with what seems like blood on his trousers. The people in the video are also heard saying that the kids were bleeding when they were found. The man was allegedly caught at a hotel after the younger girl escaped and asked for help. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the cops from Sunnyside responded to the complaint. “It was reported that the suspect had taken the two minors from Lotus Gardens in Atteridgeville to a liquor outlet in Pretoria West and from there took them to the hotel. The suspect allegedly booked a room and raped both the victims,” she said. She said the younger girl escaped and alerted hotel security. “The police were called and subsequently arrested the suspect, who was still in the room,” she said. She said the investigators have confirmed that the suspect is a parolee after having served time for a previous rape. The civil rights movement, #NOTINMYNAME were at the court and said the man shouldn’t be given bail. “He must get a life sentence. He should be castrated,” said Themba Masango of the movement. Many people on social media were angry after seeing the video of the man. Mathebula Mkholo wrote: “Justice won’t be served if he goes to jail. He should be castrated.” Thembi MamaKhumo Msiza wrote: “This guy deserves to die. Eish I am angry.”
