Three men are set to walk 572 kilometres to raise awareness on gender-based violence, substance abuse and safer festive season. Wiseman Langa, Sphiwe Nhlapo and Motsamai Tsotetsi from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni want to encourage men to stop the abuse on women and children. The awareness walk will start in Vosloorus on 25 November and will end in Durban on 10 December. According to Langa, the aim of the walk is to raise awareness during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children Campaign. He said the cases of violence against women and children had reached alarming levels. “The abuse of women and children is on the rise. As men we should take a stand and protect them. We want to encourage men to be in the forefront and ensure they stop the abuse of women and children. They should open up and seek help whenever they have family problems,” said Langa. He said they had partnered with different organisations including SAPS, People Opposing Women Abuse, EMPD, and various businesses. Jane Zwane from Powa Vosloorus branch said they supported the initiative. She said: “The walk will inspire other men to join the fight against the abuse of children and women.” Another Powa counsellor, Rose Mokoena, said: “We urge women and children to report any form of abuse. Most women and children are scared to report cases because the perpetrators always threaten to kill them.” Vosloorus police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said they were honoured to partner with the organisation. “We need such awareness that will highlight the abuse of women and children in our society. Cops cannot fight crime alone. We need the community to report cases,” said Rossouw.
