AMBITIOUS AmaZulu are eyeing former Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Brandon Petersen and Mamelodi Sundowns forward Phakamani Mahlambi. According to SunSport sources, these players are next in line to join Usuthu, who have already made 11 new signings since chairman Sandile Zungu took over the ownership of the club at the beginning of last month. Petersen, who was released by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) after they bought the DStv Premiership status of Wits, will arrive on “loan” from Kaizer Chiefs next week along with Mahlambi, who does not appear to be in the defending champions’ plans for this season. This is despite Chiefs’ ban by Fifa of not being allowed to sign players in the next two transfer windows. Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt said he’ll have a chat with his management on what they are going to do with Petersen, Sifiso Hlanti and Phathutshedzo Nange, who were all free agents after leaving TTM and signed by Hunt. Zungu made it clear recently Usuthu are looking for a goalkeeper to give competition to club skipper, Siyabonga Mbatha. “AmaZulu are in talks to sign Petersen and Mahlambi,” revealed an insider. “Both are likely to be unveiled in the coming days.” It does not come as a shock that Mahlambi, who last scored the winner against Free State Stars when Sundowns claimed the Absa Premiership title in the last game of 2018-19 season, could be leaving the Tshwane-based outfit. He has not played a single match this season under co-coaches Manqoba Mngqithi, Rhulani Mokwena and senior coach Steve Komphela. The problem, said the insider, is that the 22-year-old, who was born in Ngotshe in northern KwaZulu-Natal, lacks discipline off the filed. This is believed to be part of the reason why Sundowns want to let him go as last season former coach, Pitso Mosimane, had several conversations with Mahlambi and told him to take care of himself off the field.
