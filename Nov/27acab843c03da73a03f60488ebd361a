THE delay in DNA test results has left the Shongwe family pulling their hair out! The family from Manyeveni, outside White River in Mpumalanga, have been waiting to bury Vuyo Shongwe (26) since June. Vuyo was reported missing in November last year after leaving home. His mum, Martha Skonela (60), told Daily Sun the family reported the matter to the cops and they started searching, but her son’s body was only discovered eight months later in June by a man hunting in the bushes. Vuyo’s body was hanging from a tree. “We started preparing for the funeral,” said Martha. MALAWI POLICE ARREST BUSHIRI “But we couldn’t continue as the police said DNA tests had to be conducted before releasing the body.” Martha went to Tshwane where the tests were conducted, but was told it would take at least 28 days. “We hoped that after that time we would be able to bury him. But here we are, still waiting,” she said. “Seasons have come and gone and I’m still sitting with my neighbours on the mattress.” Vuyo’s brother, Thapelo Shongwe (28), said when the body was found, Vuyo was still wearing the same clothes. “We went through all the processes. Why are they not releasing the remains? What is delaying the process?” Relative Pretty Maseko (38) said all they wanted was for the remains to be released. “They promised that this process wouldn’t take long. We don’t understand what’s happening now,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said police were investigating an inquest. “We’re waiting for the forensic reports. There’s a backlog. The investigating officer indicated that he’s in constant consultation with the family,” he said.
