THE battle over Sassa cards between cops and thugs rages on. Thousands of card scams take place every year as thugs allegedly clone cards and sell them. According to Daily Sun sources, a box full of Sassa cards meant for social grant beneficiaries is sold for R5 000. “Each card is loaded with money and the buyer has to withdraw the cash ASAP,” said the source. In many instances, cops have caught the buyers red-handed as they withdraw the money. This weekend, cops caught some of the masterminds who clone and sell the cards. Police received a tip off about a syndicate involved in the fraudulent cloning, loading of money and withdrawals of Sassa cards. Police went to the address given to them and after searching, found stacks of Sassa cards. They also found computers used to process the fraudulent transactions. Police confirmed the arrest of two suspects, who were found with 1 220 Sassa cards, five cell phones, two official stamps, one photo back-up stick, one video splitter, five laptops, one Sassa desktop, two desktop computers and one server. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the provincial organised crime unit arrested the suspects and stored the exhibits at Booysens cop shop. “The docket has been taken to the Hawks for further investigation” said Masondo. In Parliament, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu recently confirmed that the troubled Sassa was defrauded of more than R50 million in one year and spent another 18 million on investigations to recover some of the money. In response to a question from DA MP Bridget Masango, who wanted details on the close to 20 000 cases of fraud reported to Sassa, Zulu said a total of 19 448 cases out of 23 240 Sassa card-related fraud cases reported last year were resolved.
