The awards are back for their 27th event. “Musicians and artists who are eligible for a SAMA consideration are invited to submit their body of work. To qualify, music must be released between 1 February 2020 and 31 January 2021,” said their statement. “The SAMAs are open to Recording Industry of SA members and non- members. Head to the SAMA website for information on the entry process that allows for digital and physical entries.” The award ceremony went digital this year, where artists like DJ Tira, Dumi Mkokstad, Blaq Diamond, Kabza De Small, DJ Maphorisa and more took awards home. Recording Industry CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi said: “It gives us great pleasure to see the SAMAs maintain its longest run as an award ceremony of stature.
