That’s why people couldn’t understand her talent. I believe we’re still going to see more of her and am 100% behind her talent and humble soul.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Ndoni said she was humbled by Oskido’s gesture. “I saw his post and am quite humbled and excited by his words of encouragement. This means I’ve made a mark on the show and hope people will support me going forward,” said Ndoni. Ndoni is back in KZN. “It’s been an exciting journey. I gave the competition my all and am happy to say I’ve grown as an artist. For now, I’m taking a break and digesting what’s happened. My plan is to continue with my music career. People have already shown me they love me. Now, my job is to get back in the studio and entertain South Africans,” she said.
