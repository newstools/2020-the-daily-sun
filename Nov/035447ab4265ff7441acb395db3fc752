SWALLOWS have taken to the PSL like duck to water, unbeaten
in five matches. But it would seem the PSL returnees never thought they could
upset Kaizer Chiefs as seen when they edged their illustrious opponents 1-0 in
a league encounter on Tuesday. ”It’s our first season back in the PSL.
We do have experienced guys in the team but the youngsters were excited... got
carried away by the occasion. It's Chiefs, not just another game,” said
Swallows coach Brandon Truter. The Dube Birds are top of the DStv Premiership standings on
11 points, unbeaten in five matches. Substitute Joseph Mhlongo struck in the 86th minute to
secure the big win. Truter also shared the secret to their flying start to the
season as they have barely looked like newbies. ”I'm gonna let the secret out of the bag. We're a praying
team. This victory belongs to Jesus, to God... his power, his grace. ”We're taking it one game at a time. This game was the only
game that mattered and the next game is the only game we're looking forward to. ”I'm just happy for Joe (Mhlongo). Coming back from a long
lay-off, he didn't have much of a pre-season. We wanted to give him 20 minutes
and he scored the goal.”
