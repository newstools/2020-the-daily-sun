EVEN in death, drama and controversy follows Queen of Kwaito Mshoza. The singer’s friends claim her sisters, Seipati and Thandi, treated her poorly. Close friends of the singer, whose real name was Nomasonto Maswanganyi, said her sisters didn’t care for her. A source, who didn’t want to be named, told Daily Sun: “Only her friends were there for her. Sonto didn’t deserve to die at a public hospital.

Her friends didn’t have access to her and we were worried. We even considered going to the police.” A second source said Mshoza asked a friend to take care of her kids if she died. “If Sonto said her kids must stay with someone else, it means they had problems,” said the source. “It means she didn’t trust them with her children’s lives.” A third source said Mshoza’s sisters didn’t honour her funeral wishes. “Sonto loved white and they were supposed to get a white casket, not pink,” said the source. “Now that she’s gone her sisters are fighting with all of us and it’s because we know the truth.” The sisters referred the SunTeam to family spokesman, Khumbu Sithole, who denied the claims. “Thandi left her life behind to move in with Sonto and take care of her. Seipati took her to private doctors,” he said. He said no one hid Mshoza from her friends. “We had incidents where stories were leaked and we didn’t know who was responsible. “There have been people who pretended to be her friends. “With regards to respecting her wishes, we had many people telling us different things.”
