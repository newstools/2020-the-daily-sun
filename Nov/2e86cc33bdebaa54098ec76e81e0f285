Recipients of the Special Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress threatened to burn down the Post Office in Rustenburg. The frustrated recipients claim they have been going to the Post Office since 4 November but were turned back. Many come from as far as Hartbeespoort. The group alleged they were told that only a minimum of 100 people will be assisted. Meshack Mhlambi (36) said he was tired of coming to the Post Office and not getting a way forward. “We have been coming here since last week. I have to wake up at 4am every time. These people can’t even tell us when to come for our money. I don’t have money for transport and have been walking. They only take a few people in and they closed by noon,” said Mhlambi. North West Social Development spokesman Petros Siko said the matter was referred to Sassa.
