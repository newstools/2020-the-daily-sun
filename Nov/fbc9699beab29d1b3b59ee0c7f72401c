THE THUGS thought it was the right time to rob him while he was worshipping in the middle of the night. But it was the wrong time and the wrong victim! HE CONSULTED A TRADITIONAL HEALER – AND SOON THE STOLEN GOODS WERE RETURNED! While Teacher Ndlovu (37) from Klipgat in North West was praying and praising God at a night service at the St Michael’s Apostolic Church on Saturday, the thugs stole his 40 inch plasma TV, two front speakers and two subwoofers. On Tuesday morning, he found all his stolen items outside his house in an empty space in the backyard. Teacher told Daily Sun his goods were returned after he consulted a sangoma. “I never believed in traditional healers, but always trusted in prayer,” he said. “The power of my ancestors helped me. “The traditional healer has powerful muthi that brought back my things. “I’m still in shock. I’ve accepted that izangoma have power!” He said when he woke up in the morning his items were all there after consulting the sangoma. Teacher said the muthi the traditional healer gave him helped him get back his TV and sound system. “The traditional healer told me I shouldn’t worry as my items will be returned in a few days. “I never thought such a miracle was possible, especially from a traditional healer.” He said the thugs broke a window without burglar bars to gain access. Traditional healer Kuppe Banda said: “I gave my client a combination of muthi. “My muthi does different kinds of things to thieves depending on what a client wants.” He said the client wanted his stolen items back. “My muthi works wonderfully well when thieves have touched the places.” Banda claimed he’d helped many people recover their stolen items. “My muthi never fails me. It’s extremely powerful,” he claimed. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said a case of housebreaking was reported. “A window was broken open and electrical equipment and a plasma TV stolen,” she said. “No arrests were made and the case is under investigation.”
