THE world has suffered under lockdown due to the coronavirus. Many lives have been lost, businesses closed and productions shut down, resulting in an economic crisis. But Mbali Mhlongo (22) saw an opportunity. Mbali launched her hair care brand, Zanaya Care. Zanaya Care caters for natural hair but does not exclude treated and processed hair.

People would ask me which hair products I used and to be honest, I never had an answer because most products used were self-made,” Mbali said. “As I grew older I decided to finally share my secret. I first shared my handmade organic products with my sister and brother and trust me, it worked wonders. “Next were my friends and they were really impressed. Now I share Zanaya Care with you – an organic handmade proudly South African hair care product which helps keep my hair rich and healthy,” she said. Mbali said growing up, she was always an inquisitive child who was very eager to learn and try new things. “My very first experiment was with my hair. I went from long relaxed hair to extremely short hair, dreadlocks, red hair, blonde hair and back to a full, rich Afro. “After all the funky hairstyles I decided to chemically process my hair but finally landed with the big chop,” she said. Zanaya Care is available online for purchase. In the range you can purchase shampoo, conditioner and a moisturiser.
