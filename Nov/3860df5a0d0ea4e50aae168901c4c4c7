THE driver of a Ford Mustang crashed the muscle car while trying to flee from cops, police in Arkansas said. In dashcam footage from a cop’s car, the Mustang can be seen passing the police car on the highway and the officers trying to stop the vehicle. Instead of stopping, the Mustang driver sped off. As he was fleeing from the cops, he crashed into two other cars. When the driver was arrested, he admitted to driving at 286km/h during the chase. He was charged with speeding, reckless driving and resisting arrest. It’s reported that the driver was on parole after serving seven years of a 40-year sentence for kidnapping, robbery and theft.
