RESIDENTS were so gatvol they missed church on Sunday, 29 November just so they could build speed bumps. Residents of Brown’s Farm block 8 in Philippi said they were doing this to stop speeding thugs. They said young thugs hijack meter taxis and use them for drag racing. “We’re fixing it ourselves. Our kids are being injured by thugs speeding and drag racing on our streets,” resident Bongani Dhota told the SunTeam. He said they contributed money and bought cement and sand to build the speed bumps. Thobeka Mante (36), one of those working on the road, said her 12-year-old son had broken teeth caused by speeding thugs in Tywaka Street last month.  She said: “My son’s teeth will be removed because of thugs who speed and spin stolen cars on our streets. “You become scared to send your child to the shops because kids’ safety isn’t guaranteed. “Putting up humps will stop the thugs from speeding. “I realised this problem needed to be fixed. “I can’t pray it away. God helps us when we pray, but some things we need to do with our own hands.” Nyanga station commander, Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha, recently said kids as young as 12 were using Wi-Fi hotspots to request Bolt, Uber and other metered taxis. They apparently rob and hijack the cars that respond to their fake requests.
