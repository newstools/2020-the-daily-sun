PORT Elizabeth taximan Mongameli Jojo will rot in jail for raping his 14-year-old passager. The 34-year-old will spend the rest of his life behind bars after Port Elizabeth Regional Court sentenced him to life plus an additional 18 years on Friday, 27 November. Jojo, who’s been in custody since his arrest in 2016, was convicted for rape, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said: “The victim and her siblings, three and four at the time, took a taxi from their mother’s house to their gogo’s home nearby.” “Instead, Jojo took them to a cemetery, where he raped the young girl in the vehicle in front of her two young siblings. The little children cried helplessly during the ordeal. Jojo also robbed the girl of her sneakers and threatened to shoot her, although he didn’t produce a firearm. He then dropped them off at their gogo’s house.” Magistrate Nolitha Bara sentenced Jojo to life, plus 15 years for robbery with aggravating circumstances and three years for kidnapping after prosecutor Mxolisi Bebula had urged the court to impose life imprisonment. Bebula told the court: “The accused is not a first-time offender. In 1999 at the age of 13, he and friends at school raped a six-year-old fellow schoolmate in a classroom. He was a child rapist. A sentence other than life imprisonment would be an injustice.” Bara said: “Jojo not only destroyed the victim’s life but her entire family, as he raped her in front of her younger siblings. He showed no remorse and it was unlikely for him to rehabilitate as he had no respect for children.” The court also ordered for Jojo’s name to be entered onto the National Register for Sex Offenders.
