Busiswa spoked about the first time a man laid hands on her. “My first thought was not anger, but pity. I was in love and I thought the person I was in love with was going through something. I felt like I needed to help them get through that,” she said. Busiswa, who is set to release an album soon, advised women to leave abusive relationships. “If you’re going through gender-based violence in your life, walk away from that situation. Leave that situation. If you can, tell your friends and your family. You’ll never know who’s willing to help you. The best thing I ever did was to tell the people in my private circle what was happening,” she said. The videos are on her Instagram account as a three-part story. Her new single, My Side of the Story, is coming out on 20 November.
