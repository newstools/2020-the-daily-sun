Cape Town City say they only expect to see left-back Edmilson Dove return to action in the second half of the DStv Premiership season after he underwent knee surgery. Edmilson was injured in the 1-1 draw with Chippa United in October and now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines as he works his way back to full fitness. “We can confirm that Edmilson Dove had a successful knee surgery and is well on his way to a full recovery. We hope to have him back for the second half of the season,” City said on Wednesday. Coach Jan Olde Riekerink does have a readymade replacement in Terrence Mashego, who arrived from TS Galaxy in a swap deal that saw Ebrahim Seedat move in the other direction. The highly-rated Mashego has looked impressive in the games he has played to date, but any injury to him could leave City short in cover at left-back. City are next in action on Sunday at home to Bloemfontein Celtic. SuperSport
