CAPE Town cops have bust a teenager over the murder of a 76-year-old gogo found dead on the Cape Flats on Sunday. Manenberg residents are still in shock after the gogo’s half-naked body was found by her son. Captain Frederick Van Wyk said: “Sterling investigations by Manenberg detectives, who relentlessly worked on this case, led to the arrest of a 15-year-old male suspect late yesterday afternoon on a charge of murder. He will be appearing in the Athlone Magistrates Court once charged.” Manenberg resident Azeeza Morris told the SunTeam: “This is the same as a grandson killing his own grandmother. People are shocked with what happened. We know people are being killed every day because of gang wars, but this incident is shocking.” Cops said the body was found with multiple stab wounds on the upper body and they were still looking for more information as the investigation continued. Said Van Wyk: “Circumstances surrounding the death of a 76-year-old woman whose body was found by her son on Sunday, 22 November at Eljieskraal Way, Manenberg, are under investigation. According to reports, the half-naked body was found at midnight, with multiple stab wounds to her upper body.” Cops have called on the public to provide them with more information as they investigated the gruesome killing and to contact Manenberg cops on 021 699 9400 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
