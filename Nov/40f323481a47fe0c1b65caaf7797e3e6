Swallows FC recorded their second win of the DStv Premiership season with a 2-0 victory over Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Wednesday. Ruzaigh Gamildien broke the deadlock on 59 minute at Thohoyandou Stadium ahead of a late second from Njabulo Ngcobo to see Swallows end the evening on seven points in third place on the standings. The Dube Birds started well with Kamohelo Mahlatsi breaking free of the Tshakhuma defense and beating goalkeeper Washington Arubi before the ball was cleared off the line. Mahlatsi then found a great pass to set up Gamildien with a chance on the edge of the area, but Arubi was well placed to make the save. Arubi tipped a Gamildien free-kick onto a post before a good chance for TTM with Sanele Tshabalala forced to make a brilliant double stop. There were calls for a penalty towards the end of the first half as Makhanya Moeketsi went down in the box but the referee waved play on. Tshabalala then denied Mokgakolodi Ngele as he struck a superb free-kick goalward at the start of the second period. And the save proved to be crucial as Gamildien went up the other end to give his side the lead. There were half chances for both sides as the match wore on but Ngcobo sealed the win for Swallows with a goal three minutes into injury time at the end of the tie. - TEAMtalk media
