For four years she’s been hoping he will stop playing
around. But then she found out that he’s a serial cheater but she’s
not ready to walk away. “I love him so much and I don’t want to lose him,” she told
the People’s Paper. The woman said she got hold of his cellphone earlier in
October and found shocking videos and images of the women her tall dark man was
sleeping with. The woman who asked not to be identified because of her
work, said she believes he needs help. “He might be a sex addict. I gave him a lot of sex. I don’t
know why he went around sleeping with other women,” she said. She said she counted pictures of more than 20 women on his
phone. “They come in all shapes and sizes,” she said. “Clearly after sex, he takes photos and videos of them. Who
in his right mind takes photos with every woman he sleeps with?” She said she caught him red-handed with three of these
women. “One was a prostitute from Bloemfontein, the other was a
teenage girl and the other was a married woman.” “When I arrive at his place I find that some women leave
panties and heels and some even leave used condoms behind.” She said she confronted him many times and he apologises and
promises not to do it again but he keeps on cheating. She said her boyfriend who worked for a testing centre in
Soweto and also owns a driving school lures the women with money. She said she borrowed his phone and was shocked to see how
many women were involved. She said she met his boyfriend in 2017 at the testing centre
on Soweto. “At the time I was getting my driver’s licence,’ she said. She said the man was caring and looked after her and even
took her to his house. “He made me believe I was the only one and I relaxed.’ She says the problem started this year during lockdown as
they were not staying together. ‘I think he might have been cheating but this year it got
worse because we were not together. Daily Sun spoke to the boyfriend who said if the woman is
not happy she must just leave,” he said.
