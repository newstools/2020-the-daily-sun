NOT for the first time this season, Ndumiso Mabena led from the front as Bloemfontein Celtic eked out a 1-0 league win against Black Leopards on Wednesday. Mabena tapped in from Tebogo Potsane’s low cross to hand the home side the lead which ultimately secured them maximum points at Dr Molemela Stadium. Mabena has been influential for Celtic, rising to the occasion whenever needed. He combined well with Potsane, the pair linking beautiful as they pushed back a shaky Leopards defence. They worked hard to help Siwelele broke their duck, picking up their league first win of the season. It was an improved performance from a team which went down 4-2 to Cape Town City on Sunday. But Victor Letsoalo, the man of the match, admitted their minds have been on the upcoming MTN8 Cup final, though they also have the Caf Confederation Cup assignment to worry about. However, they would have drawn a lot of confidence from the win, which has moved them to four points. ”Its early days. But we are getting there. We've been playing well and we knew we’d step up, ” said Mabena.
