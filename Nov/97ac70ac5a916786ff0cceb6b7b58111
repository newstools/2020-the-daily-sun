PITSO Mosimane’s bright start to life in Egypt continues. The former Mamelodi Sundowns coach led his new side Al Ahly to the Egyptian Premier League on Saturday following their 3-0 win over El Gaish. The Egyptian giants have extended their record, clinching their 42nd league title.Mosimane, a serial winner himself, lifted the 14th trophy of his glittering career as a coach. Mosimane joined the Red Devils with the league title pretty much wrapped up all he needed to do was to add some style. And it is for this reason that Mosimane refused to take full credit for the league title, thanking his predecessor Rene Weiler for laying a solid foundation. “Respect to Coach Weiler,” said Mosimane on Twitter. “I have just been called to finish all the games that he left behind. He had the League wrapped up. All I made sure was to finish with flair and in style. “The former coaching staff played a great role in winning the title. Also, I would like to thank the players for their efforts during the whole season. “I am very sad that our fans are not in the stands to celebrate the title with us and I wish to see them soon in the stands.” Mosimane and Ahly will now turn their attention to the CAF Champions League. They will face either Zamalek or Raja Casablanca in the 2019/20 final. “We hope to win the CAF Champions League title and make our fans happy,” added Mosimane.
