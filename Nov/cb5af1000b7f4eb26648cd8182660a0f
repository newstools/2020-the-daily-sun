CAPE Town residents are shocked after a Metro cop violently pulled a man from his wheelchair. The video that is making rounds on social media shows two Metro cops arguing with the man who wanted to move while sitting on his wheelchair. One officer is seen blocking the wheelchair by his boot. After the man on wheelchair insisted in asking for his way out, one cop is seen dragging the wheelchair and leaving the man to fall on the ground.He tried to hold on to his wheelchair but to no success. This angered the people who were with the man. They took the wheelchair and climbed back. He started shouting asking the cops why they were mistreating him. The man is believed to be from Crossroads and the SunTeam is still tracking him down. The City of Cape Town immediately suspended the officers who are implicated in the incident. Mayor Dan Plato said: “Following a video that was shared on social media regarding an incident involving two City of Cape Town Metro Police officers and a member ofthe public in a wheelchair, I immediately discussed the matter with the City’s Safety and Security Executive Director, Richard Bosman, who confirmed that both officers have been suspended with immediate effect, pending the outcome of a full investigation.” Plato apologised for the behaviour of the officers. “I want to apologise unreservedly to the member of the public, whose name is not yet known to me, for what he experienced. The manner in which this situation was handled is not what we expect from our staff.” This is not the first time the city’s security officials have been involved in the mistreatment of a members of the public. Law enforcement officials dragged a naked man from his shack in Khayelitsha earlier this year.
