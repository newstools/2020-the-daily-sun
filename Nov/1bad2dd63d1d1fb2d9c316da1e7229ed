A MAN (50), who doubles up as community policing forum and civic organisation member, has abandoned bail for the second time fearing for his life in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Thursday, 19 November. During his appearance before Magistrate Tanya Du Preez, his lawyer Owen Mnisi told the court his client had abandoned bail and opted to be kept in jail. The man has been accused of rape. “We were here for making the bail application. But after a lengthy discussion with my client, he decided to abandon bail. He opted to be kept in jail,” said Mnisi. “Sir, you abandoned bail. Detective Sergeant Tintswalo Chauke, who is the investigating officer in this matter, said the DNA results might take up to 90 days at least,” said Du Preez. This after state prosecutor Lot Mgiba said the court had not yet received the DNA test results from the national forensic lab. “I am confident that this case will be fairly judged as the accused himself saw it fit not to live with the society,” said the alleged victim’s mum. She told the SunTeam that she had visited her lover in Mkhuhlu near Hazyview, Mpumalanga leaving her daughter playing with the accused man’s kids at his homestead in Hlalakahle Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. When she came back home, the mum saw her little girl crying and she couldn’t walk properly. Doctors confirmed that she was raped. Her panties had dirt and reddish spots. The girl was raped by the man after he took her from his gate, alleged the mum. Members of the ANC Women’s League and Ward 34 chairperson, Louis Mnisi, were protesting outside court to oppose his bail. They were happy to hear he had abandoned bail. “We were happy when he chose to remain jailed for his sins. So we still believe justice will take its course without any favour or fear,” said the chairperson. The matter has been postponed to 29 January for the DNA test results.
