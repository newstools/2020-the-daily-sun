IT IS another Phuza Thursday and as always, we would love to encourage people to drink responsibly. This Phuza Thursday, we shine a light on the most potent alcoholic beverages in the world. This is unlike your academics where the higher the percentage, the greater the results. So, let’s take a look at which alcoholic beverages carry the most alcohol content: 1. Spirytus Stawski (96% alcohol) This is the world’s strongest liquor that has a gentle smell and a mild taste. 2. Bruichladdich X4 Quadrupled Whiskey (92% alcohol) This is the most alcoholic single malt whiskey that is made using a 17th century quadruple distillation method. It is the most potent whiskey. 3. River Antoine Royale Grenadian Rum (90% alcohol) This drink from Grenada is made by using the old technique of pot distilling, which is a very slow distilling process. 4. Devil Springs Vodka (80% alcohol) The Devil Springs Vodka is undoubtedly one of the strongest vodkas on the planet and is used predominantly in cocktails. 5.Good ol’ Sailor Vodka (85% Alcohol) This vodka is mostly consumed in Sweden and it is hardly known to the rest of the world. It is used in small doses for cocktails.
