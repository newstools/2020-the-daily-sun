Duo Palesa Manne and Palesa Maakwe, popularly known as the 2PMDJS, have released a new song titled Weh Mamee. Their first single, Underwater, was released in 2018. They featured Duncan, Zakwe and Rascoe Kaos on Weh Mamee. Manne told SunBuzz: “We started working on the song before lockdown and completed it during lockdown. “The collaboration came after we had witnessed Rascoe Kaos freestyling to one of our songs and we fell in love with what he was doing. “We then approached him and he agreed to collaborate with us. But after working on the song, we realised it needed more Zulu rappers. That’s when we approached Zakwe and Duncan.” ALSO READ GOGO RELEASES AMAPIANO SINGLE! The 30-year-old from Kagiso in Mogale City said working on the song was challenging. “During the peak of the pandemic everything was done in different studios, but luckily we managed to finish.” She said they hoped this song would become an anthem ekasi. “We decided to rope in Duncan and Zakwe because we didn’t want it to be just a Joburg township anthem. We also wanted to reach other parts of South Africa. Although we did not get a chance to be in one studio, the experience of working with them was great. They did not give us a hard time. They were professional and didn’t look down on us because we are women,” said Manne. Maake said they’ll release an album next year. “Our first official album is coming out next year. Although our first love is hip hop, we’ve experimented a lot and people can expect to hear a variety of sounds in the album as we’ve worked with artists such as Gigi Lamayne and Mafikizolo,” she said. Their single is available on all digital platforms.
