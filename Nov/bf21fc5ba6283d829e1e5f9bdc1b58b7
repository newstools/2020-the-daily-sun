JUDGE Prince Manyathi was visibly gatvol with Dumisani Mkhwanazi’s delaying tactics in the South Gauteng High Court on Monday, earlier today. Mkhwanazi is accused of killing University of Joburg student Palesa Madiba in 2013. Once again, the matter had to be postponed as Mkhwanazi’s lawyer Don Thinane was not in court as his client allegedly hadn’t paid him. Manyathi said: “I’ve already postponed this matter several times. This matter comes from 2013. The deceased’s family have the right to finality of the matter and a speedy trial. We have to finalise this matter. We cannot be playing games between the attorney and the accused.” He said he would agree with the state to postpone the matter to Wednesday, 11 November. “We need to know what is happening on Wednesday,” said the judge. Manyathi also had a warning for Mkhwanazi’s sister Tshidi Mkhwanazi, entrusted with facilitating Thinane’s payment: “Make sure Mr Thinane is here on Wednesday. If he’s not here, I’m going to set a trial date and you are running the risk of conducting this matter on your own without legal representation.” NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonodwane said: “These are further delays. The family is longing for closure. We therefore welcome the court’s decision as the judge has put his foot down. The family of the deceased has a right to justice as much as this court has given the accused ample opportunities to secure legal representation. The court has advised him to seek legal aid as he faces offences of a serious nature. The ball is in his court whether he’s going to represent himself or pay his lawyer on Wednesday.”
