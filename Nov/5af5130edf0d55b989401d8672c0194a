GAUTENG cops had their hands full with raids that started on Friday and ended in the early hours of yesterday morning. Provincial acting commissioner Major-General Patricia Rampota led O Kae Molao Operations in Joburg, targeting liquor sellers who break the law. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said in a statement that 15 liquor outlets were closed, 44 people arrested for drinking and driving and 20 were bust for public drinking. The owner of a popular liquor outlet in Rosebank was fined R1 500 for failing to display a liquor license, and another was fined R1 500 for allowing patrons to leave with liquor. “Over 1 050 suspects were arrested across Gauteng during operations led by district commissioners,” said Masondo. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE MEN WITH THE BIGGEST 4-5s? In Tshwane, 396 people were arrested for offences including murder, armed robbery, rape, malicious damage to property, assault, dealing in drugs, dealing in liquor without a licence and public drinking. In the West Rand, 158 arrests were made for similar crimes. Cops in Ekurhuleni bust 483 suspects for serious and violent crimes, including robbery, hijacking, rape and murder. Masondo said the arrested suspects will appear in various magistrates courts from today. Meanwhile in Tshwane, 14 000 litres of booze was destroyed by police on Friday. The booze was confiscated during previous operations. Major-General Hilda Mohajane said destroying the liquor would send a message to the public that the police was committed to the fight against illegal liquor outlets. She said most illegal outlets were proven to add to social problems in communities. She said outlets not following the Liquor Act were also contributing to the spread of the coronavirus. “When we get to these places, we find people are not social distancing, not wearing masks and not sanitising. It’s life as usual for people out there,” she said.
