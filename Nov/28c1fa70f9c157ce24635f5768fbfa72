FORMER Bafana Bafana defender Anele Ngcongca will be laid to rest in Gugulethu on Thursday. However, family spokesperson, Siyasanga Ngcongca, said the family are yet to decided on the place of his memorial service, or even some finer details about the star defender's venue of funeral. The 33-year-old, who starred at KRC Gent in Belgium, passed away on Monday in KwaZulu-Natal after he was involved in a fatal car accident. Ngcongca was set to join AmaZulu on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns at the time of his death after both clubs agreed on the deal. “The funeral will be on Thursday, 3 December,” said Ngcongca, the family spokesperson. “The venue, we have not decided on it yet and so is the memorial service details.” Ngcongca’s passing saw Sundowns technical staff wore T-shirts with Ngcongca’s face in the front and his name when the Brazilians beat Stellenbosch FC 3-0 at Loftus Stadium on Saturday. In his honour, both set of players from Sundowns and Stellenbosch, including technical officials, paused in the 16th minute, in respect of the jersey No 16 he wore at the club, and clapped for one minute for their fallen hero. AmaZulu also honoured the player by wearing T-shirts with his face during their warm-up for their game against Cape Town City, which they drew 1-1 on Saturday. While AmaZulu also showed their gesture, Sundowns coach Manqoba Mngqithi said have dedicated their next 16 games, which started with the game against the Stellies at the weekend, in honour of their fallen hero.
