WHEN residents were given title deeds in 2009, they were over the moon. But this soon turned to disappointment when they found the deeds they received were copies. On 28 November, Tshwane MMC for human settlements Mpho Mehlape-Zimu brought relief to residents of the Nellmapius Property Projects when she handed over the proper documents. The residents finally had ownership of the houses they had started renting in 1994. Mehlape-Zumu said in the late 1990s, Gauteng Human Settlements appointed a service provider to transfer the 162 properties to beneficiaries, but only 129 were registered. It was later found that 60 of the registered owners had received only copies of their title deeds. “Through the city’s engagement with the provincial department, a new service provider was appointed to conclude this process and the remaining title deeds were issued,” she said. Mehlape-Zumu said there were 10 title deeds outstanding but they would be handed over next year. Councillor Thabo Ntlatleng said he had been fighting for the community since 2016, as it wasn’t fair for residents to pay rent while bigger RDPs in the area were handed over for free. Resident Brenda Julius (58) said she has been living in fear of being evicted. “After all these years, I will be happy knowing my home is really mine,” she said.
