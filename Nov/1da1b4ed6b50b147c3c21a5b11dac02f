TIMES are tough for everyone ekasi, but Buyani Manikivana has found a way to put food on the table. The 37-year-old father of two washes wheelie bins for a fee. “I do ceilings and tiling, but I sometimes don’t get jobs and this means no money to look after my family,” said Buyani. “This is why I ended up washing bins.” Buyani’s aim is not only to make money, but ensure his kasi is clean. His friend, who used to wash bins, died. “I saw a lot of dirty bins and realised no one was doing that job. I then decided to go house-to-house and asked homeowners for the job to wash their bins.” Buyani washes bins on Mondays and Thursdays in Mau Mau and surrounding areas in Nyanga, Cape Town. He washes them by the side of the road, using water and disinfectant. He said he tried to empower some youth by employing them, but they only worked for a few days and disappeared. When the SunTeam spoke to him on Monday, Buyani was washing 40 bins. “I charge R50 per month and wash the bins twice a month,” he said. Resident Musawenkosi Magangeni (56) said he was happy with Buyani’s services. “When you sometimes empty the bins, they still have a strong stench and not everyone is ready to wash them. “What this man is doing is good. It makes our lives easy, as he’s not expensive,” said Musawenkosi.
