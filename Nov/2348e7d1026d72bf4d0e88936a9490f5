Two Mpumalanga brothers died after drowning in a pool while celebrating a party in Barberton on Saturday, 28 November. Elvis Khumalo (33) and June Khumalo (30) were among the 15 family members from Tjakastad who decided to host a party at Msunduka Park. Mpumalanga police spokesman, Colonel Donald Mdluli, said the siblings were last seen by another family member swimming that evening but mysteriously vanished. He said a search ensued on the same night but without success. “On Sunday, the search continued but before midday, an employee at the park noticed something suspicious in the pool and that’s when the lifeless bodies of the siblings were discovered,” said Mdluli. “Police and the paramedics were notified about the incident and upon arrival, the victims were certified dead.” Mdluli said police are strongly warning community members to refrain from swimming when under the influence of alcohol. “Police are appealing to the public to avoid the dangers of swimming in pools and dams, especially without adequate training, proper monitoring and whenever they’ve consumed beverages which might put their lives in a compromising position. “Parents are also urged to look after their children, especially now that schools will be closing. Also, dams and rivers will be full this time of the year and kids might disregard the danger thereof, if not monitored,” he said.
