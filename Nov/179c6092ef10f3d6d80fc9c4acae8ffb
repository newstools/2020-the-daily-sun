THE late gospel singer Neyi Zimu was honoured at the seventh Ingoma Awards last weekend. The event was held at the house of Treasures Ministries in Joburg. Neyi’s son and his wife, Dr Neli Zimu, attended the event and received the Tribute Award. At the awards, gospel singer Dumi Mkokstad won big, scooping the Album of the Year award. Speaking about his award, he said: “I’m truly humbled by this award. This is my first Ingoma Award and it means a lot to me. At this point in time I feel I have to thank my manager, Mxolisi Mhlongo, and everybody who supports my music journey.” His winning album is titled Calvary.

It already has a gold disc. “However, I haven’t shown the gold disc to anyone or shared this news with anyone until now. Therefore, I believe this is God’s anointed album and I think I’ve outdone myself in it,” said Dumi. “I believe we all had a chance to win but grace chose me this year. I also know that I stand to win another huge award at the SABC Crown Gospel Awards and I am crossing my fingers. I am hoping that people will vote for me,” he said. “I’ve actually been nominated in four categories: Best Male, Best Artist, Best Traditional and Best Songwriter on Nathi Sithole’s Konke Kuhambe Kahle. I am therefore encouraging everyone who supports my craft to vote for me,” he said. Other winners include Lombard Mtshinge, who won Song of the Year and Pretty Mhlongo, who won Best Female Artist. Ingoma event organiser Dan Raseluma said: “We are happy to have hosted this event despite challenges. At some point we had to postpone the event due to Covid-19. We were even thinking of doing it virtually, but fortunately the country moved to level 1, which allowed us to host 250 people. As a result only the nominees and invited guests attended this event.”
