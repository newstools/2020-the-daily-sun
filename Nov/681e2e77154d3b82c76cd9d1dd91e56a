Fighting over booze doesn’t make sense. I’m disappointed that some people are losing their lives due to alcohol. Everyone talks about the triple murder at Lockdown Village informal settlement in Delft South, Western Cape. These guys wanted to do something for themselves, but lost their lives. Jealousy remains a serious problem in our society because we don’t want to see other people’s businesses doing well. Fighting over booze has led to senseless killings in the country. Things can’t continue like this. No one goes to liquor outlets to die, and boozers should avoid getting into petty fights with strangers. The police should start taking alcohol-related murders seriously and arrest the perpetrators. These senseless killings must stop!
