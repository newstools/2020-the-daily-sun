THE festive season is upon us and we all know that, indeed, the silly season is here! After a year characterised by constant blackouts, courtesy of Eskom, a new blackout will be the order of the day this festive. According to statistics, December is the month when the most booze is consumed. It’s inevitable that alcohol blackouts will happen. A blackout is a temporary condition that affects your memory. Blackouts occur when your body’s alcohol levels are high.
