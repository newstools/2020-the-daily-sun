HIP-HOP artist Duncan Mbambo is set to be honoured for his song, Sikelela. The event is organised by Durban-based organisation, Masiqoqane Albinisim Foundation. It will take place this coming Saturday. The event aims to properly thank him for raising awareness about the killing of people living with albinism. On Sikelela, Duncan speaks about how people living with albinism are being killed for muthi purposes. “When I composed this song I had no idea it’d get this much recognition. But I’ve come to realise that it’s not just an ordinary song. It talks to different people at different levels,” said Duncan. “I actually released this song last year, but it keeps gaining momentum. Last month, I won the Best use of KZN in a music Video at 8th Simon Sabelo KZN film and television Awards because of this song,” he said. He said that he featured a cappela group Thee Legacy on the song. “When I wrote this song I had no idea it’d make such impact. However, I must also add that whenever I write I try to be realistic and address societal issues and I guess that’s why people relate to my songs.” ALSO READ | DUMI MKOKSTAD GETS HITCHED Duncan said that he was not expecting this honorary event. “When the Masiqoqane Albinism Foundation called me I was surprised and happy at the same time. But their gesture has humbled me,” said Duncan. Event organiser and foundation founder Andile Ngcobo said that they could have honoured any other artist, but Duncan’s work stood out. “When people with albinism were hunted and killed, he showed us support. He became one of us and fought with us.”
