Mshoza's memorial service is underway at Bassline in Newtown. Friends and family of the Kortes hitmaker have started descending on the venue. Many of them are wearing white and not black, the colour normally worn in memorial and funeral services. Friends who spoke to Daily Sun said this is a sign of celebration. “Today we don’t want to mourn, but we want to celebrate Mshoza. That’s why we’re wearing white,” said one of the people in attendance.  Mshoza, whose real name is Nomasonto Maswangayi, died on Thursday, 19 November. The Queen of Kwaito had revealed in 2014 that she was diabetic. Her long-time manager, Thanduxolo Jindela, confirmed that Mshoza died from diabetes complications. The 37-year-old star will be buried on Saturday, 28 November.
