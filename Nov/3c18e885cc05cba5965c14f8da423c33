WE ARE three days away from the start of December and the start of the silly season. Many companies are going on recess and the season’s festivities will soon be underway. After going through the year where Covid-19 put all of our lives on lockdown, December presents an opportunity for people to press the reset button on everything that took place this year, including our relationships. Like Black Coffee said in song, this year was indeed a hard time for lovers. After a lot of relationships have taken strain, don’t be surprised if your relationship status changes in December. Psychotherapist Karen Phillip says the Christmas period can be stressful for a number of reasons, relationship breakdown being a key factor. After being with each other for 11 months, this is the time when couples tend to want an emotional timeout. Research also tells us the end of the year is the most common time for couples to break up. So, if your partner suddenly wants an emotional timeout this December, chances are your relationship status is about to change.
