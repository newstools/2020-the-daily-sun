A DEVASTATED mum told Daily Sun she wanted real justice – the kind of decisive justice that only the people can bring. Keneowe Selebeleng (29) from Katlehong in Ekurhuleni said the law wouldn’t be good enough after her nine-year-old daughter was raped and murdered. She sent her child to buy milk at about 7am on Tuesday, 10 November. Thirty minutes later she got worried and went to look for her. “When I got to the shop the store owner told me she had gone to another shop,” said Keneowe. Her daughter was not at the other shop. “I called the police four times and never got an answer. I went with residents to search for her,” she said. “We kept skipping the mkhukhu where my daughter was locked up.” Keneowe went to Eden Park cop shop to report her missing daughter and when they came back with the police, they found her body. She said two weeks earlier the spaza shop owner came to their home but they didn’t know what he wanted at night, so they ignored him until he left. Gogo Matsholo Selebeleng (69) said she hoped the community would deal with the perpetrator. “The police always fail us,” she said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Mathapelo Peters said the minor suspect (16) and the shop owner (36) were both arrested. The older suspect has a fraudulent SA identity document. “The 16-year-old, who works at the shop, could not provide satisfactory answers about the whereabouts of the missing child,” said Peters. “The search was extended to the room where the body of the girl was found with a stab wound to the upper body and wrapped in plastic.” The suspects are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Magistrates Court on Thursday, 19 November with the third suspect, a woman, appearing in absentia. “The three have been charged with kidnapping, murder, and contravention of the Immigration Act,” said Peters.
