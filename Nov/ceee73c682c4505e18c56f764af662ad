NEWLY promoted Pretoria Callies will be dipping into the market for players to strengthen the team for the rigours of the GladAfrica Championship. But nothing will be done without the key input of head coach Sammy Troughton and his technical team. Together with his assistant Sly Mosala, Troughton has guided the sleeping giants of Mzansi football into the first division through the recently concluded ABC Motsepe League play-offs. Local clubs have a tendency of kicking coaches to the curb once they achieve promotion. But Troughton is not about to suffer the familiar fate. He will be there when the season kicks off on 27 November. “We have a meeting with the technical team and the CEO to work on the plan for the season, including improving the departments that need beefing up. Time is not our side,” said Callies chairman Moses Malada, who took the team through the victory parade in the capital city on Sunday. “We believe the coaches have done a great job and that they can continue doing the job going forward.” Malada has hastened to caution against high expectations on the newly promoted team. “We can’t aim high for now because time is not our side. But the agreement we have now, the consensus we’ve reached is that ‘let’s go on and maintain our status in the NFD’. “The following season we can start dreaming of going to the PSL,” he said. “The idea is to get Callies back where they belong, in the premier division. We owe it to the community of Atteridgeville and to the legends who are always supporting us, telling us to bring the glory days back, the likes of Lucas “Masterpieces” Moripe, Ntate George “Mastermind” Kgobe and many others. They need to see this brand right back there. We need to ensure that it happens while they are still here with us, so they can witness it all.”
