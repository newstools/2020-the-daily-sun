KZN legislature deputy speaker Mluleki Ndobe will be laid to rest today. The funeral will take place in his home town, Umzimkhulu. He will be sent off in a provincial official funeral. The premier and members of the legislature are expected to attend. Ndobe allegedly shot himself on 6 November at his house in Glenwood, Durban. He had been in and out of hospital fighting cancer. He was linked to the murder of ANCYL leader Sindiso Magaqa but charges against him were dropped. Ndobe was a teacher by profession. He was also a former mayor of the Harry Gwala District Municipality. ANC spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela said Ndobe was a dedicated and a disciplined cadre who had served the movement at various levels previously as Harry Gwala mayor, South African Local Government Association KZN chairman and was also the leader of the ANCYL in the region for a number of years. KZN police spokeswoman Thembeka Mbele told Daily Sun that cops found a 9mm firearm next to the body when they were called to the house. He was found with a gunshot wound in the chest.
