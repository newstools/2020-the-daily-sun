WELL-KNOWN sangoma Sibusiso “Mkhulu” Mathe’s much-anticipated birthday bash has been cancelled because of the coronavirus. The sangoma from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, turned 49 on 20 November and had planned to celebrate his birthday at Khayelitsha Stadium in Mandela Park on Saturday, 28 November. The generous sangoma was going to hand over R500 each to 500 people and a car to one lucky person. The sangoma has been giving cash to those in need for the past few months. “The issue was that we couldn’t get a permit as the government said we were going to have too many people. I have postponed it to next year and will make it a year-opening event,” he said. Mathe said next week, he would give R20 000 to one person as part of a competition he was running. “I will have people come to my house, making sure the number stays low, and I will give R20 000 to one person,” he said. Residents told the SunTeam they had been looking forward to the bash. Mathe had been planning to fill the venue and have musicians perform. Nosisi Mbane (44) from Makhaza said: “We were excited because he is one of the few people doing things for us in this kasi.” Mathe said he tried everything to convince the police and municipality to allow him to go ahead but they refused. “I understand because there were going to be lots of people. They said it would lead to the spread of the virus as numbers are going up again,” he said. Western Cape community safety MEC Albert Fritz, who tested positive for the virus on Friday, advised residents to be careful. “I wish to remind residents that as a province, we are experiencing a resurgence in cases and more than ever, we must wash our hands, wear our masks correctly and maintain a safe social distance,” he said.
