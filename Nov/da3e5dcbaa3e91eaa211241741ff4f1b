In an Instagram post, she said her dad was shot and killed in front of her and she recently filmed a scene that triggered her. Nelisiwe, who plays as Dr Mbali, is in a love triangle which recently took a sour turn. Her fiance, Sbusiso (Ntando Mncube) shot her side piece, Dr Lindelani (Mike Ndlangamandla) on Thursday. “Today’s shooting scene reminded me of how I got so traumatised.
