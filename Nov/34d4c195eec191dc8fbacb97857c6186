THE judgment regarding Pastor Timonty Omotoso’s leave to appeal has been postponed. Omotoso’s legal team submitted documents to the court when the court was about to deliver the appeal verdict at 3.30pm. The pastor filed to overturn Judge Phillip Zilwa’s decision last Wednesday, denying him bail. During his judgment, Zilwa ruled that defence failed to present any new evidence and Omotoso was a flight risk. Omotoso has been in detention since 2017, after his arrest at the Port Elizabeth International Airport. The pastor, along with his co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho who are out on bail, faced charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. Yesterday, Advocate Zukile Mdolomba told the court that the case has no reasonable prospect of success. “The bail was refused because the applicant had not given exceptional circumstances for him to be granted bail. “The applicant is a Nigeria national and his wife and kids are UK citizens. Omotoso’s Jesus Dominion International Church has international branches, therefore, he would be at liberty to go to any of those countries,” said Mdolomba. Omotoso’s lawyer Peter Daubermann said: “The applicant is entitled to appeal and if this court refuses this we will petition the Supreme Court of Appeal. The court must apply its mind and grant the applicant leave to appeal.” Judge Zilwa said he won’t be able to deliver his judgment, as the typing thereof took longer than expected. “The defence also submitted some documents that they believe will have influence in this court so the court will study the documents to see of they have any bearing on this court,” he said.
