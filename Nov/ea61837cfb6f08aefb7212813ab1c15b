THE South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has come out to address rumours that there were stations that would stop carrying news bulletins due to the looming retrenchments. The rumours said SABC management is closing down its radio services. Acting spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said they would like to put it on record that these reports are not true. “The SABC is fully cognisant that millions of South African citizens rely on SABC radio as the most accessed communication medium. Therefore, it is disingenuous to report such misinformation. It must be noted that on the contrary, the radio stations’ proposed structures are promoting and supporting the current needs of audiences such as digital transformation.
