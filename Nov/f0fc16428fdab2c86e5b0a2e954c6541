A FORMER member of a cult has taken the stand at the CRL Rights Commission. On Monday, 16 November, Apostle Makhado Ramabulana said most of the church leaders were collecting evil powers from Nigeria. He said in Nigeria, members of a cult practised openly and citizens were not ashamed of declaring that they were using evil spirits. Ramabulana said during his initiation he was touched by a creature that swam quicker than a human, and it was later explained to him that the creature was half human and half crocodile. The commission has afforded prophets and apostles, who were members of the cult, the opportunity to give insight on how congregants were often financially abused by their church leaders. “Leaders who are part of the secret society are controlled by the society. It’s either you do it traditionally or you disguise as a prophet behind the church,” said Ramabulana. He said if they wanted to come out, they were threatened with death. Last week, the commission heard explosive testimonies from former church members of Rivers of Living Waters Church, led by Bishop Stephen Zondo. Zondo is accused of financially and sexually abusing his congregation and the use of supernatural powers. “South Africans become victims because they don’t know witchcraft can happen in a church,” said Ramabulana. The commission hearing continues.
