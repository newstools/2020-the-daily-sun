FOUR gunmen caused a stampede when they robbed the Post Office in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Wednesday. It was the fourth time the same place had been robbed. Terrified unemployed people, who were there to get their Covid-19 relief grants, said one of the robbers arrived earlier and joined them in the long queue. But an hour later, three men arrived in a white bakkie. “They drew guns and ran inside the Post Office, forcing us to lie down and threatening to blow our brains out,” said a grant beneficiary. “They held four workers hostage as they demanded cash. Then they ran out carrying the cash in a plastic bag before jumping into the bakkie and racing off.” Another beneficiary said the gang had been checking out the Post Office in a gold Ford Ranger bakkie since Monday. “This is fourth time this gang has robbed the Post Office since lockdown,” she said. “During the third robbery, we saw a Post Office worker stuffing paper money inside her dress.” She said it hurts to see this. “They are eating alone while we suffer. We borrowed money for taxi fare to come here,” she said. Police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said police have launched a manhunt for the robbers. “After stealing the cash they fled the scene in a white Opel Corsa bakkie. No one was injured,” he said.
