Mzansi socialite Kenny Kunene remembers millionaire Zimbabwean socialite Ginimbi Genius Kadungure as a man who enjoyed life. Speaking to Daily Sun, the businessman turned politician, revealed how he was numb after hearing of Ginimbi’s death. “It was a shock. I was numb,” he said. Kenny said he called Ginimbi’s brother Keith Kadungure to confirm the news after receiving a series of messages on social media. Ginimbi died instantly in an accident in the early hours of Sunday morning, 8 November in his R5 million Rolls-Royce Wraith, which crashed into a tree before going up in flames.  Three other people died in the crash. Videos of the car crash went viral on social media. Sharing his sentiments about Ginimbi’s death being publicly documented, Kenny said: “Unfortunately, when you put yourself in the public domain people appreciate you and you gain a following. He was living his life and sharing his achievements publicly to inspire young people. Obviously, when your life is like that your death will be shared on social media just as much as your life was shared. I don’t think there is anything untoward.” “People celebrated him. He was very young,” he said. “Rolls Royce is supposed to be one the safest cars but it doesn’t matter where you are, what you are driving or what security you have if it’s you time, it is your time. God takes you and he decides how you go. “Let us all find comfort in the fact that Ginimbi lived his life. He loved life and enjoyed his material gains.” Kadungure’s burial will be held at his mansion in Domboshava, Zimbabwe. According to a flyer on social media, the millionaire’s dying wish was for all mourners to wear all white. Family spokeswoman Shally Nullens, was unable to comment on further funeral arrangements as she was too distraught to comment at the time of publication. However, the family announced through Zimbabwean media that a two-night vigil would take place, which kicked off on Thursday.
