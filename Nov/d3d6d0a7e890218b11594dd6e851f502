ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer is not getting carried away with his side’s promising early season form. After four wins in the last four games, any coach may feel things are slowly heading in the right direction, but the German mentor said it was premature to talk about winning the DStv Premiership title as it is still early days and plenty of matches to be played, which could produce a lot of twists and turns. Speaking after Bucs defeated SuperSport United 2-1 at Orlando Stadium on Saturday, where the Soweto giants registered their fourth win in a row in all competitions this season, Zinnbauer was cautious. He said: “Yes, we might be getting the results and when you ask other coaches they are saying the same thing. It is important to win games but we have to work on it and this is what we do all the time. Yes, it is four wins in a row. I’m happy about this but we have lot of games ahead. “We take one game at the time, one week to one week. “We now have Baroka FC (on Wednesday at Orlando Stadium) and it will not be easy against Baroka because they are playing well.” Zinnbauer, who has lost only twice in 25 games in charge since he arrived in December, was happy that key players Gabadinho Mhango and Bongani Sam, will be back in action soon although he didn’t say if they’ll form part of the game against Bakgaga. Striker Tshegofatso Mabasa, who returned against United, tucked home the winner in the 87th minute. The 50-year-old coach said this augurs well for the future. “Competition, it is what we want in the squad, to fight for places in the starting line-up,” said Zinnbauer. Another plus for Zinnbauer is the continued good form of Zakhele Lepasa. The 23-year-old scored the equaliser against the Tshwane giants in the 51st minute from the penalty spot.
