THE South African Under-17 men’s national team, Amajimbos, have taken a massive step towards booking their spot in the final of the Cosafa Youth Championship. This after they beat Angola 2-1 in their second round robin match played at Gelavandale Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday thanks to goals by Mdiduzi Shabalala and Keaviano Francis. The tournament has undergone a restart process and is now played as a 4-team tournament on a round-robin basis, with the top two teams advancing to the final on Sunday. This is after four teams - Botswana, Zimbabwe, Comoros Islands and Eswatini - were disqualified from the tournament for fielding overaged players. Amajimbos are now one result away from securing their spot in the final with one of the teams in their group after their positive result against the Angolans. Vela Khumalo, coach of Amajimbos, was pleased with how his side executed the plan they came into the encounter with perfectly against a dangerous opponent. “We played a good team,’ said Khumalo. “This is the team we lost against in the qualifier a while back. We really wanted this badly. We were tactically on it, we planned well for them and the boys stuck to the plan.” Khumalo, however, insists that the job is not yet done for his side and will be hoping that they get it done in their final round robin match against Zambia. Zambia will pose the biggest threat so far for Amajimbos, but Khumalo is confident that his charges can defeat any team if they stick to their tactical discipline. The titanic battle will take place on Thursday (3.30pm) at the same venue. “We can’t rely on other people’s results,” added Khumalo. “It is important that we win our own matches. We play Zambia next so we have to be ready for them. “They are the strongest team but we are also quite strong. So it will be the iron against the iron. It goes back to our tactical planning. We will give it our best shot.”
