Greedy companies that withhold workers UIF Covid-19 relief benefits must be exposed, shamed and punished. It’s time law enforcement agencies such as the Hawks, SIU and NPA deal with these companies. They need to charge those who benefitted from these illegal payments. The workers are most affected by the pandemic. This is inhumane, and employers who withhold funds meant for workers must immediately release those payments. Those who’ve denied workers their money must be jailed. Punish executives whose companies have failed to disburse money from the UIF’s coronavirus relief fund. If you break the law, the law must take its course and deal with you.
