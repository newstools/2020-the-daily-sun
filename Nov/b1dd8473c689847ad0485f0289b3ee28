THANKS to SunPower, Lucky Kganedi now boasts a brand new fridge! This after his girlfriend’s lover broke into his house, damaged his belongings and emptied his fridge before breaking it. Daily Sun published Lucky’s story last month. A Good Samaritan has since come to his rescue and offered to buy the 46-year-old from Diepkloof, Soweto, a new fridge. Speaking to Daily Sun, Dorcas Shoba said she wasn’t pleased when she heard what had happened to Lucky. “I know Lucky because we come from the same kasi. He’s very helpful and handy and seeing him suffer like this touched me. It’s now hot and we all know the importance of a fridge,” she said. Lucky said he was happy he had someone to look out for him. “It was going to take a while before I could afford to buy myself a fridge because I do odd jobs. I am happy and relieved that Dorcas has made my life easy again,” said Lucky. He said he won’t be forced to eat tinned food as he could now buy chicken pieces and keep them in his freezer. Lucky said he was a happy man as he not only got a new fridge, but his woman was still in his life. “I’m not going to leave her because I really love her. She makes me happy and can handle both relationships. I’m not going to be the loser here,” he said. Lucky said he won’t back down as he deserves to be happy and his woman brings him unexplainable joy.
