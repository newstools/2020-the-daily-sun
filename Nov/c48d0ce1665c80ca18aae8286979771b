But there was a time when he had to ask a friend to lend him his smartphone to shoot his content. “I had no money and equipment, but was driven by love and passion,” said Thato Mashabela (22) from Extension 1 in Mahube, Mamelodi East, Tshwane. “I used a friend’s smartphone and laptop to create content. In 2017, I won an award for the Best Videography at Mamelodi Local Brands Awards. “I made short comedy clips to be watched on social media.” When he sees his videos, Thato can’t believe he made them.

Thato works from his backroom. He has a dream to open an office and a studio. This year he worked on a 14-episode YouTube web series called Side Chick Saga. He’s now working on a project titled Don’t Change Her, a short film about gender-based violence. It’ll be on YouTube this month on the Black Taydo channel. He said the film portrays love, gender inequality, injustice, crime, betrayal and death. “It also portrays the injustice faced by women in South Africa and the abuse they face at the hands of men,” he said.
