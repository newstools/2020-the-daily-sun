THIS MMC is not related to Bruce Lee the actor! When City of Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams announced his mayoral committee, attention was focused on MMC for Economic Development and Spatial planning Bruce Lee. But the mayor has made it clear that the MMC is not the famous karateka known for the movie, Enter the Dragon, or related to him. But on social media many xenophobic sentiments were directed at Lee. @Lerato_Pillay wrote: This is an insult to South Africans.

Why is the City of Tshwane doing what Mashaba did while he was mayor in Joburg? Williams said he was disturbed that openly xenophobic and racist comments have been levelled at Lee. He said Lee is a South African of Taiwanese descent. “He’s been actively involved in building and growing business in South Africa and employing people of all races. “This has also allowed him to drive charitable causes.” MMC Lee said: “This is an open society. Kamala Harris is of Indian descent and is vice president-elect of the US. She’s celebrated around the world. People need to learn and open their minds.” He said the DA will work hard in Tshwane to promote social unity. “My concern right now is service delivery. Let me be judged on that,” he said.
