GOSPEL singer Freddy Nukeri is celebrating his success after he added his first award in the category of Best Xitsonga Gospel Artist of the Year during the second Xitsonga Gospel Music Awards. The awards show was recently held at Xilumani Hotel in Giyani, Limpopo. Freddy (31) from White City outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun he is over the moon because it’s the first time he has won an award in his music career. “This award means a lot to me. I cried tears of happiness and I was honoured at the same time. “I remember when I started to be a gospel singer. It wasn’t easy but with God’s grace, everything was made possible. Even during the time I escaped death in a horrific crash that claimed the lives of three people. I was the only person to survive in 2010.” “But after completing my recovery, I released my first album called Wena Wedwa, which had 10 beautiful songs, in 2018.This year in July I released my single called Ava Dzunisa, forwhich I was nominated,” he said. “So I want to dedicate this award to the people who supported me from an early age at church, my family and my supporters. There’s still three different awards which I have been nominated for and I am hoping to win as well. “Fans can expect my upcoming album to be released soon,” said Freddy.
