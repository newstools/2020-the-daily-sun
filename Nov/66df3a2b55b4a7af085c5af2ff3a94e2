The shack caught fire while the 29-year-old mum from Alexandra, north of Joburg, was away on Sunday. According to Andiswa’s mum, Ntombenkosi (53), they couldn’t go in as there were explosions coming from the blaze. Ntombenkosi said Thembokuhle usually stayed with her, but he was spending the night with his mum. The fire, apparently started by an illegal connection, also claimed the life of Mbonegeni Khumalo (29). It also left scores of people homeless when 80 shacks burnt to the ground. Anthony Masia and Eric Kunene of AP Panel Beating and Spray Painting Workshop said 20 cars belonging to clients burnt and 10 people were now jobless. Eric said by the time they got to the workshop, the fire was too strong to save anything. “Firefighters took over two hours to arrive. We only managed to save one car, which was taken away by residents,” said Eric. Lindelwa Mqambeli said her family couldn’t save a single item. Lindelwa said when she saw the fire, she just grabbed her two-year-old son and ran. “We need a place to stay and clothes for the baby,” she said. Lindelwa said they didn’t want to live in the area anymore as there had been three fires. She said her shack was spared in the first two incidents. Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the cause of the fire was under investigation.
