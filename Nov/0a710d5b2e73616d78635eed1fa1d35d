AMAZULU have settled their financial account with renowned player agent, Ratshibvumo “Rush” Mulovhedzi, following an “agent’s fee” dispute over the transfer of their then coach Josef Vukusic, who has since been fired by the club. The Rush Hour Sports Management boss has appreciated the cool head, professionalism and support from then general manager, Lunga Sokhela, who spearheaded the whole matter to be speedily resolved. Mulovhedzi said new club owner Sandile Zungu could have also played a big part for this drawn out debt to be finally cleared since August last year, as well as chief executive Peter O’Connor following tens of thousands rands that were paid to him. Rush Hour Sports Management, which specialises in the successful transfer of players and coaches alike in South African football, had his promised financial agreement with AmaZulu last year of R53 125 not paid. At the time, he said the amount was supposed to be a second instalment after Sokhela paid the same amount in August last year when Vukusic signed a three-year-deal with the club. But Mulovhedzi is all smiles today. “I’d like to thank new AmaZulu owner, more especially Peter O’Connor for addressing my matter so that I should be paid what was due to me. It really worked and now we're friends with the club,” said Mulovhedzi following a series of stories published through SunSport. “I would also like to thank Lunga for his professionalism and coming back to his senses to help me get paid. “My worry now is that all the money that they paid me has been swallowed by legal fees when I was fighting for this justice. But it’s fine, as long as we closed this chapter with all people happy. For me now is to pick up the pieces and move forward.” SunSport further understands that Mulovhedzi will be the club’s witness in their fight against Vukusic, who is demanding compensation from AmaZulu through Fifa after his sacking. “Yes, I will be the AmaZulu witness on this matter,” he confirmed.
