Innocent Maela has emerged as an injury doubt for Bafana Bafana after he missed training on Sunday and is “likely” to sit out the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sao Tome e Principe on Monday, the South African Football Association confirmed. The Orlando Pirates left-back started in Friday’s 2-0 victory over the same opponents in Durban, but picked up a slight knock in the game. He is set to be replaced by Mamelodi Sundowns’ Lyle Lakay, who won the last of his two caps against Angola in an African Nations Championship qualifier in 2015. Lakay is an attacking full-back who spent much of his career as a winger, and would give Bafana options from set-pieces. South Africa claimed the three points against Sao Tome on Friday despite a below-par performance, and will expect an improved showing in Port Elizabeth. Three points would likely leave them needing just a draw from their remaining two games of the qualifiers at home to Ghana and away to Sudan in March. The Nations Cup finals are scheduled for Cameroon in early March. SuperSport
