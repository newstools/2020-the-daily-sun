WE complain every day about high crime levels, with women and kids bearing the brunt. What’s more tragic is that many murders and rapes are committed by people who’re supposed to protect vulnerable women and kids. Three-year-old twins were raped by a man who’d wormed his way into their mum’s home and heart. That’s depravity of the highest level by any standard! The 29-year-old woman from Emaphupheni in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, has been left to pick up the pieces. To make matters worse, she’s pregnant with the perpetrator’s child. The rapist was unmasked in August and is on the run. Cops are still looking for him. Chances are, because this heinous crime happened to ordinary folk who don’t have clout and can’t pull any strings, cops aren’t prioritising the capture of this two-legged monster. For the poor, justice is but a dog’s smile – something they never get to experience in their lifetime. We’re calling on the local station commander to hold his cops to account, so that the suspect is arrested and thrown in jail. Minister Bheki Cele, these twins can’t fight for themselves. They’re all looking to us to get justice for them. #JusticeForTwins – Editor
