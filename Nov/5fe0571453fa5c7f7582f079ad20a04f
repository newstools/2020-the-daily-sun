PRESENTER Bongani “Bobo Da Beat” Mthomboti has been taken off Ikwekwezi FM’s schedule. Apparently, on his show Sizigedlile last Thursday, he said women get raped because of what they wear. A source told Daily Sun after calls from listeners that Bongani should fall because of his insensitive comments, he was taken off air. “Bongani has been unscheduled from the programmes after a complaint was lodged by a listener at the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of SA. “He was ordered to make a public apology, so he opened the show on Friday with an apology.” ALSO READ |  MSHOZA'S FUNERAL DETAILS Bongani apologised on Facebook on Friday. “After a long day on which many people were not happy, maybe because they didn’t understand the topic I was delivering on air yesterday, the backlash and the pointing of fingers wasn’t what I intended. “It’s not what I intended. I humbly apologise.” SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “Management is engaging Mthomboti following a discussion on air, which resulted in complaints from the listeners and a BCCSA complaint. “It must, however, be noted the SABC doesn’t condone nor tolerate any behaviour and actions which promote gender-based violence.” BCCSA registrar Shouneez Martin confirmed a complaint was logged by a listener. When the SunTeam contacted Bongani, he said: “At this time, I don’t have the authority to say anything regarding the matter.”
