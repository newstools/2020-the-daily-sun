BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have booked their spot in the MTN8 final and they will play either Kaizer Chiefs or Orlando Pirates in the final. Celtic defeated SuperSport United 2-1 on aggregate following a 1-0 win on Sunday at DrÂ Petrus Molemela Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The two sides had played to a 1-1 draw in the first leg which was played in Pretoria last weekend. Victor Letsoalo scored the only goal of the encounter on the 50th minute which sent Siwelele Sa Masele to the final of the Wafa Wafa Cup final. Celtic made nine changes from the line-up that lost 1-0 to Orlando Pirates in a league match during the week. They also had their number one goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane back after recovering from injury he sustained last weekend. The defeat is a huge blow for SuperSport as they missed out on an opportunity of appearing in their fourth successive MTN8 final. On the other hand, this will be Celtic second final in in two months. In September they reached Nedbank Cup final and lost 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns. John Maduka and his charges will be now looking to perfect their start to 2020-21 season with a trophy. This will be Celtic first appearance in the final since MTN took over as the sponsors in 2008. Celtic last won this top eight title in 2005 when it was still knowns as SAA SUPA eight. Maduka who is now the coach was the captain of the side.
