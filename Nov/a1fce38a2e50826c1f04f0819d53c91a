Up-and-coming DJ Hlo has landed a show on Soweto TV. She will host Kasi Vibes while in Joburg for the Rush Hour TV show. “It all started on a Friday. I’d been invited to do a one-hour set. After playing my set, I was invited by the Soweto TV management. They told me they liked my work and offered me the job on the spot. “For me this was a dream come true and I instantly accepted their offer. The following Monday I’d already started,” she said. “Kasi Vibes is a music show with different segments. The show focuses on the kasi lifestyle, how Soweto people live and everything that affects them. My job is also to do the links for this show. I’m quite excited right now. “It’s a new world for me and I am humbled at the same time. “The show is aired between Mondays and Fridays in the afternoons. My contract runs up until the end of the year and it is renewable,” she said. DJ Hlo said the show came at the right time. “It feels as if everything good is happening for me. I say this because my song Festive is doing quite well in digital stores. I am just praying it gets nominated for Ukhozi FM’s top 20. “On this song I featured Bizizi and Kaygee. Now this TV opportunity will definitely enhance my profile as an artist,” she said. It is not the first time DJ HLo is in front of the camera. “I’ve never presented a show, but I’ve done a lot of TV ads. I think those small roles in front of the camera really helped me to get this gig,” she said.
