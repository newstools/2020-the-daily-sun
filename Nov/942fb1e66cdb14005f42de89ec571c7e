PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had jurisdiction to investigate President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign money for the ANC presidency. This was part of the argument of Mkhwebane’s legal representative, Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, in the Constitutional Court. They wanted the North Gauteng High Court ruling that her findings into Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign was unlawful and irrational to be set aside. Sikhakhane argued the public protector was empowered by the Constitution to investigate any state affair, report and misconduct and take remedial action. He said that matters involving Ramaphosa fell under matters of the state, as he was deputy president at the time.  Sikhakhane argued the Public Protector Act was clear on the powers of Mkhwebane to investigate without fear or favour. “This is a serious matter dealing with possible breach of the Constitution by a sitting president, and an even more serious one that he possibly misled parliament.” On why the matter should not go to the Supreme Court of Appeal first, Sikhakhane said the matter hung on the heads of Mkhwebane and Ramaphosa, both important constitutional functionaries. Sikhakhane said politicians ran the risk of being conflicted in their personal capacity and often were bribed in this capacity. On Mkhwebane’s criticism of the high court for not alerting Ramaphosa of her findings before making them public, Sikhakhane said the public protector went to great lengths to accommodate the president. He told the justices Mkhwebane was within her right to refer the matter of suspicious money laundering for criminal investigations by law enforcement agencies, as she had no powers to investigate it herself. He said the court may find she may have gone too far by asking timelines in investigations. “But it was certainly not an instruction and these agencies were within their right to decide there was no case to answer by Ramaphosa,” he said.
