A BIG storm on Thursday has left residents of Stinkwater and New Eesterus, Tshwane, homeless. Some are still picking up the pieces and fixing their damaged homes. They told Daily Sun they lost furniture, food, clothes and important documents. Junior Mogale (31) from Stinkwater said her nine-roomed home was destroyed by the storm. She said they were left with an open roof and broken windows. “It’s sad as we thought the rain would bring us water, not destroy our homes,” said Junior. She said she lost many things, including sofas, a TV, beds, clothes and food. Junior said she was also scared she might lose her unborn child. She added she didn’t know where she’d get the money to rebuild her home. “We’ve had hardships for more than 20 years,” she said. Louisa Nkoana (40) said her five-roomed house was destroyed by the heavy rain. She said she almost lost furniture, clothes, important documents and her kids’ stationery. “I have to start from scratch and I need help,” she said. Community leader Margaret Sepogwane said: “We need government to intervene. “Residents from Mokome zone 1 in Stinkwater need to be moved to a safer place. We’re tired of empty promises.” Tshwane community safety and emergency services MMC Karen Meyer said:  she was saddened by the devastation, which caused significant damage to almost 31 houses.“We’ve assessed the damage, alongside Community and Social Development Services Department, which identified a community centre to temporarily accommodate the affected households.” “I have requested emergency services to monitor the situation and provide me with regular feedback,” she said.
