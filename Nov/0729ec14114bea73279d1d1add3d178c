BANYANA Banyana will be eager to continue their dominance in the COSAFA Cup. They will begin the defence of their title with a clash against Angola in their Group A opener at the Wolfson Stadium in Nelson Mandela Bay on Tuesday (3.30 pm). Banyana have dominated this tournament, winning six of the previous seven editions. Desiree Ellis’ charges are hoping to win their fourth title in a row having clinched the previous three on the spin. Even with a relatively young side featuring several players from the Under-20 national team, Banyana will still be considered favourite to win the competition. “The COSAFA Cup is for local players and it is always great to give new players a chance to prove themselves,” said Ellis. “I have been impressed with the work that the current crop of players has put in. “We have a young group of players and the opportunity now to expose them to international competition and we want to make sure we plan properly. Then it is up to the players to execute.” Banyana will also play Comoros and Eswatini in their pool, with only the top team in each group advancing to the semi-finals where they will be joined by the best-placed runner-up.
