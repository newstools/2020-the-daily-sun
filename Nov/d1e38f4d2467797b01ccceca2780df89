BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have risen above all their troubles and are now just one step away from a big reward. Phunya Sele Sele are in the final of the MTN8, their second cup final in a little over a month. They were beaten by Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in the final of the Nedbank Cup but now have another opportunity to win silverware. This after they beat defending champions SuperSport United 2-1 on aggregate to reach their MTN8 final. Celtic, whose financial problems have been well documented in the past, have managed to be highly competitive regardless. John Maduka, who took over the reins from Lehlohonolo Seema after he left for Chippa United, has exceeded expectations. “As much as we have gone through tough times, we have come out on top,” said Maduka. “In order to be a champion you have to go through the wars. We know that we have another big game coming, but we will be ready. “The supporters, the team and the management deserve this trophy. It means a lot to us to be in this final, we have been working hard in the field of play. “Whoever we play against, we will be ready. We just need to prepare well and ensure that this time around the cup comes to Celtic.” Maduka believes losing the final to Sundowns has made his charges even hungrier than before. They are determined to make up for that heartbreak and grab their second chance to win a trophy with both hands. “It’s very important for us to go out there and try to win the cup for our supporters and the team,” added Maduka. “It has been such a long time and this is our second cup final. We just hope and pray that things go according to our plan this time around. “We have another opportunity to get it right and win silverware. We need to go out there and focus on the game and try to do our best to win. “It will be very good for the team, especially for a team without a sponsor. It’s not easy but in the field of play the boys have been working hard and this is the reward that we get.”
