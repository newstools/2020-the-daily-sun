A VIDEO showing Olly Mlamleli saying she has pleaded not guilty in court has gone viral. Now the former mayor of Mangaung Municipality has to prove her innocence on charges of fraud and corruption. Mlamleli and the other six suspects appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 11 November. The R255 million asbestos corruption matter involving seven accused was postponed to 19 February next year for further investigation and the possible addition of about three more accused people on the charge sheet. In a short video where Mlamleli is standing at the courtâ€™s main entrance, she told her supporters that she is not going to be accused by people in the streets. But there was another ANC anti-Olly group that made their sound heard outside court, calling for the arrest of former Free State premier and current ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule. Magashule is expected to hand himself to the cops in Bloemfontein on Friday, 13 November.
