PROPHET Paseka Mboro Motsoeneng has distanced himself from the rumours that he was the last person to speak to Prophet Shepherd Bushiri before he skipped the country. Mboro cleared the air and said he last spoke to Bushiri on his day in court. The prophet and leader of Incredible Happenings Ministries was speaking to eNCA when he said all he received from Bushiri was a missed call. “I then sent him a WhatsApp message telling him that I was busy during the day when he called. He never responded.” Mboro said he was shocked when he saw in the media that Bushiri had fled the county. . “I did not speak to him before and after he escaped,” he said. All this came after Mzansi woke up on Saturday, 14 November to the news that Bushiri and his wife Mary had skipped the country despite their bail conditions prohibiting them from travelling outside Gauteng and the North West. The prophet of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church then took to his social media account to address his followers. He confirmed that he had left South Africa but said it was because he feared for his life, not because he was expected in the dock in the R102 million fraud and money laundering case.
