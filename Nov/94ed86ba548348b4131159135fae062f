The mum told the SunTeam on Friday, 20 November, that her daughter’s friend was sleeping over and she left the kids to go to an all-night prayer meeting. “When my boyfriend heard the kids would be alone, he offered to sleep in my shack to keep them safe. “It’s clear he was planning to do this,” she said. The mum said when she arrived home the next morning, the kids were still asleep. She didn’t wake them up and went to have her hair done. “When I came back, my neighbour came and told me my boyfriend tried to rape her child. “I went to call him and he denied it.” The mum said after the neighbour left, her daughter told her the boyfriend had raped her. “The following day, we took the child to the doctor and it was confirmed she had been raped. “The worst part is that he gave her an infection,” she said.

Resident Iminathi Hlanga said they didn’t want the man in the area. “In fact, he doesn’t deserve to live among human beings. What he did was evil,” said Iminathi. Western Cape NPA spokesman, Eric Ntabazalila, confirmed that the suspect appeared in court. The bail application has been postponed to 4 December.
