A
municipality thief was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. The
municipal auctioneer Masilo Tumisang Molefe (38) was found guilty on two counts
of theft by the Mmabatho Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. According
to South African Police Services (SAPS) Tlangelani Rikhotso it's alleged that
the accused was appointed by Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality and Sedibeng
Water, to auction off assets on behalf of the government offices. Rikhotso
explained that Instead of paying the proceeds of the auctions to Lekwa-Teemane
Local Municipality and Sedibeng Water, the accused allegedly kept a combined
total of over R1.5 million rand for himself.  The matter
was reported to the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation for a further
investigation, which led to his arrest. "He
was sentenced to five years direct imprisonment for the first count of theft,
and three years wholly suspended for five years for the second count of theft.
The accused will therefore serve an effective five years jail term," said
