A resident, Phumlani Mtolo (34), told Daily Sun he was in another taxi when he saw the accident. “We had to wait for about an hour for the scene to be cleared. I ended up late for work. There was nothing we could do as the tree was across the road,” he said. Phumlani said they thought the taxi was full but found out later there was only the driver and one passenger. “I didn’t get to hear where the taxi was headed,” he said.  Another resident, Noxolo Mhlaba (23), said the tree was close to the road and that’s why it fell and covered the entire road.
