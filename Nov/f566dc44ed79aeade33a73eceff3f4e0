The South African Football Association (SAFA) is happy with the decision of the independent Arbitrator that has dismissed the complainant claims regarding the ABC Motsepe National Play-Offs decision. The outcome paves way for the staging of the play-offs this coming week. ‘’We respect this outcome and hope the clubs do likewise in the spirit of moving forward,’’ said SAFA CEO, Advocate Tebogo Motlanthe. "The request by those clubs, that took the Association to Arbitration, has been dismissed because they failed to follow proper procedures. "The ruling shows the Association is transparent when it makes its decisions. "We allow individuals to exercise their rights to challenge any decision that they do not agree with,’’ added Advocate Motlanthe. The Association is now preparing for the ABC Motsepe National play-offs that will run from 9-14 November at the Vaal University of Technology. ‘’In terms of our procedures and regulations, the Arbitration is the final resort, so we consider this matter closed and we are looking forward to an exciting national play offs tournament this coming week,’’ concluded Advocate Motlanthe.-SAFA
