PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri and his co-accused will hear tomorrow if they will spend more time behind bars. Bushiri, his wife Mary, Landiwe Ntlokwana and Lethu Mudolo have been in jail for over two weeks since the Hawks bust them. They’re facing charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to R102 million. But there’s speculation on social media since a video of the court adjournment trended after Magistrate Thandi Theledi’s bail judgment. In the 26-second video two women court employees, who seem to be clerks, are seen taking documents from the magistrate’s podium immediately after she adjourned proceedings. While some see nothing wrong with what’s happened in the video, others speculated it was an attempt to steal the court documents. On Twitter, Sipho Nkosi said: “If this fake prophet gets bail, I’m going to cry foul play. Can someone explain this nonsense.” After a video trended on Friday of Bushiri trying to signal someone during the court proceedings many speculated if the act was linked to that. Some people said the two women were court clerks doing their job. Vusi Nqo: “Nothing wrong here. Clerk of the court doing her job.” Justice and constitutional development spokesman Steve Mahlangu said they’d noted videos claiming documents had been illegally removed during proceedings in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday. “We conducted a full investigation and confirm the bench notes of the magistrate are in possession of the relevant court officials,” said Mahlangu. “It’s standard practice for the clerk of the court to retrieve the charge sheet for further processing and storage.” The interaction between a clerk and a journalist was the journalist requesting to see the charge sheet. “This is allowed and doesn’t imply any documents were removed from the courtroom,” he said.
