A JEALOUS woman (29) who was arrested for allegedly killing her lover briefly appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Tuesday. She was standing quietly in the dock as state prosecutor Edith Nemukula told the court that she was facing a serious offence, which falls under schedule six for murdering a man by stabbing him to death. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba said the accused has a right to get a legal representative from her own pocket, or from a legal aid board. “I opt for a lawyer from legal aid board as I am not employed. And I don’t have enough money,” she replied in shame. Shocked neighbours told the SunTeam the woman was caught red handed by her boyfriend cheating with another man. Then an argument ensued when the boyfriend asked her what was going on. Instead, she allegedly ran into her house and came back with a knife and stabbed her man in the chest and he fell to the ground. The incident happened in Teka Mahala Village in Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Sunday at about 9pm. Police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdhluli said: “Police and the medical personnel were notified of a man who was stabbed at Teka Mahala Village. When the cops got there, a man (30) was found lying in a pool of blood. He was certified dead by the paramedics at the scene. The victim had a stab wound to the chest and police opened a case of murder. And a woman (29) was then arrested.” “The police management has since condemned the horrific incident and urged residents to resolve matters in a civil manner instead of being violent,” said Colonel Mdhluli. The matter has been postponed until Thursday for her to get legal representation and possible bail application.
