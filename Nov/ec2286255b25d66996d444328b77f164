IF WE try the new formula to fix the mind, it will help fix the social ills facing the country. These were the words of newly-crowned Miss South Africa, Shudufhadzo Musida, at the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday during the official announcement of her ambassadorship of Brand SA. Shudufhadzo said she was grateful the Presidency has pledged to help her in her cause on mental health. She said the involvement of the head of state was a good sign as mental health would no longer be taboo. “When I started the conversation on mental health, I didn’t know how it would be received by society. But it warmed my heart that it received positive feedback. “I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay, and it’s also okay to seek help,” she said. Shudufhadzo was officially announced as Brand SA ambassador by the Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Thembi Siweya, and Brand SA’s leadership. Siweya said: “We’ve pledged to work with her to ensure we speak to Mzansi about mental health. “She sparked an interest in the Presidency to work with her. “We want Mzansi to be well and speak freely about mental issues.” Shudufhadzo said hearing the Presidency has pledged its support to her cause, not only in words, but through action is heart-warming. She said that this was collective action that needed everyone to be involved. “With this collaboration, we’ll see change as people will be encouraged to better themselves and be the best version of themselves,” said Shudufhadzo.
