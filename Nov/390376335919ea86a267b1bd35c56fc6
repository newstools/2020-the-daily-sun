SABC chief operating officer Ian Plaatjies has rejected claims that he will stop working at the public broadcaster and move to eMedia, which owns e.tv. Plaatjies has been in the job for one year. He said he was totally committed to completing his contract, which still has four years to run. The claims come amidst reported divisions at the public broadcaster. “The report of me moving over to eNCA is false. I’ve neither engaged eMedia nor anyone else about any prospects of me leaving the SABC,” said Plaatjies in a statement released on Sunday. “This misleading reporting will be reported to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa and the publication that printed the story to retract this untruth and apologise for the false reporting.” According to the statement, Plaatjies said he was still committed to the broadcaster. “The transformation work the SABC Board and management are doing has far reaching consequences beyond the sustainability of the SABC which is to grow the local industry. “This requires continuity of the leadership that spearheads the turnaround. I’m committed to seeing this to fruition,” he said.
