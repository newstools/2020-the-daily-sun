PEBETSI Matlaila, who plays Mokgadi Maputla on SABC1’s Skeem Saam, became a happy wife this weekend after long-time boyfriend Lloyd Mbatha paid lobola for her. She told Daily Sun: “I’ve always known he was going to marry me, so his proposal didn’t come as a surprise. “When he told me about his plans to speak to my family, the first thing I asked him was whether he had money for lobola.” Pebetsi was dating someone else when she met Lloyd. “He stole my heart from someone else. I considered him a friend for four years,” she said. “Before we started seeing each other, he always joked about how he’d one day make me his wife.” She said for their first date, on her birthday weekend, Lloyd took her to Durban.

I’ve known him for a very long time, so it’s effortless to be around him. “He understands my line of work as he’s also in the industry and wants the best for me. He sees things about me I don’t see myself, like my potential,” she said. Pebetsi said although Lloyd paid lobola, he hasn’t gone down on one knee yet. “If you haven’t noticed, I’m not wearing any ring on my finger. He believes if you’re about to marry a woman, ask the parents first and the ring comes later.” She said she’d have a traditional and white wedding. What stood out for her about the lobola ceremony was that it brought family together. “I saw people I never thought I’d see again happily singing in one place. Some even confessed they missed each other. I now I understand the meaning of love conquering all.”
