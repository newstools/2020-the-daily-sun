GAUTENG cops have begun their safer festive season campaign, which has resulted in more than 150 motorists bust for driving under the influence of alcohol so far. Captain Mavela Masondo warned motorists in the province of more roadblocks, stop and searches as well as raiding of liquor outlets as the safer festive season operations get underway. “By these arrests, Gauteng police are sending a strong warning to those who would undermine the rule of law this festive season and that it will have no mercy with those who drink and drive,” Masondo said. More than 1 200 suspects were arrested for crimes ranging from dealing in drugs, rape, truck hijacking and assault. Masondo said the arrests were made in Ekurhuleni, Tshwane, Joburg, West Rand and Sebokeng. “All arrested suspects will appear before different magistrate courts in Gauteng in due course,” he said.
