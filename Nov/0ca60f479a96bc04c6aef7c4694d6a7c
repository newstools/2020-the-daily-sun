A Fifa delegation is expected in Durban next February to assess the R160 million KZN Sports Development Training Centre and Football Academy launched last week. The event, held at the Hoy Park, was attended by SA Football Association (Safa) CEO Tebogo Motlanthe and the association’s head of delegation Kwenza Ngwenya. The centre, whose focus will be on all sporting codes, will be completed in the next 18 months and has been endorsed by Fifa. Once completed, the centre will also be used as a training camp for Bafana Bafana when they play games in Durban. This facility forms part of the KZN Football Academy launched in 2014. It has produced three players who travelled with the SA Under-23s who are playing two friendly matches against Saudi Arabia during the current Fifa international break. Motlanthe has welcomed the addition of this academy and hopes other provinces will follow suit.  “This academy will ensure that kids go to school first and also push their passion, which is football,” he said. “This academy will add to our vision 2022 where we need to start producing players (for the national team). We also need to teach them the values of life. “We’d like to thank Carlos Catalino, the Academy CEO for this and (he) can bank on our support.” KZN MEC for Sports and Recreation Hlengiwe Mavimbela described the move as province’s major milestone. “The development centre will ensure boys and girls from the rural areas are well-developed,” said the MEC.The provincial government, through its Sports and Recreation Department, has set aside a budget of R30 million for over three years. Some of that money has already been transferred to this project.”
