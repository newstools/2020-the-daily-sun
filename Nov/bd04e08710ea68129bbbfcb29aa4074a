THE government’s inter-ministerial team will focus on Nelson Mandela Bay this week to fight against the resurgence of Covid-19. The team, led by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize, comes amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city. Mkhize will be back in the metro on Thursday, 26 November and Friday, 27 November to address the increase in Covid-19 cases in the province. Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Minister of Social Development Lindiwe Zulu and senior government officials will join Mkhize. MEC for Health Sindiswa Gomba said taverns would be visited as some of them have proven to be super-spreaders since some patrons don’t wear masks and there’s minimal social distancing. “Taverns found to be violating regulations may be closed or fined.” She also dismissed media reports of a shortage of Covid-19 beds as fake news. The MEC called on people to stick to the golden rule of washing hands or using an alcohol-based sanitiser regularly, keeping at least a two-metre distance and the wearing of masks. The latest report from the provincial Health Department on Tuesday, 24 November reported 1 362 cases and 45 deaths.
