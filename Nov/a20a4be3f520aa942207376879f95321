FORMER Bidvest Wits midfielder Phathutshedzo Nange is optimistic that his career will grow under Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker. Nange, who had been training with Kaizer Chiefs signed with Stellies last Friday. The 28-year-old’s move together with his former Wits teammate, Sifiso Hlanti to Amakhosi failed after the Soweto giants’ appeal against their two transfer window Fifa transfer ban appeal was rejected by Court of Arbitration of Sport. “I had a chat with coach Steve Barker and I was happy with how we talked and how he wanted me in his team,” said Nange. “I am happy with the move to Cape Town to join Stellenbosch as they are a new team which are aiming high. They have a good coach and quality players. I am positive that we will do well this season. I have been training with them (Stellenbosch) for two days and I have seen that we have a strong team.” Asked why he chose the Mother City based side as DStv Premiership rookies Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Moroka Swallows were after his signature, the former Black Leopards star said: “I wanted a new challenge in a new environment. I wanted to come to the coast.” The Venda born player said he has already forgotten about his failed dream move to join his former coach Gavin Hunt and Chiefs. “The truth is I would have loved to work with Hunt again but it was not meant to be and life must continue,” said Nange. “I have forgotten about that move and my heart is here at Stellenbosch and I want to give my best for Barker after the trust he has shown in me.” In their opening three league matches, Barker’s lads have recorded two draws and one defeat.
