THERE was music, booze was flowing and everyone was having a good time. Two women who seemed to be having a really good time were enjoying themselves so much, they even showed off their punanis. In two videos that recently hit social media, two women could be seen showing off their punanis while twerking. The videos are said to have been shot in Jukulyn in Soshanguve, Tshwane. In one video, a woman can be seen pulling down her dress as she twerks. A man then crawls up to her bum and she twerks on his face while he licks her punani. People around them cheer them on.  The man then lies on the ground and unzips his trouser, but people stopped them. The woman then sits on the man’s face again and this time, she pulls her panty aside so he can lick her punani.  In another video, the woman isn’t wearing any underwear and she shows off her cleanly-shaved punani. Many social media users had a lot to say about the videos.
