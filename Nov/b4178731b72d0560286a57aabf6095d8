ZULU-SPEAKING families usually sing popular Christmas carols in English when they celebrate Christmas. But gospel and choral producers Sipho Mbele and Zolani Maseko-Mkhize have a Christmas gift for them. They’ve created a group called Ivangeli Gospel and recorded a six-track EP of Zulu Christmas carols titled Ukhisimuzi, translated from the popular original English Christmas carols. They vowed to entertain families with their debut choral and gospel EP. Producer and arranger Sipho, who’s done production for gospel artist Deborah Fraser and others, told SunBuzz these are the first Christmas carols recorded in Zulu.

The EP will be in digital stores on Friday, 27 November.
