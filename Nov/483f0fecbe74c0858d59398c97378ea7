THE Enlightened Christian Gathering Church has denied that Shepherd Bushiri will host a prayer event on 31 December at a stadium in Malawi. Church spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said a poster advertising the event is fake. He wrote on the church’s news page on Facebook: “Please note that the church has not issued any communication with regard to this year’s Crossover Night. “Information circulating is fake. The church will officially make a statement.”  While the South African government is trying to have Bushiri brought back to the country to face prosecution, life has been going on as normal for him in Malawi. Bushiri apparently continued holding daily sermons online. Bushiri and his wife, Mary, fled the country about two weeks ago. They’re facing charges of fraud, theft and money laundering amounting to R102 million. They were released on R200 000 bail each. With an arrest warrant hanging over his head, Bushiri seemed unbothered on Friday, 20 November while preaching online. A poster making the rounds states he’ll host an event at Bingu Stadium in Lilongwe, Malawi, on New Year’s Eve. On Friday, after being released by the Malawi police, Bushiri told crowds gathered to hear him cases he opened against corrupt cops were not being investigated. “I opened cases against them prior to them opening cases against me,” he said. “The South African government isn’t commenting on the five corruption cases.” Asked about assets confiscated by South African police, he said his life was worth more than any worldly belongings.
