ZODWA Wabantu says she doesn’t mind when fans lick her punani. “It really doesn’t bother me because I decide to let them,” she said. The fans of the reality TV star and dancer were recently seen licking her private parts when she made an appearance at Club Africa in Benoni, Gauteng in a video that has gone viral. Zodwa can be seen dancing with her back turned towards the audience when first one man, then another man, lean forward and lick her punani. Then a third man reaches out his hands and spreads the star’s legs a bit to take a look at her private parts. Zodwa said she decides what she does with her body.  “Those who say I should keep my punani private should keep theirs private,” she said. Zodwa said she didn’t see the actions of her fans as harassment. “I knew exactly what was happening behind me. I could feel them touching me. These are my fans. They love me and I was there for them. That’s why I sometime kiss them, so they get the best experience. I enjoy engaging with them when I’m on stage and when I feel they are becoming too much, I just move away.”  She said she never felt unsafe at events. “There are always security guards if it gets out of hand.” Zodwa has been in a relationship with an older man since March. “My partner is older and mature. He’s not the jealous type. He understands the work I do and he respects it,” she said. “We never mix business with pleasure. Things happen to me while I’m working and it doesn’t affect my relationship.”
