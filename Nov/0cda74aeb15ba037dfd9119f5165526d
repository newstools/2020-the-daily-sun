2020 is turning out to be a good year for actor Thembinkosi Mthembu. In January, he joined one of Mzansi’s most popular shows, The River as Mabutho. He recently scored a nomination in the Royalty Soapie Awards for the Best Villain Award. And now he has been nominated for the Best Actor Award at this year’s KZN Entertainment Awards. Speaking to Daily Sun, the hunky actor said he was overwhelmed by the love he’s been getting not only from fans, but the industry as well. “The support means I’m doing something right and I’m grateful that it took long for me to get where I am because everything happens at the right time,” he said.

Thembinkosi said when he joined The River nine months ago, he didn’t think he would get the amount of attention he’s getting. “I was doing what I’ve always loved. I don’t do what I do for awards, or attention, but for the love,” said the 26-year-old. The actor from Durban advised aspiring actors not to look for fame, but to perfect their craft. The winners will be announced on 15 December at an event in Durban. Each category winner pockets R100 000 cash and the overall KZN’s Most Loved Star will walk away with R500 000.
