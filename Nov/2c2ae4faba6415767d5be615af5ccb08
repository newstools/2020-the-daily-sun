THE South African national Under-17 men's team (Amajimbos) have qualified for the Cosafa Youth Championship finals despite their defeat to Zambia. Amajimbos were beaten 1-0 by the Zambians in the final round robin match played at Gelvandale Stadium on Thursday. Joseph Banda broke Amajimbos' hearts with his late winner for Zambia, who topped the group. Vela Khumalo's Amajimbos, though, had done enough in their previous two matches to reach the final. They were aided by the result from the other match where Angola thumped Malawi 7-1 to ensure the Young Flames could not advance ast the expense of Amajimbos. Khumalo and his side will have an opportunity to exert some revenge when they face Zambia in the final at the same venue on Sunday. Both sides have qualified for the Under-17 Africa Cup of Nations by reaching the Cosafa final.
