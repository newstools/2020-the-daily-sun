IT’S been a month since Mokgadi Maake was raped, assaulted and robbed by two thugs. The 18-year-old from Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo was attacked on the evening of 18 October while walking with a friend near Mameriri Secondary School. She said the men approached them and said they wanted to help them get home safely. “Out of nowhere, they started attacking us. They raped me and only beat my friend after they took our belongings. “I’m heartbroken and don’t know what to do because we’re raped by people who know us. It seems as if they know exactly where to find us,” she said. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a case of rape was opened, but no one was arrested. Mokgadi said she didn’t want what happened to her to happen to others. She’s started a campaign called Rape ga se sephiri, which means rape is not a secret. She wants to urge rape survivors to talk about their experiences. “Most women who’ve been raped are afraid to come out. Some don’t even want to open cases because they’re afraid of what’ll people say. “I want to use the campaign to assist them to come out. We shouldn’t feel scared every time we walk in the streets,” she said. Mokgadi said it was time to put an end to these violent crimes against women and children.
