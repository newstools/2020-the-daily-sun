GAVIN Hunt has received a baptism of fire in his first few games in charge of Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. The 3-0 thrashing at the hands of arch-rivals Orlando Pirates in their MTN8 semi-final first leg on Saturday was just another reminder of how difficult a task Hunt has on his hands. Hunt’s charges had barely recovered from their thumping by the same scoreline at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns in their DStv Premiership opener. But nothing will hurt Amakhosi faithful more than the defeat to their fierce rivals Pirates, who now have one foot in the final at their expense. Hunt, who was well aware of the situation he was getting himself into when he joined Chiefs, has been forced to try and compete with a squad he did not build. The 56-year-old former Bidvest Wits mentor cut a frustrated figure after his side’s Soweto derby defeat, but he refused to throw in the towel. He would like to see his side put up more of a fight in the second-leg, set to be played at the FNB Stadium on Sunday (3pm). “It is what it is,” said Hunt. “We have to dust ourselves off and go again. I don’t think this was a 3-0 game, just like the Sundowns game. The scoreline wasn’t necessarily a true reflection of the match. “The second goal is from a free-kick which bounced over our right back’s head and he didn’t head the ball. The third goal is from our corner where one of our players failed to control the ball, so if you just read the scoreline, then it doesn’t look good.” Hunt will hope his side can build up some momentum before they face Bucs in the second leg. They can do that by beating TS Galaxy in the league at FNB Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm). Although it will be tough to overturn the deficit, Hunt’s charges will attempt to do so against the rampant Bucs. “We’ll try to win the game, that’s the most important thing “There’s nothing we can change much,” added Hunt.
