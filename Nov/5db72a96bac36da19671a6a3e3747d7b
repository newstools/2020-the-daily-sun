ANGRY residents marched to Dikwena Funeral Services yesterday after the parlour allegedly took a decomposing body to a family. The march in Soshanguve, Tshwane, was organised by the Forum for Service Delivery. The forum’s spokesman and family representative, Themba Mariri, said when Oupa Ngobeni’s body was taken to his family home for burial on 25 October, it was already decomposing, full of maggots and had a terrible smell. He said the family was forced to bury the body in that state after taking two cars belonging to the funeral parlour as compensation. But the owner of the parlour tricked the family into returning the cars and made false promises. “When the family went to their offices, they were threatened with lawyers. “We want them to make a public apology for the pain they caused the family,” said Themba. ZODWA DOESN'T MIND WHEN FANS LICK HER PUNANI Residents said they believed the funeral parlour took advantage of the Ngobenis because they were poor. Salome Mathe said the dead needed to be respected and what the parlour did was a sin. “There were certain rituals the family needed to perform to ensure ntate Oupa rested in peace. but they couldn’t,” she said. The funeral parlour’s marketing representative, Lilly Malena, said she would address residents. When asked for comment, she said she didn’t have enough information about the incident. “We apologise to the community for what happened. We know this incident will affect the business, which can lead to job losses,” she said. “We need residents to help us to make things better.” Residents said Malena clearly didn’t know the details of the matter, so it was pointless of her to address them.
