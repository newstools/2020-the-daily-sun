BLACK Leopards have sacked coach Patrick Aussems. Aussems was shown the door on Sunday following three successive defeats in the DStv Premiership. Lidoda Duvha are rooted to the basement of log table without a point. They have conceded the most goals in the league, seven and scored a mere one goal which led to management’s decision to fire the Belgian mentor. He became the second PSL coach to be fired after Dylan Kerr who was relieved off his duties last week. Aussems was appointed in October to replace Allan Clark who left the club in August to join KF Llapi in Kosovo. According to a reliable source, Aussems didn’t attend Leopards training session today as his fate was already decided. Said the Source: “The coach was sacked on Sunday as he was told not to attend training session on Monday. He will leave the country on Wednesday since management have already booked him a flight ticket to return home. The club will make an announcement on Tuesday.” Sunsport has reliably learnt that his assistant Morgan Shivambu who helped the team avoid relegation via the promotion play-offs will be in charge  together with Mongezi Bobe when Leopards host fellow strugglers Maritzburg United at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).
