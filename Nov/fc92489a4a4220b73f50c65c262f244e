BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has called up five players to plug the gap following withdrawals of key players due to injury and others tested positive for Covid-19. Bafana assembled for camp in Durban where they’ll face Sao Tome in a back to back Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday. The two countries will battle it out again in the return leg three later at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, in Port Elizabeth. The former Under-17 coach has called up Bloemfontein Celtic defender  Tshepo Rikhotso who replaced Cape Town City captain Thami Mkhize. Mamelodi Sundown defender Mosa Lebusa has been brought in for Portuguese based defender Thibang Mpete of Belenenses SAD, who made his Bafana debut last month in two friendly matches. Orlando Pirates winger Vincent Pule replaced Downs workaholic Andile Jali, while Cape Town City midfielder Thabo Nodada was called up for Thulani Serero, who plays for Al Jazira in Saudi Arabia. Jali’s withdrawal was due to an injury he suffered against Cape Town City in the DStv Premiership last week. Nodada’s teammate at City, Abbubaker Mobara has been replaced by Downs right-back Thapelo Morena. Ntseki said these are difficult times for everyone with Covid-19 while other players sustained injuries from their clubs. “These players won’t be part of the team due to injury and others for medical reasons,” said Ntseki. Ntseki also confirmed that Kamohelo Mokotjo, who is based in US for FC Cincinnati FC in the MSL, will arrive tomorrow afternoon. Also arriving tomorrow is  midfielder Bongani Zungu, who made his debut for his new club Glasgow Rangers at the weekend and Dean Furman, who plays for Carlisle United.
