 ONE of the lead prosecutors in the rape and human tracking trial of Timonty Omotoso died on Saturday. The National Prosecuting Authority has confirmed the death of senior State prosecutor Advocate Zukile Mdolomba. NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said: "Advocate Mdolomba died on Saturday after short illness. He was one of the three prosecutors for the rape and human trafficking case against Pastor Timothy Omotoso." There has been a twist in prosecution since the trial began. In March the State prosecutor Advocate Nceba Ntelwa suddenly withdrew from the case, NPA says he had other urgent matters to attend to in East London. Then in September Advocate Ishmet Cerfontein who had been assisting Ntelwa also withdrew. Surprisingly when the Nigerian Pastor made his new bid for bail, Advocate Ntelwa was back assisted by Mdolomba and Advocate Vatiswa Jodwana-Blayi. Ngcakani said: "While Advocate Mdolomba played a pivotal role in this case especially the successful opposition of Omotoso's recent application for bail, the two remaining prosecutors are equally capable of successfully prosecuting the case." The 62-years-old has been in detention since 2017 after his arrest in the Port Elizabeth International Airport by the Hawks. He was denied bail after he was found to be a flight risk. His co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho who are out on bail, faced multiple charges related to human trafficking, rape, and racketeering.
