CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink is crossing his fingers that his former striker Kermit Erasmus doesn’t come back to haunt his side. The Citizens sold the 30-year-old lethal striker to Mamelodi Sundowns at the beginning of this season. Erasmus was the Citizens’ star player last season, scoring 13 league goals for the Mother City outfit. And he seems to have hit the ground running for his new side Sundowns, scoring in their league opener against Kaizer Chiefs. Erasmus now has his sights on his former team the Citizens who host Sundowns at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday (7.30 pm). Riekerink is hoping the diminutive striker doesn’t come back to haunt the Citizens. “Kermit is as fantastic guy and everybody will love to see him back,” said Rikerink. “He is also a good goalscorer so we will definitely miss his goals but it’s always an opportunity for someone else to stand up and show themselves. “We have other players who can fill that gap, we have Tashreeq (Morris), Fagrie (Lakay) and Prince who is not completely match fit at the moment. “We have options, the ball is in their court. I hope he (Erasmus) will have some empathy for us.”
