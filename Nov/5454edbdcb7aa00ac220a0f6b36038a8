CONTROVERSIAL businessman Duduzane Zuma has denied dating former Generations: The Legacy actress, Thuli Phongolo. This after people on social media suspected that the two were dating. Weeks ago, Thuli posted a picture of her secret bae and one tweep pointed out a tattoo that was similar to Duduzane’s tattoo. Since then, the two have been linked together because Thuli has been frequently vacationing in Dubai, where Duduzane has now relocated. In an interview with YouTube talk show host MacGyver, Duduzane said he has never even met Thuli. “She’s a beautiful young lady, I’ve only heard of her now, I didn’t know who she was until now. Beautiful young lady, she’s doing her thing and all the best in whatever she’s doing. But I do not know her, let’s just start there. Point number two, I’ve never met her and the third and obvious point, I’ll categorically deny it,” said Duduzane. During the interview, he told MacG about how he met his wife, Shanice Stork. The couple married in 2015. “It was just a random, chilled and laid-back afternoon on the weekend. Just cruising around, we happened to meet at a mutual friend’s cousin’s place and that’s how I met her. That’s how it started,” he said. ALSO READ | E.TV PULLS PLUG ON RHYTHM CITY! Duduzane also spoke about his childhood and being former president Jacob Zuma’s son. He also addressed his move to Dubai. However, he said he’s coming back because he believes he can contribute to Mzansi, referring to his plan to run for the presidency. “At the time when I moved, I need to emphasise this, it wasn’t a decision that I’d pack up and Ieave because I’m upset at the world. I love South Africa and I believe in South Africa. That’s why I’m coming back because I believe we have a lot of work to do. And I believe there’s a lot of contributions that I can still make... I’m gonna be part of the solution, I’m gonna be part of what South Africa will be in the next 10 to 15 years, there’s no doubt about that.”
