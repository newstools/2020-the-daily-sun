PLEASE, help me go to Hollywood! These are Heroine Maenetsha’s words. She wants to represent Mzansi and Africa in Hollywood. Unfortunately, she doesn’t have money to buy a flight ticket, accommodation, food and dancing outfit. The 15-year-old from the Pretoria CBD in Tshwane said she needed at least R124 000 to cover all her travel expenses. The Grade 8 pupil from Founders School in Tshwane said: “Please, help me so I can inspire disadvantaged children and fulfil their dreams as I do mine.”  Heroine said she was selected during auditions in Sandton, north of Jozi, in July where she showcased her dance, acting and modelling talent. She’s set to compete with the best in the world on 16 July, 2021. “This will be my first time to showcase my dance skills at this level. Only if I make it to the dance show,” she said. Heroine spends her spare time teaching kids how to dance. Her dream is to become an established choreographer and an actress. “My mum gave me the name Heroine because she believed I was the heroine of the family,” she said. Her mum, Nelwa (36), said when she was pregnant with Heroine she felt she’d become the saviour of the family. “She’s my girl of wonders and my miracle daughter. My daughter is confident and more than brave,” said Nelwa. Nelwa pleads with people to help her daughter’s dream of dancing in America become a reality.
