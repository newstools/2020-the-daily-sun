TJO, ja! This is how Zondo Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo responded when he heard that SAA board members were involved in operational matters. But former SAA Technical board chairwoman, Yakhe Kwinana, testified yesterday there was nothing wrong with it. “It’s in order for a board member to attend meetings where operational matters are discussed,” said Kwinana. Zondo, who looked shocked, asked why board members were involved in operational matters. “They’d go there to support the executives,” said Kwinana. Kwinana is accused of wanting a R100 million kickback from a US company called AAR, which formed a joint venture with SA-based JM Aviation in exchange for a tender worth R1,4 bn to provide ground power units and aircraft components to SAA. The contract was concluded in March 2016. Evidence showed the units, bought by SAAT for R800 000 each, were sold to JM Aviation for R248 000 each, far less than their market value. Kwinana said she approved the terms and conditions of the contract, not the contract itself. “I didn’t think this was a contract. I thought we were approving the terms and conditions of the contract,” she said. The hearing had a lot of interruptions from Kwinana’s lawyer, Advocate Lindelwa Mbanjwa, and at one stage Zondo told her she was wasting the commission’s time. Before giving evidence, Kwinana accused evidence leader Kate Hofmeyr of being biased against her. She wanted her to recuse herself, but Hofmeyr stood her ground. Another contract that Kwinana was taken through was the cancellation of the cooking contract in 2015. SAA cancelled the contract awarded to LSG Sky Chefs and gave it to SAA subsidiary, Air Chefs. “There’s no way I cannot remember that. That was one of the best decisions I made at SAA,” said Kwinana. Air Chefs lost the contract because of complaints about its food. She said that tender should have been awarded to LSG instead SAA had to help Air Chefs to avoid job losses.
