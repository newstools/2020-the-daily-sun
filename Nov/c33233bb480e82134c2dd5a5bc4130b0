LEGENDARY actor Seputla Sebogodi has scored himself a role onThe River. He’ll be playing Mohumi Ditshwene on the popular 1Magic telenovela. Seputla told Daily Sun: “I was really excited when I got the call to be part of the show. I’ve been a fan since it started and for me to be part of such a great production is an honour.” He said he’d be creating havoc on the show. “Mohumi is a great guy, but spending almost 10 years in prison for something he was framed for has changed him. He’s going to cause havoc in the life of Lindiwe, with whom he has a long history, and change things for Refiloe,” he said. “The show has an amazing cast, directors and writers, so I am really excited to be part of their family. I’m going to make sure I bring my A-game because the ratings are up there.” Seputla was curious to see whether viewers would love or hate Mohumi. The actor’s son, Thapelo, plays Khabzela on the show. Seputla said it was exciting to work with him. “Sharing a set with my son has to be one of the best things that’s happened to me, but I need to find a balance because after shooting, I put on the father hat,” he said. “I acted with him when he was 12. He was an extra on a show I was in and was later cast as my son. Hearing him call me dad on stage was priceless. He has come a long way and I’m really proud of him. Helping me read scripts is where his love for acting began.”
