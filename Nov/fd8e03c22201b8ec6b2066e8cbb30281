PRESSURE is the order of the day heading to Saturday's Bloemfontein Celtic and SuperSport United’s MTN8 semi-final, second leg at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium (3pm). SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo said pressure is on Celtic, while his counterpart John Maduka plays reversal psychology by saying, “pressure is on SuperSport, they are the defending champions”. “KT is playing mind games, the pressure is on them. They are the defending champions,” Maduka said yesterday in a virtual press conference. The two teams played to a 1-1 draw in the first leg played in Pretoria last weekend, and Celtic are at an advantage due to the away goal rule. Maduka said they won’t dwell too much on the away goal they scored this past weekend, but they will instead focus on the job at hand to ensure they reach the Wafa Wafa final. Maduka added: “We scored an away goal in the first leg but we won’t put too much attention on that, anything can still happen. It is going to be a tricky one. “For me, I do not even believe we have one leg in the final, it is still a 50/50 thing, but one team must win.” The winner will meet either Kaizer Chiefs or Orlando Pirates in the final, who play in the other semi-final at FNB Stadium on Sunday at the same time. Said Tembo: “Advantage is with Celtic cause they scored an away goal and they have a home advantage. The pressure is on them now cause they have one foot in the final. “But there is still a lot to play for. We don’t know what kind of tactics they will apply, whether they will sit-back or come at us. We hope to take pressure to them.” Maduka confirmed that goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane has fully recovered from the head injury he sustained in the first leg and is available for selection tomorrow. Maduka concluded: “All players are available for selection. We hope nothing will happen from now until match day.” SuperSport will look to their king goalie and captain, Ronwen Williams who have the pillar of strength for the club.
