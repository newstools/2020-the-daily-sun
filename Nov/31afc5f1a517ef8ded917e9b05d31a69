HE stopped a taxi, thinking it would take him home – but it took him on a ride straight to hell! Lucky Mokoena (26) was stabbed 13 times inside the taxi before his attackers dumped him and left him to die. But Lucky wasn’t ready to die. Lucky from Crystal Park, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun his ordeal started on Friday, 30 October when he helped a motorist who had asked him to find a place in Petit. “I went with him because we were going in the same direction. After he dropped me off I got into a taxi.” In the taxi there were six men, including the driver. “I sat in the middle seat. After only a few metres, one of the men put his hand around my neck and started choking me,” he said. The men ordered him to lie on the floor and they started to stab him. They took his bank cards and his cellphone from his pockets. Then they hit him with a heavy object on the head and he passed out. “I woke up in hospital,” he said. His mother Nonhlanhla Mokoena (45) said she became worried when her son didn’t come back from work and his phone was off. She called family and friends and they started searching for him. Finally, they found him at Far East Hospital in Springs after he regained consciousness. “He gave the hospital staff his name and when we contacted the hospital, they could identify him,” she said. Sergeant Connie Moalusi said a case of attempted murder was opened and no one has been arrested.
