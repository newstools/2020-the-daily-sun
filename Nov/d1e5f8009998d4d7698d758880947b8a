THE streets of Seshego, Polokwane were filled with joy and love yesterday when people gave newly-crowned Miss South Africa Shudufhadzo Musida a hero’s homecoming. Her day started at Meropa Casino outside Polokwane for breakfast, where she spoke to the media. Then she paraded in a white Mercedes-Benz cabriolet, waving to the people lining the streets. She said she liked her chiskop and preferred herself that way. “It saves me a lot of time. “The weaves look really good, but this is me and this is the way I look. It’s a bold decision for women to choose how they look.” She said her crown was a big responsibility. “As Premier Stan Mathabatha said, I’m a mirror for village girls,” she said. Mathabatha said Limpopo, Vhembe District and himself were smiling because they have Shudufhadzo.  “She has emerged as the most beautiful maiden of 2020. Shudufhadzo is a student at Wits University and a graduate of the University of Pretoria. She is a beauty with brains.” Mathabatha warned Shudufhadzo not to be changed by her crown. Grade Morudu (37) from Polokwane was happy to have seen Miss SA with her own eyes. “It’s great that we were offered a chance to see our beautiful queen,” she said. The homecoming ceremony will continue today in Vhembe District until tomorrow, when she will be at her home village in Ha-Masia.
