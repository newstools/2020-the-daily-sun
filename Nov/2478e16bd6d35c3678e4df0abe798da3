Tempers are running high outside Brackenfell High School in Cape Town. Stun grenades and water canons have already been used as cops push EFF marchers further away from the school. Members of the EFF were supposed to hold their march a kilometre from the school but a group of over 100 people gathered very close to the school. Cops wanted them to move further away from the school and this led to tempers running high. “We have done nothing wrong. Why are you throwing stun grenades at us. We are just practising our constitutional right to protest. We are not here to fight but to march against racism and you must treat us with respect,” shouted protester Mzi Ntshali. The protesters complained that cops started treating them like criminals well before they even started marching. “They even brought helicopters. They never do that when there are protests in the kasis. This is how racism is entrenched,” he said.  Cops helicopters are hovering around the area with several private security vehicles manning the school yard. Cops have also put razor wires around the roads near the school blocking the access to the school gate.  The EFF has came back to Brackenfell in large numbers after some of its members were attacked by parents outside the school two weeks ago.
