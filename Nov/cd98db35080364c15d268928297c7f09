BLIND residents marched on Wednesday to raise awareness of the challenges they face. The residents of Mbombela, Mpumalanga, held placards and chanted as they walked through the streets. Nokuthula Dladla (36) said they still didn’t receive equal treatment and faced challenges in public areas such as taxi ranks and police stations. “We want to be recognised and respected. So many people violate our rights. “We don’t get the same treatment as everyone else,” she said. “Taxi drivers take advantage of us and that’s not OK. Every time we go to a place, we feel unwelcome. “It also becomes difficult for us to ask for help to get jobs. We’re always sidelined.” Themba Mhlanga (31) said there was still a lot to be done to raise awareness about blind people. “When we get to the shops, some people ignore or undermine us,” he said. Provincial chairwoman of the National Council for the Blind Doris Mgwenya said there were still many challenges facing the blind. “Our members are unemployable. They’re not considered when there are job opportunities. “This needs to end as we want to be treated the same as everyone else,” she said. Danisile Mthembu, manager of the municipal transversal services, said there’s a programme set up to raise awareness and celebrate people living with disabilities. “As transversal services, we’ve decided to make people aware of our needs and that people living with disabilities also need to be treated in a good way,” she said. Mthembu said the municipality was advocating for people living in disabilities and dealing with the challenges they encountered.
