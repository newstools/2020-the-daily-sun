REALITY TV star Lucky Gumbi has come out guns blazing at DJ Tira. The polygamist, whose reality show, The Gumbis, recently launched on SABC1, said Tira was arrogant and disrespectful. During the show, Lucky, aka SomK, was asked if he knew one of Tira’s songs and his response was he didn’t care about Tira’s music. In his diary sessions, he explained why he said that: “Even when you look at Tira, you can see he’s just for himself,” said SomK.I’d say he’s arrogant. “I used to invite him and other DJs when I still worked on events. I’m cool with other DJs.” We even greet each other. With him, we could meet at the garage and he would pass like he didn’t know you.” He said the only time Tira greeted him was when he was with a woman. “I don’t care about him or his music, but He needs to learn to respect other people and those who support his music.” When approached for comment DJ Tira said: “I’ve no idea who this man is. I don’t remember engaging with him. I don’t want drama in my life. And if ngamdelela ngiyaxolisa, nganginga qondile. SomK said he didn’t want to comment further.
