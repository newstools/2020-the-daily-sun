  The two busses belong to the North West Transport Investment (NTI) and they crashed on each other. On Saturday morning the two busses were following each other on the R101 in Hammanskraal north of Tshwane taking passengers to work. Instead of getting to work on time, nine passengers were injured and taken to hospital. It is not clear what could have led to the other bus to hit the other bus. The incident although a large number of ambulances got to the scene, didn't cause traffic congestion. A motorist who passed the accident scene said he was relieving to see that a lot of passengers were not injured. "Bus accident most of the time leave many injured. It was a huge relief hearing that paramedics arrived at the scene quickly. â€œIt happened so fast and in no time every one was attended to and traffic flowed," he said. He said it was just strange that the busses belonged to the same company. "One would expect the drivers to treat each other with respect on the road and keep a good following distance since they work for the same company," he said. Spokesman for the North West Department of Community Safety and Transport, Freddy Sepeng, said the two buses were both heading to Pretoria from Hammanskraal when one hit the other at the rear as they were following each other. "Ambulances were immediately called and took all the injured to the nearby Jubilee Hospital," he said. He said the MEC for Community Safety and Transport Management, Sello Lehari, has been informed and has wished the injured a speedy recovery. He said NTI's Management also wished all the injured passengers a speedy recovery.
