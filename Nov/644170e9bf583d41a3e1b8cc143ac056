BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is relieved that top defender Sifiso Hlanti has found a new club. The left back, who was without a club following the recent sale of Bidvest Wits’ status to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, was signed on Tuesday by newly promoted DStv Premiership outfit Swallows FC. The talented Hlanti was omitted from Ntseki’s squad for this month’s back-to-back 2021 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Sao Tome due to his lack of match fitness and the fact he was without a club when the Bafana coach named his squad to play Sao Tome. And due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the tiny island nation have agreed to play both qualifiers at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium. The first will is scheduled for 13 November and the second three days later. Ntseki said a player of Hlanti’s calibre and experience is an important part of the national team. Ntseki confirmed that he’ll be part of the squad next year when Bafana host Ghana on 25 March at FNB Stadium and three days later against Sudan in Khartoum, when the Afcon qualifiers will be concluded. “I’m very happy for him because I think he has been a loyal servant of the game and the national team,” said Ntseki. “So we are looking forward to see him playing regularly and hopefully he’ll stay free from injuries. “Come Ghana and Sudan next year, if he’s fit and ready, he’ll be part of the team because we cannot throw away his experience. It’s good for us and it is good for him and hopefully, he’ll be an important addition to Swallows FC.” The Kwa-Zulu Natal born defender had been training with Kaizer Chiefs under his former coach Gavin Hunt who was keen to reunite with the 30-year-old Hlanti, who he worked with at Wits.
