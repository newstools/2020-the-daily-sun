GATVOL residents have demanded that Home Affairs take action against officials who refuse to help them. For over a week, residents have been complaining that they have been sent home by Home Affairs officers in Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, without getting any help. According to residents, whenever they visited Home Affairs, they were told the system was offline, forcing them to travel to Tzaneen or Giyani to get help. Matome Modiba (45) from Bolobedu said he had been trying to help his daughter apply for an ID. “I haven’t received any help. every time I come here, I’m told the system is down. We have no choice, but to stand in long queues waiting for it to come up again,” he said. “Sometimes, it comes back on late in the afternoon, but because of the long queues, many people have to go home without being helped.” The offices serve more than a million residents in the Greater Letaba Municipality. Stella Machaba (33) said sometimes she had to go to the office as early as 5am to make sure she was first in line. “This systems should be upgraded because some of us don’t have the money to come here on a daily basis. “This has been going on for a long time. It seems the department just doesn’t care,” she said. The residents told Daily Sun they had complained about the issue a number of times with no luck. They said if the department did nothing to solve the issue, they threatened to shut the offices down. Provincial Home Affairs manager Albert Matsaung said there were problems with the system, which often went down, but not for the whole day. “Another issue is our camera booth, which wasn’t working properly. We’ve supplied a new one. We’re currently modernising our systems and have provided a mobile office for temporary relief,” he said.
