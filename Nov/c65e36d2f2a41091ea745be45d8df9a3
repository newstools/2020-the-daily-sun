ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule has been released on R200 000 bail. He was formally charged in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court, a while ago after he made a brief appearance where 21 charges ranging from theft, attempted theft, fraud and corruption were read out to him. The matter was postponed to 19 February, 2021 for the addition of at least three more accused persons on the charge sheet and to join Magashule with the rest of the accused. “He was ordered to surrender his passport, he must inform the investigating team if he wishes to travel abroad and not to be in contact with any witnesses, particularly his former PA, Moroadi Cholota. In this regard, he may not, directly or through third parties, make any contact with her,” the NPA said in a statement afterwards.
