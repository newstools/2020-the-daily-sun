Limpopo police are investigating two drownings after the bodies of two boys were found outside Seshego near Polokwane. The bodies of the boys, aged 5 and 7, were found in Thakgalang village on Friday at around 16:00. The children had reportedly been playing next to a small dam when they decided to swim without any supervision, provincial police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. "Later on, their families noticed that the boys are nowhere to be found and the matter was reported to the policeâ€¦ Subsequently, the SAPS Search and Rescue Team and [emergency services personnel] were also notified and managed to retrieve the bodies from the dam with the support from the local community," Ngoepe said. An inquest case has been opened for further investigation. SOURCE:News24
