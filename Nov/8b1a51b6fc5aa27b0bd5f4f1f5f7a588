PITSO Mosimane is on the verge of yet another title with the reigning Caf Champions League champions to add another feather to his busy cap of achievements after having won the Egyptian Premier League. This weekend was special for the 56-year-old South Africa coach as he clinched his second Caf Champions League title with the Red Eagles, the club’s ninth overall. Now, there is no time to rest for Al Ahly, as they jumped straight into preparations for the Egyptian Cup semi-final match against Alexandria’s Al Ittihad, set for tomorrow. Al Ahly won the Champions League title 2-1 against bitter rivals Zamalek in the final to earn Mosimane accolades from across Africa as he became the only coach to have won twice in different times with him, within four years. But Mosimane will have to make do without the services of Junior Ajayi, who will be sidelined from the match due to injury. He underwent medical checks before yesterday’s training. “The coaching staff preferred to rest him,” the club said in a statement. “Our players, Taher Mohamed Taher and Karim Nedved, continued their rehabilitation programmes. “The two players are taking major steps in the programme to be ready to support the team.” Mosimane has already handed over the Champions League trophy to chairman, Mahmoud El Khatib, and will be hoping to do the same with the Egyptian Cup. “I’ve nothing better to give you, but only this beautiful jewel,” said Mosimane upon handing over the silverware. But there are possibilities that Al Ahly could have another date against Zamalek in the same cup, as the The Royal Club will face El Gaish in the other semi-final also tomorrow.
