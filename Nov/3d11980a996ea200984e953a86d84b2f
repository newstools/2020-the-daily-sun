 More than 40 North West residents continue to pick up the pieces after a heavy storm left them homeless and stranded. Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and traditional affairs MEC Mmoloki Cwaile and Mahikeng local municipality mayor Betty Diakanyo came out in support of those who lost their homes. A freak thunderstorm tore through Goedgevonden and Uitkyk outside Mahikeng on Friday , destroying the walls and roofs of many houses. Masego Springbok said she was sitting inside her house with her children when the storm started that evening. “I saw my roof flying and walls falling apart but at that time all I wanted to do was to save my four children,” she said. Masego said everything was destroyed. “Their school books are destroyed, even the little grocery we had got damaged because of that storm,” she said. Lefu Moilakgaka said he needed a place to stay. “My shack was destroyed and I had to sleep outside for Saturday night. I do not know where am I going to sleep tonight,” he said. Visiting the area yesterday MEC Cwaile said his department was about to relocate the affected families to the neighbouring crèche and also engage the local church as an alternative place. “Human settlement together with the department of public works will make assessments on the damaged infrastructure and the department of public works has already deployed a service provider on the site who is clearing up the water,” he said. Cwaile said on the bases and strength of the report, his department will make the redress on the houses that were damaged. “We are here to monitor if our interventions are unfolding well and if we are making an impact. There were no fatalities and we have persons and animals here rescued,” he said.
