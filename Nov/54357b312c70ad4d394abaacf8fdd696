FORMER Bafana Bafana star Delron Buckley is set to be appointed today as Maritzburg United’s interim coach. Buckley, appointed as the assistant coach at the beginning of the season before the sacking of Vincent Kobola, will be in charge when the Team of Choice host SuperSport United in their DStv Premiership clash at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. Buckley, who will work alongside goalkeeper coach Rowen Fernandez, takes over from Eric Tinkler, who was sacked on Monday after a string of poor results this season. It is not clear how long the duo will be given in their new roles as SunSport sources have learnt that Shaun Bartlett, Owen Da Gama and Benni McCarthy are front runners to replace Tinker. Tinkler’s departure came after he lost all five matches in all competitions this season, which has seen the team languishing at the bottom of the table. The 50-year-old was let go after Maritzburg were beaten 1-0 in a league match against Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. It was the club’s 11th game without a win, going back as far as last season. Maritzburg last victory was against now relegated Polokwane City in March before the season was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Tinkler arrived at Maritzburg last January to replace Muhsin Ertugral, when the club was also struggling for results. Tinkler saved Maritzburg’s Premiership status via the promotion/relegation play-offs. Last season, the former Orlando Pirates coach performed admirably when he led the club to seventh spot on the table and also reached the Telkom Knockout final. Tinkler was in charge of 57 games, winning 23, drawing 13 and losing 21.
