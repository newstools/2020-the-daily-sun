MAMELODI Sundowns have confirmed Gift Motupa has been involved in a car accident. The burly striker escaped with minor injuries and is recovering well after his Golf GTI crashed on the R37, outside Polokwane. Despite the shocking images that have circulated of the aftermath, the club have confirmed Motupa escaped unhurt. It is believed the South Africa international lost control of his white Golf 7 GTi and rolled off the R37 as he was en route home to Polokwane, and received medical attention on the scene. The 26-year-old joined the Brazilians from Wits in the transfer window. But he is yet to debut for his new team.
