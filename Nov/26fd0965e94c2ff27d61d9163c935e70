THREE buses, a truck and other vehicles were torched in Khayelitsha, Cape Town on Thursday, 12 November during a violent service delivery protest. Protesters closed roads and burnt tyres demanding electricity, water and toilets for their shacks, which were erected during lockdown. Protesters under the banner of Intlungu yaseMatyotyombeni Movement said they have engaged with the City of Cape Town and the office handling hearings on land expropriation in Khayelitsha. The group said they expected a response in seven days, but they got nothing. “It’s been six months without water, toilets and electricity. We feel we are being treated like outsiders,” read their statement. The organisation said they represented 12 informal settlements formed during lockdown. Golden Arrow Buses spokeswoman Bronwen Beyer-Dyke said three buses were burnt. “Thankfully no injuries were reported. At this stage the motive is unknown.  “We have had to move our services to the old Makhaya terminus as a precautionary measure. We condemn this in the strongest possible terms,” said Beyer-Dyke. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Public order policing and other law enforcement agencies are policing a service delivery related protest in Khayelitsha. “According to available information, about three buses and a truck were torched and the N2 is closed. No arrests were made so far.”
