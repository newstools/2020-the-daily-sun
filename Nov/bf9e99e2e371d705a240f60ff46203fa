IT goes without saying Kaizer Chiefs are facing a herculean task in the Caf Champions League. It is even tougher when taking their poor form into consideration. But club boss Kaizer Motaung expects nothing less from his team. The stuttering Soweto giants kick off their Champions League campaign with against PWD Bamenda. They visit the Cameroonian champions for their first leg preliminary round clash at Omnisports Stadium in Limbre, the first of a two-legged tie, with the second game scheduled next week Friday at FNB Stadium. And Motaung has emphasised the importance of Amakhosi doing well in the taxing Champions League. ”This is an important journey for us. It’s our first time playing in Cameroon," Motaung. "It happens in our 50th-anniversary milestone. And it happens when Cameroon is preparing to host the Africa Cup of Nations. "So, we are going out there to fly the South African flag with pride. I wish the team a safe journey and victory on Sunday.”
