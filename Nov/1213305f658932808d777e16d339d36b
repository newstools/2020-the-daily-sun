Johannesburg's Killarney Mall was evacuated on Saturday due to a bomb scare. People rushed out to allow for the Bomb Squad to sweep the building. The mall's initial advisory said the mall was evacuated due to safety protocols and the Bomb Squad was contracted. The mall posted later on its Facebook page that once getting clearance, it was reopened. "The Bomb Squad has completed a full investigation and sweep of the mall and can confirm the mall is safe and may resume trade." bomb threat at killarney mall:) pic.twitter.com/1LpOCIqS9S
