A VIDEO, supposedly featuring a popular maskandi star, has created a storm on social media. A man can be seen lying in bed next to an unkown woman. According to details on the video, it was taken on Thursday. Many people were convinced it was maskandi star, Mthandeni “Igcokama Elisha” Manqele, in the footage. Others were certain it’s his lookalike, upstart Mvelwenhle “Igalofu Elisha” Mhlongo. But they both denied being in the 10-minute video. Maskandi fans laughed their heads off and swore by their dearly departed gogos and mkhulus it felt as if they were seeing Mthandeni in the flesh. They accused the underperformer in the video of failing to use his 9mm 4-5! But Mthandeni told Daily Sun it wasn’t him and accused Mvelwenhle of impersonating him. Said Mthandeni: “Igalofu Elisha enjoys it when people say he looks like me. “I agree. We do look alike. As a result, people accuse me of things I know nothing about.” He said he respects himself. Mvelwenhle distanced himself from being labelled an underperformer and posted a video of his current hairstyle. “I have hair and Mthandeni, who’s in the video, has trimmed his hair. “It breaks my heart that people associate me with it.” Naturally, maskandi fans had a lot to say. “It’s clear she tossed and turned while the snoring Mthandeni slept all night.”
