Controversial artist Rasta celebrated Mshoza’s life by painting her. Lebani Seranje, affectionately known as Rasta, told Daily Sun that he painted this with love and spent a lot of time to create a masterpiece of the Kwaito Queen. Last week he was trending for one of his old paintings, people mistaking actress Thandeka Mdeliswa for Mshoza. He cleared the air, letting people know Mshoza’s beautiful piece as he described it, was definitely coming and it’s here. He said Mshoza had asked when he’ll be painting her portrait. “I’m very sad and disappointed that I was only able to paint her when she’s no longer alive,” said Rasta. “Heaven has gained an angel,” he added. Mzansi is not happy with his painting but as usual, the artist does not care about any negative criticism. Minenhle Mabaso said she saw Rasta’s tweet earlier this week and she was hoping that he’d change his mind about painting her. “I really wish someone stole his brushes and paint. I don’t think he realises how disrespectful this is,” she said. Not everyone is against his painting, some people think he’s improving. “We’ve known Rasta for his unrecognisable paintings but I honestly think he’s improving. This might not be perfect but he’s definitely getting better and I hope he never gives up,” Lerato Mahobe tweeted.
