MOTSHIDISI Sefako (48) told Daily Sun she got infected because a colleague who was Covid-19 positive came to work. “The person didn’t disclose they were positive,” said Motshidisi from Boitekong, outside Rustenburg in North West. She urged people to not fear telling close contacts about their status. Motshidisi tested positive in June. “I wasn’t showing any symptoms. I was terrified when I got the news.” She said she feared going back to work. “I was told I could get infected again or infect others though I had healed. I had to request a re-test before I could return to work.” She said she didn’t have symptoms, but used home-made remedies and bought vitamin C supplements, which helped her heal. “It’s our responsibility to take care of our health and consider those close to us. “People shouldn’t fear revealing they’re positive. Someone might lose their life because someone was scared to seek help.” She said her road to recovery was not easy. “I still fear infecting those around me, especially children. I’m grateful for the support I got. I’m thankful to everyone who encouraged me to stay positive. “I encourage people to continue following precautionary measures. Covid-19 is not yet over. Let’s continue wearing our masks. Let’s do it for ourselves and those around us.”
