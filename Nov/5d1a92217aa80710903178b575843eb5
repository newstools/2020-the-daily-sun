Nateniel Julies' family have expressed frustration over court postponements. On Friday, the case against three cops implicated in the murder of Nateniel was postponed to 8 December for further investigations in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto. The National Prosecuting Authority said it needed to thoroughly prepare for trial. Sergeant Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvane, Constable Caylene Whiteboy and Sergeant Foster Netshiongolo were denied bail and have since remained in custody. Ndyalvana and Whiteboy are facing charges of premiditated murder, defeating the ends of justice and discharging a firearm in public, while Netshiongolo is accused of concealing evidence, defeating the ends of justice and possession of unlawful ammunition. However, Netshiongolo through his attorney is expected to appear in court on 1 December to present new evidence. This comes after the court heard that Nateniel was shot by Whiteboy, who said in her affidavit that she just wanted to scare Nateniel as she thought the gun was still loaded with rubber bullets and she did so under Ndyalvana’s instruction. Nateniel’s mum Bridget Harris said: “The postponements are tiring and draining us. We just want justice to be served as we know who killed Nateniel.” NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said they sympathised with the family but they need to go through the process. Nateniel (16) who had down syndrome was shot and killed near his home in Eldorado Park, south of Joburg in August. His murder sparked outrage that saw community members marching to the police station.
