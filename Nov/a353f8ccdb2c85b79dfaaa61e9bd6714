BRIGADIER Vuyisile Ncatha has spoken out against laws that protect criminals. The head of Nyanga Police Station, speaking at an event in Philippi in Cape Town over the weekend of 21 November, said this needed to change. Ncatha said cops are required by law to share information with suspects’ lawyers. This allowed thugs to get away with crime. “Imagine after the whole investigation, the whole docket, we must disclose and hand it over to perpetrators’ lawyers, where he can look for loopholes.” He said this makes it difficult for the police to secure convictions. “When the case is in court, the perpetrator becomes the main guy. “They don’t talk about the victim. His rights are pronounced loud and clear.” Unless laws were changed, it would remain difficult for police to get convictions. “Why can’t it be that the suspect proves he didn’t commit the crime?” said Ncatha. There was a need to lobby the legislature to make laws that protect victims. Although cops were doing their best, the conviction rate wasn’t enough. He pleaded with communities to work with cops. “We have over 1 000 murder dockets that are unsolved. “If 20 people are killed, we solve maybe three or four of those cases. We need to do better. “As cops, we need to do everything in our power in terms of our contract so people can trust us. “We must be trusted by the community for people to come forward with information.”
