BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic will have a new coach when they embark on their African Safari this weekend. But that’ll only be temporary as assistant coach Ditheko Mototo guides Siwelele in their Caf Confederation Cup opener against DR Congo side AS Maniema Union on Sunday. Together with Abram Nteo, Mototo has travelled with the team to Kindu and will not be joined by head coach John Maduka who is home. Eyebrows have been raised when Maduka explained after the midweek match that he won’t be joining his team in Congo. According to Celtic CEO, Khumbulani Konco, the arrangement formed part of the plan to ensure the team doesn’t fall behind in the league, while in pursuit of continental glory. “When we played Leopards on Wednesday, other teams were departing for Congo. It’s all been part of the plan,” Konco explained. “This is not to say we’re undermining Maniema, sending a B-team to Congo. It’s football, you need to plan. We’re confident the team will do the job out there.” Celtic have a tough schedule in the coming weeks, which includes the MTN8 showdown with Orlando Pirates. Naturally, they wouldn’t want to stretch their thin squad any further with a tight fixture schedule. The likes of Ndumiso Mabena, who scored against Leopards and Tebogo Potsane, Victor Letsoalo, including Lucky Baloyi won’t be travelling. But should the Free State team prevail over Maniema in the two preliminary round legs, they’ll move to the first round. Despite their impressive run in the top-eight, Celtic have started quite slowly in the DStv Premiership, only registering their first win in their 1-0 victory against Leopards in five outings. Notwithstanding their financial challenges, they have punched above their own weight and could surprise many in the continental competition.
