KwaZulu-Natal police are on the hunt for three suspects, who allegedly ambushed a cop, hijacked his police car and fled the scene. "This morning [Saturday] at 08:00, a police officer stationed at Ezibayeni was on duty conducting investigations in the area. While he was at Tebha area, three unknown men emerged from the bushes and opened fire," police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said. He said the officer managed to get out of the vehicle and returned fire. "The suspects hijacked the police vehicle, which contained his rifle, before fleeing the scene. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the body and was taken to hospital for medical attention." He said the suspects also hijacked a second vehicle in the vicinity. "The state vehicle was found abandoned at Wela Bridge. Charges of attempted murder and carjacking are currently being investigated." The KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi condemned the attack on the police officer. "Criminals must realise that an attack on a police officer is an attack on the nation. We have initiated our 72-hour activation plan to trace the suspects, who were responsible for this callous attack. "We wish the injured police officer a speedy recovery," he said.
