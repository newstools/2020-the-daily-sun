INVESTMENT commitments, which have now amassed billions of rands should translate into new jobs, skills and opportunities. This was the message from President Cyril Ramaphosa when he opened the third South African Investment Conference, an initiative he established to spearhead economic growth and lure investors into the country. Since the initiative was launched, which targeted R1,2 trillion for five years, Ramaphosa said local and international investors committed R664 billion to date. Despite unemployment reaching record highs as announced by Stats SA recently, Ramaphosa said many projects had since been launched. “We want to see this R664 billion translated into new factories, production lines, mining operations, retail outlets and infrastructure,” said Ramaphosa. He said government has been tracking the implementation of the 102 projects announced at the last two meetings,” he said. “R172 billion of the committed amount has been spent on projects to date. This is just over a quarter of the commitments made in 2018 and 2019. “These projects alone portray an economy with exciting opportunities for growth across a wide diversity of industries.” Ramaphosa further announced that the mining and mineral sector has seen the greatest flow of investment from this commitment with just over R63,6 billion having been spent to date. Others were the car industry at R23 billion, infrastructure at R7,7 billion and property and hospitality at R8,2 billion. He said government had set its sights on economic reconstruction and recovery riding on the success of attracting investment over two years. He used the platform to launch another initiative, dubbed Operation Vulindlela, to be driven by a team from the Presidency and National Treasury. It will open the way for high-impact economic reforms in network industries such as energy, water, telecommunications and transport, as well as in attracting critical skills and streamlining the visa regime.
