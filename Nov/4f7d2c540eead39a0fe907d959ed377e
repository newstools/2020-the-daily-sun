THE trial of the four men accused of being responsible for the hit on billionaire Wandile Bozwana has started in the North Gauteng High Court. Bozwana was shot nine times by a lone gunman while sitting in the passenger seat of business partner Mpho Baloyi’s car on the Garsfontein offramp in Tshwane five years ago. Baloyi was also shot at, but managed to drive away and get help. Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela and his co-accused Sipho Hudla, Matamela Mutapa and Bonginkosi Khumalo, earlier pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder. The trial resumed this week, two months later. Cellphone expert Warrant Officer Wynand Venter testified that according to phone records, there was no communication between the four accused on the day of the murder. ZODWA DOESN'T MIND WHEN FANS LICK HER PUNANI Hudla’s Advocate, JP Marais, read out a confession the cops claimed he made the day after his arrest, where Hudla said they were following the car the victim was travelling in when Mathibela phoned them and told them to carry out the job. Hudla has denied any knowledge of the killing and claimed he was forced into making a confession by the police. Marais said there was proof his client was telling the truth because according to Venter, cellphone records indicated Hudla did not leave Joburg on the day of the murder. Another police cellphone expert is expected to later testify. Mamelodi taxi boss Khekhe faces charges of intimidation, assault and extortion with Elias Skhosana and Stemmer Monageng it the Pretoria Magistrates Court. The four accused in the Bozwana matter remain behind bars.
