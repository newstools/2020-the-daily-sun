NATIONAL Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) president Mzwandile Makwayiba told North West premier Job Mokgoro that things will not go in his favour if the government does not hire community health workers. This came after the community health workers engaged in a week-long strike where they shut down clinics around Mahikeng and damaged some Department of Health properties. Makwayiba reminded Mokgoro on Thursday, 26 November that he was elected by the masses to become a premier and that they have the powers to remove him. “For more than six years we have been asking the Department of Health to absorb community health workers on the basis that primary health is the way to go. “We have agreed that at least 40 000 must be absorbed. We are here because the government led by the ANC is now dragging its feet when they have to absorb community health workers,” he said. Makwayiba said the working class need a political party that would put their interests first, and accused the governing party of failing to fulfil promises made to its alliance partners, the SACP and trade union federation Cosatu. “The ANC has failed to fulfil its promises. Let us stop playing around the bush. Let’s get to reality. The reality is that the working class is on its own. And the reality is that the working class need a party of the working class and in this case, the party for the working class is the Communist Party. Mokgoro assured Nehawu that workers’ concerns would be attended to. “Already at Exco we are discussing this matter within the context of the national state. Clearly in these very difficult economic times, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic, we all need to have some sense of security, especially job security. So there is no way that the concerns that they have expressed cannot be empathised with,” said Mokgoro. Nehawu has given the provincial government seven days to respond to the submitted demands.
