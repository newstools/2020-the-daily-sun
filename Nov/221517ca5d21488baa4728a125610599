FORMER Expresso presenter, Katlego Maboe, was meant to appear in the Cape Town Magistrates Court today for allegedly violating a court order by one of his ex-lovers. But he never appeared in court. Western Cape NPA spokesman, Eric Ntabazalila, said: “When the prosecutor saw an article about allegations made, she contacted the cops and asked about the court appearance. She was given today’s date for the court appearance. This morning the docket was not brought to court as was expected. She has since asked for the docket to peruse it. No date has been set yet for the appearance.” A video of Katlego being confronted by his partnerMonique Muller for cheating on her recently did the rounds on social media. In a nasty exchange of words, Monique accused Katlego of giving her a sexually transmitted infection, which, according to her, had the potential of causing long term or fertility problems. Katlego has since been suspended from Expresso and OUTsurance stopped his adverts. In a tweet on 23 October, Katlego said: “Truth: I was unfaithful to my partner during a very important time of our lives – an act I regret to this day. We are currently undergoing an unfortunate and painful separation, which is being resolved through legal proceedings.” After the incident, Katlego’s situation gained public sympathy, notably from Twitter users who lashed at his employers and called for the companies to give him his jobs back. Over 7 000 people signed a petition. OUTsurance previously made it known that Katlego was paid for all the adds he featured in and was not a permanent employee of the company.
