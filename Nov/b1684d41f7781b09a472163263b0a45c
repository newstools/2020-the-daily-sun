 As the matriculants sat for their first English paper one
today, the pregnant pupil was nursing a broken heart at home. Anele Mbatha (18) from Mnambithi in Ladysmith KZN said she
had accepted that she will write next year. She was expelled from Mzimela Secondary School last month
after it was discovered she's pregnant. "I had hope when the principal called my mother to a
meeting yesterday but she come back sad saying the School Governing Body
refused to let me write," said Anele. She told Daily Sun that the School delayed her dream, and
her pregnancy never affected anyone. "I was very confident that I will pass and go to the
university to fulfil my dream of becoming a chartered accountant," said
Anele. Her mother Zandile Mbatha (38) said she was hoping that they
will let her child write. "The principal called me in school yesterday, he then
told me to beg the SGB as they are the one who took that decision but they
refused," said Mbatha. She said she feels the School wasted her time as they knew
from the start they won't allow her daughter. "I am not okay with their decision and there is nothing
I can do. We just accepted what they told us, " said Mbatha. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said every school had a code of conduct that needed to be followed. “Pupils must stick to their work and avoid falling pregnant. I believe this doesn’t implicate this pupil. It’s a school policy,” said Mahlambi. But he said that did not mean she shouldn’t write the final exams.
