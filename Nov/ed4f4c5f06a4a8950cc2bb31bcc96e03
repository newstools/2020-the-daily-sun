FORMER magistrate Shireen Hoosen targeted acquitted drunk and driving suspects using her position. But the long arm of the law finally caught up with her. On Monday, Hoosen, a former magistrate at the Krugersdorp Court, west of Joburg, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Provincial spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo, said the police received information that Hoosen was calling acquitted drunk and driving suspects, telling them they should pay admission of guilty fines. She would then pocket the money and release the suspects. The investigation was led by Sergeant Cobus Cronje and it was discovered that Hoosen had defrauded eight people using the same modus operandi. “She was then served with summons to appear in court and subsequently suspended, pending an investigation. “Investigating officer was able to trace and obtain statements from the victims who became complainants,” said Masondo. The matter was on trial in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court since 2013. In September, Hoosen was found guilty of eight counts of fraud and eight counts of defeating the ends of justice. Acting Provincial Commissioner of the police, Major General Patricia Rampota, said: “This arrest should send a strong message to officials involved in criminal activities that no one is above the law. I commend the investigating officer that worked so hard to ensure that the former government official pays for her misconduct.”
