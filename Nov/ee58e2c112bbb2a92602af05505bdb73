Rising DJ and producer, Zimbabwean-born Zandimaz, is ready to take Mzansi by storm. She dropped Emathandweni, featuring Nokwazi, last month. It’s number four on Shazam! Speaking to SunBuzz, the musician whose real name is Zandile Mazithulela didn’t expect her debut single to do so well. “For a long time I was scared to release music. But lockdown had me thinking. “I reflected on my life and thought to just do it. Finally, I have my first-born child. “I knew the song would do well, but not to this extent. Being number four on Shazam is crazy. “It’s amazing how well it’s also doing on radio. It’s a great feeling when something you put a lot of work and energy into does well.” ALSO READ | I LOVE YOU MOMMY - MSHOZA'S DAUGTHER AT SERVICE The lawyer started deejaying in 2014 while still a student at Unisa. “I was inspired after seeing DJ Zinhle play,” she said. “I’d always loved music, but never thought of deejaying. I thought I’d be a singer. I fell in love with it and taught myself how to play. “This was until I started going to Rhapsody’s in Sunnyside. I became a resident DJ.” Nokwazi was amazing! “I knew she’d do justice to the song. So I approached her. She allowed me to do things my way, which is something most vocalists don’t agree to. I was able to deliver everything the way I wanted to.” She said she’ll drop Umgqibelo, another single, in February. “The song titled Umgqibelo was supposed to be released at the end of this month, but we changed. The producer I worked with, Calvin passed on and I’m trying to respect his family. So, we’ll drop it next year,” she said.
