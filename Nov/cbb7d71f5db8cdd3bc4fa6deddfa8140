Chippa United will take on Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the Dstv Premiership match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3:30pm CAT. The Chilli Boys recorded their second defeat in their last three league matches when they succumbed to a 2-0 loss to Stellenbosch FC away last weekend. As a result, Chippa are placed 13th on the league standings with four points from four matches having registered one win this season which was against Maritzburg United. Lehlohonolo Seema, the Chippa head coach, says his youthful side will learn from their defeat to Stellenbosch. "We were not at our best. Like I have said the team is still young. They will learn. It is just that we conceded twice which was too much," Seema said. "We have to talk to the youngsters and make sure they are aware that we should not concede two goals or more. At least we have a chance if are trailing by one goal. We will fight again another day." Meanwhile, Tshakhuma registered their first-ever win in the elite league when they overcame Baroka FC 1-0 in the Limpopo Derby clash at home last weekend. The victory has taken Vhadau Vha Damani to the 10th spot on the league standings with five points from four matches including a draw against defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns. Diamond Thopola, the Tshakhuma defender, is wary of Chippa, but he is optimistic that they can secure their second successive win. "Chippa have assembled a young team which is full of energy and running. I can tell from watching their few games that they have played. They will be looking very dangerous after losing," Thopola said. "We are coming from a win over the weekend and it boosted our morale, but we shouldnâ€™t let that get into our heads. We are ready. We have been working hard at training. We should bring our A-game." -SuperSport
