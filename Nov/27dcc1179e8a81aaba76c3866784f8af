AFTER being stranded in Nigeria for more than six months, musician and actress Naledi Boltina is finally back home and spending time with her two-year-old daughter. She told Daily Sun she was surprised at how much her daughter had grown. “I’m told she knows the lyrics to my song and I’ve even witnessed her singing it. It feels really good to be home and be with family,” she said. “I’m currently in the Eastern Cape with my parents, who’ve been looking after my daughter while I was away.” ALSO READ: SENZO'S DAUGHTER BLESSED BY RED ANTS! Naledi said she will return to Nigeria at the end of the month to shoot her reality show, Celebrity Build. “I’m going back to shoot the reality show of which I’m part of it. I should be there until February because that’s when the show will wrap up,” said Naledi. The People’s Paper previously reported that she was stuck in Nigeria and couldn’t return as international travel was banned due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But following President Cyril Ramaposa’s announcement last night that international travel will soon be permitted, Naledi can travel at her leisure.
