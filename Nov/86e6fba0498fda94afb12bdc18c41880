FORMER International Boxing Organisation welterweight champion Thulani "Tulz Evolution" Mbenge says he needs one more fight to sharpen up before he moves onto the world stage. Mbenge came out of 14 months inactivity to register a unanimous points victory against Congolese opponent Katembo Kuvesa and annexed the African Boxing Union (ABU) welterweight crown last month. The 29-year-old boxer from Mdantsane is back to winning ways after he tasted his first defeat in Germany in July 2019. Mbenge surrendered his IBO welterweight crown to Sebastian Formella with a controversial points defeat. Talking of his comeback victory Mbenge said he is excited to have won on points as most of his victories were won via the short route.“I'm happy with the points victory (over Kuvesa) because I was able to show the other side of my boxing. It has been 14 months without a fight, I needed to go the distance. We came prepared, I have been inactive for quite some time so I need rounds, coming to the fight I knew I had to box," said Mbenge.Before the coronavirus outbreak there were talks that the former SA titleholder will fight in  American. According to the reigning Boxing South Africa (BSA) Male Fighter of the Year those plans are still in the pipeline. However, the talented boxer wants one more local contest to sharpen his boxing skills before going to the US.“Plans of fighting in America are on but the only worry is the lockdown travel restrictions because one cannot travel abroad. They want me there and love my style and definitely, this is something my team and I are looking forward to," he said.
