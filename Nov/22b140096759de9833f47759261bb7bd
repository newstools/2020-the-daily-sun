 “Middendorp is set to join Maritzburg United and the move will be done in the next coming days,” said the insider. In the meantime, Maritzburg have appointed Delron Buckley as caretaker coach, and the former Bafana Bafana and Maritzburg midfielder will be in charge when the Team of Choice, rooted at the bottom of the DStv Premiership table, host SuperSport United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. Middendorp will be joining the Midlands club for the fourth time in his coaching career. He coached the club from November 2009 until March 2011. The other stint was from January 2012 until October 2013. His last was from December 2015 before resigning in November 2016. However, he’ll forever be remembered for saving the club in that season of the 2015-16 campaign. Maritzburg, faced with relegation then going to the last two games of the season, won those two matches against Ajax Cape Town and Jomo Cosmos. Former striker Evans Rusike scored twice against Ezenkosi to see the KZN club retains its DStv Premiership status in which led to tears of joy from chairman Farook Kadodia after the final whistle. Following those efforts, Middendorp was given the two-year deal by the club before the 2016-17 season got underway. However, he had in fighting with referees as well as PSL acting CEO Mato Madlala. It was then Maritzburg management decided to part ways. But players such as Lebohang Maboe (signed from Mbombela United), Siphesihle Ndlovu (from the club development) benefited a lot under him as were given him opportunities before they were sold to Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates respectively.
