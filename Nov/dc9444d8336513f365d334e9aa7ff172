Donald Trump is the worst president the US has ever had. Trump lacks diplomacy, wit and charm. He’s also arrogant, rude and egotistical. Worse, he has no respect for women. How did Americans elect such a leader? He also presided over a poor economy and believed Covid-19 (which he called “China virus”) was a hoax. Recently, the US held its presidential elections. Trump was up against Joe Biden, who won. Trump thought he had a natural right to power. At the back of his mind, it was a forgone conclusion that he was going to be re-elected as the country’s president. But it was not to be. South African voters can learn something from Americans: that they don’t have to vote on the basis of sentiment. If a political party no longer serves them, they should vote it out.
