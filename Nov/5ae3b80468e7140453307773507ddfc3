A 17-YEAR-OLD mum and her boyfriend (30) appeared separately in the Protea Magistrates Court, Soweto, on Wednesday, 25 November, for murder, rape and child abuse. This after a two-year-old baby succumbed to her injuries at the Chris Baragwanath Hospital on Thursday, 19 November.   She was allegedly raped and assaulted in Diepkloof, Soweto. The gogo of the murdered girl said she was struggling to come to terms with the death of her granddaughter. She wants justice for her grandchild, even if it means the mum serves jail time. She blamed herself for not babysitting the toddler on the day of the incident, on Sunday, 15 November. She told the People’s Paper she was bathing her grandchild last month, when she noticed a bruise.  “The child indicated it was her mum’s boyfriend, but my daughter denied it,” said the gogo. The mum is said to be secretive, so the gogo said she wouldn’t know if she was in an abusive relationship or not. “She was always happy. Her boyfriend never disrespected her. Now that this has happened, I don’t know what to think.” The gogo is frustrated that her teenage daughter is pregnant with her third child and is still in Grade 8. “She was 15 and in primary school and I could tell she was sexually active. “I told her to go for family planning, but she denied being in a relationship. I discovered that the father of her first child is almost my age.” After the baby had died, the mum took her to the police and told them she had woken up in the middle of the night to check on the child and found her with serious facial injuries. The medical examination found that the child had been penetrated. The doctor called the police. Magistrate Audrey Mpofu said the accused was facing very serious charges. “Rape of a minor child carries a prescribed minimum sentence of life, murder with aggravating circumstances. “While child abuse carries a minimum sentence of 10 years in jail,” said Mpofu. The case will return to court on 2 December.
