AMERICAN singer, rapper, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams has let the masses in on his skincare routine, which keeps him looking youthful. The 47-year-old rapper always has people asking how he manages to look the same as he did when he first started his career. Pharrell launched his own skincare line, Humanrace, on Wednesday, 25 November and revealed the secret to his youthful looks. He started paying attention to his skin when he first met dermatologist Elena Jones. Speaking to Vogue, Pharrell said he wanted to understand more and learn about skin health. “The first thing was, just taking a shower is for your body, right? But your face, that’s the thing people communicate with and your face is only as good as the energy that comes from behind it. “And that’s just understanding that your face is different. You gotta take care of your face,” he told Vogue. “Everybody’s got a different routine and everybody’s got different processes and methods. “For me it was always, ‘OK, you’re gonna need a good cleanser. You’re gonna need a good exfoliator, and in my case, you’re gonna need our awesome humidifying creme. “But the number one thing for me is routine. So that’s what we’re giving people, a routine for maintenance. Like, take care of your skin,” he said.
