THE 32-year-old man caught in the middle of a deadly love triangle has spoken out for the first time this week. He’s pleaded for forgiveness from his lovers’ families. Now that his nyatsi (21) is dead and his pregnant fiancee (35) has been charged with her murder, he’s decided to break his silence. The lovers were caught in the act by the man’s pregnant fiancee inside a church in Tshepiso in Sharpeville, south of Joburg. The nyatsi was stabbed to death, the fiancee was arrested and the two-timing cheater was hospitalised for several days with serious stab wounds. Following his release from hospital, the man spoke to Daily Sun from his home in Sharpeville. Still clearly in pain, he said he’d learnt his lesson and would never again be involved with more than one woman at a time. “I was in a relationship with both the women. The deceased was my lover of four months. I dated my girlfriend for three years before we became engaged. She’s pregnant with our child,” he said.  The dead lover leaves a six-year-old kid behind. He apologised to the two families and asked the nyatsi’s mum for forgiveness. “Two-timing your partner isn’t a smart thing to do. It’s dangerous,” he said. Looking miserable, he said the nyatsi’s family had high hopes for her. “Because of my actions, their dreams won’t come true,” he said. “I’m truly sorry about what I did to the family, especially her mum.” He also apologised to his fiancee’s family.  “If it wasn’t for me, their daughter would still be with them and not facing the problems she has now,” he said. The man’s advice to young men? Cheating does NOT pay! “People you care about end up dead,” he said. “Stay loyal to your partner. When you do jolling business like I did, you’ll end up in a situation similar to mine.” Constable Busisiwe Sango said the suspect was out on bail and expected in court later this month.
