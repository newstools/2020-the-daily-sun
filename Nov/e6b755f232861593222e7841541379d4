THE Gauteng community safety department on Saturday, 21 November visited families that lost loved ones to gender-based violencer. Acting department head Sipho Thanjekwayo visited two families in Sebokeng zone 7 in the Vaal. Among the families was Keneilwe Pule’s. The 27-year-old’s body was found chopped up with a grinder and burned after she was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend. Family spokeswoman Nono Pule Ramathe said:d: they were called to the scene by a neighbour saying the house Keneilwe shared with her boyfriend was on fire. “We found her badly burnt body and realised she’d been stabbed and one of her ears was missing.” There was blood all over the house! “We are disturbed. What hurt us the most was that this man burnt the house because he wanted to hide the evidence of what he did to our child.” The suspect was arrested and the family said police were updating them on the case. The second family was Kedibone Mosime’s. The 39-year-old was shot outside her mum’s home in zone 7 by her husband. He fled the scene, leaving behind a bottle filled with petrol, and shot himself with his gun at his home in Graceland. Kedibone’s cousin Diphaphang Tsoane told the story to a shocked Thanjekwayo, who said they were visiting the Evaton area because it had a very high number of incidents of gender-based violence. He said the department had a number of programmes to address the problem. “What we are doing today is part of one of the programmes. We are encouraging the cops to take these cases very seriously and to update the families of victims,” he said. Bhekizizwe Kubheka of Man as Safety Promoters said his organisation went to various areas to teach men about gender-based violence. Act Now’s Carol Lerole said: “Women shouldn’t keep quiet about abuse.”
