THE time has come for the class of 2020 to write their final matric exams. With grade 12s having had a challenging year due to Covid-19 lockdown, anxiety and panic has kicked in. On Thursday, matrics will write their first English paper.   Speaking to Daily Sun, matrics said the year had been stressful. Sandy Ntsanwisi (18) said: “I was looking forward to my matric year, but the experience was hectic. I had to adapt to online learning, which wasn’t easy at first as my marks dropped. I’m very fearful, but I’m trying my best to stay positive. I wanted to enrol for law, but I’m doubtful if I’ll qualify.” Tshepang Mazibuko (19) said: “The first term was amazing and I enjoyed school. But now I’m filled with fear. But I’ve been studying a lot because I want to be a teacher one day.” Reatlegeli Sefekedi (18) said: “I was looking forward to my matric year and having a matric dance, but it didn’t go as expected. ” Mpumelelo Mola (18) said she wasn’t confident about Afrikaans and life science. “The most challenging part of schooling this year was self discipline as we spent most of the year studying at home. I wanted to enrol for journalism, but Covid-19 has taught me not all jobs are secure, so I will study teaching.” A teacher said: “Some pupils perform better under the supervision of teachers. It wasn’t an easy year for us as teachers either. ” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has wished the matrics well. “Despite having the odds stacked against them, our learners are determined to present for this exam the pinnacle of their schooling,” he said.
