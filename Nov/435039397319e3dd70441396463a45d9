DJ Dansanie (37) has landed another big gig. He’s been chosen to do the SABC1 Summer Campaign song again. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said he was given a second chance in the competition. “This is because the first round was cancelled. When the second round was opened, I asked to enter the competition again,” said DJ Dansanie. “At the time I’d lost hope, but I decided not to give up. Fortunately, they allowed me to re-enter the competition, and that’s when I got selected. “We were then given the title of the song,  We Move Nomanini. They gave us the lyrics, but I decided to change them to suit my sound. ALSO READ: MEYIWAS GET TOMBSTONES AND COWS! According to DJ Dansanie, the song will be played across all SABC radio stations. “I also believe we shall be doing a music video for SABC TV. He said this is one the biggest gigs in his music career. “I’m excited to get this opportunity, mainly because this is the third time I’m selected for the same campaign. To me this means they like my work.” His next goal is to produce for more international artists. “From a very young age I’ve always loved music. A handful of artists such as Msawawa, Mandoza and Zola 7 inspired me. Fortunately, I managed to work with some of them. “But my biggest highlight was producing Love Me by Lil Wayne featuring Drake. That opportunity opened a number of doors for me. I received multiple radio interviews from abroad. “As it is I’m currently producing for another international artist, but I can’t disclose his name for now.”
