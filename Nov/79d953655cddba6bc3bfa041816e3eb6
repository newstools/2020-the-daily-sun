SOUL Brothers’ only remaining member, Moses Ngwenya, was honoured with an honorary doctorate in philosophy by Unisa in Tshwane on Friday, 13 November. Moses said he wished the other members, David Masondo, Thuza Mthethwa, Zenzele Mchunu and American Zulu were still alive to witness this special day. He said: “I’m happy to be honoured. This is a great moment. “I thank all my fans for such an occasion. It would have been nice if all our members were around and this would have been a big ceremony for the group.” Moses said he finished school in grade 8 and didn’t have any tertiary qualifications. “This is my first time setting foot in Unisa and it’s like my first day at school,” he said. He said Soul Brothers built families and united people. He said he was ready to research more about mbaqanga if the opportunity arose. Musical legend Steve Kekana, who also received a doctorate in philosophy, said he has always wished to be a Unisa graduate. Hosi Lwandlamuni Nwamitwa II and Dr Motsoko Pheko, both received honorary degrees of Doctor of Laws. Unisa Vice-Chancellor Professor Mandla Makhanya said: “We are recognising people who impacted society. These are extraordinary individuals who were honoured by the university.”
