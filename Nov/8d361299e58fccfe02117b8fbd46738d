SAMKELO Dlamini’s family is shattered by his tragic death after a concrete wall fell on the seven-year-old and his friend while they were playing at an outside toilet on Saturday, 7 November. Samkelo died, while his friend Samkele Mvelase (7) was injured. Samkelo’s madala Leonard Mkhize (62) from Ezimangweni in Inanda, north of Durban, told Daily Sun the toilet was built in 2005. “The toilets were built before the RDPs were even built in our area. But on this site, no RDP was built until the site owner decided to leave. “The toilet was left like that next to a site with no house. We don’t know where the owner of the site went to,” he said. He said kids in the area normally played at the site. “The toilet started to get very old and was on the verge of collapsing. “Tragically, one of the toilet’s bricks fell, which led to the concrete falling onto the children,” he said. Madala Leonard said they were called by a neighbour who heard the kids screaming. “It was such an awful feeling to see the children lying under the concrete. We removed it and rushed Samkelo to a nearby clinic as he was seriously injured on his head. But he died upon arrival at the clinic.”  He said Samkelo was rushed to hospital, as he was injured on his leg. “This incident has left the entire family shattered. We wish Samkelo didn’t play near this old toilet,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that Inanda cops have opened an inquest docket. Gwala said a boy (7) was allegedly playing with other kids at Ezimangweni when the wall of the toilet fell on him. “He was taken to a local clinic, where he died,” said Gwala.
