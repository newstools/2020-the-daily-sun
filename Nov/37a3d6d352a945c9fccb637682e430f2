THE five suspects arrested in connection with the death of Prince Lethukuthula Zulu, the son of King Goodwill Zwelithini, appeared in court on Monday, 23 November. Tshefogatso Moremane (30), Margaret Koaile (42), Portia Mmola (28), Gontse Tlhoele (30) and Dakalo Mbedzi (32) appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court facing murder and theft charges. According to the state, the suspects are believed to be part of a syndicate that has been going around drugging and stealing from people for the past three years in areas such as Benoni and Tshwane. Among the items the accused allegedly stole were microwaves, TVs and R80 000 in cash. The state’s Yusuf Baba said the accused allegedly drugged the victim, which led to his death. “The state will be opposing bail,” he said. The case has been postponed to 30 November for further investigation and legal aid confirmation. The suspects were arrested in Tshwane on Friday. The prince’s body was found by security guards at his residence at Graceland Residential Complex in Northwold, Joburg, two weeks ago. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said one of the suspects was found in possession of different substances and these were seized for further investigation to test the possibility of the dead man and his business partner having been drugged. “Several suspected stolen items were seized at the residences of the suspects.” Daily Sun previously reported that police found there were signs of a struggle in the apartment. They said they also found broken alcohol bottles and two used condoms at the scene. The prince’s friend was found passed out by the complex’s security guards. This after neighbours alerted the guards of a broken window and reported hearing shouting and loud noises that came from the prince’s apartment.
