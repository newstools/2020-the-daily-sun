THEY stood on the frontline during the pandemic, despite constant criticism. On Thursday 26 November, nurses from various regions, were honoured with a day of prayer at the Grace Bible Church in Pimville, Soweto. Lindiwe Muhaduba, who was named Nurse of the Year, told Daily Sun: “This year was difficult for nurses and midwives. “When the state of disaster was declared and everyone was locked down at home, they became unsung heroes, who risked their lives.”  She said the day was an opportunity for nurses to reflect on their hard work. “Above all else, it was to honour those who lost their lives in the line of duty after contracting the virus.” University of Joburg midwifery lecturer Sanele Lukhele said the prayer day helped relieve pressure on nurses. “I can’t take too much credit as I wasn’t on the frontline, but my students suffered as they couldn’t do their practicals. The academic year needs to be extended to help them catch up.”  Acting Gauteng Health Department head Lesiba Motana said the day celebrated all the province’s nurses. “Mothers and fathers lost their lives working to save patients. Their deaths didn’t happen in vain.”
