CHAOS and commotion erupted on the streets of Brackenfell after police barred the EFF from marching to Brackenfell High School on Friday, 20 November. The EFF wanted to hand over a memorandum to the principal of the school but cops blocked them about one kilometre away from the school. EFF secretary-general Marshal Dlamini did not have any kind words for the cops after they blocked them. He said it was pointless for them to hand over the memorandum away from the school. Dlamini’s address did not end well after the EFF moered a man who was shouting at Dlamini while he was on stage. Cops had to disperse the group with stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Angry protesters set bins from the sides of the roads on fire as they were chased away. Together with Vuyani Pambo, Dlamini tried to negotiate but cops did not budge. While addressing over 1 000 EFF supporters who had come out on the streets, Dlamini said cops are used to protecting racists. “If the SAPS chose the side of the racists every time we are in a confrontation, we must tell them they are no longer SAPS but boys and girls who are the securities of racists. “They think we are scared of them, there is nothing they can do to us they have not done to Andre Tetane, there is nothing they can do to us that they have not done to our brothers in Marikana. We are not scared of them,” said Dlamini. Pambo said all they want to do is “put racism in its place” and they did just that. EFF chairwoman Veronica Mente said: “We are in a revolution, we are going to expropriate the land without compensation.” EFF provincial chairman Melikhaya Xego said there are more schools that are still very racist and they are going to deal with them one by one.
