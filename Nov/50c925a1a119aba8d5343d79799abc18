PRODUCER and DJ, Ganyani, wants justice after his music studio was broken into on Monday, 23 November. The evil thugs damaged property worth R27 000 and stole equipment worth R99 000. They entered his home through the roof and disabled a motion sensor. He said: “They switched off the main switch, removed roof tiles, and the ceiling caved in. “They also hid three items in the ceiling, indicating they were planning on coming back.” Ganyani said thanks to social media, he recovered most of his belongings. “I took a video and shared it on all my social media platforms,” he said.

When he came back he saw us and ran away, but we caught him. He denied it but eventually confessed.” They recovered most of his belongings, even those that had been sold.  “We didn’t find my wireless keyboard, CD player and graphic equaliser. The suspect fingered three accomplices. “Two were freed because the other two claimed they didn’t do anything. I want the boys to be taught a lesson.” Captain Kay Makhubele said cops bust suspects aged 19 and 20 for housebreaking and possession of stolen property. “They allegedly broke into a house in Meadowlands zone 6 and stole electrical appliances.” They were expected to appear in court on Wednesday, 25 November.
