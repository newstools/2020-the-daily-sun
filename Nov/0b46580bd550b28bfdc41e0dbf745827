SIBUSISO Vilakazi will be spotting a new jersey number when he returns to the field. In a tribute to the late American basketball icon, Kobe Bryant, the Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder will swap his jersey No 11 for 24. The sports world mourned the sudden passing of Bryant in May, and the memories are vivid for Vilakazi. “I wanted to change before end of the season and for me, it was to honour my idol, Kobe Bryant. He passed away and I felt like I should use his number and relieve his memories,” said Vilakazi. “Even though he did everything on the Basketball court, I want to replicate that on the soccer field. He was my inspiration.“I remember when he passed on. I almost broke down in tears as he was someone I looked up to and it felt like I had lost someone close to me. He has had an impact in my sporting career as I could relate to some of the things, he went through like being injured and winning championships and that has also happened to me. You know having an injury and coming back as if nothing happened.” Vilakazi has had battles with injuries. He is currently recovering from an injury he picked up last season and he is yet to feature for the Brazilians this season. “The recovery is going well. In football, you do not have time as you are playing at a high level and there are quality players who are ready to fill the space. The space is small because of the players that are around. We tend to think we have time whereas we do not. These days when you get injured you must work harder to get back into the team.” An emotional @ValdezIsComin24 sits and explains why he’ll wear 2??4?? this season.?? https://t.co/vbx9DDzVVm#Sundowns pic.twitter.com/a8h0jDk3wQ
