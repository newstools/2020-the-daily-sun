MATRICS wrote their last isiZulu paper on Thursday, 26 November. According to pupils in Soshanguve, Tshwane, the exam was just OK. Lindokuhle Manana (18), from Hlanganani Secondary School, said she was aiming for a B. But after the exam, she thought she was more likely to get a D. She said she had some challenges. “I struggled to understand the questions, but did well enough to pass,” she said. Sthembiso Nkosi (18) from Rhulani Junior Secondary School said she wrote well. She said most of the material she studied was in the paper. “I prepared hard and it paid off. I hope to get an A,” she said. Her classmate Phindile Mkhize (19) also said she wrote well. She said this was because she studied hard. “I’m not sure what percentage I’ll get but I’m certain I’ll do well,” she said.
