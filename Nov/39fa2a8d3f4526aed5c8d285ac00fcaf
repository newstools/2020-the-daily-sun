THE Soulful Sundowners musical concert is back with a bang. This year, the much anticipated show has a fresh new line-up of top South African musicians and DJs. According to the event organisers, attendees are guaranteed a weekend of fun and entertainment for the whole family. The Van der Stel Sports Club in Stellenbosch will be transformed to accommodate an outdoor live music festival like no other this summer. Performing at the fun-packed event will be: The Black Ties, Chad Saaiman & Kerwin, Jesmone, Jarrad Ricketts, August West, Spinksie “Sparkel” (from Maak My Famous fame), Janice, DJ Mickz and Tye Platinum. CEO of LRI Productions Lyle Ryan told Daily Sun he hopes the music festival becomes an annual phenomenon with Cape Town audiences. “This is our second year hosting such a high-calibre music festival and we hope it resonates with Capetonians as the go-to summer festival each year. It’s a perfect way to spend time with the family while celebrating some of SA’s top local musicians in action on stage.” One of the performers, Janice, said she’s excited to perform at the festival. “After hearing the line-up for Soulful Sundowners, I couldn’t resist the offer. These are some of my favourite local artists in SA.” Musician and songwriter Chad Saaiman said he’s excited about the event too. “Fans can expect some happy vibes and some of my most familiar tunes to sing along to. This year has been something else, so let’s end it in a celebratory fashion.” Ryan said the event will cater to the entire family. There will be various food trucks, family activities, and picnic spots on offer. “We want the entire family to spend the day with us in Stellies, so we are going to ensure that each person is catered to, so that they walk away with the best festival experience Cape Town has to offer right now.”
