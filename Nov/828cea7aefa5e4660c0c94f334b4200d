ALTHOUGH the school year has been rough on matrics, most pupils said Tuesday’s exam went smoothly. But pupils at Hammanskraal High School in Mandela Village, Tshwane, told Daily Sun English paper two was tricky. Teboho Hlangweni (18) said she struggled as they didn’t get enough support to prepare. “Last year, there were holiday study camps. But it didn’t happen this year because of the pandemic,” she said. Teboho is confident she’ll pass, but doesn’t think she’ll do well. Neo Sithole (19) said writing while wearing a mask was uncomfortable. “We didn’t prepare enough, but doing our best to pass,” she said. Her advice to fellow pupils: study hard and not wait for teachers to help you. “Start a study group and use previous papers for revision,” said Neo. Pupils at Nyamazane High School in the Ludlow area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said the paper went well. They said they were confident they would do well. Meanwhile, pupils at Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in North West, said the paper was easy. The exam had six questions that focused on poetry, drama and literature. They had to choose two questions for 70 marks. Kagiso Modimoeng (19) from Rauwane Sepeng High School said he was expecting to pass with 50%. He said it was easy to study as he was not distracted. “The drama essay was easy because I love drama. The short story section was also not so bad,” he said. Tshireletso Moreki (18) form HF Tlou High is expecting an 80% pass.
