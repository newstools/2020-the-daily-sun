Public hospitals are in a shambles due to a lack of accountability. People don’t do their jobs and there’s no consequence management. Chaotic planning puts patients lives at risk. Conditions in the public health sector have deteriorated to near collapse. Collapsing infrastructure, staff shortages and a lack of beds are common problems. Some of the hospital lack resources such as bedding, poor ventilation in the casualty ward and a shortage of staff. People aren’t happy and we can hardly blame them. They’re at their most vulnerable about the deteriorating health system. Government must prioritise healthcare and refurbishing healthcare facilities, some of which are in shambles. We need to unite, put our collective foot down and make those who are truly responsible accountable.
