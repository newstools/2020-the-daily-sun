Many South Africans buy things they don’t need on credit and end up drowning in debt. Businesses, in a bid to maximise profits, are always looking for new ways to lure consumers. Black Friday is one event where people buy things which they don’t need. It’s not financially wise to go shopping simply because it’s Black Friday. Some people go shopping on the day to show friends and neighbours that they’re moving with the times. We need to change that mind-set and stop living beyond our means. To improve your financial situation, draw up a budget and live within your means. That’s the best way to beat the debt trap. Some people save money for a few years and buy with cash. Those who buy something because a neighbour has it often buy on credit and find themselves drowning in debt. Remember, buying on credit means you pay double the price. People who earn meagre salaries must draw up a budget, so as to be debt free. Don’t go shopping just because it’s Black Friday. Let those who saved enough go on shopping sprees. You, on the other hand, need to save the little money you have for when you need it most. This year has been difficult financially for everyone. Therefore, we need to be smart with our money.
