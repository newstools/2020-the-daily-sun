FORMER Transnet group treasurer Phetolo Ramosebudi was shown a number of invoices at the Zondo Commission Thursday. Ramosebudi answered all money-related questions in the same way: “With your permission, chairman. “May I not respond to this question in case I incriminate myself.” Ramosebudi received over R5 million for helping Gupta-linked advisory firm Regiments Capital to get confidential information from state-owned entities. Previously, Ramosebudi was group treasurer at the Airports Company South Africa and SAA. According to evidence before commission chairman, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, Romosebudi issued invoices for a total of R9 132 490 to Regiments and received a total payment of R5 173 000 from the company. Earlier, Zondo scolded Ramosebudi for not complying with his instructions to provide the commission with a full affidavit or statement. Ramosebudi was asked about his recollections relating to emails between himself and Regiments director, Eric Wood. But he told the commission although he wanted to assist the commission, unfortunately there were things that he couldn’t help with.
