KAIZER Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt can begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Amakhosi finally scored their first goals from open play in their fourth DStv Premiership game in their 2-2 draw with Golden Arrows at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. Both goals were scored by their Colombian striker Leonardo Castro. Chiefs only other league goal was in their 1-0 win over Chippa United which was an own goal by Gregory Damons. Hunt said Castro could have added to his tally. “He worked hard and he could have had five. I mean two, three chances in the first half and I’m talking about good chances, much easier to the ones he scored, but I’m happy for him.” But Hunt was not pleased with the result.“From where we had been leading 2-1 to where we are right now getting a draw I’m disappointed. We expect more from the players. Now we need to move on to the next game against Swallows ( tomorrow 7.30pm).” Hunt gave another youngster Darren Matsheke his debut against Arrows when he replaced Nkosingiphile Ngcobo in the 82nd minute. Hunt will be forced to blood more youngsters after Amakhosi lost their appeal against their two transfer widows transfer ban by Fifa. Hunt confirmed youngsters will play more often as games are coming thick and fast. On Thursday, Chiefs head to Cameroon to face Elite One Championship winners Bamenda in the Caf Champions League preliminary round on Sunday. “Darren’s got legs and that is what we need in the team, he’s determined,” said Hunt.
