COMMUNITY Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko has vowed that criminals hiding behind law enforcement uniforms will be arrested. Mazibuko said the thugs within law enforcement were making it hard for police to execute operations as many of them yielded undesired results. The MEC was speaking at the launch of the Safe Festive Season campaign on Friday, 20 November in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. “Premier David Makhura declared this a decade to end corruption. Several law enforcement officers have been arrested and charged with various crimes and corruption. It is a shame to say criminals nowadays hide in law enforcement uniforms. We plan crime combating operations in their midst and they share that information with their partners in crime. We can not continue in this fashion because we will be wasting state resources,” she said. Mazibuko said they were sending a stern warning to all law enforcement officers, who take bribes, that their days were numbered. “They will soon wear orange overalls. They will go and join those they have previously arrested,” she said. The festive season is around the corner and criminals are ready to prey on unsuspecting people in the malls. Mazibuko said law enforcement officers would be sent to the malls.
