SEVEN people have been wounded at Cape Town Taxi Rank on Monday, 23 November after gunmen shot at a group of people. Six men and a woman were rushed to hospital after the shooting. Cops managed to apprehend one of the suspected gunmen when he was running from the scene. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said they were not ruling out that the incident could be related to taxi violence. “Crime experts and detectives are combing three scenes in Marine Drive, Strand and Buitenkant streets for clues in Cape Town following a shooting incident that left six men and one female wounded. “According to information, unidentified suspects shot and wounded people at the station deck before fleeing in various directions while still discharging shots. Traffic official apprehended one suspect aged 31, and confiscated a firearm,” said Rwexana. “Cases of attempted murder are under investigation. The suspect will appear in court once he has been charged. The possibility that the incident is related to the taxi industry is not ruled out,” she said. Jean Lungomba, a barber from Congo who works at the taxi rank, said they were shocked to hear several gunshots. “I had to hide inside and lock the door because the were several gunshots. I thought maybe these people even came to me so I did not want to die, so I locked my door,” he said. The Western Cape Government Health’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokeswoman, Deanna Bessick, confirmed the incident. She said ambulances responded to a shooting incident at noon on Monday, 23 November. “The incident involved six male patients and one female patient. The patients were found at Old Marine Drive – the long-distance bus terminals and on the taxi rank deck. EMS transported four patients to nearby hospitals. The rest of the patients were transported by ER24. The patients sustained chest, shoulder and head injuries. Fortunately, there were no fatalities at the scene,” said Bessick.
