One would have expected lockdown hardships to teach us about saving a portion of our income for rainy days. But since the alcohol sales were allowed until midnight, young people have returned to drinking like there’s no tomorrow. The youth continue to waste money at taverns or clubs instead of saving a portion of it. While studying, they have good dreams. But after finding good-paying jobs they fail to invest in their future and that of their children. What’s even worse is that some young men would rather buy booze for friends than to support their kids. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE MEN WITH THE BIGGEST 4-5s? They work so hard to earn good salaries, only to drink it away. It’s like taking a step backward. To achieve a brighter future, you need to start investing the moment you start working. You should learn from those who are already in the field of work. It’s wise to invest in the future while you’re still in your 20s before you’re burdened with financial responsibilities that come with maturity. Friends who go on drinking sprees with you should not make you buy booze alone. Friends who accompany you only on pay day are a bad influence. There’s no dignity in buying and drinking lots of booze. Buy enough alcohol only for your own responsible consumption. Don’t waste money on booze! Letter by MA Ledubuk
