BAFANA Bafana defender Sifiso Hlanti has joined Swallows FC for the 2020-21 PSL season, the club have confirmed. The former Bidvest Wits star had been training with Kaizer Chiefs for the past few months. Amakhosi, however, could not register the 30-year-old due to their transfer ban imposed by world football governing body Fifa. The Soweto giants had kept Hlanti at Naturena hoping they would be successful in their appeal through the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). They learnt their fate last week when CAS dismissed their appeal. Amakhosi's loss was the Dube Birds' gain as they moved quickly to secure Hlanti's services. ?? welcome to the Birds Nest Hlanthi @Moroka_Swallows?????? pic.twitter.com/HV2PjS2Vo1
