VETERAN winger, Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala, is likely to feature when AmaZulu host Black Leopards in a DStv Premiership clash at Jonsson Kings Park Stadium tonight (7.30pm). According to Usuthu coach Ayanda Dlamini, Shabba faces a late fitness test as he looks to get his football career back on track after more than 14 months on the sidelines. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana midfield star joined Usuthu last month. Shabba, who won eight trophies in his 11-year career with Chiefs, last kicked a ball in an official match for Turkish side BB Erzurumspor in May last year. Since he joined AmaZulu, the 36-year-old has missed the first two games of the new season, a 1-1 draw against Orlando Pirates on 24 October and 1-0 loss to TS Galaxy last Wednesday. “Shabba is undergoing a late fitness test and I’ll hear from the medical team if he’s available,” said Dlamini. He also confirmed defender Mario Booysen is sick and didn’t train on Monday, and he also faces a late fitness test. The Usuthu coach is already minus injured right backs Thembela Sikhakhane and Mbongeni Gumede. They join Bongi Ntuli and Siphesihle Maduna, who are nursing long-term injuries. Dlamini admitted the absence of Sikhakhane and Gumede is being felt because he doesn’t have another right back in his squad. “It is difficult because we don’t have anyone for the right back position at the moment, but we’ll have to see what we can do in that position,” said Dlamini. Despite injury problems, Dlamini revealed that it is important that they pick up points at home against Leopards so that they can meet this season’s target of top four finish, which was mandated by new chairman Sandile Zungu. “We have to make sure that when we play at home we dominate teams,” said Dlamini. “We can’t allow teams to come here and take points away from us. “It is important that everyone understands that because we fight together as a team.”
