GOSPEL artist Butho Vuthela wants to preach in nightclubs. He was reacting to a video of people who seem drunk and singing to his songs. The crowd was clearly having a good time while enjoying their drinks. Butho shared the video and wrote: “Ndithini ke ukungayocula in the clubs?” Mpumza Sisusa wrote: “Alcohol is so nice when you’re listening to gospel music, so much that you can easily repent. The gates of heaven become a reality and you can even see Maria and Joseph.” Ta Zain Sikiti encouraged him and said: “Go there my man. They’re drunk and they’ll easily repent.”  Mahlub’andile Bhut Hlubi Mehlomakhulu said he would join him. He wrote: “I’d be glad if we can go and preach there because these are the kind of people we need.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Butho said: “I am touched by the love and support I am getting from my supporters, especially the ones who go to clubs. Even when I am nominated for awards, their support outnumber the people who are churchgoers. They phone me and book me for their small and big events. When I take the stage they always sing along and dance with me. They never complain about my fees.” He said these were the people who influence event organisers to book him. “As a result you’d always see me among the DJs at different events. When they are travelling long distances or have family gatherings, they always play my music. I feel so special to them,” said Butho.
