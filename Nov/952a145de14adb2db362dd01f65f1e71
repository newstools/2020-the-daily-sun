TEACHING and learning has been disrupted at Daniye Primary
School outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Monday. This is because angry residents of Merry Pebble Stream
Village are demanding that Education MEC Bonakele Majuba should come and
address their concerns after there were promises of a new school eight years
ago. Residents’ leader Ronald Phoku (68) told Daily Sun that
before the schools closed last month, they submitted a memorandum to the office
of MEC hoping to get a response before today. But nothing happened. “As residents and parents, we’re tired of the empty promises
and we took a decision that the school should remain closed until the MEC comes
to address.” Our children can’t be learning in such a bad. It’s not safe
for our kids because might collapse on them at any time,” said Ronald. “The school was built 53 years ago and a soccer team from
this school once represented the country in football, but there hasn’t been any
development year. Since 2012, we have been pleading with the education
department to fix the school. They promised to build us a new school in 2013,
but nothing happened. They only delivered mobile classes in 2014 and that is
not enough. “This school is surrounded by bushes and there’s a river
nearby were snakes can attacked the pupil, so we are pleading with the MEC to
help us.” Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the
department is asking the parents to allow teaching and learning to resume while
their concerns are being addressed. “A team from infrastructure directorate has been sent to
make an assessment of the state of the school and to advise the parents through
their school governing body on the course of action to be undertaken in to
improve the conditions of the school,” said Zwane
