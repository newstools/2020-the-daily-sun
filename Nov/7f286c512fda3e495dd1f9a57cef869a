O kae Molao operations closed down 18 illegal liquor outlets this week in preparation for the festive season. He said the liquor outlets were shut down throughout the province with the most in the west of Joburg, including Zandspruit, Honeydew and Cosmo City. SAPS spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele explained that as per tradition the operations led by the SAPS were supported by the office of the MEC for Community Safety, the Department of Home Affairs, Gauteng Traffic Police, Joburg Metro Police, private security, brand ambassadors, and other stakeholders such as the local community policing forum. He said over 748 wanted suspects were traced and arrested by detectives across the province. “Detectives in Sedibeng arrested 76 suspects for various serious and violent crimes as well as vehicle related crimes. In the West Rand, 27 were secured for different offences including possession of dagga, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, sexual assault, rape and attempted murder,” said Makhubele. He said police in Ekurhuleni District arrested 235 wanted suspects, while police in Tshwane took in 168 suspects. Makhubele said more than 242 suspects were arrested during the raids in Joburg. “These suspects were on the run from the law on cases of robbery, car hijacking, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, murder and rape. In the other areas of Joburg, police confiscated counterfeit goods worth an estimated value of R2 million and arrested four shop owners and nine security guards who were non-compliant with industry prescripts as verified by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, who were also part of the O Kae Molao operations,” he said. Makhubele said the arrested suspects will be appearing in various courts soon.
