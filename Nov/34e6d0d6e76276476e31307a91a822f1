ORLANDO Pirates have assured their supporters Josef Zinnbauer will be back soon to continue his work rebuilding the team. The Bucs coach barely had a moment to celebrate a 3-0 derby win over Kaizer Chiefs, as he hastily flew out of the country to attend to his son, who is in hospital in Germany. The club quickly shot down speculation that he may be going for good, explaining the German had been granted leave. “Orlando Pirates can confirm that the club has granted the head coach leave to go home to Germany,” explain the club. “The coach has requested for his family’s privacy to be respected during this difficult time. He will be back soon.” Zinnbauer said: “Please understand, it’s family that’s very, very close to me. I’m sorry about this. I hope you understand it.” The Soweto giants took a major step towards their first MTN8 final appearance in nine years when they trounced their Soweto rivals 3-0 at Orlando Stadium at the weekend. Starting in his first match this season, Thembinkosi Lorch inspired Bucs to a massive victory, scoring and creating goals. Zakhele Lepasa and Terrence Dzukamanja netted the other two to guarantee Bucs one of their biggest Soweto derby wins. Buoyed by the emphatic win, Pirates visit Bloemfontein Celtic for a league fixture on Wednesday. Whether it’ll be Fadlu Davids on Zinnbauer in the hotseat, the Buccaneers will be tipped to continue in their vein of form and chalk up their first league win.
