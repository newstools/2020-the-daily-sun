  STUDENTS, management and staff of Sefako Makgatho Health
Science University were marching against Gender Based Violence. Wearing all black they marched to the Pretoria North police
station on Friday to deliver a memorandum of demands to the station commander. They were joined by Tshwane University of Technology
students as they brought WF Nkomo Street to a halt. This after a female student was allegedly abducted by two
armed men when she had walked to a convenience store a few meters from her off
campus residence in Pretoria West on last Sunday. The students said one of their demands were more police
visibility around student accommodation. “We want more action to curb this gender-based violence that
has become a common problem in the tertiary education sector,” they said SMU spokesman, Dr Eric Pule, said it is a fact that as a
University and the country by extension, is not yet safe for our female
students and staff. “Gender-based violence remains one of society’s greatest challenges. “Harrowing statistics show that a woman is murdered every
three hours in South Africa, and the country has the world’s fourth highest
death rate due to “interpersonal violence." He said with the march, the University seeks to reinforce
President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call for all sectors of society to work together to
stop gender-based violence.  “President Ramaphosa has called for an extraordinary and
immediate response to the scourge of gender- based violence and femicide by all
members of the society. “Through this march, the University reaffirms its position
to the comprehensive response to a national crisis as part of emergency
measures to combat Gender Based Violence ‘epidemic’ he said. The memorandum was received and signed by Pretoria West
station manager, Michell Toohey. She said: “We have received the memorandum or of demands and
we are going to sit down, work together with the students and the concerned
community to find a solution to this problem.”
