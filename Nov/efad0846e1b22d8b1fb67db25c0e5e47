ONCE again, the Mmabana Mahikeng is alive to the sounds of saxophones, voices in training, percussions and drums, guitars, bass, violins and violas. Yesterday, the centre held workshops for aspiring students to practise. The centre was burnt down by angry protesters in 2018 during the fall of former premier Supra Mahumapelo. This has left many residents begging the state to renovate the centre. Music lover, Amogelang Xabanisa (26), said he’s happy that the centre is back in operation.  “I love music and when I heard it was burnt down, it felt like my dreams were shattered.” Amogelang said after matric he didn’t have money to further his studies. His only hope was to acquire skills from Mmabana. “These days, you need some qualification to get into the music industry. Getting my career started here can open doors for me as people know the centre for producing top artists such as the late HHP.” Mmabana Mahikeng re-opened its doors to artists last month. Hoping to be in full operation next year, the centre is extending an invitation to patrons and music lovers to offer music, conversation and learning. Mmabana’s regional director, Kesolofetse Mbali, said the workshops were aimed at setting the tone for the 2021 academic year. “Patrons will get insights into the music business, education and industry-related questions will be tackled by the pros,” she said. Mbali said the series will end in a jam session that will be like flagship projects such as the Jazz Foyer. “The management of the foundation, together with the staff members, have taken it upon themselves to reclaim foundation’s integrity and good standing,” she said.
