She has caused so many problems for her mother. But after running into problems, she decides to change and become a good girl.” Apart from her book, Noluthando has been writing poetry and short stories. “My love for writing started when I was 11, in 2013. At that time I wasn’t good at it due to inexperience. My writing skills only started improving in grade 9. I was writing books but wasn’t publishing them. Instead I’d give them to my friends to read for fun,” she recalled.
