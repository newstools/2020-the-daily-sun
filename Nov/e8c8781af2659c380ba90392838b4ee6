THE spike in Covid-19 cases in the Eastern Cape may be caused by outbreaks in varsities and schools. This is according to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The number of new cases in the province was 50% higher than the week before, and the increases are driven by massive spikes in Nelson Mandela Bay and Sarah Baartman district.” The president complained about students sneaking out to party, and not bothering with social distancing and wearing masks. Said Ramaphosa: “In response to rising infections, we’re implementing the resurgence plan, which was developed together with a team deployed to South Africa by the World Health Organisation.” There’d be increased contact tracing and daily community mobilisation to ensure readiness of health facilities and response to possible cluster outbreaks. The president told the People’s Paper: “We’ll be working closely with the provincial government and municipalities to ensure this surge is contained and managed.” Nelson Mandela Bay acting mayor Thsonono Buyeye confirmed that the city is a hot spot. “The rate at which the numbers are increasing is alarming,” he said. “Every citizen needs to be aware of the danger we’re facing. “Reports from private and public hospitals indicate that the city is in a serious situation. “Hospitals are full and ICU beds are a problem.”
