IT WAS a sombre moment as Bafana Bafana goalkeeper and Senzo Meyiwa’s friend Itumeleng Khune called for justice for Senzo. He was speaking at the unveiling ceremony of Meyiwa’s tombstone on Tuesday in Durban, KZN. He said: “My friendship with Senzo started a long time ago. From a young age we had big dreams. We wanted to be number one in our teams. I remember I was promoted first and he congratulated me with KFC Streetwise Two. Two months later he was promoted and I also bought him KFC to congratulate him.” Khune said they met at the age of 15. “We were very young but we were determined. We wanted to go far in our careers. We gave coaches a headache because they didn’t know who to choose between the two of us. That’s how competitive we were,” said Khune. “When he passed away he had not accomplished what we dreamt of. With those words I hope we get justice very soon,” he said.

The traditional ceremonies started on Thursday with the slaughtering of a goat to appease the ancestors. On Saturday, two cows were slaughtered to bring Senzo’s spirit back home. Comforting the family, Jordaan said: “Senzo’s father had always said he didn’t want a tombstone for his son until he knew what happened to him. Senzo’s death is an ongoing matter. Today, we’ve come to deal with the tombstone, which in this case is the final resting place of Senzo. “Today we still ask, what happened? This is because we were initially told that there was a robbery, but later people were brought to court and were presented to us as hitmen and not as robbers. “We need closure. So far we only know half of the truth and we hope that today we will get closer to the truth.”
