TOUGH-as-teak Bafana Bafana midfielder, Dean Furman, has cautioned that the job of qualifying for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is not done. Furman said talk they have one foot in the Afcon finals in Cameroon is premature and can end badly. This is the point also stressed by Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki, who wants the six points from the last two qualifiers at home to Ghana and away to Sudan next March to be assured of qualification. “Sport, especially football, can do funny things to you,” said Furman, who has now won 58 caps. “Let’s not talk about having one foot in the door. Let’s make sure we get the job done first.” The industrious workhorse tirelessly pulled off great performances in both Bafana’s recent Afcon qualifiers against Sao Tome, and was impressive. Despite Percy Tau scoring three goals in the two matches, Furman was the best player over the two games, breaking up the play and allowing either Kamohelo Mokotjo or Bongani Zungu to play their normal games. Bafana are in a good position to qualify for the Afcon finals after collecting six points from their two qualifiers against Sao Tome, while group leaders and favourites Ghana suffered a shock 1-0 defeat in Omdurman to Sudan on Tuesday, which has blown the group wide open. Bafana and the Black Stars are on nine points from four matches, with Sudan on six points, with two qualifiers to play. Both Sudan and Ghana will play minnows Sao Tome next March, who after losing back-to-back games against Bafana, are out of the running. Meanwhile, Furman said he is still attached to his former club SuperSport United and watches all their matches while back home in England. The 32-year-old left United in March after the 2019-20 PSL season was halted due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Furman has since joined Carlisle United in League Two which is the fourth tier in England.
