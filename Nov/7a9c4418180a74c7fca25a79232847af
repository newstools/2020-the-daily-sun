PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri might be living his best life in Malawi, but his Mzansi problems are far from over. There are now three warrants relating to three rape cases out for Bushiri. Bushiri said in a statement that he was not surprised. “They’re just part of the larger crusade to try and tarnish my name,” he said. Bushiri accused the Hawks of leaking the information to the media and has fingered white police officers. “These are white police officers against whom I opened extortion and corruption cases against in 2018 after they tried, unsuccessfully, to extort about R10 million from me. “They were clear and on record saying that failure to pay the R10 million would result in immediate retaliation.” He said South African authorities had not taken any steps to bring the officers to book and were covering up their crimes by launching and issuing warrants of arrests against him. He also questioned the involvement of the Hawks in the rape cases. “I’ve been advised that rape cases are not handled by the Hawks but by designated police force units.” He said he launched complaints on how Hawks were recruiting girls to fabricate charges of rape against him. “Some of these were confirmed via various videos of those who came back to confess such wrongful conduct,” he said. He said on Saturday that, as long as the officers are not recused, there’s no way he can receive a fair trial in South Africa. Bushiri said the fresh warrants confirm every detail he shared regarding the injustices he suffered before he left South Africa. Bushiri fled the country two weeks ago after he was given bail by the Pretoria Magistrates Court. He’s facing fraud and money laundering charges amounting to R102 million. Hawks spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale confirmed that three warrants were issued. “The warrants are for three separate rape charges,” said Mogale.
