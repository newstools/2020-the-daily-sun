ORLANDO Pirates have calmed the nerves of their followers after the shock departure of their coach Josef Zinnbauer on Saturday. Zinnbauer left the country immediately after throttling traditional Soweto rivals, Kaizer Chiefs 3-0, in an MTN8 Soweto derby at Orlando Stadium. Though eyebrows were raised when Zinnbauer announced his departure in a post match interview, the club swiftly came to clear the shock: "He will be back." "Following the coach's announcement that he will be leaving straight after the MTN8 semi-final first leg match against Chiefs... Pirates can confirm that the club granted the head coach leave to go home to Germany," said the club in a statement. "Unfortunately, out of respect for Mr Zinnbauer and his family we cannot divulge anything more except to say that his son is in hospital. The coach has requested for his family’s privacy to be respected during this difficult time." Pirates will be back in action next Sunday in the second leg of the MTN8 carrying an emphatic 3-0 lead. However, it's unclear whether Zinnbauer will be back for this important match, or his assistant Fadlu Davids will take over the reins in his absence. ? Zinnbauer Update??
