SENEGAL World Cup hero Papa Bouba Diop has passed away aged
42. He was reportedly suffering a long-term illness. Bouba Diop was part of the Senegal national team who reached
the quarter-finals at the 2002 World Cup. He scored the first goal of the
tournament to beat France 1-0 in one of the greatest upsets in World Cup
history. The former Senegal international, capped 63 times for his
country, played seven seasons in the Premier League and won the 2008 FA Cup
with Portsmouth, having also played for Fulham and West Ham. He cut his teeth at local club ASC Diaraf in 1996 before
going overseas for spells in Switzerland with Vevey, Neuchatel Xamax and
Grasshoppers. He moved to France to sign for Lens in 2002. He then joined AEK Athens for a brief stint, before joining
West Ham, Birmingham City before retiring seven years ago. Bouba Diop was renowned for his immense stature in the heart
of a midfield and gained popularity in England for his Hlompho Kekana-sque
long-range strikes. He was affectionately known as "the wardrobe" by
supporters. FIFA is saddened to learn of the passing of Senegal legend Papa Bouba Diop.
