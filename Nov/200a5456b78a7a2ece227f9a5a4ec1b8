MONUMENTS are often places to honour loved ones who are no longer with us. When ANC treasurer general Paul Mashatile’s wife died, his family decided to find a different kind of monument to honour her life. On Friday, 27 November, Mashatile launched the Manzi Mashatile Foundation, named after his wife who died in July. Mashatile told Daily Sun: “After her passing, my children and I decided to honour her and look at the things she loved doing. “We came up with the idea of a foundation that’d focus on supporting education, particularly children from primary school up to tertiary level.” Mashatile said high school pupils and students would be assisted with scholarships and bursaries while primary school kids would be helped with shoes and school uniforms. He said the foundation would also work with NGOs whose focus is women empowerment. He said through the foundation, they were continuing Manzi’s legacy of giving. The foundation will start most of its work in Alexandra, north of Joburg, where she grew up. It has adopted Emfudisweni Primary School, which she attended. Mashatile said they would make sure the foundation accounted for each and every cent donated. “It’s registered with the Master of the Supreme Court and we’ve appointed a firm of lawyers for legal advice and an auditing firm to audit the foundation,” he said.
