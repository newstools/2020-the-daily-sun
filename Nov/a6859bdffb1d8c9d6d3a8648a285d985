THE SA Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) head of sports, Gary Rothbone, has assured the boxing protesters that their memorandum of grievances did not fall on deaf ears. A boxing organisation representing a portion of fighters, promoters and managers marched to the SABC headquarters in Auckland Park demanding the public broadcaster to bring back live boxing on TV. The public broadcaster has not been showing live bout since 2010, so concerned boxing community led by Free State based promoter Lebohang Mahoko took to the street to raised their dissatisfactory. Although Boxing South Africa (BSA) threatened to take action against its licensees who would be part of the protest, they forged ahead with it. Signing the memorandum, Rothbone said as the SABC they will deliver on what South Africans want. According to Rothbone, they always wanted to prioritise on boxing as the public’s free to air broadcaster. “Boxing is important to millions of South Africans and probably one of the popular sport in the country that does not get the space it deserve, so we need to work on it,” said Rothbone. “The problem is that it not easy exercise, I can’t go upstairs to take things off-air and put boxing on tomorrow. It’s not going to be a quick fix.” However, Rothbone said boxing is going to be live again regularly on a decent spot where boxing fans can appreciate it. Mahoko said he was excited that their memorandum was signed.
