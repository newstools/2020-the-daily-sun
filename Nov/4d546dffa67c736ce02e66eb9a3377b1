THERE is a perception that buying a car comes with the joys of enjoying the open road. But there’s wickedness that comes with your pride and joy: hijackings. Crime statistics for the second quarter of 2020/2021 were recently released and there was a 1,6% decrease in cases of carjacking or 79 less. But there was also a 31,7% increase in truck hijackings. Traditionally, the end of the year is the time when crime tends to rise. Therefore, all drivers need to increase their awareness levels as they make their way around. Managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, said whether you drive a car or a truck, you should increase your awareness levels as we head toward the end of the year. Motorists should pay careful attention in driveways and avoid turning into driveways if there’s a suspicious car behind them. “Even if there’s no one behind you, rather wait parallel to your gate while it opens and only pull in once you can drive straight inside. Ensure the area is well-lit and clear of overgrown bushes,” Herbert said. Avoid coming to a complete stop at an intersection. Rather anticipate light changes so you’re not at a standstill. If this is unavoidable, leave a large gap between yourself and the car in front to give you space to react if necessary.
