A PAROLEE is behind bars for business robbery, attempted murder and the possession of an unlicensed firearm. Joburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said a 35-year-old man was arrested on Thursday, 19 November at the corner of Mooi and Bree streets. Mbele said the suspect had been released on parole last month. “It is alleged that three suspects robbed a family tuck shop,” he said. He said they entered the shop pretending to be customers, then one of them pointed a firearm at the owner and his wife while the other two took an undisclosed amount of money, cellphones and airtime before fleeing the scene. “Victims screamed for help and the security guard came to their rescue. He gave chase and detectives who were tracing wanted suspects also gave chase,” said Mbele. “A suspect fired several shots at the police and they retaliated. He was cornered and apprehended. “A firearm with no serial number and live rounds was recovered,” he said. Mbele told Daily Sun the firearm will be sent for ballistic testing to check if it was used in the commission of other serious and violent crimes. “Two suspects are still at large with the belongings of the victims. The investigation is underway and the suspect will appear soon in the Joburg Magistrates Court,” he said.
