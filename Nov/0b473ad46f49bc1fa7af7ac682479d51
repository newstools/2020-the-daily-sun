MASTER KG has once again flown the South African flag high and made Mzansi proud. The 24-year-old star won the MTV European Music Award (EMA) for Best African Act on Sunday, 8 November. The Jerusalema hitmaker, was nominated alongside Kabza De Small and DJ Maphorisa for their track Nana Thula, Burna Boy (Nigeria), Rema (Nigeria), Sheebah (Uganda) and Gaz Mawete (Democratic Republic of Congo). The world-renowned producer and DJ said he didn’t think he would win the award because of how tough the competition was in the category. “Winning this is overwhelming, I never saw it coming because there was a lot of hype on social media about a particular artist.

Master KG said he hadn’t gotten used to accolades and they always came as a shock. “Winning internationally will always come as a surprise to me. I mean there’s always competition in the music industry and it’s people who are as good as me. So I am blessed to be winning these awards,” he said. When asked how he felt about not being recognized by award ceremonies in the country, but abroad, he said: “I feel blessed, I am seeing the true powers of God and the results of the hard work I’ve been putting in.”
