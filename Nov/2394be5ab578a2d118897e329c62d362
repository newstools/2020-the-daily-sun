THE Daveyton Hearts Athletics Club in partnership with Mayfield Square shopping centre are going big this year by hosting their first ever virtual 10km and 5km run. This exciting event is meant to attract elite and social runners from across the board from 6 December. The “Blue Army”, as the Hearts are affectionately known, together with Mayfield Square, have hosted three successful races that started in 2017. But due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a virtual race was the only option for this year after various sporting events were brought to a halt. The event is not only meant to assist runners with their physical health ambitions. However, it is meant to promote social cohesion by bringing the community closer. Mayfield Square and Hearts will be using the gains from this event to donate to a charity organisation in Daveyton called Theodorah Ndaba Victim Support Centre. This gesture of goodwill from the partners will reach out to the most vulnerable members of the community, with the hope of easing the financial burden during the festive season. Chairman of the running club, Tsietsi Lephokwane, remarked that sports is a strategic vehicle to drive empowerment and social connection among people in the community. “The strategic relationship with Mayfield Square is vital in bringing the necessary developmental changes in the community,” Lephokwane said. “The running community is abuzz with excitement for this race. Part of the club’s main objectives is to encourage individuals to take up road running as a way of life and keeping healthy and fit.” Participants can register on www.entrytime.co.za or contact Lephokwane on 084 738 9476.
