Kaizer Chiefs have confirmed the club will be without right-back Reeve Frosler for around the next eight weeks in another blow for embattled coach Gavin Hunt. Frosler was injured in Sundayâ€™s 2-0 MTN8 semifinal, second leg, defeat against Orlando Pirates and was forced off inside half an hour. Chiefs confirmed that an MRI scan has revealed unspecified damage to his knee, with the recovery time of two months. Hunt already has a number of walking wounded and his plans for this season have been hampered by the inability to sign new players as Chiefs work through a Fifa ban in the next two windows. Better news is that striker Samir Nurkovic is likely to restart training in two weeks, which would add some significant firepower up front for Hunt. Also set to return is young striker Keletso Sifama, who missed the last two games with an ankle problem. He should be back by the end of the international break. Next up for Chiefs is a trip to Lamontville Golden Arrows in the DStv Premiership on November 21. SuperSport
