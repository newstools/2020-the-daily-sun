THE EFF has called on the UIF to name and shame companies that defrauded the insurance fund. The EFF marched to the UIF and Sassa offices in Tshwane today. They brought traffic to a standstill as they marched from Church Square, sitting down at every intersection. EFF deputy secretary-general, Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi, said the Department of Employment and Labour allowed companies to claim on behalf of workers yet some workers had not yet been paid. She said the EFF’s labour desk receives thousands of complaints every day from workers who’d not been paid. “We want to know who didn’t pay their workers, and we’ll visit each and every company that hasn’t yet paid them,” she said. She demanded to see a list of companies that beat the system. “We’re fighting corruption. The department has to help by giving us a list of the companies. “We want the names of those fraudsters to be made public. The department has 42 call centre agents that service the entire country and during lockdown it’s 22. It’s impractical.” UIF acting commissioner, Marsha Bronkhorst, received their memorandum. She said as a mother who wouldn’t want her own kids to go to bed hungry, she sympathised. “We take your concerns seriously. We’re busy investigating and we’ll make sure those who stole money go to prison,” she said. The EFF gave the department seven days to reply to its demands and 48 hours to pay outstanding claims of workers, or else members would return to the offices.
