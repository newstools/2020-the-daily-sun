Police nab mother and boyfriend following alleged rape and murder charges. The couple from Diepkloof, Soweto Mother (17) and boyfriend(30) are due to appear at Protea Magistrate court tomorrow after the cops made a swift arrest earlier today. According to SAPS spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters the two year old succumbed to her injuries and was declared dead on the 19th of this month. "During the preliminary investigation, police established that the incident happened on the 15 November when the mother left the toddler in the care of her boyfriend," said Peters. Peters said It was only on Tuesday, 17 that the mother of the victim came to report the incident to the police. Nevertheless, this assisted police in obtaining vital information towards building a solid case in order to secure arrests. "Police have reason to believe that the deceased child may have suffered previous abuse at the hands of her step-father and this went unreported. This, is the basis of the arrest of the teenage mother who in this instance, only reported the incident to the police two days later," said Peters. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the police in Gauteng, Major General Patricia Rampota has welcomed the arrest and urged the investigating team to ensure that all bases are covered towards attaining justice for the two-year old child. Peters emphasised that SAPS remains committed to upholding the rights of victims of gender based and domestic violence and femicide, and to prioritise the investigation of all cases where women, children and other vulnerable persons are victims.
