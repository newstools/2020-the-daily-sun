CAF president Ahmad Ahmad has been banned by Fifa from all football activities for five years. Fifa has ruled that Ahmad had breached football rules of the current edition of the Fifa Code of Ethics, and sanctioned him with a ban from all football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level for five years. In addition, a financial fine has been imposed on him. "The adjudicatory chamber of the independent Ethics Committee has found Ahmad, who is a FIFA Vice-President, guilty of having breached art. 15 (Duty of loyalty), art. 20 (Offering and accepting gifts or other benefits) and art. 25 (Abuse of position) of the 2020 edition of the Code of Ethics, as well as art. 28 (Misappropriation of funds) of the 2018 edition," Fifa said in a statement. "The investigation into Mr Ahmad’s conduct in his position as CAF President during the period from 2017 to 2019 concerned various CAF-related governance issues, including the organisation and financing of an Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca, his involvement in CAF’s dealings with the sports equipment company Tactical Steel and other activities." This will surely open up opportunities for Mamelodi Sundowns president, Patrice Motsepe, who will be contesting for the position in March during their elective congress. "In its decision, following an extensive hearing, the adjudicatory chamber ruled that, based on information gathered by the investigatory chamber, Mr Ahmad had breached his duty of loyalty, offered gifts and other benefits, mismanaged funds and abused his position as the CAF President, pursuant to the Code of Ethics," Fifa said. Fifa has indicated that it has notified the Malagasy on Monday, "the date on which the ban comes into force".
