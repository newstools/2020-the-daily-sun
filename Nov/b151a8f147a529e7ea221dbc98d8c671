There has been a breakthrough in the Prince’s murder case. Five suspects, four women and a man have been arrested. The women whose ages range from 27 to 42, and a 32-year old man were arrested in Pretoria on suspicion of being involved in the murder Prince Lethukuthula Zulu. Zulu’s body was found by security guards at his place of residence at Graceland Residential Complex in Northworld, three weeks ago. Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Peters Mathapelo told Daily Sun that all five suspects were arrested on Friday night, 20 November. “This comes as a result of meticulous investigation and hard work by the Provincial Investigating team who, since the reporting of the incident at Honeydew SAPS about two weeks ago, were able to piece together bits and pieces of information that saw the initial inquest docket being changed to a murder case,” said Mathapelo. She said critical evidence that could easily have been overlooked, was effectively lifted from the crime scene by the SAPS forensic science experts. “The processed evidence assisted the investigating team in establishing a possible linkage of the suspects to the crime. During the arrest, one of the suspects was found in possession of different substances and these were seized for further investigation against the possibility of the deceased and his business partner having been drugged before cash and other valuables were stolen from their place.” She said several suspected stolen items were seized at the residences of the suspects. “The investigation continues as police envisage to possibly uncover more evidence towards building a solid case that can stand in court. The investigation might also assist in establishing whether the suspects might have committed previous similar crimes where victims were drugged and robbed." She said at this point, the suspects are facing a charge of murder and theft. The suspects are expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate Court tomorrow (23 November 2020,” said Mathapelo.
