DIMPHO Soboyisi’s Girls Talk initiative teaches girls how to protect and take care of themselves. “I’m doing this as a concerned young woman trying to help girls,” said Dimpho (24) from Nyanga in Cape Town. She put together a seminar for young girls from Nyanga and New Crossroads. “I’ve also invited their parents because the girls want to discuss with them things that are happening in their lives,” she said. Dimpho said most kids can’t even talk to their parents because they’re so strict, which is pointless. “Kids are going to have sex anyway,” she said. She said girls at times get mixed up with perverts because they don’t get the chance to discuss sensitive topics with their parents. “Times have changed. Parents might not want to talk about these topics,” she said. “But kids will still get incorrect information from the street anyway.” Parent Nozuko Qongqa (54) said she finds it difficult to have heart-to-heart sex talk with her kids. “We believe when you have these conversations with them, they think you’re allowing them to get involved with boys,” she said. Endinako Gwegwe (14) said it’s easier to talk to strangers when one’s own parents are strict. “Our parents must listen to the stages that we’re going through and advise us on what to do,” Endinako told the People’s Paper. Resident Shaun Wilberforce told the girls they should always tell their parents where they’re going and when they’ll be back. “When using Uber, always take the details of the driver and give it to your parents,” said Shaun.
