Beware of fake izangoma who target desperate people. Some people have been robbed of thousands of rands by these so-called izangoma. They promise people fortunes, knowing they want to rob them of their hard-earned cash. Many people out there pretend to be traditional healers, knowing well they have ulterior motives. Izangoma don’t use magic and operate in line with the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007. Therefore, anything that does not adhere to this piece of legislation is illegal. I’d like to appeal to communities to refrain from entertaining bogus izinyanga. Letter by Rachel Molema Theresa Mews
