Mamelodi Sundowns have reclaimed top spot in the DStv Premiership after a comfortable 3-0 win over Stellenbosch FC at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday evening. Goals from Peter Shalulile, Kermit Erasmus and Themba Zwane saw the Brazilians leapfrog Swallows FC back to the summit of the standings – with a haul of 13 points from a possible 15 – while Stellies drop to 10th on the log after a second defeat of the season. After the teams traded early attacks, Sundowns took the lead on seven minutes when Peter Shalulile got up highest at the far post to head home from Kermit Erasmus’s teasing cross. The goal arrived in the same passage of play which saw Denis Onyango come off his line to thwart a dangerous moment from Leletu Skelem at the other end. The match also saw a touching moment when, with 16 minutes on the clock, both teams took time out to have a round of applause for the late Anele Ngcongca. He wore the number 16 for the Brazilians. Ten minutes later ‘Downs doubled their advantage. Stellenbosch were sloppy in trying to clear their lines and allowed Shalulile to tee up Erasmus, who stroked home a left-footed shot from inside the penalty area to put the hosts firmly in control.The Brazilians eased off in the remainder of the first half and allowed Stellenbosch to see more of the ball, though the visitors offered little in the way of penetration and goalkeeper Onyango was left mostly untested. The score remained 2-0 in favour of the home side to the halftime interval.Sundowns took their time moving back through the gears in the second half, but they duly extended their lead on 62 minutes when Erasmus pulled a ball back for Themba Zwane to shoot home from close range and make it 3-0.Substitute Haashim Domingo almost added to the scoreline 15 minutes later with a low shot which looked destined for the bottom corner, but goalkeeper Lee Langeveldt made a fine save diving to his right.‘Downs looked to add to the score line in what remained of the game – with the likes of Domingo, Lesedi Kapinga and Aubrey Modiba all hungry to impress after rising off the bench – but the score remained 3-0 to the fulltime whistle.Sundowns will be back in DStv Premiership action next Saturday, 5 December, when they face Maritzburg United away from home, while Stellenbosch visit TS Galaxy the following day. -SuperSport
