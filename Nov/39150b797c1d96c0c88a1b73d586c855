THE recent storms and heavy rain didn’t spare kasis in Tshwane. Vincent Matabatho was left picking up the pieces of what was once his home. The 39-year-old from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, said he was woken up by heavy winds shaking his family’s shack on Monday, 9 November. He said his family quickly ran out and watched from a distance as metal sheets were blown away by the wind and rain damaged their furniture. He said: “I stood there helpless. There was nothing we could salvage because the rain was too strong and we needed to find cover.” Vincent, who has only one leg, said he had to limp his way to safe shelter. “I thought the world was coming to an end. Everything was happening too fast.” He said after the storm they spent the morning searching for metal sheets blown away in the heavy rain. Derrick Maluleka had to find shelter in his car as all the roofing was blown away. His kids’ books and uniforms were ruined. “This is not the first time, and it looks like it won’t be the last time,” he said. “I just wish government could help by moving us from this place before someone dies.” The residents said they needed clothes, food and books. The Soshanguve cop shop barracks and a house in block L were left rooflesss. Tshwane emergency services spokesman, Charles Mabaso, said firefighters had to cut down trees uprooted by the storm to clear the blocked R80/Bushveld Road near Soshanguve cop shop and the magistrates court. “Emergency services calls on residents to report incidents,” said Mabaso. “It has come to our attention that some houses were affected in Soshanguve blocks G and K, but these incidents were never reported.” The weather service issued a warning of severe thunderstorms over Gauteng, south and south-west of Limpopo, and in the western parts of Mpumalanga, which might damage infrastructure, informal or formal settlements, as well as vehicles.
