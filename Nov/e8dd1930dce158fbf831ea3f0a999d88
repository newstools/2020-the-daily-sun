DJ MASTER Jazzy D is reviving singing legend Brenda Fassie’s legacy with remixes for the festive season. New singles I Love You Babe samples the Queen of Afropop and the remix of SA’s 1999 biggest selling single and album Nomakanjani. The remakes of the chart-topping songs were released on Friday, 27 November to celebrate the icon’s birthday month. Master Jazzy D aka the Groovemaster told Daily Sun  he got the idea after studying the current music market. “I discovered we have no more magic in our music like back in the day. I took it upon myself to do some soul- searching and decided this is a song which represents happiness and unity when people are getting married.” Nomakanjani features vocalist Nokwazi. Master Jazzy D said the remixes had no official approvals but MaBrr’s former manager Chicco Twala and her family were made aware of the new songs. “Chicco and I have a long-standing relationship, so I spoke to him and the Fassies about remixing one of Brenda songs, Nomakanjani.” He said there was a collaborative approach on the single. “I invited music gurus to feature on the making of the song, hence all three different mixes are hot. The song was remixed by top DJs including Christos, Jununu and music fundi Dikgauza, which gave the song a diverse taste which appeals to young and old.” Nomakanjani consists of three remix versions: an Afro mix by legendary DJ Christos, an amapiano mix by Jununu and a powerful radio edit mix by advertising guru Dikgauza. Matrix group publicist Dineo Mahloele said a solid team was created to plan the celebration and preservation of the heritage of one of Africa’s most talented musicians. “Fans of MaBrr can expect more remixed songs, a book by Bongani Fassie, a theatre production, a biopic of Brenda’s life and a tribute tour across Africa from the Brenda Fassie Legacy Project.”
