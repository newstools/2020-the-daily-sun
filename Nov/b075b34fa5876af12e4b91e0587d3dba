UNISA invigilators closed down the main campus on Friday, 13 November. They vowed to continue protesting at the campus in Sunnyside, Tshwane, until their outstanding salaries were paid. Protest leader Solly Morudu, the chief invigilator from Olifantsfontein in Ekurhuleni, said it was their third protest. “We will not stop protesting until we’re paid what’s due to us. We have not received a cent since March.” He said they were also not paid Covid-19 funds or UIF. He claimed some invigilators had not been paid for work they did last October and November. “Management promised to pay us on Tuesday 10 November, but we didn’t see money in our bank accounts. Management wanted to give us R7 000 each and then terminate our contracts,” said Morudu. Yvonne Radebe, chief invigilator for Pretoria Showgrounds, said 1 836 people and their families were affected. “We will be shutting down Unisa from Monday to Friday until we are paid our money. Solly Masole, an invigilator from Randburg in Joburg, didn’t receive his January salary. “I went through Covid-19 without any money.” Betty Seloane, an invigilator from Polokwane in Limpopo, said she was still owed her December salary. The invigilators pleaded for the intervention of Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Unisa spokesman Tommy Huma said management met the invigilators’ representative on Thursday, 12 November and agreed to pay their October and November salaries. He said they’d help them with UIF claims. “We’re verifying their bank accounts so that the money doesn’t go to the wrong people.”
