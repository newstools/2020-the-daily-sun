I’ve seen and read the news about Ace Magashule. Where there’s smoke there’s fire. The president always conducts sermons about corruption and how people are going to be prosecuted. He’s also mentioned that if any senior official is caught, they’ll be prosecuted and forced to resign. I’m still waiting to see that happening to Magashule in particular. What does he know that we don’t? According to the Zondo Commission, many senior ANC senior officials are implicated yet earn salaries and haven’t been fired. The commission was established by Jacob Zuma, but he’s now unhappy with Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. If Zuma is indeed innocent, why is he so scared? It’s time those implicated in corruption were fired and forfeit some benefits, not just be suspended. Letter by Sharif Slow, Ennerdale
