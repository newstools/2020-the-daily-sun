LEGENDARY actress Baby Cele-Maloka has explained the reason she’s leaving SABC1’s Uzalo. Earlier this month, Uzalo confirmed her departure, leaving viewers heartbroken. Baby, who plays Gabisile Mdletshe on the show, said there was no bad blood between her and the Uzalo production and has landed a role on a new drama to be produced by Uzalo makers, Stained Glass Productions. Her last appearance in Uzalo will be between February and March next year. Baby told Daily Sun she was taking a break to have enough time to focus on the new role. “I’ll relocate from KZN to Joburg for a new drama shoot and have more time for me and my family,’’ she said. “Those who’re too fast to spread news about my character are spoiling my surprises and the fun.” She said she’ll make a surprise comeback at the end of next year. “My fans should calm down. I’ll still appear on their favourite soapie until the beginning of next year and disappear for a while and return.” She said her bosses were good to her. “I’d like to thank Stained Glass Productions for giving me a break on a daily soapie and time to heal,” she said.
