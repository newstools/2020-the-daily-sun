Netflix recently held a content showcase webinar hosted by Pabi Moloi. The popular streaming service gave us a sneak peak of what Mzansi viewers can expect on the platform. Mzansi can expect three exciting films between the month of November and December. The first one will be Riding With Sugar premiering on 27 November. It’s a feel good story about a young refugee’s quest for BMX glory and the pursuit of identity, safety, happiness and love. Then comes Kings of Joburg produced by Ferguson Films and starring Shona Ferguson as Simon “Vader” Masire, a member of the KOJ brotherhood and the eldest of the Masire siblings. As the smoother and charming brother, Vader leads the family business. However, under the lavish suites and ties is a man hiding a deep dark secret.

Last but not least is the star-studded movie, How to Ruin Christmas, which will premier on 16 December. It follows the story of Tumi Sello, who joins her dysfunctional family for the first Christmas holidays in years. It’s not the merry return of the prodigal daughter everyone was hoping for. She manages to ruin her younger sister’s Christmas wedding before it even takes place and spends the next six days frantically trying to get things back on track. In a statement, Netflix African originals manager Dorothy Ghettuba said: “Our goal has been, and continues to be, to partner with local creative talent, on and off screen, to tell more compelling stories that will resonate with local audiences and showcase African stories to the world. I’m so proud of the African originals we have brought to Netflix viewers in 2020 and excited about the amazing series and films coming over the next several months and into 2021.” A post shared by Netflix South Africa (@netflixsa)
