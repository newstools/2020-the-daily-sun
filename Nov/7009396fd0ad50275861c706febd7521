The challenges that today’s young people face seem to be the reason they abuse drugs and alcohol. They resort to mind-altering substances to try and forget their troubles, but that illusion makes their situation worse. They become addicted and end up needing more money to feed their cravings. The problem with drug addicts and alcoholics is that they are not in good standing to create and sustain their jobs. Boys who are slaves to drugs often steal to get money for a fix, while some girls prostitute themselves for the same reason. The authorities don’t handle the campaign to tackle drug and alcohol abuse with the sensitivity it deserves. If they did, they would make sure that the youth have development centres in all Mzansi communities where they can nurture their talents. We need to join hands with the government to support the organisations in our communities that are trying to keep young people away from the streets and social ills. By supporting the organisations good work, we will be encouraging our children to stay out of trouble and improve their lives. Letter by Abigail Ledubuko Bochum
