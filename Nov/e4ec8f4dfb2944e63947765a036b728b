THOUSANDS of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule have descended at the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court where he is due to appear on corruption charges in a little than an hour. The placard carrying members in ANC regalia marched along the street of the court with the MKMVA leading the chant under the watchful eye of the police who had blocked the road leading to the court with police nyala and barbed wire. “Acee, Acee,” they chanted as they waved placards, some of which read: “Innocent until proven guilty.” According to the placards, the supporters came as far as North West. A face-off erupted between some of the supporters and MKMVA marshals who were pleading for discipline as they wanted to force their way past the barricade. Magashule is reported to have handed himself over to the Hawks who it is understood are currently taking a statement from him before he appears in court. He had been asked to hand himself over at 10am but he did so way earlier. Despite asking his supporters not to print T-shirts in his name, many turned up with T-shirts printed: “Hands off Magashule.” Security has been tightened around the court precinct with some of the roads blocked off. The situation threatened to get out of hand with Magashule supporters threatening to jump over the barbed wire and demanding that police remove it. Eventually, they dragged it with helpless police looking on.
