BAFANA Bafana captain Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo has thanked all the current and previous national coaches after reaching his milestone of 50 caps. The tough-as-teak central defender reached his half-century of caps in Bafana’s 4-2 victory over Sao Tome in their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier played at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Monday. As always, the Orlando Pirates defender put his body on the line for the team. “It’s an honour to serve and be served by the leadership in the team,” said Hlatshwayo. “I’m just thankful to all the coaches that worked with me to get to this stage and have my 50th cap.” Hlatshwayo, who has played for both the SA Under-17 and SA-20 teams, captained Bafana for the first time when then coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba handed him the armband against Eswatini on 25 March 2015. He marked that memorable day with a goal as Bafana won 3-1. Recently, Hlatshwayo was one of South Africa's goal scorers when Bafana recorded their biggest ever victory, a 6–0 win over Seychelles in 2019 Afcon qualifier in 2018. After Monday’s match, Hlatshwayo said the day was made special because Bafana won, though it would have been better if they were able to keep a clean sheet. “What tops it was the win,” said Hlatshwayo. "But to concede through a lack of concentration, we should have done better. When you look at the game in Durban (the first qualifier against Sao Tome last Friday where Bafana won 2-0), it was a similar (type of game) to what happened on Monday. But we kept the faith, we kept going and we managed to get the goals."
