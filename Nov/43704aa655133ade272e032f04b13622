BANYANA Banyana seems determined to continue their dominance in the Cosafa Women’s Championship. They sent out a strong statement when they thumped a strong Malawi outfit 6-2 in their semi-final played at the Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Hildah Magaia’s hat trick and Mapule Kgoale’s brace along with a goal from the heroin against Comoros, Sibulele Holweni,  was enough to see Banyana romp through to their eighth straight final. Malawi’s inspirational captain, Tabitha Chawinga her sister Temwa scored both of their side’s goals but they were not enough to knock out the defending champions. Desiree Ellis’ charges are now eying their fourth consecutive title after they won the last three in a row. Banyana’s dominance is showing no signs of letting off as they have clinched six of the last seven editions played. After the first half finished goalless, both teams came out with clear intentions to find the back of the net and they did so eight times combined. Kgoale opened the scoring in the 51st minute before Temwa Chawinga equalized just a minute later. Magaia then got into the action to restore Banyana’s lead before Kgoale completed her brace in the 64th minute. Magaia then bagged her second in the 67th minute while Holweni, who scored five against Comoros last time out, also got in the scoresheet. But this time, it was Magaia’s turn to shine as she completed her hat trick while Tabitha Chawinga’s goal was nothing more than a consolation. Banyana will now turn their attention to Botswana in the final set to be played on Sunday at the same venue.
