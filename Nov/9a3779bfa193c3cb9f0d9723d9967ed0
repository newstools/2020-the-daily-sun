THE taxi industry on Wednesday, 25 November mourned those who lost their lives to Covid-19. The taximen did this in acting Public Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo’s presence. He started off the day with a prayer session at Bloed Street Taxi Rank. Speaking at an event held at Tshwane District Hospital later, Mamabolo said the best way to remember those who died was to continue working to slow its spread. He was in Tshwane for the national five days of mourning to pay tribute to those who’d died of Covid-19 and gender-based violence. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet decided on 11 November there should be five days of mourning from 25 to 29 November. The acting health MEC engaged with hospital staff and was joined by Steve Biko Academic Hospital officials. KILLER WOMEN GANG STRIKES AGAIN! He said 4 989 people in the province had died of the virus while its health department had lost 45 employees. “Health workers who died didn’t die in vain. They lost their lives in the line of duty, working hard to ensure we minimise the pandemic’s impact,” he said. “We owe them a debt of gratitude and we need to continue working hard to stop the spread of the virus.” Mamabolo urged the taxi industry to continue following regulations and to be extra careful over the festive season, a time when a high number of people move in and out of the province. “It’s important during this period to also ensure government intensifies its work with all stakeholders to put an end to gender-based violence, described as the second pandemic ravaging society.”
