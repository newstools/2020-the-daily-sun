IZANGOMA have told Daily Sun Gauteng residents can expect more heavy storm havoc in the coming week! Said sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye: “Mamlambo is the cause. It’s the mating season and the snake is angry. It doesn’t want anything evil in its path.” He said many lives could have been lost. “Mamlambo is going to various places. It looks at the number of evil versus good things in an area, and if there’s more evil than good it attacks. If there’s more good than bad it passes without any harm.” Sangoma Madlanduna Luthuli said: “When people slaughter, Mamlambo also gets a sacrifice. But there was a pause during lockdown. Mamlambo starved and it’s looking for blood.”  He said more heavy floods would kill people. Traditional healers needed to go to the mountains and perform rituals. “Otherwise, people are going to suffer a lot,” he said. He said some traditional healers did go to mountains. “We do it in secret. We do it to save people, not to become famous. We never invite the media or take photos and brag.” He said traditional leaders know how dangerous Mamlambo can be when it’s angry. “Horrible things can happen. It can destroy the whole village. People who’re blessed are the ones required to beg it for mercy,” he said. The powerful snake could sometimes be referred to as inkanyamba.  “Things that make it angry include its offspring going missing,” said sangoma Mkhulu Phakathwayo. Fishermen catch the child and anger inkanyamba. “Wherever it passes people will cry when it’s looking for its child.” Heavy rains and hail lashed most parts of Gauteng on Friday. People escaped serious injury in Vereeniging, Vaal, after the roof of a petrol station collapsed. Shacks and lowlying bridges were flooded and uprooted trees blocked roads. Three boys drowned in Tshwane.
