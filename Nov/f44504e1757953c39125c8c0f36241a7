GOSPEL singer Luyanda Ramatswi is collaborating with Zimbabwean gospel singer Mawamba Bunjira on the new song, The Orphan. “The song aims to bring unity and forgiveness,” said the singer known for his likeness to the late Lundi Tyamara. But Luyanda (35) is originally from Ga-Mashalane Village in Senwabarwana, Limpopo. Speaking telephonically to SunBuzz from Zimbabwe, Mawamba said: “I admire Luyanda’s ministry and have been following him on social media for a long time. “Although we haven’t met yet in person, spiritually we’ve been connected.” Luyanda said the song is about a streetkid who takes care of the sick.  “It was inspired by two adults who lived in the streets. “They came to me while promoting my music and asked for money. Instead of giving them money, I gave them food. “Two weeks later I made a follow-up and was surprised to realise they’d cleaned themselves up.” ALSO READ:SENZO'S DAUGHTER BLESSED BY RED ANTS!

This will show the two countries that we shouldn’t discriminate against each other.” The rhythm is local, with Zimbabwean elements here and there. “It’s a spiritual song and the melody will touch you,” he said. “We hope to change people’s lives and fight xenophobia. “The song will be released this month.” The singer is known for songs Re jelana Mona, Jesu O Ntswembu, Moya Moya and Jehova.
