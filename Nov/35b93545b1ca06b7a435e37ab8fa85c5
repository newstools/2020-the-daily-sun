On 19 November every year, the world comes together to speak with one voice in celebrating World Toilet Day. On this day, the world raises awareness on the importance of proper toilets in keeping our water resources clean and to help protect our health by stopping the spread of deadly infectious diseases. World Toilet Day raises awareness on the importance of a toilet and the plight of many people who are still without toilets and proper sanitation facilities. It’s crucial to note that there are still many people throughout the world who don’t have access to a toilet or proper sanitation. The focus of World Toilet Day is about taking action to tackle the global sanitation crisis and achieve the sustainable development goal which deals with water and sanitation for all by 2030. The theme for World Toilet Day this year is focusing on how sustainable sanitation can assist in mitigating the impact of climate change as it is getting worse. Floods and drought are threatening sanitation systems. Proper functioning sanitation system also contributes to water security as quality water is released back into the water resources, making water available for other critical uses. It’s important for government to ensure proper toilets and sanitation facilities and systems for all citizens, especially the most vulnerable. Letter by Themba Khoza
