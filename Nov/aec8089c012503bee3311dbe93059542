VINCENT Pule wants to make his mark and be a regular in Bafana Bafana. Pule wants to make up some grounds as his Bafana's debut in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers (Afcon) 2019 was a nightmare. He was called up by then coach Stuart Baxter when Bafana were hosting Libya in September 2018 in match day two of the 2019 qualifiers at Moses Mabhida Stadium. However, given the starter, he was taken off before the second half started and replaced by Bradley Grobler. Pule’s downfall to be sacrificed early was after he lost the ball cheaply in his own half and Libya stole the ball and almost scored, with ball coming off the post of Itumeleng Khune after the visitor's brilliant counter attack. The Orlando Pirates winger wants to correct that after he was called up by coach Molefi Ntseki as he replaced an injured Andile Jali for the two back-to-back 2022 qualifiers against Sao Tome ePrincipe at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday and three days later at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. “I’m excited to be back in the national team and it is always been great honour to be with the guys,” said Pule who has earned two caps with the other coming against Paraguay in the Nelson Mandela Challenge in Durban in November 2018. “It’s overwhelming and it’s good to be with overseas guys too. For me I’m just here to make an impact to the team and hopefully win both games.” Another player who is looking forward to these qualifiers is Keagan Dolly. The former Mamelodi Sundowns winger missed last year’s Afcon finals in Egypt after picking up an ankle and foot injury. Safa tried all their best to ensure Dolly gets fit, allowing him to be part of Cosafa Cup in Durban last year. However, that didn’t work as Dolly didn’t recover and thus was not included. “Each one of us wants to be part of the national team,” said Dolly. “Not just for me, but I think all the players here especial after the results in our last camp. We really want to win both games since we are playing here at home.”
