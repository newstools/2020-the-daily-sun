MOST matrics said their second business studies exam on Wednesday, 25 November went just as well as the first. Pupils at Florapark Comprehensive High in Polokwane, Limpopo, believed they nailed the exam. Phophi Sikhweni (17) said: “Only a few questions gave me problems.” Molebogeng Tlomatsana (18) told Daily Sun: “I spent five days preparing for this paper. I used two textbooks and previous question papers.” Kgothatso Meso (18) was also confident. “The paper was very good. The people who set the paper did a good job and I’m sure I passed,” she said. The pupils said their teachers played a huge role in making sure they were well prepared. But matrics at HF Tlou High School in Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in North West, felt they didn’t have enough time to prepare. Tshiamo Lenkwe (18) said the paper was challenging. Boipelo Boniswa (18) said it was fair and she enjoyed some questions as she’d studied them. Reabetswe Nkwe (17) said: “It was fair for me, but due to Covid-19 I feel we didn’t get enough time to study and prepare. “Unlike most schools, we didn’t have online classes, which would have helped. Some of us found it hard to study at home.” Clint Nxumalo (18) and Daniel Khoza (18) from Mafemane Nxumalo High School in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, said it was easy and were sure they did well.
