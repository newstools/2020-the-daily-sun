THE plot to oust ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule was hatched immediately after the announcement of the party’s top six at the 54th national conference at Nasrec. This was the claim by former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo speaking to journalists outside the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Friday. Mahumapelo was part of the once powerful premier league that comprised of him, Magashule and Deputy President David Mabuza. Mabuza, however, dumped the league ahead of the conference saying he no longer wanted to be part of divisive force and wanted to be part of the united ANC. Mabuza pulling out led to the victory of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who triumphed over the NDZ faction, which until then was backed by the premier league. Mahumapelo said soon after the announcement of the top six at Nasrec, there were murmurs of a plot to make sure Magashule did not finish his term. He said his arrest did not come as a surprise. “People must not forget that as soon as the results of the top six were announced, there was group that had a particular programme. We undermined that because we never thought members of the ANC could stoop so low. I just hope what is happening now is not related to what people are saying was said and done. It is now up to front troopers – the branches of the ANC. They are the ones who have to decide what should be done,” he said. Mahumapelo was seething after being kicked out of the court proceedings, claiming this was done despite him having an accreditation. He said they had wanted to hear from the court itself what Magashule was being charged with and not read about it in the newspapers. He said they would have to wait to be briefed by Magashule when the matter concludes for the day. Magashule is expected to address his supporters who have been singing outside court in the blistering heat. He has not volunteered to step down or aside for the duration of his trial. The NEC is set to discuss his case in the next meeting.
