DJ CAPITAL has given his concerts a new touch to make them fun! In his upcoming concert, The Escape, the DJ and TV personality will add activities such as a mechanical bull, water dunk tank, karaoke, archery and sand buggy rides. The Escape will be hosted at Malibu Lodge in Tshwane from 4 to 6 December. DJ Capital told Daily Sun he wanted people to have fun, especially because they were on lockdown for months. “We all feel like we have been locked up for a long time and we need a breather. “People need to break free and get away. When you get to this lodge, you feel like you’re outside Joburg, because there are animals and it’s just a cool space,” he said. ALSO READ: ISIBAYA: IT'S A WRAP! The star said lockdown forced them to think outside the box and that’s how the idea for the event came about. The DJ said: “This idea came about when we were only allowed to have gatherings of not more than 50 people, so a lot of venues were still closed. “We thought about how we can aid the entertainment industry and give people a little bit of fun, while still respecting the law. “I think the one thing about lockdown is that it really made us go back to the drawing board and think outside the box in terms of events, because everything was getting dull.” He said the festivities will start on a Friday with a karaoke night and a party. “Then on Saturday we also have some activities and a pool party. We will have live performances on Sunday. I don’t want to mention the line-up yet because I don’t want the event to be about that. I want it to be about the trip,” said DJ Capital. Tickets cost R1 500 on Webtickets.
