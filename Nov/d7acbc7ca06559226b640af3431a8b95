ONCE again, Collen Mashawana has stepped in to help another family. The well-known Limpopo businessman and philanthropist will be building a new home for Bongi Mputhi and her family. On 27 October, Daily Sun ran the story of 19-year-old Bongi who sought help from SunReaders to get a new prosthetic leg. Bongi from Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga, was born disabled and had been using the same prosthetic leg for years. Now, the leg is damaged and no longer fits properly because she has grown. The Collen Mashawana Foundation responded to her plight and Bongi will have not only a new leg, but also a new home which will be completed before Christmas. Marketing manager of the foundation, Motshabi Ntsoelengoe, said: “We paid her a visit and decided not only to find her a new prosthetic leg, but also finish construction to their home and make sure she has a safe place to live in.  “Plans for the construction of the house will start soon with the aim to complete the house in time for the festive season.” Bongi said she was grateful and happy. “This is a new journey for my mum and myself. She’s over the moon. I felt humiliated and helpless, but now am overwhelmed by this noble gesture.”
