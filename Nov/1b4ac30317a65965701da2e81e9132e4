TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach, Joel Masutha, said he is fully focused on his team, not the rumours that he could be sacked if Vhadau Vhadamani lose their Limpopo DStv Premiership derby against second placed Baroka FC on Sunday. TTM’s Limpopo rivals, Baroka and Black Leopards, have fired their head coaches Dylan Kerr and Patrick Aussems respectively in the past five days. Baroka have appointed Matsimela Thoka on a permanent basis, while Kerr rejoined Leopards on Tuesday. In their three opening Premiership matches, TTM have only managed to collect two points and are lying in 13th position. And rumours doing the rounds are that TTM must beat Bakgaga on Sunday at the Thohoyandou Stadium (3.30pm) for the former Leopards and Chippa United coach to keep his job. But Masutha told SunSport yesterday he does not know anything about such rumours and he has the full support of his club boss, Masala Mulaudzi. “I am a coach and I know that if the team is not doing well, a coach gets fired,” said Masutha. “But I don’t think we started badly. We have collected two points in three games. We also drew with Mamelodi Sundowns, a game which no one gave us a chance. We have not been playing badly. We were unlucky against Swallows. I have assembled a quality team which I believe in.” He added: “I don’t care what people are saying out there. “All I care about is my team and to prepare them well for our next game. The good thing is that I also have the full support from the club management.” On their derby on Sunday, the former Lidoda Duvha goalkeeper said: “This is a must-win game for us. This is not just a league game. “It’s a derby and we want three points and the bragging rights. Baroka have already won the first derby against Leopards, and we cannot allow them to win two derbies in Venda. We are going to do all we can to win.”
