Mai-Mai traders marched to Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo’s office on Wednesday, 11 November. Convener Malibongwe Sithole said they wanted their market out of Joburg Property Company’s management and back to the City of Joburg. “We’re against the proposed and set lease agreements. We want ownership of stalls in the form of sectional title deeds, as we’ve been operating family businesses for over seven decades.” He said a refurbishment project was left incomplete in 2017 and they wanted a detailed report. 'RICH MEN USE MUTHI' Trader Katlego Mlambo (23) said they wanted to know why no development had taken place since then. Malibongwe claimed maladministration by Joburg Property officials assigned to the market. “There’s no lighting, paving, safety and security. We want security personnel increased, for their job descriptions to be clear and for them not to be corrupt.” Gogo Zodwa Dlamini (79), who was raised at Kwa Mai-Mai, is disappointed by the market’s condition. “That place is a dump and a joke to people. We pay for services that are not being rendered. We live like pigs while officials have flashy cars. We are tired,” she said. Nonhlakanipho Nedzamba from the Speaker’s office said the mayor was unavailable, but she’d deliver the memorandum to him.
