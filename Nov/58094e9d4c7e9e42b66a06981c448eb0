IT is no secret that Kaizer Chiefs are not at their best yet!The last season runners’-up have not had the best run since the start of 2020-21 Dstv Premiership. In four matches they have gathered just five points from one win, two draws, and suffered one defeat. On Tuesday night, Amakhosi will be hoping for better results when they visit Dobsonville Stadium to take on Swallows FC (7:30pm). Swallows are unbeaten in the league, with two wins and two draws from their four matches, which has elevated them to the second spot on the league table, a win against Chiefs will see them topping the league standings. Chiefs youngster Nkosingiphile Ngcobo says it will be crucial for them to get maximum points. “For us, it is important to get three points so that we gain confidence and belief moving forward,” Ngcobo told the club website. “We are up against a strong team that has not lost this season. We have to go there and fight for a win.” “We know they are also strong at the back. They have conceded one goal this season and if we apply ourselves well, we will be able to get the win. I am confident of that.” The 21-year-old said he has been enjoying his game since the season started. He inserted: “I have enjoyed my football since the league started and have also enjoyed doing and implementing what the coach asks of me. I do feel I need to be more effective by creating and scoring more goals.” “These kinds of games against strong teams challenge us and we enjoy playing them,” he concludes. “It will be good for us because we have not lost in our last three games and they have not lost all season. We need to keep it tight at the back and not concede. We have to take our chances and win the game”.
