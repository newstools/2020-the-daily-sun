More than 16 firearms were recovered by the police over the weekend in Gauteng. According to Captain Kay Makhubele, some of the recovered firearms are believed to have been stolen during house robberies while others were used in the commission of serious and violent crimes. In a statement, Makhubele said 16 firearms, 10 magazines and 153 ammunition were seized during the operations. “During these operations in the early hours of the Saturday morning, more than 21 suspects were arrested in the West Rand, Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane Districts for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “The other suspects were nabbed on Sunday during crime prevention operations in Sedibeng,” Makhubele said.

He said the seized firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if they may have been used in other crimes. “Management of the SAPS in Gauteng would like to thank the members of the community who continue to work closely with the police to expose criminals, particularly those who possess illegal firearms. “The continued recovery of firearms will take law enforcement in the Province a long way as efforts are intensified in addressing the high volumes of armed robberies, murders and other serious and violent crimes,” Makhubele added. He advised owners of illegal or unwanted firearms and ammunition to hand them over to their nearest cop shop and take advantage of the firearm amnesty period that ends on 31 January 2021.
