AMAZULU striker Andre de Jong hopes the injury crisis he suffered last season are over. De Jong, who joined Usuthu at the beginning of last season from Eastern Suburb in New Zealand after helping them win the title where he scored 17 goals in 20 matches, had a season to forget for the Durban side. The 23-year-old suffered a foot injury last November when he was playing for New Zealand in a friendly against Lithuania. De Jong was ruled out for the rest of the season following that injury. But he was helped by the PSL suspending the season indefinitely in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He returned when the campaign resumed in August and concluded in a bio-bubble in Gauteng last month. “Obviously it was a frustrating season after getting an injury on international duty and I was out for the majority of the season,” said De Jong. De Jong started the opening DStv Premiership against Orlando Pirates which ended 1-1. He impressed in a supporting role to striker Lehlohonolo Majoro. De Jong is set to see more game time since striker Bongi Ntuli is out with an injury and missed the Bucs clash. “This is probably a fresh start for me and with Ayanda Dlamini coming in as the new coach, it could be an exciting season for us. ‘It was awesome to play the first game on Saturday and I’m excited,” added de Jong. And now fully fit, de Jong wants to contribute and help Usuthu’s deliver chairman Sandile Zungu’s mandate, to finish the season in the top four. “I want to contribute, score goals and add some assists,” said De Jong.
