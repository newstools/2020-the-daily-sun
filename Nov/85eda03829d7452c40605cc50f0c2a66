BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic goalkeeper, Jackson Mabokgwane, was released from hospital on Sunday after being rushed to a Pretoria medical centre in the second half of their MTN8 first leg semi-final clash against SuperSport United. He was substituted with Sipho Chaine in the 66th minute after feeling "dizzy and blurry" in the game which they drew 1-1 against Matsatsantsa a Pitori at Atteridgeville's Lucas Moripe Stadium. According to the 32-year-old goalie, he had diarrhea on Saturday and lost a lot of body fluids. But he woke up feeling better on match day and forced to be in the starting 11 thinking he was completely out of danger. "I was very sick in camp on Saturday and doctors assisted me, saying I was dehydrated," he said. "I woke up feeling better and thought I'd be okay to play. I was okay during warm ups. Midway through the game I felt dizzy and everything went blurry, everything was just blank hence I couldn't continue with the game. But it was me who forced to play because it was an important game." He said he was rehydrated and released on Sunday night. On his official Twitter page, Mabokgwane appreciated the support from "Dr Maphoto of @Masandawana for your selflessness, Doc took care of me since yesterday. Much appreciated sir folded hands". He continued: "And thanks everyone for the messages of support, I am recovering well in hospital. Hela Yalo, Raised fist @Bloem_Celtic." It is unclear whether coach John Maduka will consider him for Wednesday's DStv Premiership clash against Orlando Pirates at the Dr. Petrus Molemela Stadium, or Chaine will start the game as Mabokgwane is afforded time to recover.
