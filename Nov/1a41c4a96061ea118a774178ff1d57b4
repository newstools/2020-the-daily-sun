 AFTER HIS dad died, Karabo went to reclaim the house, but his late dad’s girlfriend produced a marriage certificate. “This is fraud at the highest level,” he said. “MY FATHER DIED SINGLE – THEN GOT MARRIED FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE!” Karabo Ramakgale (30) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun his dad died last September. “His death certificate stated he was single at the time of his death,” he said. Karabo said when they went to his dad’s house, they found his girlfriend. “She denied us entry into the house. She told us she was the owner. “We told her she can’t be the rightful owner because she was never married to my dad.” That’s apparently when she whipped out a certificate, which stated they got married in February. “How can someone die single and get married months later? “We want the truth. We want our dad’s house. It’s the last thing that belonged to him.” He said the woman wouldn’t even let them set foot in the house. “She wants it for herself. When I went there she called the police. She said I was intimidating them. “This isn’t fair. Some people think they can just take other people’s property through fraud.” The woman asked Daily Sun to not mention her and threatened to sue. “Write whatever you want, but if I see my name or picture there I’ll take you to court.” Asked to explain, she said: “For your information I got married to his father in July 2017, but we never signed any papers. “When Karabo gave me problems, I did a customary marriage in February,” said the woman. She said she never said Karabo shouldn’t come to his dad’s house. “Karabo wants me to leave, so he can sell the house. He wants to sell it to someone I know and I won’t let that happen.”
