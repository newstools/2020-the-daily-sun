I’LL be the first to admit that anything done in a drunk state has dire consequences. From drunk driving to drunken behaviour, alcohol tends to become toxic to our overall behaviour. Except if one is drunk in love, right? Wittiness aside, being drunk makes one physically and emotionally vulnerable. If you don’t believe me, ask someone who suffers from drunk call mania. Alcohol affects areas of the brain involved with behavioural regulation, which may make people more prone to drunk texting, drunk dialling, or posting on social media. Studies have shown that significant percentages of people who send electronic forms of communication while drunk regret these decisions later. These behaviours can have consequences for people’s social lives and sexual relationships. Drunk dialling, or calling someone while intoxicated, has become common among young adults. A study looked at the drunk dialling behaviours of college students and why they engaged in this behaviour. The study found out that students were drunk calling for the following reasons: 1.Entertainment 2.Confession 3.Hook up 4.Sexual Psychologists warn that alcohol is among the top five reasons for relationship strains and breakups. So when drinking, learn to stay away from all communicational aspects of your phone.
