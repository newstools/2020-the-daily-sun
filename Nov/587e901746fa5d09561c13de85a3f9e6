THE Confederation of African Football (Caf) has confirmed that current interim president Constant Selemani Omari's contract is extended. The adjudicatory chamber of the Fifa independent Ethics Committee has just banned incumbent Ahmad Ahma, and vice-president of Fifa, from all football related matters for five years, after having acted irresponsibly in violation of the Fifa Code of ethics. He's banned from all football-related activities (administrative, sports and other) at the national and international levels for a period of five years. "Caf took note of this decision which puts Ahmad in a position of no longer being able to exercise his responsibilities. Caf, which is concerned about the reputational consequences of this long procedure, maintains the schedule of all its activities and programs,' said the statement from the African football controlling body.
