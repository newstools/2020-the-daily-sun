IZINYOKA have killed my daughter, says heartbroken mum Anita Thebekwane (21). Anita’s daughter Likuwe Thebekwane (3) was electrocuted on Saturday, 7 November in Alexandra, east of Joburg at about 7pm. Anita had gone to the toilet and left her little girl outside the door. A drunk allegedly had pushed the child into a hole with live wires. Likuwe was electrocuted and the left side of her body was badly burnt. Anita heard her crying, but didn’t think she was listening to her dying voice. A passerby heard Likuwe and then felt she was being shocked by the electricity and pulled her away by force. The child was still conscious. When the passerby called out for help, Anita came out of the toilet. That’s when she saw her badly burnt child. She couldn’t talk as she was in a state of shock. Her sister Babalwa Thebekwane (28) said Anita told them she saw a guy digging cables in the dark on her way to the toilet. “She asked the guy what he was doing and he told her she should mind her own business. Little did she know the same hole would kill her child.”  Babalwa said the guy who dug the hole has disappeared and no one knew where he was. “We took the child to the clinic but they told us she had died,” she said. Relative Yoliswa Moltino (36) said the family needed help. “We are all broke. We don’t know how we will bury her.” City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said they had a report of a child that was electrocuted. “This is a sad incident and we send our condolences to the family.” Mangena said illegal connections were dangerous. “They not only cost us millions in revenue, but are also a danger to particularly children. We appeal to the community not to connect electricity illegally. We will intensify our operations around cutting off illegal connections.”
