TRIBUTES and condolences continue to pour in for UDM councillor Mongameli Bobani, who died in hospital on Wednesday at the age of 52. He was admitted at St George’s Hospital after contracting Covid-19 three weeks ago. He had been a councillor of the UDM in the Nelson Mandela Bay for 18 years. The former number one citizen in the metro was booted out via a vote of no-confidence in December last year. He died while serving as the mayoral committee member responsible for infrastructure and engineering. Bobani was remembered for his dedication to serving the people of Nelson Mandela Bay. “Bobani’s loss is a wound that cuts deep and his energy, passion compassion and inimitable style will never be forgotten,” said acting mayor Tshonono Buyeye. “Councillor Bobani will be remembered as a committed and fearless servant of the people who dedicated his life to the betterment of the poor and downtrodden,” he said. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said: “The ANC conveys its deepest condolences to his family, friends and his political home, UDM. He will be remembered for his dedication and commitment to serve the people of Nelson Mandela Bay. We hope they will find comfort in the knowledge that many people share in their grief. We wish them strength and fortitude in their moment of pain.” Mandela Bay Development Agency board chairwoman Mandlakazi Skefile said: “Management and staff wish to send their deepest condolences to the late councillor Bobani’s family, his colleagues in council, and his party, the UDM. We wish his family strength and light during this difficult time.” DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga said Bobani would be remembered for his sense of humour. “We are deeply saddened by his passing,” he said.
