OUTGOING Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu, was described as humble, kind and friendly. These were the sentiments of mourners at Makwetu’s funeral service in Fourways today. His father-in-law, GM Makasi, said Makwetu was the epitome of a good mkhwenyana. “He was a good man. If anyone asked me how I want my son-in-law to be, I’d say he must be like Kimi. “He was always with us. I found Kimi to be a bold man. He was brave. “You could mention any problem and Kimi would never say no, it’s beyond his capacity.” He further described the late auditor-general as a clever man, who was always cool, calm and collected. “There was no time I ever found him to be otherwise. He was diligent and active. He wanted to do everything that needed be done and didn’t believe in delay tactics. “Young men these days believe in buying time. “He was an efficient man, always friendly with everybody in the family,” said Makasi. Makwetu’s funeral was held privately, but those who wished to be part of the send-off could do so through digital platforms. Friend Sipho Pityana said: “Today we’re joined in spirit. Today, we pay tribute to a gentle and an unwavering giant in the fight against corruption and maladministration. “As we celebrate his life, we must use this occasion to also pay tribute to the many public servants like him, whose mission in life is only to serve our people with honour, integrity and dignity.” Makwetu succumbed to lung cancer last week, a few weeks before his term as auditor-general was due to come to an end at the end of November. He was appointed to be part of the United Nation’s Independent Auditors Advisory Committee
