A couple of weeks ago a Russian YouTuber set his Mercedes Benz GT 63S on fire. The Merc owner reportedly got fed up with the endless battles he faced with a dealer where he bought the car. In a video that has gone viral on social media, the black Merc can be seen flexing its muscles and a moment later, it catches fire. Following that, the owner gets out of the car to inspect the huge flame underneath the car, and they use fire extinguishers to put out the fire. Their efforts to put out the fire donâ€™t help as the fire keeps coming back and burns the car to the ground.
