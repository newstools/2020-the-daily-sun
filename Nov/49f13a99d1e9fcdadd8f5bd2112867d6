WATER and detergents can really wear fabrics down and exposure to other factors such as soil and oil can leave your fluffy towel hard and worn out. Getting out of a refreshing bath or shower only to be met by a towel that seems like it has seen better days is not what anyone wants. Fortunately, with these tricks you can prevent your towels from getting hard. 1.Add vinegar – A TikTok user Mama_Mila shared a trick to prevent towels from becoming hard. In the video, she explains that you should wash the towels at a temperature of 40 to 60° C. “Add liquid detergent and 120 milliliters of white vinegar instead of fabric softener,” she wrote. “Vinegar breaks down the detergent residue, leaving the towels soft and fresh.” Say goodbye to crusty towels ?? ##TikTokTaughtMe ##learnontiktok ##hometips ##cleaningtips ##howto ##myhome ##bathroomcheck ##cleanhome ##tipsandtricks  2.Use Baking soda – This helps loosen up fibres and cleans off any chemicals or grime, making your towels softer.
