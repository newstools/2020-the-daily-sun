STELLENBOSCH FC defender Sibusiso Mthethwa has vowed that they will do everything in their power to stop Mamelodi Sundowns dead in their tracks when they face the defending DStv Premiership champions at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). The Brazilians, usually known for a slow start in recent seasons, have come flying out the blocks this term and look like they will take some stopping. Their new signings Peter Shalulile and Kermit Erasmus have slotted in seamlessly to the Brazilians attack and are combining well with Themba Zwane. This has seen the Tshwane giants swat aside just about every opponent they have faced in the league this season. The trio have scored the bulk of Downs’ goals this season and keeping them quiet has proved to be a near impossible task for their opponents so far. But Stellies centre back Mthethwa says they are fired up and looking forward to testing themselves against arguably the best attack in the league. Stellies, fresh from a 2-0 win over Chippa United in their last match, will travel to Tshwane hoping for another positive result. “We want to compete with the best and this is an opportunity to show that we are not just here to make up the numbers,” said Mthethwa. “We are well aware that we will have our hands full against a quality attack that Sundowns possess but we are confident that we can manage. “We defend as a team and attack as a team. We are not easy to break down because we understand our roles very well on the pitch. “If you concede fewer goals then you win the game and that’s what we try to do in every match. It will be no different against Sundowns. “They are a dangerous team but we believe In ourselves. We always fight for each other and the badge. We believe we can win, we fear no one. We are ready.”
