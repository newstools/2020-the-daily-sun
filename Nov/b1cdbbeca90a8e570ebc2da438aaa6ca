Kwaito musician Bhar is amazed at how people are reacting to his new single. The Uyabhampa singer released a single titled Moto – featuring Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha – on Friday, 6 November. He said the response to the song shocked him. Bhar told SunBuzz: “I’ve been releasing music for years, but never have people responded the way they did to Moto. “I’m surprised because when we were making this song we were just kidding, but people love it. “Since releasing the song on Friday, I’ve had messages from people asking me to come perform it at their events.” ALSO READ | ZAHARA CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY WITH STARS Explaining how the song came about, he said: “Babes, Mampintsha and I were chatting in studio and I wanted to leave. They said I should leave the car alone, get into studio and start recording. “So we took the word ‘moto’ and just started making the song. This shows talented people can make a song out of anything.” Bhar said his upcoming album will show just how talented he is. “It will be released in March. It will have gospel, hip hop, kwaito and gqom, and everyone will have a song they love on the album. “I want to show that I’m not just a kwaito artist,” he said. “I’ll feature DJ Tira, DJ Clock, Enzo and TNS. I can’t mention others because I’m still in talks with them,” said Bhar.
