A horror crash left 25 people injured this morning. This after a bus crashed into the side of a taxi at the Main Reef and Commando Road intersection in Riverlea, Joburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring told Daily Sun that ER24 along with several other services arrived on the scene to find the bus parked on the side of the road while the taxi was in the emergency lane. “Several people were found walking around on the scene while five patients were found in the bus. Medics carefully extricated the patients from the bus and thereafter tended to the patients on the scene,” said Meiring.  He also said on assessment, medics found that at least 25 people had sustained moderate injuries.  “Fortunately, no fatalities were found on the scene. The patients were treated by numerous services and thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further care,” he said. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
