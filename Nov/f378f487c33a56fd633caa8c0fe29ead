SIFISO Hlanti says Bafana will need to show a positive mentality to
overcome Sao Tome and Principe in the back-to-back qualifier matches at Moses
Mabhida Stadium on Friday and Nelson Mandela Bay, Port Elizabeth on Monday. The 30-year-old says he doesn't feel bad to have been left out of the squad by coach Molefi Ntseki as he has been inactive since the now defunct Bidvest Wits was sold to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. Hlanti will soon get back into the Bafana set-up since he has now joined Swallows FC. Said Hlanti: “It’s up to the guys how they respond. A positive approach
with a good mentality can see them win. I don’t have hard feelings (for being
left out) and I wish the team the best of luck, they need our support.”
