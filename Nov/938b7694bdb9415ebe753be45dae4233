THE by-elections voting in Naledi, Soweto, got off to a slow start yesterday as locals, who claim they haven’t had electricity for seven months, protested in the street and refused to vote. Fewer than expected people headed to the voting stations. Resident Matshidiso Mangola (43) told Daily Sun that after months of no power, Eskom gave them a switch-on date of 18 August. “Eskom asked for a 60-day postponement and have been postponing ever since. So we said we won’t vote,” said Matshidiso. EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the voting stations should be opened so that the people causing problems could be taken out. “Let’s remove the ANC that is abusing state resources,” he said.  ANC chairman in Gauteng David Makhura said as the premier of the province he’d follow-up with Eskom and the office of public enterprises. IEC spokeswoman Kate Bapela said they hadn’t received any incidents report apart from the protest in Soweto. “We’ve picked up some tension in the Vaal, but there are no protests,” she said. The tension started shortly after the ANC acting chairman in the province, Mandla Ndlovu, left after casting his vote. The members were seen pushing and grabbing each other as they wrestled at the voting station’s main entrance. They eventually calmed down and started singing slogan songs separately. EFF provincial chairman Collen Sedibe said people must embrace democracy. ANC regional task team co-ordinator Phazamisa Mathe said: “This is a highly contested ward, so they are likely to greet each other in style.”
