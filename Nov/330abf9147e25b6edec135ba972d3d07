MASTURBATION is demonic and makes people poor! This is according to Prophet Bernard Siame, who said for a man, each time you climax, you donate sperm to the demonic kingdom. “As a woman, each time you are masturbating, you are having sex with a demon and sometimes you get impregnated by a demon,” he said. He said single women who see themselves breastfeeding a baby in their dreams when they had none were looking at the children of the demon. Bernard shared a post on Facebook on Thursday, warning people about the dangers of masturbation.  He said many people would have been rich but because of masturbation, their wealth, luck and happiness had been donated to demons. “You would have been married by now but your feelings are gone because of masturbation. The enemy has come up with sex toys to aid masturbation. Sex toys is an industry of the devil,” said Bernard. He told the People’s Paper that this spirit of darkness was accompanied by the spirit of lust. “It leads people to pornography and sexual immorality,” said Bernard. “It is not harmless sex pleasure. People become permanently damaged and addicted.” He said people who masturbated tend to have anger issues and they lose touch with God. “Repent and your luck and fortunes will come back. You need to fight back,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to people who masturbate and some believe it was just self-pleasure, just like any other hobby. A man said this prevented him from getting into unnecessary relationships. “I don’t go around asking to have sex with women. If I’m not ready to be in a relationship then I’m just not ready,” he said. Another man said masturbation prevented him from begging for a poke. “Sometimes when my girlfriend is not in the mood I do this otherwise I’m unable to sleep. I’m a praying man. This demon claim can’t be true,” he said A woman said she loved her man but he didn’t give her the best sex. “I make myself happier than he does,” she said.
