A 42-YEAR-OLD woman filed for divorce because her husband loves sex to the extreme. The woman, from Milenge in Zambia, told a magistrate that she was diagnosed with an illness and was advised to reduce sex and heavy duties. She said she can’t keep up with her husband’s strange sexual appetite. According to the Lusaka Times, the couple has irreconcilable differences because of the husband’s unusual sexual demands. The wife said the illness resurfaces every time she engages in too much sex, but her husband has refused to obey the doctor’s guidance. “We have been married for seven years and my husband demands sex from me even when I am menstruating. But he also cheats on me because he engages in extramarital affairs with other women,” the wife told the publication. She added that what makes things worse is that the husband is allegedly a drunkard who does not financially support their two children.
