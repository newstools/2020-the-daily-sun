THE new Toyota C-HR GR Sport will have the Nissan Juke glaring at its owners with disgust, noticing they’re checking it out the C-HR. Toyota has revealed its exciting addition to the much-admired C-HR crossover. It’s inspired by Toyota’s performance-focused GR models and Toyota Gazoo Racing. The new GR Sport has sharper exterior and interior styling. The GR Sport roll-out continues, after the Corolla Hatch, and further helps build the Gazoo Racing brand. GR Sport represents the second tier in the GR-pyramid and includes bespoke visual and handling treatment. GR Sport models receive revised suspension tuning, bespoke alloy wheels, and other GR-inspired trim. The GR Sport includes a black emblem background and headlamp housings, a Piano Black finish to the centre bumper and fog lamp surrounds. Piano Black door moulding inserts are complimented by a model-unique “19” alloy wheel design.  The GR Sport is available in a choice of nine exclusive bi-tone colour schemes, including a new, model-unique Dynamic Grey finish with a black roof. Its interior features a new cool silver cabin finish and a choice of alcantara-trimmed leather or all-fabric seat upholstery, both enhanced by a GR-inspired red and grey stitching theme.  The C-HR GR Sport launched in 2016 and positioned as a dynamic crossover combining extravagant looks with the handling ability to match, yet delivering segment-best emissions performance. In its first year, the C-HR sold 120 000 units in Europe, instantly achieving a 10% share of the segment. This success story has continued and is equipped with a segment-unique choice of 1.8 litre 90 kW engine and is driven by more than 400 000 Europeans.
