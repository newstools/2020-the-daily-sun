THE overturning of charges against two farmworkers previously convicted of killing a teenager has been blamed on old and tired ANC MPs. ANC Youth League spokeswoman Sizophila Mkhize claimed white people get away with crime because MPs fail to transform the judicial system. She was speaking outside the Coligny Magistrates Court in the North West yesterday. Youth League members were protesting against the Supreme Court of Appeal decision to overturn the conviction of Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte. Mkhize said it was not too late for the pair to return to jail and demanded the Constitutional Court hear the matter.  She said government must allow young people to lead. “We’re stressed and angry over white supremacy that continues to reign in South Africa. We must fight against white supremacy, which continues to raise its ugly head. “Old people are tired. They’re sleeping in Parliament. We send them to transform the judicial system put there by apartheid, but they fight among each other. They forget about the poor majority of our people. You ruined the ANC.” In the morning before the protest, the parents of Matlhomola Mosweu, who the two men were accused of murdering, visited his gravesite. His mum Mmankhibidu cried uncontrollably, saying they’d have celebrated his 19th birthday in seven days time. “I wanted to tell him I see his killers every day. I saw both of them in the morning near my house.” The men, convicted by a lower court in January, were acquitted.
