THE dark horse of South African boxing, Prince “The Demon” Dlomo, said his surprise sixth round knockout victory against Xolisani Ndongeni has opened more fight opportunities for him. The unheralded fighter stunned Mzanis’s boxing community when he sent the favourite to the canvas with a left hook last month. The victory has boosted the Soweto-based fighter’s career. It has attracted fight opportunities beyond South African borders. Dlomo is scheduled to challenge SA junior middleweight champion Xolani “Tiger” Mcotheli on 12 December. “The win over Ndongeni has opened more doors for me. I was offered a fight in America but I could not go because of the Covid-19 travel restrictions. I had another offer in Germany, but I have prioritised the SA title over an overseas trip as the contest (offered) was a non-title fight,” he said. “All the attention now is on me. Remember Ndongeni is a highly rated in local boxing and before our clash he had not tasted defeat against a SA boxer. Going into that contest, most people did not give me a chance, but I have managed to steal the thunder from under his nose,” said Dlomo. According to the 31-year-old seasoned campaigner, the surprise victory also made him to view boxing differently. Dlomo said he is taking his craft more seriously now. “In the past, I was not giving boxing all the attention and focus it deserves and all that has changed. Now I see that boxing can improve my life for the better if I give it my undivided attention,” he said. Talking about his upcoming clash against national champ Mcotheli, Dlomo said he has started working in the gym to prepare for the fight. He has sent a strong warning to the Eastern Cape champion to come prepared. This will be Mcotheli’s third title defence. He scored a seventh round stoppage against Khumbulani Mdletshe to capture the vacant crown at East London’s Orient Theatre three years ago.
