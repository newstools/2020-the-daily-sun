Amapiano singer Killa Punch is going solo and has left Gigabyte hitmakers, Vusinator and Soso. The talented musician, whose real name is Nkululeko Mogale, decided to go solo after they disagreed on some things. Killa rose to fame last year when he, Vusinator and Soso releasedGigabyte, which has reached double platinum. He explained to SunBuzz why he decided to go solo. “Our issue started when we were approached by a big company, which offered to distribute our song,” he said. “I’d rather not name the company, but they exploited us to a point where we ended up fighting among ourselves. “That’s how we ended up separating. We had too many disagreements. “We weren’t really a group. We worked really well together, so we released most songs together.” ALSO READ | ZODWA: KHOTHA ME BABY! But they’ve worked things out and are fine now. “Fortunately, we’ve sorted it out and we’re on good terms now,” said Killa. “We came together and saw that we can’t be fighting over this and destroying our friendship. “We’re even working on new music together. It’s coming soon.” Killa released his debut EP, Sweet Revenge, on Friday last week. “I dropped a lead single for the EP titled Malunde in September and people loved it. I’ve finally dropped the EP. “I worked with Simple Tone, Kaybee Sax, Nkulee501, Kota Embassy and Hey K on the project.” Killa said he enjoys working on his music, and he markets it himself. “Even though I don’t have people that are pushing or marketing my music, I’m moving because music is in my blood,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s my music and I’ll hustle for it.”
