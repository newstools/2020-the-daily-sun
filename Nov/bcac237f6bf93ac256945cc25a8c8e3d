FROM the farm garage where their six dogs slept at night, to distilling using a makeshift copper still. This was the birth and narrative of Six Dogs Distillery.  Centred on innovation, passion, taste and presentation, Six Dogs Distillery prides itself in remaining humble and appreciative of the enormous support it gets from all its customers. After barely surviving the dire impact of Covid-19, the business managed to stay afloat through the 18 countries that export their products. This meant that their business model had to change to online sales and exports. Some of their amazing gin products include: Six Dogs Karoo, Six Dogs Blue, Six Dogs Pinotage Stained and the newly launched Six Dogs Honey Lime. Their range of gin is delectable and is proudly distilled the South African way. According to Six Dogs Distillery, the industry is growing rapidly, but sadly some of the distilleries are not making it. Greater focus on marketing myopia is needed, which is part of what they do as Six Dogs Distillery. After five years of distilling, their future in delivering the best products with the greatest humility remains their top priority. Their amazing products are available at specialty liquor stores, major retailers and via their website www.sixdogs.co.za.
