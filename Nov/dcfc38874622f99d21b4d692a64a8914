ANY doubts about the Bloemfontein Celtic’s seriousness with their Caf Confederation Cup campaign were swiftly quashed yesterday. Far away in DR Congo, Siwelele got their campaign off to a flying start with a 2-0 preliminary round, first leg win over AS Maniema Union at Joseph Kabila Kabange Stadium. Two quickfire goals from Harris Tchilimbou and Menzi Ndwandwe set the tone for a gutsy win for the South African side. Tchilimbou struck first, as early as the fifth minute while Ndwandwe added the second in the ninth minute. John Maduka’s men went into battle without their commander as Maduka stayed behind for their midweek league fixture against Black Leopards. The team was guided in combat by his lieutenants Ditheko Mototo and Abram Nteo, the duo recording the biggest career victory of their respective young coaching careers. Winning on the continent is often a near-impossible mission for touring side, South African teams invariably falling at the first hurdle mainly due to inexperience. But it was a good week all round for Celtic, accomplishing their mission of winning their league DStv Premiership match at home and chalking up a massive victory in Kindu. Despite the absence of cavalrymen, Ndumiso Mabena, Victor Letsoalo, Jackson Mabokgwane, Lucky Baloyi and Lantshene Phalane, Maduka’s side put one foot in the first round of the Confederation Cup. The likes of Tchilimou, Ndwandwe, Thato Lengwathi, Shadrack kobedi and Teboho Khasipe did the job. Celtic are due back home on Thursday and will quickly resume preparations for the return leg in Bloemfontein. Despite their well-documented challenges, Phunya Sele Sele have punched above their weight.  They qualified for their maiden Caf tournament after finishing as runners-up in the Nedbank Cup.  They are set to contest the top-eight final with Orlando Pirates next week.  Maduka has insisted participation in the gruelling competition will give his players a chance to learn and gain experience.          -- tso
