IT seems actor Vuyo Dabula is gearing to leave SABC1’s Generations: The Legacy. According to sources on the soapie, the star was given an ultimatum by producers. “They placed two options before him, either he chooses to stay with the show or goes to shoot the upcoming season of Netflix’s Queen Sono, but he chose to leave. “He made his decision earlier this month and will be leaving the show shortly,” said a source. Another source said Vuyo’s decision shocked his colleagues as they thought he would choose to stay because it’s more stable. “It makes no sense for him to choose to leave a show that gives him financial stability. He is leaving behind a stable salary. We knew about the ultimatum he was given, but his decision came as a shock because he’s one of the lead actors on the show. “Writers are now scrambling to find ways to write his exit storyline, which is a difficult task as they are getting ready to shoot the new season,” said a second source.A third source said Vuyo had been thinking of leaving the show two years ago already. “He’s been thinking of leaving and I guess now is the perfect time for him to leave. Being on Queen Sono is a big thing for him,” said the source. While Vuyo is gearing to leave Generations, Kay Sibiya will soon make his appearance on the show playing Vusi Kunene’s onscreen son. “He is joining soon because he went through an audition process. There were three other contenders for this role, but Kay came out on top. He will play Luyolo,” said another source. When approached for comment Vuyo said: “I was going to reveal this, but I guess it is what is.”
