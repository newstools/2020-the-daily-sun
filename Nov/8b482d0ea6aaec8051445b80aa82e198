“IT’S a shame that since 2013, residents have been struggling with a tiny clinic and government isn’t doing anything about it.” Those were the words of ACDP president Reverend Kenneth Meshoe during a march to Kekanastad Clinic in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, on Thursday, 26 November. Meshoe said although construction on the clinic started in 2013, it was still incomplete. He was told it would be opened in July. Meshoe said it was not right that government only wanted to deliver services for its own benefit. “Residents are tired of queuing in the sun when they come to the clinic. They deserve a proper clinic and deserve it now.” Meshoe said he was committed to pushing government to do the right thing. “When I make a promise, I intend to keep it. Next February, we’ll come back and if this clinic isn’t open, we’ll have a huge protest.” Resident Thato Mafoko said they needed the clinic to open as they were struggling. “He said there were many elderly citizens in the community. “The clinic was meant to be opened a long time ago. No one tells us what the hold-up is.” Happy Moloi said it was the rainy season and the clinic was too small for everyone to fit in. “The unfinished clinic is big and will accommodate everyone.” The project’s steering committee chairwoman Tidimatso Malati said she had been in talks with stakeholders about the clinic’s construction. She said there were issues with the provincial government and the City of Tshwane. “We’ve set up a meeting to discuss a way forward regarding the completion.”
