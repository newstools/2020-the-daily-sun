The matric dance is something every pupil looks forward to, but it’s the after party that makes one uneasy. Kids go all out just to go make irresponsible decisions, not to mention disappointing parents. It’s scary to see that having fun is so much more important than anything else. These kids should remember their normal lives need to continue after all, and that their bad decisions will have serious consequences such as threatening their entry into higher education institutions. Young people, think carefully before you make that decision. Don’t only think about that moment of fun, but remember your life needs to continue afterwards. Letter by Nolo, Joburg
