THE classmates of two siblings doused with petrol and set alight say it will be difficult to go to school without them. Karabo (11) and Nokubonga Shabangu (10) died of their injuries on Friday, 13 November, after being attacked on Tuesday. It’s believed their father, France Shabangu (43), bought the petrol on Tuesday afternoon and set them alight along with their mum Gladys Mokoena (45) that evening. Gladys, who has since been discharged from hospital, didn’t attend the memorial service held on Tuesday, 17 November. Their father killed himself after hearing the kids had died. Speaking to the SunTeam at the memorial service at Chakaza Primary School in Zwelisha, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, grade 5 pupil Amantha Msibi (11) said she couldn’t believe it when she heard they had died. “I loved Nokubonga. We were good friends. She shared everything with me, even if it was just a sweet. I’m hurt that she left me with no other friends,” she said. Amantha said she had hoped they would attend high school and university together. “We always shared our dreams. She wanted to be a pilot, build her mum a beautiful home and buy her a car,” she said. Karabo’s classmate and friend, Avoid Ngobeni (12) said after he heard Karabo’s house had burned down, he went to see. “Everything was gone. I couldn’t believe it. Karabo was always there for us, but we couldn’t be there when he needed us the most,” he said. Family member Solly Silinda (46) said the incident came as a shock as France had no history of domestic violence. The children will be buried on Saturday at Hlabekisa in Graskop.
