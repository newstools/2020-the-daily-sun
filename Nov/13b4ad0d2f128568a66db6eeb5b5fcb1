Arrived. Promised. Conquered. This is how Al Ahly has described their incredible coach Pitso Mosimane after gifting Africa's Club of the Century their ninth Caf Champions League title when they nipped Zamalek 2-1 in the final of Africa's premier league on Friday night. This is Mosimane's second star after having cut his teeth with Mamelodi Sundowns in 2016. This is one big achievement that it will go in history where Mosimane has won this continental title twice in four years with different teams. "We did it," that was the message from Red Eagles chairman, Mahmoud El Khatib, as he hugs the Kagiso-born coach. This is the sixth Champions League victory for Al Ahly over Zamalek who have only beaten them once."We still remember and celebrate our iconic 6-1 victory over Zamalek in 2002, but thanks to our victory in the CAF Champions League Final makes it another 6-1 for us over Zamalek in Africa," Al Ahly said in a statement."Friday night’s victory is our sixth victory over our rivals in African competitions and we only lost one match against them. "Our first match against Zamalek in Africa was in 1994 in the CAF Super Cup and we lost the match 1-0."Eleven years later, we met Zamalek again in the CAF Champions League semi-finals and won both legs 2-0 and 2-1. "Our third victory over Zamalek in the African Competitions came in 2008 when we won one match over Zamalek in the competition’s group stage while the second match ended with a draw. "We achieved our fourth victory over Zamalek in 2012 CAF Champions League group stage thanks to a goal from Mohamed Abou Trika, while the fifth victory came at the same stage in the next season. "We achieved our sixth victory in African competitions over Zamalek on Friday night at the CAF Champions League final." South Africa also joined in the Egyptians as it celebrated their big achievement.
