 EDENGLEN High School in Edenvale, Ekurhuleni turned into a war zone on
Tuesday, 10 November. And the pupils were caught on video fighting gang style. They exchanged blows and kicked one another outside the school premises,
leaving parents disappointed. Parent, Joseph Juda, told Daily Sun the incident happened while they
were in mourning. “Three kids from Edenglen died in a car accident last Friday. We were
still mourning those kids when the fighting broke out. We condemn it,” he said. Another parent, Octavia Simba, said: “If these kids don’t want to
respect us, their teachers and the MEC, they should have respected their fellow
pupils who tragically died. Starting a fight before they were even buried is
disrespect.” The parents said they wanted all those who were part of the fight to be
punished. “We do not need this kind of the behaviour in our area. They should be
dealt with harshly,” said Andrew Mosesi, chairman of the community polling
board in Ekurhuleni. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Wednesday, 11
November. He was informed that the fight was sparked by R25 that one pupil owed
the other. He condemned the incident, emphasising that it was not to be tolerated. He said their psycho social team was dispatched to the school to support
all those affected by the incident. The violence allegedly involved about 10 pupils, but some of them don’t
go to Edenglen. An investigation to identify them is currently underway. The School Governing Body undertook to immediately take necessary
disciplinary action against all those involved in the incident and would
provide Lesufi with a report.
