She is a chartered accountant and a registered auditor, who holds a B Comm (Accounting) and a Post-Graduate Diploma in Accountancy from the University of Cape Town. She also obtained a Post-Graduate Diploma in Development and Public Management from the University of the Witwatersrand in 2016. Maluleke has more than 20 years of experience in the private and public sectors, spanning diverse areas including auditing, consulting and corporate advisory. Since 2014 she has served as the deputy auditor-general and CEO of the Office of the Auditor-General of South Africa – the first woman to hold this executive position in the organisation’s history. - EWN
