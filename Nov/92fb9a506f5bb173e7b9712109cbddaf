I’ve never taken part in any election since the first democratic election in 1994, but I’ve benefitted a lot from the black government. In my village, I have a house with a JoJo tank, electricity, a water tap inside my yard and my kids are getting grants. They also attend no-fee schools while two are studying towards nursing and teaching degrees at universities through Nsfas. In my village, we have received almost everything from our government. I’m a lucky man to benefit ahead of those South African citizens who queued on sunny and rainy days just to cast their votes, but now they are crying out for service delivery in their communities. Voting has nothing to do with service delivery. It’s just a selection system to elect leaders for all the people living within Mzansi’s borders. Voting is not service delivery and service delivery is not voting. Letter by Simo Shangase , from Denver Hostel, Joburg
