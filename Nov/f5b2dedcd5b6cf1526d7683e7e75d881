MATRICS wrote paper two for home languages yesterday, and while some said it was easy, others were scared they would fail. Karabo Maeko (20) from Stanza Bopape Secondary School in Mamelodi, Tshwane, said he was confident he’ll ace the Sepedi exam as his teachers had been committed to helping pupils. “Although it was difficult studying during the pandemic, our teachers made sure they helped us,” he said. “The difficult thing about studying during lockdown was that we were sometimes sent home due to positive cases but we didn’t let this discourage us.” Emmanuel Chaane said he faced many challenges, but was determined to do well. He said he was sure he would get 80% or more. “Sepedi is my favourite subject and I have no doubt I will do well. I’m grateful to my teachers for helping us throughout this difficult time,” he said. Pupils at Millennium Combined School in Madiba Park outside Polokwane, Limpopo, had mixed feelings. Mpoki Mabotja (17) said he had a good time writing the exam. “I revised a lot and used previous question papers,” he said. Rufus Mamabolo (18) said he didn’t have much time to revise as he had to focus on economics paper two. “The paper was bad for me and I regret not spending more time revising,” he said. Pupils at Rauwane Sepeng High School in Rustenburg, North West, said Setswana paper two was a breeze. “Everything I studied was in it. I’m sure I have 90% in the bag,” she said.
