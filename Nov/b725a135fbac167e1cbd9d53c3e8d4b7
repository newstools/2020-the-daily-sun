BLOEMFONTEIN residents woke up to the sad news after a crash
between a bus and a car claimed six lives in the early hours of Sunday morning. The accident, which happened on the crossroad of R702 and
N6, also claimed the lives of a 15 month-old baby and a little girl (4). All passengers in the bus were not injured. Free State health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said the accident
happened at about 1am on Sunday. Mvambi said: “At about 1am, Free State EMS services
responded to a bus and a car accident at the crossing of R702 of N6 (Dewetsdorp/Reddersburg crossing) in Bloemfontein.  “Two people suffered critical injuries and six were declared
dead on scene. All the injured and the dead were from the car and patients were
transported to Pelonomi Trauma unit. The bus had about 58 passengers who were
treated and observed for shock and later transported to Bloemfontein Tourism
Centre. The dead were two men aged about 40, a woman (35), a 15-year-old baby
girl, a four-year-old girl. The police will be investigating culpable homicide.”  In another incident, a BMW driver was lucky to be alive
after he crashed under the truck on the same day at Nelson Mandela and Jac Van
Rhyn Road in Bloemfontein. A blue BMW ended under on the side of a truck but the car
driver, who was driving alone, escaped with his life. James Lepato (28) told Daily Sun: “I was shocked to see that
the driver of the BMW was still alive. His ancestors have really saved him. Hi
car is badly damaged. You would think no one came out alive of it. God is
amazing indeed.”
