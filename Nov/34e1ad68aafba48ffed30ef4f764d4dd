CHIPPA United coach Lehlohonolo Seema is happy to be back in DStv Premiership action soon and is hoping that his side can start to build some momentum. The Chilli Boys have had a decent start to the season, picking up four points out of a possible nine in the three matches they have played so far. They face Stellenbosch FC in their next match at the Danie Craven Stadium on Saturday (3.30 pm) looking to get points on the board in the early stages of the season. Seema, though, is not expecting Steve Barker’s Stellies to roll over easily for them, especially at their own backyard. Nevertheless, the Chilli Boys will have one mission, to turn Stellies over and go back to Port Elizabeth with maximum points. “It’s good that PSL fixtures are back again this week,” said Seema. “We are up against Stellenbosch FC in their backyard. It will be a difficult game, Stellies are always a tough nut to crack but we are up for it. “Stellies will come out all guns blazing, especially because they will be playing at home. “It is always important to try and get maximum points when you play at home so we go there knowing exactly what to expect. “We will never be naïve and shy away, we will face them head-on.” Seema, like many coaches after the international break, is sweating over the fitness of some of his players. But the former Bloemfontein Celtic mentor is crossing fingers that he will have a fully fit squad to pick from at the weekend. “We are hoping that the knocks we have in the team will be all sorted by then but we will wait for the guidelines from the medical team as far as that is concerned,” added Seema. “We have a few concerns with some players but we will see at the end of the week how far we are and how many players we have.”
