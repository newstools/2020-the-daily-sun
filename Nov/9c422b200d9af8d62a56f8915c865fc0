PUBLIC Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan makes accusations without evidence, said Advocate Dali Mpofu, representing former Sars commissioner Tom Moyane at the Zondo Commission on Monday, 30 November. Gordhan claimed there was enough evidence that Moyane was involved in state capture, and he first started to suspect this in 2016 when he was finance minister. Mpofu said Gordhan accused a number of people, including former president Jacob Zuma of being involved in state capture without proof and could be guilty of perjury. Gordhan responded: “That’s not true. There is enough evidence. There’s no issue of perjury.” He said his evidence was in the Nugent Report, which looked into tax administration and governance at Sars. “If I were you I would stay away from the Nugent report,” said Mpofu. Gordhan replied: “You are not me.” Mpofu said: “Yes, I’m not you. Thank God.” Gordhan claimed specialist units were dismantled during Moyane’s tenure, resulting in loss of revenue and low tax compliance at Sars. He said Moyane was motivated wholly or in part to advance objectives of state capture. According to Moyane, the hostility against him was caused, among other things, by Gordhan’s arrogance, jealousy, racism and by Gordhan’s own involvement in state capture. “All of those assertions have no foundation whatsoever. I emphatically deny those assertions,” said Gordhan, who previously told the inquiry in 2018 Moyane maliciously laid a criminal complaint against him. It has since emerged Moyane never laid a complaint against the minister. “It wasn’t out of intent. It was lack of information available at the time,” said Gordhan.
