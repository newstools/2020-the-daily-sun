LOCKDOWN House Party presenter Mpumi “Msakazi” Mlambo has scored a presenting gig on Ghanaian online radio, LiveXtra. Msakazi, who co-hosted the Channel O music show with Robot Boii, said 2020 has been an amazing year for her. The show she’s hosting on LiveXtra is called MzansiXtra. She’s been hosting it since September. She told Daily Sun: “Every week, I share about amazing South African musicians. Shining the spotlight on artists that I think people need to be on the lookout for. “I find artists with a unique style and offer a sound that Ghanaians might not be familiar with, one that’s fresh and represents us as a country. I also plug them on the latest artists who are popping and old artists as well,” said Msakazi. The radio personality, who also hosts the Power Lounge, which airs between 10pm and 2am on weekends on Power FM, got this gig after interviewing two Ghanaian artists.

Both these interviews granted me an opportunity to be on LiveXtra as a presenter. “Honestly, this is an opportunity that I will be eternally grateful for. After Ghana it’s to other African countries and then the world,” said Msakazi. MzansiXtra airs every Friday at 6.30pm on the LiveXtra website.
