WE are on the last lap of 2020 and the month is November. The month has globally been recognised as #Movember, which is a month dedicated to highlight the importance of men’s health.

Frequent ejaculation may well give you some protection against prostate cancer, especially if you’re 50 or older. 2. A cup of coffee Drinking 4-5 cups of coffee every day can lower your chances of fatal and high-grade prostate cancer, according to a 2014 review of clinical studies. 3. Eat tomatoes and other red foods Tomatoes, watermelon, and other red foods owe their bright colour to a powerful antioxidant called lycopene. Some recent studies show that men who consume this fruit and tomato-based products have a lower risk of prostate cancer than those who don’t.
