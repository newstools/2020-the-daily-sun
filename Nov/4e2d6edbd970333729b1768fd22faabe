FORMER Baroka FC captain Gerald Phiri Jnr has vowed that Bakgaga will maintain the good form they have shown so far this season. Baroka are the only DStv Premiership side to have won both their opening league matches and are currently at the summit of the table after collecting six points. And the Malawian international believes the Ga-Mphahlele side, who are being led by their assistant coach Matsimela Thoka, will continue with the good form when they host Golden Arrows in a league clash at Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow night (7.30pm). Thoka has been given a chance to be at the helm, as head coach Dylan Kerr has been suspended by the club. “It’s a good feeling when you are winning games and our aim is to continue with that,” said Phiri. “Last season was tough and we don’t want to go through that situation of fighting relegation again. This season we have a strong team and we understand each other well. We are aware that it is not going to be easy. But we are ready to fight until the end. “It’s a nice feeling to be at the top of the log. We are not going to put pressure on ourselves. Our aim is to take it one game at a time and keep fighting. Our focus now is Arrows and we are playing at home and we cannot afford to lose games at home.” And for the 2018 Telkom Knockout Cup champions to maintain their good run, the 27-year-old is putting his trust in his teammates and striking partners Richard Mbulu and Evidence Makgopa. Mbulu has scored three goals in two matches, while Makgopa has netted once. “I see these two guys (Mbulu and Makgopa) giving a lot of teams problems this season,” said the former Ajax Cape Town midfielder. “They have started in fine form and understand each other. I see them scoring many goals for us. “How they play during the game it’s what they are doing at training. “They are so impressive even at training. I hope they can avoid injuries as we need them fully fit.”
