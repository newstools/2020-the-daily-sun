THE Super Rugby Unlocked can never quite be like the original 15-team provincial tournament. But the performances from local teams are proof that local fans are missing out on some great action, unable to attend the game due to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. No doubt the Griquas would have gotten over the line with an extra push from their fans against the Sharks in Kimberley at the weekend. Leading by a narrow two points, the Griquas contrived to lose the match 34-33, watching as Curwin Bosch slot a last-minute penalty from a fatal mistake they committed. But Thembelani Bholi and Phendulani Buthelezi had a great game, with the duo playing out of their skins as the Sharks staged a last quarter comeback. The win has edged the Durbanites closer to the log leaders Bulls, equal with the Stormers with 17 points. The Stormers hardly broke a sweat to keep their second spot with a 30-13 win against the Cheetahs. Playing in their last match as the Stormers at Newlands Stadium, the Cape franchise built on their victory against the Griquas last week to maintain pressure on the Bulls. Like the Sharks, the Stormers had started the Super Rugby campaign in fine form and had looked early favourites for a semifinal spot, despite fierce competition from tough New Zealand teams. “To get a win in Newlands, the last time the Stormers will play here, is quite special,” said Man of the match Frans Malherbe. But it gets tougher for the Stormers, visiting the Sharks next week. The result for either side will be massive in as far as chasing the Bulls for the top spot is concerned. The Griquas are still winless in five matches, but on their performance against the Sharks, they will a safe bet for a maiden win. But they can certainly do with the extra man in the stands.
