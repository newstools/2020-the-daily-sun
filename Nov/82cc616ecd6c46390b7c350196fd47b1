IF THIS SunHero didn’t save the Chaukes’ one child from a deadly fire, they would have been preparing to bury two of their kids. Ntombifuthi Moephudi (36) from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she felt guilty for not being able to save the other child. She told the SunTeam on Saturday morning she was doing laundry when her seven-year-old son told her there was smoke coming from the Chaukes’ shack. She rushed to the shack, but the door was locked. “I called out to the people inside and the kids responded. I told them to come closer and kick the door.” When the door opened, she grabbed the girl in front, but when she turned away, the door closed behind her. “When I tried to go back for the boy, something fell from the roof and the flames were too big. I couldn’t reach him. The boy called my name. I was screaming on the other side, but it was impossible to go inside,” she said She said his cries were haunting her. The family told Ntombifuthi she did all she could do.  “She helped us. We could be burying two kids, ” said uncle Elijah Chauke (42). Eniya Sithole (47) said she left her daughter Simphiwe Chauke (4) and her grandson, Luka Chauke (7) asleep and locked the door when she went to the shop. She was called by people telling her there was a fire in her shack. “I don’t understand how the fire started,” she said. Luka’s mum, Selina Chauke (28), who stays in Mpumalanga, immediately took the taxi back. “I got home and found my son had died and my sister was in hospital. It’s hard to accept but we know it was God’s plan.” Elijah said they couldn’t afford to bury the child. “We hope someone will assist us to bury Luka. We ask for help with clothes, furniture and groceries.” Landlady Nthabiseng Nkosi (38) said their house was damaged on the side next to the shack. “We are also unemployed. We would appreciate help to repair it.” She gave the Chauke family her house and a room to mourn in. Anyone who is willing to help can call the People’s Paper.
