THE Khoisan protesters camping outside the Union Buildings say they hunted pigeons during level five lockdown to survive. King Khoisan SA said as no tourists were visiting the site in Tshwane, life became very difficult. He said the pigeons earlier became their friends when they gave them pieces of bread, but they were later forced to eat the birds to survive. They previously got money from tourists who took photos with them. The Khoisan group has been camping outside the Union Buildings since 30 November 2018. They plan to celebrate the anniversary. King Khoisan said there were claims that the Department of Public Works was planning to get a court order to evict them. “We have positioned ourselves that we will not accept or sign an eviction order. We will tell officials we need President Cyril Ramaphosa to engage with us,” said King Khoisan. “An official from the public works department told us last week that a court order might be issued. The department cut the lights for four months at one point and we were living in the dark.” He said it was believed the department wanted to move them to extend a pavement. “They said they will open a case of vandalism against us,” he said. King Khoisan said they had not yet received an official letter. “We will only move when the president addresses us and nothing else. Even the police will not remove us,” he said. Public works spokeswoman Zara Nicholson said: “The minister was not consulted on the matter and has requested that the matter be put on hold until she has been consulted.”
