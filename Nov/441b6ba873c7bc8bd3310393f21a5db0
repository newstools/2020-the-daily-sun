FORMER Boxing South Africa (BSA) championship belt sponsor, Old Buck Gin, will make a return to local boxing after a 12-year absence. The liquor brand is back in the sport with a series of boxing competitions to honour fighters and award them financially for thrilling performances. Devon Currer, who will run the competition on behalf Old Buck, will select the best performance from a male or female boxer in a tournament. The chosen individual will get a performance bonus and his or her name will go forward to be selected for the overall winner at the end of the series. “In each tournament where I am the ring announcer, I will select the best fighter of the tournament who will get a performance bonus of R5 000. “The fighter who wins the most performance bonuses through the first season will receive the overall winner’s cheque and the Old Buck Gin Champion of Champions belt,” said Currer. “It is fantastic news for these fighters and through the performance bonus system, it will maintain the prestige of the Old Buck belt. “The boxers will benefit financially and SA boxing also stand to benefit in the long run.” The sponsors who used to occupy a prominent space in South African boxing from 1976 to 2008 will not replace the current national championship belt. Meanwhile, Currer said that the most important thing is to get the first season of the competition right. He added that the public needs to see that Old Buck is making its way back to the sport by honouring fighters and awarding them money. In the past, Old Buck Gin was also the makers of the most exclusive belt in boxing, who awarded these belts to 44 South Africans and 42 world champions. Among the leading boxers who’ve been awarded the belts are Dingaan Thobela, Jacob Matlala, Vuyani Bungu, Brian Mitchell, Gerrie Coetzee, Vuyani Nene, Winky Wright and Simon Ramoni.
