DIVINE intervention may not heal the families who lost their loved ones through gender-based violence. But prayer goes a long way in giving the affected families closure. On Sunday, families of victims and survivors of GBV gathered at the Kopanong Hall in Dobsonville, Soweto, for a prayer as the Gauteng community safety department closed off the five days of mourning for GBV victims. The family of Tshegofatso Pule, who was heavily pregnant when she was killed, said they were looking forward to welcoming the new addition in the family. But to their disappointment, Tshegofatso and her unborn baby’s lives were cut short. Neo Giwu, Tshegofatso’s aunt, said: “It still feels like a dream. She was still very young for us to refer to her now as the deceased. “Besides being young, we were looking forward to having a grandchild. It was going to be the first grandchild in the family. “Unfortunately, we’re in this position – no grandchild, no mother. The pain is so intense and it’s difficult to sleep.” They want justice for Tshegofatso’s death even though it won’t bring her and her unborn baby back. Giwu said it was helpful to be part of Sunday’s prayer.  “Prayers are important. When you’re alone, you become weak. At least when you have people who give you a shoulder to cry on you become strong. “Today’s prayer gives us a step forward, and it shows it is still remembered that we are in pain. Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said the justice system is failing women, particularly the GBV victims.  “The justice system is forever failing women, because cases are still dragging in court. Some dockets have gone missing. “There’s a case of a five-year-old in White City, where the chief prosecutor said that case is not prosecutable.  “Some dockets have been closed, because cases are not prosecutable.” She said sometimes the NPA or the police don’t tell the family about the status of their cases.
