TAVERN owners have committed themselves to responsible operations during the festive season. During a Taverners Summit at Kameeldrift, Tshwane, responsible trading and consumer behaviour were addressed. The event was hosted by the Gauteng Department of Economic Development and the Gauteng Liquor Board, in partnership with spirits maker Diageo SA. Diageo corporate relations director, Sibani Mngadi, said the tavern industry should play its role in promoting responsible behaviour. “As we begin to sell, let’s avoid taking shortcuts to recover losses,” he said. The ban on the sale of alcohol and the ban on exports from Mzansi saw an annual loss of R54,7 billion to the country. “The ban resulted in the loss of 165 371 jobs in the industry,” he said. According to Mngadi, the industry was focusing on ensuring registered liquor outlets trade in a responsible manner to curb the spread of Covid-19, as well as shaping the economic recovery. He appealed to tavern owners to avoid taking more than the 50% capacity of patrons required under lockdown rules and to comply with the midnight curfew. “It’s our duty as traders to teach patrons social distancing, wearing of masks and the use of sanitisers.” Chief executive officer of the Gauteng Liquor Authority, Raymond Martin, said non-compliance was everyone’s problem. He urged liquor outlet owners to trade responsibly and play their part in combatting gender-based violence. There are 34 500 registered licenced tavern owners in Mzansi supporting more than 200 000 dependents. With taverns at the centre of ekasi and rural economies, tavern owners can contribute meaningfully in helping address Covid-19 and gender-based violence.
