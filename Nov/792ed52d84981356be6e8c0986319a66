You will be tried and tested but victorious you shall emerge. I’m still standing. My heart and home are full of love and laughter. Our mini-mes are growing and doing amazingly well, the strongest, smartest, hilarious and kind twins I know. They are perfectly splendid. In this life you must know to whom you belong... phetha, phasa, rapela,” she said. Her pregnancy is the reason she took some time off from the show, where she plays a mother to two sons.
