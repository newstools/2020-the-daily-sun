THERE were mixed feelings after grade 12 pupils wrote the Tswana exam on Tuesday, 10 November. Oratile Mphahlane (18) from PHL Moraka High School in Temba in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, didn’t know what to expect as this was their first paper. “I went into the exam room terrified as I don’t want to fail. Studying was difficult because I couldn’t study with my friends due to Covid-19 regulations. I hope I’ve done well enough to pass,” Oratile said. Otsile Moeng (17) said the exam was a bit difficult. “I was familiar with the content because our teachers taught us, but it was difficult because we didn’t prepare well.” He said they didn’t have enough time to prepare because of the pandemic. Pupils from Hans Kekana High School in Mashimong, Hammanskraal felt differently. Keketso Magadane (22) said he was sure he would pass with a distinction. “Although we studied under pressure, I’m sure I’m going to pass,” he said. Mozarine Dibetso (20) said the paper was a bit hectic, but she tried her best. “ I studied and that made it easy. I made sure I answered all the questions. But I’m sure I’ve passed.” “I’m confident I nailed it as it included all the things I knew,” she said. Lesego Baloi (17) said: “Everything I studied for and knew was in the paper. I know I have done well.” Nkamogeleng Rasesemola (18) said: “I went into the exam room ready as I used previous exam question papers to prepare for this exam. I know I did well and will pass.” Tasky said he finished writing after an hour, while Polite said it was fair.
