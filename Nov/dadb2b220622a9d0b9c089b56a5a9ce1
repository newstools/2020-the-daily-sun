LUVUYO Memela scored twice to help AmaZulu FC overcame Black Leopards 2-0 in the DStv Premiership match at the Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Wednesday night. The win took Usuthu to the ninth spot on the league standings with four points from three games, while Lidoda Duvha are placed 16th on the log without a single point. Usuthu dominated possession in the opening stages and they were looking to test Jonas Mendes in the Lidoda Duvha goal-posts. Memela placed his effort wide of the target, before Lehlohonolo Majoro and Augustine Mulenga fired over the crossbar within the first 15 minutes of the match. The Leopards defence was solid and compact and AmaZulu resorted to long-range shots which could not seriously test Mendes. The visitors grew in confidence after the half-hour mark as they looked to break the lock with Lefa Hlongwane leading their attack. However, Leopards were unable to unlock the AmaZulu defence which was marshalled by former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Mario Booysen. The score was 0-0 at the interval in Durban. Usuthu created goalscoring opportunities after the restart following their half-time team talk with coach Ayanda Dlamini, but they were wasteful. Mulenga had a chance to score near the box, but the Zambia international curled his effort wide of the target five minutes before the hour-mark. Dlamini then introduced Siphelele Mthembu and Sibusiso Magaqa in the 66th minute as the home side pushed for the opening goal and they got it. Magaqa made an immediate impact as he set-up Memela, who hit the back of the net to make it 1-0 to AmaZulu in the 77th minute. The momentum was with Usuthu and Memela completed his brace when he beat Mendes for the second time to seal AmaZulu's 2-0 win seven minutes left on the clock. -SUPERSPORT.COM
