ULULATING could be heard when Mandisa Meyiwa walked into her in-laws’ yard in Umlazi, south of Durban. She was there on Saturday for the unveiling of her late husband Senzo’s tombstone and for a ritual to bring his spirit back home. It’s unclear when Mandisa last visited the family. She was accompanied by a few of her relatives and welcomed by Senzo’s brother Sfiso, as well as a few of Senzo’s relatives. In typical Zulu makoti, down-to-earth fashion, she politely declined to be interviewed by the SunTeam. The two rituals started on Thursday with the slaughtering of a goat. “The goat was meant to appease the Meyiwa ancestors and bring back Senzo’s spirit,” said Sfiso. “At this point, we can say Senzo’s spirit is finally back home. “We initially intended to do this ceremony on Saturday, but decided to start on Thursday due to preparations and a series of activities that had to take place.” He said Thursday’s ceremony was small and only involved family and close friends. “We’re glad everything went well. We slaughtered cows on Saturday and had public festivities yesterday. “We’ll do Senzo’s tombstone unveiling tomorrow. This will be the final leg of the ceremony. “The unveiling will take place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in the presence of the Bafana Bafana squad. “We’ll then head to Senzo’s grave, where the unveiling will take place.” About Mandisa’s presence, Sfiso said: “We’re happy Mandisa came to observe her husband’s ceremony. “She’s always be part of the Meyiwas and we welcome her.”
