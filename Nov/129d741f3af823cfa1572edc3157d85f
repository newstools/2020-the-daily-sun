If you are anything like me, then you should be bumping some Michael Gray round about now proclaiming loudly: “I can’t wait for the weekend to begin.” The weekend is here and the throats are indeed open for some percentage beverages. Citing sporting and other social events as the reason for our drinking spree, it is almost inevitable that one will suffer a hangover. Yes, the unpleasant symptoms that occur after excessive alcohol intake. These are fatigue, thirst, headache, nausea, light and sound sensitivity and dizziness. So, if you will be out and about this weekend, here are some creative ways of curing that hangover: 1. Eat a honey toast sandwich Scientific evidence has shown that a big, greasy breakfast will cure your hangover, and a honey coated toast is what the doctor ordered. 2. Drink a lot of ginger, including ginger tea Ginger can help soothe an upset stomach and if it’s from a hangover, then ginger is for you. 3. Have some avocado toast Avocados help protect your liver against injury, so they’re a particularly good food to eat when you’re having a hangover.
