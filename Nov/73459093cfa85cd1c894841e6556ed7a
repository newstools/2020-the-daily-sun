THE bail application of the suspects accused of killing two
businesswomen in Polowane, Limpopo last month was postponed to Friday, 13
November. This is because the state needs to verify the relationship
the suspects have with their children after they submitted them as exceptional
circumstances for bail. Thabo Leshabane (57), the husband of one of the deceased, is
accused of being the mastermind behind the double murder. Through an affidavit read by his lawyer, John Mohoto in the
Polokwane Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 10 November, he denied a report by the
police that he tried to commit suicide. He further refused being involved in a conspiracy to kill
his wife Makoena Mabusela-Leshabane (46). Thabo is a businessman from Midrand, while his co-accused
Mbekezi Butheledzi (25) worked as a car guard in Gemiston Mall, John Zulu (30)
worked as a driver, Sfiso Bhekinhlezo (34) worked as a queue marshal and
Emanuel Dlamini (30) was a taxi driver from Germiston. Makoena and her business partner Tebogo Mphuti (35) were
shot at point-blank range in a suspected hit while they were about to view a
warehouse in Magnavia in Polokwane. The alleged killers allegedly jumped into a maroon Hyundai
Accent and speed off from the scene. Magistrate Jenine Ungerer said the NPA had until Friday to
verify all the information in the applicant’s affidavit before she could make a
judgement. Family member, Peggy Mofojane, said they were confident the
NPA had enough information. “We are really confident the state has done their work
properly and have the right suspects in this matter. We have no doubt we will
not conquer in the end,” she said.
