THIS could well be the season Keagan Dolly establishes his competitive edge and entrench himself in the Montpellier starting team. Injury free and regaining his old form, the Bafana Bafana midfielder has so far been part of the Montpellier squad, playing six of the 10 Ligue 1 matches in France. Dolly, who has battled with recurring injuries, came on as a second substitute as Montpellier edged Strasbourg 4-3 to move to fifth on the log, four points adrift leaders PSG who are on 24 at the weekend. He played in two international matches as Bafana thumped São Tomé and Principe in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, and should he stay fit, could finally prove the reason the French side paid millions for his signature three years ago. In the Belgian league, Percy Tau continued to cement his place in the Anderlecht starting line-up, lasting the entire match as Vincent Kompany’s team went down 2-1 to Beerschot. Tau has missed only one of the 13 league matches so far this season. Elsewhere, Bongani Zungu wasn’t part of the match-day squad as Rangers blew away Aberdeen 4-0 in the Scottish Premier League Luther Singh also did not feature for Pacos Ferreira as they crushed UD Oliveirense 4-0 in the Portuguese Primeira League while Dean Furman also did not appear for Carlisle United in the English League Two.
