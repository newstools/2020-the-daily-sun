 SWALLOWS FC maintained their 100% unbeaten run in the Dstv Premiership when they defeated Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 to top the Dstv Premiership table.After five matches of the 2020-21 season Swallows have managed to gather 11 points from three victories and two draws.Â They are a points ahead of second placed Mamelodi Sundowns who have played four games this season. Joseph Mhlongo who made his debut for Swallows coming from the bench scored the only goa of the match on the 85th minute of the encounter which ensured The Dube Birds maintain their unbeaten run. Without a doubt, the results now leaves Chiefs under immense pressure as they only have won one match, drew twice and lost twice in five outings this season. This was the first Soweto derby between these two sides sice Swallows relegation in 2015. Chiefs struggled in the opening exchanges to get a foot on the ball with Swallows applying more of the pressure in search of an opener. Swallows continued to apply increasing pressure on their opponents and spent the majority of the first-half parked just outside the Chiefs 18-yard area. Gavin Hunt's side grew into the game and somewhat against the run of play nearly took the lead on two occasions just before the break. Left-back Philani Zulu was unlucky not to score in the 43rd minute when he struck an effort from distance that struck the frame of Swallows goalkeeper Virgil Vries' post before being cleared. Two minutes later in the 45th minute Chiefs had the ball in the back of the net as defender Daniel Cardoso bundled the ball over the line from close range but was adjudged to have fouled Vries. The two sides went into the break deadlocked with nothing separating the two teams.
