“I AM at a loss of words. I wasn’t ready to lose you, mommy.” Those were the words of late Queen of Kwaito Mshoza’s 12-year-old daughter, Pride that got many people in tears at her mother’s memorial service. Her 11-year-old daughter Junior could not hold back and when she tried to speak, she just wept. All she could say as they were about to step off the podium was: “I love you mommy.” The friends and family of the Kortes hitmaker came in their numbers to House of Treasures Ministries in the south of Joburg where the funeral service was held.  The service was very emotional, where Mshoza’s friends in white dresses lit candles and put them around her coffin. They said they wanted to light the way for her. Media personality Khanyi Mbau paid tribute to the singer, speaking about their relationship. “I never thought this day would come. We always planned on getting old together.” She said Mshoza broke into the industry before her and now has left her. “She was a strong woman who believed in love and companionship. Her commitment to what she loved extended beyond her children and family, but also to her small circle she considered her friends.” ALSO READ | QUEEN OF KWAITOLAID TO REST TODAY Mshoza, whose real name was Nomasonto Maswangayi, died last Thursday at the age of 37.
