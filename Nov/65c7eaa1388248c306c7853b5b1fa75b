WITH the SA Football Association having given the green light for football activities to resume, following a six-month hiatus due to the nationwide lockdown, fans can look forward to a number of popular kasi tournaments in the coming months. Safa said organisers must monitor and ensure teams follow strict health protocols to avoid any possible spike of Covid-19 cases. Former Kaizer Chiefs defender Jacob Tshisevhe, who runs his foundation tournament in Mogwase, North West said it has been a challenge to comply with all the protocols. Last weekend the Tshisevhe Foundation kicked off their annual eight team’s tournament, which ends on Sunday with the semi-finals and final. North West Masters will face Chaneng Masters in the first semi-final at 10am, then the second semi-final will see Magong Masters lock horns with Try Again Masters at noon. The final is scheduled for 3pm at Sandton grounds in Mogwase. Talking to SunSport, Tshisevhe said: “We started this tournament in 2016 and it has been a great success. “When we started we only had four teams but now we have eight, the tournament has been growing.” Tshisevhe said organising this year’s event has been challenging. “Playing in the midst of Covid-19 has been a challenge. We do follow all the protocols, screening players, and all that. But it is not easy, you know there would always be that one or two people who want to do things differently. But everything is under control so far,” added Tshisevhe. The winner of the tournament will win a trophy plus football kit and soccer balls.
