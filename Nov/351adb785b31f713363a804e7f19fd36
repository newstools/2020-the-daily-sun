THE Black First Land First (BLF) Movement has come out guns
blazing in support of self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri, calling on
government to stop harassing him despite the prophet and his wife fleeing the
country unlawfully, making them fugitives. It said it was clear Mzansi’s government waged a vendetta
against the prophet and wasn’t interested in the rule of law, but in tarnishing
his name. Their statement said: “The latest media-driven negative
propaganda against Major 1 is a desperate attempt to remove focus from the
clear and legal demands made by Prophet Bushiri to come and answer the charges
against him. It’s clear the government has no case against the prophet, hence
the manufacturing of charges and feeding the media frenzy in an attempt to
conduct a trial by media. “It’s clear Prophet Bushiri shall never receive a fair trial
in South Africa under the Ramaphosa administration. Stellenbosch is threatened
by the prophet, hence the persecution we see. It is clear South Africa is under
white control and black people not controlled by white power and able to stand
on their own are destroyed.” Recent developments have seen three more warrants of arrest
for the prophet relating to three rape cases. Two cases are from 2018 and the other from this year. Bushiri fled the country two weeks ago together with his
wife Mary after being released on bail of R200 000 each by Pretoria Magistrates
Court, as they were facing charges of fraud and money laundering to the tune of
R102 million.
