NEIGHBOURHOOD watch member Athenkosi Mzamo from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, claims there are members who are stealing money. “When we started this neighbourhood watch we had nothing and were doing it to keep our community safe, but some people decided to give us money to use for our needs as the neighbourhood watch,” said Mzamo. The Masincedane neighbourhood watch lends crucial supports to the City of Cape Town to patrol at clinics, schools, and malls. “The people who keep the money gave R300 to some members,” said Mzamo. Mzamo is one of the members who didn’t get the money. “I want them to treat us equally because we’re all risking our lives. Why are they excluding us when there’s money involved? They must stop stealing money that’s meant for Masincedane,” they are using the money for their personal things”, said Mzamo. Nozinzile Fana was lucky to get the R300, but she never gives a straight answer as to why other members were not given the cash. “We go out everyday to make sure our communities are safe. We are all equal. If there’s money, they need to give it to all of us”, added Fana. Khunjulwa Ntsimbi never received the money. “They were supposed to use the money to buy tracksuits for us and some equipment, but they decided to give some members R300 each,” she said. Khunjulwa said this would have a negative impact. “Why would we give our time when some are using the money meant to be used by all of us for their personal needs. They must show us the bank statement.” These members said things were better when there was no money involved. “We can’t blame the people who decided to give us money, they saw the good job that we are doing in our communities, all we want is to be treated equally because we are doing the same thing, protecting our communities”, added Ntsimbi. Daily Sun contacted one of the accused members. She said: “We cannot comment on this now because it’s so sensitive. We need to meet them and see how this can be resolved.”
