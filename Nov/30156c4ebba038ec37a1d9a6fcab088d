A KASI radio presenter is using her experience to help women with broken hearts. Tabita Busani (28), a presenter at Zibonele FM, told Daily Sun she encountered several people with relationship, marriage and even friendship challenges. “That made me realise we’re serving a broken community with broken relationships that will lead to a broken and bitter generation,” she said. Tabita held a workshop with a group of women over the weekend at Lookout Hill in Khayelitsha. She said the programme helped her as well as she was still healing from her previous abusive relationship. “I’m a divorcee. My husband abused me emotionally and physically. “This was a way of trying to reach out to many women in the same situation. “I want to give them hope and remind them the future is still bright.” Now that she’d realised many people needed help, Tabita said, she’d hold another workshop next year. It would focus on single mums, kids with absent dads, and those who grew up without fathers. One of the attendees, Akhona Sebe (34), left her husband earlier this year. She couldn’t stand the abuse. “I left with our two-year-old child, even though I didn’t have any means to look after myself,” she said. “Whenever he was home he’d beat me up over anything. “I left him and I’m still alive. The session with Tabita made me even stronger. “I sometimes feel like going back to him because I don’t have a job. “I just have to find ways to put food on my table.”
