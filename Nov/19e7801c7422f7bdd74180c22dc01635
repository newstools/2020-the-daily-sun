The case against former Mpumalanga MEC and ANC PEC member together with his stepson has been postponed after their attorney didn’t show up in court. The 48-year-old, accused of raping his daughters, appeared briefly before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on 20 November on rape and sexual assault charges. His 26-year-old stepson also appeared in court. They were accompanied by their family members, friends and supporters. The supporters who were wearing ANC regalia chanted struggle songs outside court. One supporter told the People’s Paper: “We are here today because of one issue. The ANC in the province lied about cancelling the comrade’s membership. We want them to publicly announce that they lied about that. Our comrade is still attending PEC’s meeting,” said the supporter." He said they would march to the ANC offices in Mpumalanga next week to demand an apology. The duo were arrested in September at their home in Mbombela after rape and sexual assault cases were opened against them in July. They are out on R20 000 bail each. Magistrate Susan Monaledi postponed the matter to 23 November.
