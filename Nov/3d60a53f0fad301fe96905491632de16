NIGHT wear has become one of the most sought-after outfits during the pandemic, with comfort being at the top of everyone’s mind since most people are working from home. A new trend has also been seen to be on the rise, as men are now getting night dresses. Although night dresses seem to be a thing of the past for some women, the comfort that comes with sleeping in one cannot be denied and it seems some men can attest to it now.  In a discussion on Quora, one guy said that there is nothing wrong with wearing a night dress, even outdoors to do a simple errand like picking up mail. He mentioned that this may raise an eyebrow among his neighbours and make them wonder if he got his pyjamas mixed up with his wife’s, but so what? One woman, who seemed to also not mind it, said: “I see no problem with men wearing a nice nightgown to bed in the privacy of their own home. Why should women be the only ones to experience such pleasures in life. The same goes with lingerie. It does no harm and doesn’t hurt anyone. Why are people so small minded about such little things in this day and age?” The night dresses are available on online shops for just as little as under R500, and are available in sizes from Small to 5XL.  Finally!!! A night dress for men ????I usually just go to bed commando but this will do too ???? https://t.co/f5BD3jGxqw
