MURDER accused Dumisani Mkhwanazi has taken to the witness stand and denied he ever crushed Palesa Madiba. This is after his childhood friend Zwelakhe Mahlangu on Monday told the court that Mkhwanazi had told him that he had crushed her. Mahlangu said that’s Mkhwanazi said after the news that Palesa had gone missing went viral. Mkhwanazi also told the court he didn’t own a gun. This despite the testimony of two police officers, who told the court they found a gun and ammunition in the car driven by Mkhwanazi at the time of his arrest. According to the two police officers, witnesses who testified on Tuesday, Mkhwanazi confessed the gun belonged to him and that he bought it from someone from Kimberley. He denied owning a gun and said he didn’t know there was a gun in the car, which belonged to one of his friends, Sebitlo Malgatle. Mkhwanazi is accused of killing Palesa, a University of Joburg student, in 2013. Investigating officer Captain Amos Maneta told the court about the shocking discovery of human remains at the Mkhwanazi’s home. The remains were subsequently proven to be those of the missing UJ student. After the remains were found, Maneta said he interviewed Thandi Mkhwanazi, the owner of the house. She said she had no knowledge of the body. Maneta said Mkhwanazi only became a suspect after the body was found and he was later arrested early last year. Makgatle on Tuesday said he knew Mkhwanazi to have a gun, which is the same size as the one used by police. “I didn’t possess a firearm that I kept in the car,” he said. Maneta said he got a tip off from an anonymous person to go search Mkhwanazi’s home. The defence’s legal representative Dominic Thinane asked why it took them almost two years to find the body. Maneta said it was difficult as the owner was angered by police presence at her house. She had an interdict to stop the cops from entering the premises. The case was postponed to Tuesday, 1 December, for closing arguments.
