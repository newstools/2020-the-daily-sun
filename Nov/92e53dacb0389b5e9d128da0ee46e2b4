EVERYWHERE around the world, people are fighting for the lives of black people to be taken seriously and be respected. But in Mzansi, you’d bet black people are just irritants who must just die in numbers. Almost every day, our reporters traverse the country, bringing you news of how some of the citizens of this country die in situations that should have been easily avoided. In the latest case of black-man-you’re-on -your-own, four innocent kids were swallowed by a trench in Hammanskraal, Tshwane. This trench, according to the residents and the Tshwane Municipality, was left open by a construction company doing work around the area. According to the MMC, barricades around the trench were blown into the water when it was raining heavily over the weekend. Now that for me is a dangerous statement, right? It means the municipality is acknowledging they gave work to a construction company that couldn’t even secure their sites. If you’re in the business of construction and dealing with deep excavations, then you should know better. How are we going to trust the structures or infrastructure that you’re putting up if you can’t even secure you site? This is a sick joke. Both the company and the council must be held liable. – Deputy Editor
