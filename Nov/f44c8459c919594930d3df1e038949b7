AFTER being postponed for a week last week, the murder trial of
Dumisani Mkhwanazi was supposed to proceed Monday to Friday uninterrupted. But there has been yet another speed hump in the case after
the Dumisani's lawyer, Dominic Thinane asked for a postponement, citing health
reasons. He told Judge Prince Manyathi that he was going to hospital, which led to the matter being moved to Tuesday. Judge Manyathi had always said that he wanted the matter to
proceed so the affected parties, especially the family of the deceased could
get closure because the matter had been dragging forÂ  too long. The state was supposed to call more witnesses to come and
testify in the cases. Some of the witnesses that are yet to be called to take
the stand include the investigation officer and a prisoner who is Leeuwkop
correctional centre. Dumisani is accused of killing UJ student Palesa Madiba and
burying her in a shallow grave back in 2013. He had pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. He
is charged with murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, obstruction of
justice and possession of illegal firearm and ammunition.
