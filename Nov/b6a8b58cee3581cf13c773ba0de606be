CHURCH leaders from different Zion churches visited the murder scene of Nomvuzo Atoli on Saturday, 28 November. They prayed and cleansed the area. Nomvuzo was murdered and her body dumped at a rubbish pile in Siyanyanzela squatter camp in Browns Farm, Cape Town, not far from her home. The group of men and women in church uniforms sang, danced and prayed at the scene. Church leader Dorothea Gopi hoped the prayers and cleansing would bring healing to the family and the community. “The wound is big and the community needs us to be there to support the family,” said Gopi. Church leaders sprinkled holy water during the prayers. Reverend Zama Mfihlo said: “As men, we say we’re sorry to the Atoli family for the pain brought to their family. “We’re saying violence against women and children must end.” Nomvuzo’s aunt, Zandile, (59) said the journey to healing had been difficult, but church leaders had always been on their side. “They took us step by step and we’re grateful. They took our burden and made it theirs,” she said. Residents of Siyanyanzela have stopped using the container where Atoli’s body was found. Activists planted trees at the scene two months ago. Mfihlo said the fight against women and child abuse must not only be for 16 days. “It must be all year round,” he told Daily Sun.
