A KASI family is appealing for help after their shack was burnt down by a mysterious fire on Sunday. The Mhlangas from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, lost everything in the blaze. Sam Mhlanga (65) said he was asleep with his three children when he was suffocated by smoke. “I woke my children up and we got out. We tried to extinguish the fire, but it spiralled out of control,” he said. He said neighbours came with buckets of water and sand to put out the fire, but it got bigger and bigger. “It was as if it was fuelled by some force and they failed to extinguish it. With God’s grace, we all managed to escape,” he said. He said they were grateful that God spared their lives. Sam thanked his neighbours for helping them out, and for accommodating them since the incident. Resident Nomalanga Nkosi said: “We appeal to other people to lend a hand as the family was left with nothing. The situation is dire. We appeal to the public to help so they can rebuild their lives.” An inquest docket was opened at Etwatwa Police Station.
