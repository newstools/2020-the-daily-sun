IN one Nigerian state, if you are
convicted of rape you will face castration. The state of Kaduna in Nigeria recently passed
the law to punish child rapists by castration or death. Male rapists in Kaduna state can be
subject to surgical castration, while a woman convicted of raping a child faces
the removal of her fallopian tubes. According to The New York Times,
men can also now be handed the death penalty for raping a person under the age
of 14 and a life sentence for raping of an adult. These drastic penalties are
required to help further protect children from a serious crime said Governer
Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai. The governor said this after
signing the legislation on Wednesday after it gained parliament approval. Between January and May, over 800
cases of sexual violence were reported, which has been labelled as a major
surge. The tough new punishment comes as a
bid to curb sexual violence, which has spiked strongly during the Coronavirus
lockdown.
