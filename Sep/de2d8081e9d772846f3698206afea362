FORMER Free State Premier Ace Magashule used to announce he’d build houses for people without having a budget. This is what former provincial human settlements head, Mpho Mokoena, told the Zondo Commission yesterday. Said Mokoena: “I decided to resign in December 2011 due to pressure I was getting as HoD from Ace Magashule. “We were under a strict schedule of ensuring that we turned building materials into houses. “But at the same time, when we went out on an outreach programme called Operation Hlasela, the premier would still be announcing allocation sporadically everywhere we went. “We were also under pressure to build bigger houses, but the amount of money we got from the national department was for 40 square metre houses.” He said former human settlements MEC Mosebenzi Zwane called a meeting in October 2010 to tell officials to buy building material from service providers, so building could start. He said suppliers were paid before they delivered material as the department had to spend the R103 billion allocated to it or risk losing a portion of its budget. Mokoena said he told Zwane what they were doing was illegal, but other officials didn’t support him. He said Zwane told him to resign if he didn’t agree with the scheme. He said the next month Zwane approached him with a list of 106 contractors he wanted appointed. He said most of the contractors were new and given more than 200 units. Mokoena said despite not having built a single house, officials were told by Zwane to sign a document to be sent to the national department, claiming foundations and walls had been built. “We didn’t have capacity to do what we put in that document,” he said.
