THE resignation of John Moodey is sad and unfortunate – and more so as he played the race card. This is according to the DA after Moodey yesterday announced his resignation from the party, saying he was longer comfortable in the party which he joined in 1998. Moodey said he had many options and signalled that he was not lost to politics. He would not confirm if he’d be joining former Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba’s new party, Action SA, as rumored. He said he was not happy that the party was comfortable with only governing the Western Cape. Moodey said he had reached a point where he was unable to defend some of the insensitive statements by Zille. “There’s also a very clear agenda of the party to purge any or all leaders who have supported Mmusi Maimane in the past. Of course, it is being pushed by the current leadership,” said Moodey. His resignation comes as the DA was preparing to charge him. Moodey said the charges were not put to him, although he had been told the dates. He said there were at least nine out of 25 federal executives who were facing disciplinary processes. “They are using trumped up charges and character assassination, and rumour mongering and I have learnt to live with it. “I have been informed that there are charges to be brought against me for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to frame a senior DA member of Parliament on charges of soliciting sex for jobs,” he said. The DA in a statement confirmed that Moodey was facing a disciplinary process, but rejected allegations that it was a witch hunt. “It’s unfortunate that he plays the race card to justify his decision to avoid due process,” it said.
