CONDEMNED to a life in prison! These were the sentences handed down to Mongezi Mcunukelwa and two co-accused in the South Gauteng High Court yesterday. Mcunukelwa’s sentence had 10 years added to it for escaping from custody in December 2018. Mcunukelwa (35), Paseka Mahloromela (24) and Sanele Madiga (30) were sentenced for the murder of Akhona Mthabela, whom they killed in 2016 in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni. “We’re dealing with three accused people who killed the deceased jointly in the execution of their evil intent,” the judge said when handing down sentence. “The three accused, who were all armed with knives, were resolute in their careless conduct, despite having being reprimanded by two witnesses.” The deceased was a relative of one of the accused, but this didn’t stop them. The judge said: “Instead, one of the accused commanded they should ‘kill the cow’.” Akhona’s mother, Noyana Majola-Mthabela, (56) welcomed the heavy sentence, but said it would not bring back her son. “My child will never wake up from the dead. The murderers will continue to live,” she said. Noyana said her son was a casualty of a turf war, which she came to know about after he died. She said endless trips to court didn’t tire her. “I wanted to know why my child was killed. “What’s most painful is that the second accused is my cousin’s child. My cousin never even came to help bury my child, nor did she apologise for her son’s actions.” Chances of the accused escaping again were very slim – they were guarded by about nine prison officials.
