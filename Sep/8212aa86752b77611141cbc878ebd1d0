BLACK Leopards will have to show more fight if they are to cling on to their top-flight status. The Limpopo outfit are in danger of following neighbours Polokwane City to the GladAfrica Championship. This after they finished 15th in the Absa Premiership, and now need to contest the promotion/relegation play-offs. They will battle it out with Ajax Cape Town and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) for the remaining spot in the Premiership. Leopards could not avoid the play-offs after they were thumped 3-0 in Saturday’s final day of fixtures by a rampant Mamelodi Sundowns, who clinched their 10th league title. Lidoda Duvha will hope to begin their quest to save their top-flight status on a positive note when they face the Urban Warriors at FNB Stadium on Wednesday. Leopards’ joint caretaker coach, Morgan Shivambu, was not happy with his side’s performance against Downs and wants them to respond against Ajax. “From here, all our focus now goes to the play-offs,” said Shivambu. “We need to go back to the drawing board. We need to be ready for the play-offs. “We are playing on Wednesday, so we don’t have to look back. We don’t have that time to moan because we have to be prepared for the play-offs.” Leopards will have to be wary of the Urban Warriors as they will be determined to grab their second chance at earning promotion back to the money-spinning Premiership. They narrowly missed out on automatic promotion after they were pipped by Swallows FC. They topped the Championship table for the better part of the season, only to be toppled in the penultimate game of the season. Shivambu has bemoaned some of the injuries in his camp, as Leopards will still be without midfielder Lifa Hlongwani. “It was a tough game against Sundowns,” added Shivambu. “We also had some injuries to some key players and we had to make some forced changes.”
