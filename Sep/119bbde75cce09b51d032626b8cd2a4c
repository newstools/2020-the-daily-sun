HIGHLANDS Park co-director, Sinky Mnisi, is seeking legal advise as he kicks off his legal battle against fellow majority shareholders over the reported sale of the club. It has been reported that the Lions of the North have been sold to TS Galaxy chairman, Tim Sukazi, for an undisclosed amount, and the deal is expected to be concluded by end of the week. However, Mnisi says he was never consulted over the sale and is bitter that things have been happening behind his back. Even yesterday while speaking to SunSport, Mnisi said he knew nothing about the sale and no one had the “decency to furnish” him with information despite being a shareholder himself. Mnisi has not made it a secret that he does not want the club to be sold. He said it would be best to first look internally when his fellow shareholders issued an offer to sell before considering outsiders. “I cannot say much, except that I am consulting with lawyers seeking legal advise on what steps I should take on the reported sale of the club,” he said. “We will meet in court. The lawyers will get around that and they will let me know what to do next. I’ll wait for the lawyers to give me all the logistics. I cannot reveal a lot of details in the media now because I would be shooting myself in the foot, if I were to put all facts on the table. But definitely this matter will end up in court.” He said he was not comfortable with what is happening at the club. CONTINUED ON PAGE 14
