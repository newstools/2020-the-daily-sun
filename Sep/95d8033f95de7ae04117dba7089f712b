LED by Jamaican leaders, Rastafarians from across Mzansi paid a visit to King Buyelekhaya “Zwelibanzi” Dalindyebo’s private home in Nkululekweni, Mthatha today to pay their respects. The Rastafarian community said they have been recognising Zwelibanzi as Thembu King, even while he was in prison. The elders included Vincent Allan (Ras Iven) Nyabhingy, high priest Theocracy reign of His Majesty, Bongo Wake, chairman of the Ancient Council Nyabhingy Order across the world and Incident high priest Bongo George. Mthatha Rasta chairman Ras Aviwe Tyumre said it was a historical moment in Africa for the elders to meet the king. “This is the only king in Africa who stands up against people targeting to take over the heritage of Africa.” The elders also told Dalindyebo he was the only African king who went through many troubles, by speaking the truth.  The king was grateful to be visited by the Rastafarian elders. “It’s time for us to be jealous of who we are. Let’s unite as Africans to protect our heritage. Thanks for your support during difficult times, thank you for being original brothers,” he said. He promised his kingdom would honour late Rastafarian musician Bob Marley. “I will honour the original prophet and his music, which inspired people in Africa. We need to have an annual Rastafarian commemoration.  “We need to honour our fallen Rastafarian people who died fighting for our freedom of Africa. It’s our duty to teach our people about the role played by our late brothers. Let’s stand up to protect our heritage. Let’s not betray each other. Let’s love and protect our people,” said the king.
