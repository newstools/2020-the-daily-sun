Songstress Zoë Modiga is excited to serenade fans with her new songs in her Zoë Modiga in Concert one woman show. The jazz artist, who released her sophomore album Ingankwane in July, will be performing at the South African State Theatre on Sunday. Zoë told SunBuzz her performance will tell a story. “We curated the concert in a way that creates a story. I don’t want to get into it too much as I don’t want to give it away,” she said. “We wanted to lure people in so they enjoy the concert.I also want to keep it strictly Zoë, so I don’t feature anyone in the concert. I’ve added a full piece band, which will make this concert different from all the performances I’ve done.” According to Zoë, performing without an audience has been hard, but she’s getting the hang of it. “I’m one of those people who really love performing. I love singing for people and it’s been difficult because Inganekwane dropped during lockdown. I miss having an audience, but I understand what we’re going through,”she said. “I’m grateful for the technology that allows us to still be able to connect with fans.

We used African influences and told stories in isiZulu. I don’t like telling people what to feel or what to expect during my shows, but hopefully this will create conversations between the people who’ll be watching. Through this concert, I want to reconnect with people.”
