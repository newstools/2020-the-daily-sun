NEW GladAfrica Championship side Sekhukhune FC are hard at work in bolstering their squad ahead of the new season. The club, which bought the Championship status of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM), have appointed former Vaal University of Technology (VUT) coach Stanley Nkoane as assistant coach to Johnny Ferreira, as they prepare for life in the PSL’s second tier next season. Nkoane and Ferreira are leaving no stone unturned as they put a squad together that will compete in the Championship. Nkoane made his name during the 2019-20 season with SAB League side VUT in the Nedbank Cup, when he guided his fourth-tier side to a stunning 6-5 win on penalties against Premiership outfit Golden Arrows after the sides were level 2-2 after extra time. They became the first team from the SAB League to beat a PSL club in this competition. SunSport has learnt that the new club have signed former Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United midfielder Ennocent Mkhabela, ex-Orlando Pirates midfielder Yusuf Maart, former Mamelodi Sundowns and Maritzburg United midfielder Siyabulela Shai, former Royal Eagles left back Rebone Ntsoane, ex-Baroka FC midfielder Thato Madigoe and Thabang Mokoena from JDR Stars. “Yes, these players are part of the camp with Sekhukhune and they have been signed,” said our mole. However, Sekhukhune technical director Alex Bapela said he cannot confirm the signing of these players, saying that he would be shooting himself in the foot as other teams will become aware of what they are doing. “I can’t disclose everything because people can come and steal my players,” said the former Downs star.
