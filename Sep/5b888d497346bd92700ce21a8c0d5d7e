THE family of Letaba TVET College student Kgaogelo Shai (20) suspects she might have been murdered after the family of her boyfriend Ronny Kgatla, allegedly last seen with her on Saturday night, found he killed himself on Monday. Ronny was found hanging from his shoelace tied to the burglar bars inside his bedroom. He’d opened a case of robbery and kidnapping on Sunday at Ritavi cop shop in Nkowankowa outside Tzaneen, claiming they were attacked by four men and robbed before the men left with Kgaogelo, but he killed himself soon afterwards. First year student Kgaogelo, originally from Mulalani Village in Ga-Sekororo, rented a room in Ga-Mokgolobotho near her college. Mum Rose Shai (49) told Daily Sun she was afraid something bad happened to Kgaogelo. “Her boyfriend committed suicide, sending a message to me that my daughter might be dead. I last spoke to her on Friday and her sister who was supposed to share a room with her didn’t find her at her room on Sunday. Her phone was forever on voicemail.” Rose didn’t buy the story of the boyfriend opening a case, claiming to be robbed and her daughter being kidnapped. “Why did he kill himself? He was the first suspect who must give us answers about what happened on Saturday night. I believe his conscience dealt with him for not telling the truth about what happened to my daughter until he panicked and hanged himself.” Uncle George Forosi (61) said Kgaogelo’s disappearance caused serious confusion, as they didn’t know if she was alive or dead. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a missing person’s case was opened and cops were investigating. Anyone with information about Kgaogelo should call Detective Sergeant Lawrence Shikwambana on 072 373 7399, Lieutenant-Colonel Makasela Mushwana on 082 451 7156, or report to the nearest police station.
