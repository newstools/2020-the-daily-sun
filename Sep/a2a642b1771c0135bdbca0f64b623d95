Minister of Police Bheki Cele says they are not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring that killers of the Cape Town-based top detective are bust. Cele and Western Cape provincial management visited the family of the slain cop Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear who was killed in front of his house in Bishop Lavis yesterday afternoon. Kinnear who was attached to the anti-gang unit was number one investigator in Western Cape and was third nationally. He was investigating several high profile cases including those of gangs and underworld dealings. Cele said cops have not arrested anyone in connection to the killing and they launched a 72 operation to try and arrest the killers. Besides the arrest of the killers. Cele said internal investigations are being done to find the breaches of security that led to the murder Kinnear. The two detective used to have 24-hour state-security and Cele wants to know who withdrew the security. “The man has been under threat all the time, people used to walk around here with hand grenades. There was protection but it was withdrawn, these are things that needs to be investigated. “Why there was protection, why was it withdrawn? What informed that and all that for now, at the face value, I’m standing here and conceding that indeed things were not done in a way they were supposed to be done.” “Let's get the facts because it should not be just a story after that, some heads have to roll as we find what really happened,” said Cele. The Minister said the investigations are on-going but they have lots of unanswered questions. “At the present moment there are more questions than answers,” said Cele. After visiting Kinnear, Cele went on to visit the home of another cop, Sergeant Thabile Mapoma in Khayelitsha. The 43-year old Mapoma was shot dead outside his driveway on Thursday. Cele said cops need protection and called on the community to protect cops and condemn the killings.
