THE end of Mzansi’s load shedding woes may take more than  a year. The power utility had announced this afternoon that the current
load shedding schedule has been moved up to stage 4. Today’s particularly cold weather and broken down generators
are said to be the cause behind Mzansi’s electricity troubles. Eskom spokesman Sikhonathi Mantshantsha told TV news channel
Enca that the people of Mzansi must brace themselves for load shedding up until
late next year. He said for now the schedule was expected to continue until
the weekend. “ We will be load shed 
throughout the week and weekend. What may change is the stage  of load shedding and as the weather outside
gets warmer, the next change will be down a step or 2”,said Mantshantsha. He said the current
blackouts were caused by 10 generation units that broke down over the past two
days. “Overnight and during the day we fixed four but another two
broke down. That plus the cold weather has added another 1000 megawatts of
demand to the system.” Mantshantsha added that Eskom was bust fixing design defects
at the Kusile and Medupi power stations. “The situation may persist until late 2021”,he said about load
shedding.  Eskom has announced stage 4 load-shedding this afternoon. The power utility says this is due to exceptionally high demand caused by the cold weather. @ThembiMrototo spoke to Eskom's spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha. Courtesy #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/TLaFuHjSNK
