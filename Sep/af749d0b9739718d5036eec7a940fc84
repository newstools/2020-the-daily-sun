THE City of Tshwane has been dealing with one service delivery protest after another in recent weeks. This has led to the EFF in Tshwane demanding the removal of head administrator, Mpho Nawa. The EFF called on Gauteng Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebohang Maile to fire Nawa, appointed as administrator in March. EFF regional chairman, Moafrika Mabogwana, said they were concerned about the growing number of service delivery protests since the city was placed under administration. He said residents had been living under hard conditions as a result of not having water and electricity. He said all this had been caused by Nawa, who approved tariff increments. Mabogwana said the service delivery problems showed Nawa had failed to achieve objectives set out by Maile. “He must be replaced with a more competent person who’ll be able to resolve the crisis of service delivery in Tshwane before the city is plunged into a more dire state,” he said. Meanwhile, ratings agency Moody’s has downgraded the City of Tshwane’s baseline credit assessment by one notch from Ba1 to Ba2.  DA mayoral candidate for the city, Randall Williams, said the decreased credit rating was a direct result of the ANC’s “unlawful coup” and imposition of incompetent ANC administrators who’d mismanaged the city’s finances. He said Moody’s had indicated the downgrade was a result of the city’s weakened operating performance and liquidity. Maile’s spokesman, Castro Ngobese, appealed to the EFF and other political parties not to use Tshwane as a political football. He said the statements were not helpful. He said: “They’re not in the best interests of the residents of Tshwane, who’ve suffered poor service delivery before as a result of a coalition between the EFF and the DA.”
