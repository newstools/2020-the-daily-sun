COPS are looking for the mum who allegedly abandoned and neglected her three kids to chill out at local taverns in Shatale near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. The poor little ones were spotted by residents lingering around alone, and police were called. “We became worried at nightfall and the mum was not returning home. We called her to check what was going on. She just said she was enjoying herself at a local tavern. She also said she left the kids with their father,” said a resident. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “Police responded swiftly and found the kids alone. The mother’s cellphone went unanswered. The women left her minor kids aged one, three and five in the house to fend for themselves, saying she was going to buy groceries, but she never returned. Currently, all the children have been kept for safety by a certain man she has one child with. Police have condemned the incident and a call has been made to the community to take care of their children, especially now with incidents of crimes directed at children.” Hlathi said police were looking for Zinhle Mathebula to assist with their investigation. Anyone with information can contact Detective Sergeant Macro Makwela on 072 613 2576, Crime Stop on 0809 10111 or the MySAPSapp.
