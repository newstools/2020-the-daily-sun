A VICTIM’S family is living in fear after the pregnant woman was murdered, burnt and her body dumped. The body of Ntombizandile Mdutyini (22), who was eight months pregnant, was found in a green wheelie-bin near Siqalo kasi near Samora Machel, Cape Town. The alleged killer has been seen on the streets several times, but has not been arrested. Ntombizandile’s sister, Thandokazi Mdutyini (29) said her sister had been terrorised by her ex-boyfriend for a long time and she believes he killed her. The family said they were living in fear because he may harm them, so no one could seek justice for her death. “She wanted to get out of the relationship because of his criminal activities, but he didn’t want to accept that she didn’t love him anymore,” said Thandokazi. He was arrested last year and her sister dated another man and that’s when she fell pregnant. “When he came out of jail he told my sister to abort and ordered her to break up with the new boyfriend. She didn’t and he kept on abusing her.” Ntombizandile went to Gauteng to stay with their brother and when she came back, they moved her to Siqalo and the former boyfriend followed her there. Mum Nokwayintombi Mdutyini (53) said: “Cops wouldn’t let us see her because she was so badly burnt. They showed us pictures instead and we identified her. We are expecting DNA results in a few days.” Daily Sun sent inquiries to cops about the case since Wednesday, but they had not responded at the time of going to print.
