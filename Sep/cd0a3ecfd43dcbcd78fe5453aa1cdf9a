The family of a missing Mfuleni man is accusing cops of not doing enough to find his body. They told Daily Sun 24-year-old Sibabalo Tsilana was beaten up by two men on the day he went missing. Zimkitha Tsilana (27) the sister said the two men who attacked him on 11 September confessed to having dumped his body in a nearby river. Since then, the community and cops have been trying to find Sibabalo’s body without success. Zimkitha and community members are blaming cops for not doing enough to find the body or bringing justice to the family by arresting the suspects. Community leader Mlungisi Nowa (36) said they have been doing everything as residents and cops brought their sniffer dogs to find the body. “Divers were there but they did not get inside the water because it is dirty with sewerage. Nobody has really entered into water to try and find the body so we are just looking for it outside. We expect cops to do more.” Residents said they took the suspects to the place they claimed to have dumped the body, but it wasn’t found. Captain Frederick Van Wyk said cop divers have been assisting the family to recover the body and cops opened a missing person’s case. “The alleged drowning incident was reported to Mfuleni SAPS on 12 September. A missing person’s enquiry file was registered. The next morning, detectives went to Covid-19 informal settlement to speak with the family of missing Sibabalo. “Two people were identified and taken in for questioning on Sunday, and were released during the week. In the meantime, the search for the missing person continued alongside the riverbank with police divers and the dog unit joining the search. Since Monday morning, SAPS divers searched the river from Hindle Road to Old Faure Road without any success.”
