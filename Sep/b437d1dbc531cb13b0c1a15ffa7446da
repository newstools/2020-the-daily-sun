SANGOMAS, pastors and prophets flock to this stream every day to fetch water. They also perform rituals at the stream. Even ordinary people go to the spring in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, to drink and bathe in its water for luck. Daily Sun visited the stream, where a number of people performed rituals, while others were collecting the water. Sangoma Ndibayeni from Temong in Tembisa was also at the stream, cleansing two people. He said the water worked wonders. “I have been coming here since 2014. This water is blessed. “It gives life and brings good luck,” he said. Another sangoma, Precious Piyose, came with a container to collect the water. She said she used the water to heal.  “I mix the water with muthi to cleanse my patients. “The water is pure and does wonders,” she said. The sangoma said they performed rituals to appease the water snake before getting into the water. They said they also avoided poking when visiting the stream, as it might anger the snake. “But not everyone respects the snake. They come here after they have poked or were involved in other unpleasant things,” said sangoma Thokozile Sithole. Alfred Nkonyana told the People’s Paper he lost his job after his company closed down due to lockdown. “I’m hunting for a new one, but it is difficult. I collect the water and bathe and drink it. “I believe with this water I will find another job,” said Alfred.
