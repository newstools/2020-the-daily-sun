THE ANC in KZN is tomorrow expected to remove all its councillors facing criminal charges. This comes after the party’s NEC decided in a meeting at the weekend that all members facing criminal charges must step aside from government positions until they’re cleared by the courts, or the party’s integrity commission. The party in KZN was the first to follow the trend by suspending former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, only eight days after she was appointed to the provincial legislature, as well as deputy chairman Mike Mabuyakhulu. Both are out on bail after being charged with corruption. Provincial party spokesman Nhlakanipho Ntombela told Daily Sun that provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli would meet all regional secretaries today to get a list of ANC councillors facing criminal charges. He said the party would then start formally informing all affected councillors to leave their positions. He said councillors would receive letters. Ntombela said members accused of crimes would also step aside from party positions. “The ANC’s decision was that all party members who are facing criminal charges must step aside, and must never represent the party at any level.” In eThekwini, the ANC will lose three councillors – Sthenjwa Nyawose, Zo Shabalala and Thembelihle De Lange – arrested along with Gumede over the R208 million waste tender scandal. The three are out on R5 000 bail. They are expected back in court next week.
