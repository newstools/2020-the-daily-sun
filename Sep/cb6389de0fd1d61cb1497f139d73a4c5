With all the determined stories about GBV in the media, one would expect the matter to be a talking point among common people and men in particular. But the opposite is true. The media and government are talking to themselves only. In the same way that it’s difficult for preachers to turn people away from wrong behaviour in a democratic milieu, so is the case with the good intentions of GBV narratives in an unequal and traditionally patriarchal milieu. But there’s one thing that the GBV narratives are achieving. They’re serving a political strategy of the ANC for the longer term. The ANC is campaigning for itself and preparing society for a woman president in future. They know the GBV problem is an emotive issue. I suppose the men and women in the ANC are convinced that South Africa is not ready for a woman as president, but could be gradually softened through GBV narratives. If the ANC and media were serious about GBV, they would have supported both Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s bids for the ANC presidency. Yet we know what they did and who they’re in reality.
