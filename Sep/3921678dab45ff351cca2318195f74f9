HE went to the Duduza Clinic pretending to be sick. But the nyaope addict had other plans. He waited for the doctor to disappear into the sick room and then got into the dispensary to steal pills, ointment and aqueous cream. But a security guard stopped him as he was leaving and found the stolen medicine. The suspect was then bust. Security guard Fihliwe Sotuko said the nyaope addict waited for the doctor to see another patient and snuck into the dispensary to steal the medication. She said he once broke into a staff member’s car to steal a toolbox. “We just don’t know how to help him because he doesn’t want to go to a rehabilitation centre,” she said. Residents welcomed the arrest. “He’ll sober up in jail. This boy is a headache and he steals from us,” said Mildred Bhekezela (34). “The problem is that they get arrested today and are back on the streets the following day.” Said another resident Vusi Nalanda (49): “That boy steals from everyone and it would best for him to stay in jail because some people will kill him one day.” Another resident, Kgalaletso Moremane (42), said: “These boys steal pills to smoke with nyaope and we suspect he was going to do the same.” Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza cop shop said the man faced theft and robbery charges and would appear in court soon.
