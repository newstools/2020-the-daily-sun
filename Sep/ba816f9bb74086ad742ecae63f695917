WHEN her son left home, he told her he’d be back soon. But it’s been over a month and there’s no sign of Mthokozisi Radebe and his mum Thembeni Radede (59) is worried sick. The 33-year-old from Umlazi south of Durban left home on 25 July, saying he was going to Dalton, but not who he was going to see. Thembeni told Daily Sun when she realised it was late and he wasn’t coming back home, she called him on his cellphone but it was off. “I kept calling his cellphone that night. I was hoping maybe he will switch it on and I would get hold of him. This was the first time he told me he was going to Dalton.” Mthokozisi has never left without returning home before. “I asked all his friends but they don’t know where he is. None of our relatives have seen him. Now I’m worried. I’m scared something bad might have happened to him.” Thembeni said Mthokosizi was still searching for a job. “I hope nothing bad has happened to him because I still have hope of finding him alive.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said Umbilo cops are appealing to residents for help in locating Mthokozisi, last seen wearing khaki pants and a khaki jacket. “Anyone with information can contact Sergeant Bongumusa Ngcamu on 078 878 9522 or 031 203 2412 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.”
