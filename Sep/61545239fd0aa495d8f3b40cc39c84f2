TREBLE PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns are set to form part of the Umsunduzi Cup next month. At the weekend Downs added the Nedbank Cup to the Absa Premiership and Telkom Knockout trophies they had previously won this past season. KwaZulu-Natal based PSL clubs Golden Arrows, Maritzburg United and last year’s inaugural winners, AmaZulu will also be part of the tournament as organiser Lebo Mokoena is leaving no stone left unturned to make it another big success. The event will be staged at the Harry Gwala Stadium on 10-11 October. To ensure that the tournament adheres to the National State of Disaster Lockdown Level 2 regulations, Mokoena has sent a document to the PSL for approval on how the pre-season tournament will be run. The document ensures the event will be played in the bio bubble and behind closed doors, in the same safety measures that the PSL took when completing the 2019-20 season. “It is going to be (staged in a) mini-bubble, all teams will report to the bubble on 9 October,” said Mokoena of Mkoena Group. “We’ll follow all the pandemic regulations especially.”While the tournament is scheduled to be held behind closed doors, Mokoena is hoping the country will move to Lockdown Level 1 next month and he hopes the new regulations will allow a few fans to attend. “We are praying President Cyril Ramaphosa opens the country. If he does that, we will speak to Computicket so that tickets can be sold there,” revealed Mokoena. Mokoena, who earlier confirmed his interest in salvaging the financial affairs of Ke Yona Cup finalists, Bloemfontein Celtic, has secured Hollywood Bets as one of the tournament sponsors. “We are still looking for other sponsors. We have already put proposals to other (companies in the) private sector,” he added. The games will be broadcast live on SuperSport 2 and on SABC radio stations.
