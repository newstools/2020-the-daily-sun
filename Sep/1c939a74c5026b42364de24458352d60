Unhappy residents of Madelakufa squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun they were overlooked. “We want to know why we don’t have electricity. We also deserve electricity,” said resident Boy Mtshweni (48). Another resident, Friday Ndaba (36), said: “They know us when it’s time to vote, but turn their backs on us once they get our votes. We deserve better.” Residents living in houses near the squatter camp were pleased with what the cops did. “We wish this could be an ongoing thing because, as paying customers, we’re suffering,” said gogo Evelyn Mashilwane (67).

The Ekurhuleni Municipality said it won’t tolerate illegal connections after losing over R800 million due to electricity theft. Spokesman Themba Gadebe urged residents to be patient until solutions were found.
