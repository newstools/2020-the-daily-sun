VETERAN maskandi artist Zibokwakhe “Phuzekhemisi” Mnyandu has released a song to apologise to his ancestors. The song, Thongo Lami, is getting increasingly popular since its recent release. He told Daily Sun: “I have had the most terrible years since 2018, but now I feel much better. I have since recorded an album titled Izinja Ziyangiluma, and I decided to include a song apologising to my ancestors.

I’ve never been to a court except this one time. “I never thought I’d come face to face with the judges, but the devil...” Phuzekhemisi said it was against his culture to be in and out of court, but he had no option. “On this song, I’m asking my ancestors to forgive me. I need them to remove whatever dark cloud is or was upon me. I am pleading with them to guide me and cleanse my soul. This song seeks spiritual closure.” But Phuzekhemisi said he still owed his ancestors more than just a song. Phuzekhemisi’s troubles started in 2018 when he was accused of shooting band member Selby Shezi. He was initially charged with attempted murder, but it was later changed to murder after Shezi died from his wounds. He was acquitted earlier this year.
