A PHILIPPI family in Cape Town is demanding justice after their child died at Red Cross Children’s Hospital two months ago. Ntombenja Sogiba (32) and her husband Siyabulela (32) said they rushed their daughter Akhanyile (5) to the hospital on 18 June a few days after she complained of a headache and a pain in her leg. It was suspected she had TB, but doctors decided to have an operation after she became seriously ill. The family claimed Akhanyile was brain dead after the operation, but doctors left without telling them. “They did not even give me any papers to sign on the day they did the operation. One of the doctors came outside and said ‘good luck, I have done my part’ and then left. “Another one walked past me while typing on the phone and left,” said Ntombenja. “I was shocked when I saw Akhanyile. Her eyes were white, her tongue was out like she was already dead. But she was breathing. She said the next day a doctor said her child had brain damage and should be removed from ICU as “she was already dead”. Ntombenja said she was traumatised and never got any counselling. Red Cross Children’s Hospital spokesman Dwayne Evans said the family had not brought the complaint to them. “We understand the loss of a child is never easy and we empathise with Akhanyile’s mother. We are obtaining facts on the matter and will engage with the mother to bring her and the family closure,” said Evans.
