EFF members shut down the clicks at the Lakeside Mall and destroyed the Clicks in Northmead. Witnesses said EFF members found the stores open and told workers to leave. After they left members started trashing the one in Northmead. “No one was going to be able stop them: they were very violent, making it clear that if we came anywhere near them we’d get into trouble,” Lakiwe Banda tweeted. Lakiwe said she understood why Mzansi was disappointed, but the violence will just leave people unemployed. Jackson said didn’t understand why there had to be violence in the process. “Two wrongs can’t make a right. Instead of advising people to protest peacefully, you’re fueling rampage and engaging in political warfare. I’m disappointed,” said Jackson. In my view, the #Clicks case #BlackHairMatter,is a textbook case of unconscious bias. Calling it out is great but anarchy and violence undermine the cause. The best and most cerebral response I’ve seen so far is a video by young black women, among them my colleague @Diane_Gahiza  Do you call peaceful protest anarchy?
