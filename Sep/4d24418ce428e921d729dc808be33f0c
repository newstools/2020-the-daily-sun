MORETELE Magistrates Court staff in the north of Tshwane have insisted that Covid-19 rules be followed. But activists and residents believe they have to be part of court proceedings. This as Thato Radebe’s alleged killer appeared in court yesterday. Radebe (22) was fresh from rehab when she was stabbed to death in the street in Temba in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, last month, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend.  She wrote in her diary about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her ex and how she looked forward to a new life with her new boyfriend. But the suspect arrived in court after the magistrate had already postponed the matter. It wasn’t clear whether protesters delayed the suspect when they blocked court gates. A scuffle broke out between police and residents, who tried to force their way into the court. After being denied entry into the courtroom, residents closed off the entire court. All the gates were blocked, preventing anyone from going in or out. Residents accused police of being unfair and siding with the accused.  Joyce Mathebula couldn’t understand why they were prevented from going into the courtroom. “We’re on level 1 of lockdown,” she said. “We have our masks on and we asked to send only 20 people to observe proceedings. “But officials refused. They were being very unfair and rude.” Although Joyce didn’t like it when the gates were blocked, she didn’t blame those who protested. The matter was postponed to 16 November and the suspect remains in custody.
