GUCCI is getting a lot of backlash over its new grass-stained jeans that cost about R13 000. The eco-washed jeans are part of the luxury brand’s autumn/winter collection. The Italian brand said the material has been specially treated for a “grunge vibe” throughout the season.  The bootlegged jeans look like they’ve been around for quite a while with faded brown spots that look like stains, coupled with green grass stains on the front.  The worn-out jeans trend has been around for some time now, but this trend has failed to impress many. Gucci said the jeans were a new take on blurring the line between vintage and contemporary.
