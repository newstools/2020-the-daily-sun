KWAITO star Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo is starting a new business – brewing alcohol. His new drink, Original Shandis, has not been launched yet but will come in three flavours. Mampintsha said the gin would hit shelves in December. “I’m happy to announce that I have my own gin. I’ve been toying with this idea for a long time but now I’ve brought it to life,” he said. “For now, it’s too early to disclose details but I can say that packaging, design and tasting has been sorted. “The prices will not be the same but everyone will be able to afford it. “The intention is to have an exclusive gin catering for VVIPs, which will be expensive. We will also have a less expensive bottle for middle class people and a cheaper option that will suit everyone’s pocket.” Mampintsha told the SunTeam it had always been his dream to have his own gin. “From a young age, I’ve always known I’m not just a musician but also a businessman. I belive I’ve matured. I’ve learned the ins and outs of the music industry and it’s time to explore new business ventures. My fans can expect more surprises from now on,” he told Daily Sun.
