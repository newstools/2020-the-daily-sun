FOOTBALL can kill you! These famous words of Kgoloko Thobejane are ringing true for both the Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns fans. It remains to be seen who between the two powerhouses will be breathing when the final whistle is blown on this dramatic Premiership campaign on Saturday. Upset, Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp dodged the mandatory post-match TV interview while his Sundowns counterpart, Pitso Mosimane, was captured kicking water bottles out of frustration. Defeats for both teams on Sunday means they are still tied on 53 points, although Amakhosi are ahead on goal difference. This makes for an intriguing round of fixtures tomorrow, with Chiefs set to face unpredictable Chippa United. The Brazilians tackle relegation-threatened Polokwane City. Mosimane has admitted to his frustration at the failure to pick up any points in their 1-0 loss to Bakgaga but also insisted the race was far from over. “It is frustrating for us as coaches. We are human,” said Mosimane. “But it’s the beauty of football. It’s keeping everyone on the edge. It’s unbelievable. It’s madness. “I’m so disappointed, it’s not funny. I said during the water break ‘guys let’s at least take a point’. As coaches, we take the blame as much as the credit. “But the race is not over yet. This thing has a heartbeat. We are going to fight for it in the last two matches.” Getting pressure is the name of the game and the coaches, as well as those at bottom of the log, are living it now. “My job is pressure. In football there’s always pressure, ” Mosimane added. “There are no excuses. Professional players must thrive under pressure. We are getting paid to work under pressure. If you don’t want to be criticised, don’t be a footballer, don’t be a coach.” Middendorp has called the 1-0 defeat to Wits a “disaster result”, but he is still hopeful.
