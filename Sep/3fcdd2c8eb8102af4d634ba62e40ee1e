VIDEO clips of horrific scenes of a City of Polokwane municipality worker
driving over his colleagues and smashing municipal vehicles with a work truck
have been leaked.  The disturbing  visuals
have been on social media today, about a month after the incident happened. The SunTeam had reported that on Friday 7 August the municipal
driver went on a rampage with a work truck, crashing into cars and unfortunately
into people.  The Municipality's worker Walter Madubanya (35) is seen
driving carelessly towards his colleagues smashing municipal vehicles and
police vans.  The incident happened at the municipality's offices in
Ladanna, Limpopo early in August 2020.  It's still not known what had caused his erratic and dangerous
behaviour.  Loud gun shots can
also be heard in the video when police shooting at the truck. In another video, Walter is seen  trapped inside  the mangled and bloody truck.  He yells in Sepedi  at
the cop who approaches him with a gun in his hand, in Sepedi ,"Betha moo
hlohogong ke tsamaye" meaning shoot me in the head so that I die.  The cop deliberately shoots against the wall and Walter
screams.  He ran over his  55-year-old colleague Basie Smith, who died in
hospital on the same day.  Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo the spokesman for Limpopo
police has confirmed that the attempted murder case against the accused, Walter
Madubanya has now changed to murder.  "The suspect has been denied bail by the  Polokwane Magistrate Court and his cases were
remanded to 16 September 2020 for formal bail application”, he said.
