PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri has urged his followers to refrain from using his name to insult people on social media. In a statement, the leader of Enlightened Christian Gathering Church urged members not to make remarks and issue statements on social media that are against people who supported the alleged rape victims. “The past few days have seen allegations of the violation of women come up against me,” said Bushiri. “I’ve observed the rage and anger by women following these serious allegations. “I don’t want my name to be used or associated with anyone who insults, discourages or acts in a manner that speaks against anyone supporting the alleged victims. “I understand the pain of women and how they live in fear of being violated every day. Those who follow my teachings will surely attest to this.” This came after Bushiri made serious accusations of blackmail and extortion against police and media last week, following an eNCA documentary on women speaking about the sexual assault they suffered at the hands of Bushiri. But according to him, they lied as he didn’t want to give in to their blackmail ploy.
