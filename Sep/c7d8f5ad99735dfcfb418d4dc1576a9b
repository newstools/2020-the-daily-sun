Executive producer Rethabile Ramphakela said: “Shooting during a pandemic was very different to what we are used to. How To Ruin Christmas is a very Covid-19-conscious production. The safety of the crew and cast was paramount to being able to bring the story to life. Having the support of a partner committed to diverse storytelling and that believes in uniquely African stories proved essential for our success.” ???????????? coming soon to @netflixsa #HowToRuinChristmas - The Wedding A post shared by  Thando Thabooty Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Sep 28, 2020 at 3:36am PDT
