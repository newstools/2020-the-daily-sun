PHILIPPI residents are in shock after three people were shot in Sheffield Road on Wednesday night. Residents heard gunshots at about 8pm and when they went out to check, they saw men disappearing in the middle of the shacks. “The Toyota Fortuner the deceased were driving was in the middle of the road when I went out to check,” said one resident. A vendor who saw the incident said the vehicle was sprayed with bullets. “After bullets were fired at the vehicle, the driver drove off for almost 20m, but then stopped in the middle of the road,” she said. Brigadier Novela Potelwa said cops suspect the incident may be related to taxi violence. “The Western Cape Taxi Task Team is investigating a triple murder case, as well as an attempted murder following the discovery of the bodies of a couple and another person in Browns Farm last night.” Potelwa said cops were called to the scene at 8.20pm and found a white vehicle riddled with bullets. “Inside the vehicle were the bodies of two women and a man. Indications are one woman was from Delft, while the couple lived in Nyanga and a fourth person who was also in the vehicle, managed to escape, while another was injured and taken to a medical facility for treatment.” She said spent cartridges were found at the scene. “The team is hard at work trying to find the perpetrators.” Last week, Western Cape MEC of transport Bonginkosi Madikizela met taxi bosses in an effort to end taxi violence. “I held meetings with leadership of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Associations and Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations on taxi-related violence and murders that involve their members and affiliates.” Madikizela said there were 56 taxi-related murders and 32 attempted murders between 1 January and 17 August. “SAPS is making good progress with investigations into these cases and others, with 106 arrests over the last three years and 54 cases currently on the court rolls.”
