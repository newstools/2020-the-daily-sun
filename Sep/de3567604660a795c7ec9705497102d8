SO, she’s once again slept over at your place and forgot to pack her overnight bag. Besides looking sexy in your favourite top, she also feels comfortable in your underwear. But there’s a valid explanation for this before you ask her anything: according to statistics, women love men’s underwear 47% more than theirs. According to fashion aggregator Style Compare, almost 50% of women in relationships with men aged 18 – 24 like to borrow their partners’ underwear and it all boils down to the way men’s underwear is designed and not just for aesthetic purposes. “Men benefit from designs that put support and comfort first,” it said, adding women find men’s underwear more practical and comfortable. The same study also showed 17% of men like to borrow their female partner’s underwear as well. I guess it works both ways. Sharing is caring.
