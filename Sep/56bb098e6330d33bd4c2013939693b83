THIS period of Covid-19 has left many people without jobs and therefore no income. Being unable to provide for your family and loved ones is very strenuous. Some people who are breadwinners have found themselves in a tough position of being unable to meet the demands of their partners. When a person is stressed and frustrated, it is easy for the body to react to the stress level. There has been a rise in some men experiencing a different sexual performance from the one that they are used to. Erectile dysfunction is one of the psychologically influenced challenges that men suffer from. The minute your mind is focused on the wrong and bad states of your life, it is easy for your body not to react sexually. Being unable to get an erection or failing to maintain it does not mean you are not man enough. It means you are only human and have feelings too. It’s natural for a man not to give his best performance sexually when he’s not in the right state of mind, so do not put yourself under pressure. This is the time where women are supposed to be supportive of their partners like never before. Being the provider that cannot provide leaves one feeling weak and incomplete. Instead of attacking and shaming them, show support and understanding that this situation is not permanent.
