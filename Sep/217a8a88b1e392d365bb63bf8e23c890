A MEMBER of the defence force was one of three men who were arrested for money laundering and dealing in dagga. The three were bust in Mahikeng, North West, on Monday. Hawks spokesman Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the suspects, aged between 24 and 39, were arrested during an operation by the Hawks, assisted by K9 unit members, border policing unit and Asset Forfeiture Unit. He said this was aimed at dismantling an illegal enterprise that was allegedly involved in activities involving dealing in dagga and money laundering. “The trio allegedly smuggled dagga from Swaziland and supplied it to the market in Mahikeng and surrounding towns. “Following months of surveillance, evidence further suggests that the suspects are allegedly also involved in money laundering activities involving fixed and movable property,” he said. Rikhotso said earlier this year, the main suspect, who is the kingpin, was bust in possession of dagga worth R600 000 and was charged with dealing in dagga. He has now been allegedly linked to money laundering activities. “Two BMWs, two Mercedes-Benz, a Corsa and VW Polo belonging to the suspects were seized as they are believed to be proceeds of crime,” Rikhotso told Daily Sun. He said the suspects appeared in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court yesterday. The matter was postponed to Friday for formal bail application.
