THEY were happy when a construction company came to their kasi to build a tar road more than three years ago. But their happiness soon turned to worry and anger. This is because the company hired by the Polokwane Municipality to build the road in Hospital View, Seshego, left ditches in an open space. Parents said the ditches were endangering the lives of their kids because they played in them every day and could injure themselves. They said there were no barriers and no security to keep the kids out. Germinah Maluleke (44) said they would not feel safe as long as the ditches were not filled in. “Our kids play around there every day. They climb these culverts and then jump off. They sometimes get hurt and we fear they might end up in hospital or even worse,” she said. The residents said they tried speaking to the municipality to fix the problem, but with no success. They said they were tired and thinking of taking their frustrations to the streets. Phylens Ramaremo (30) said he was now thinking of sending his child to a boarding school. “I can’t just watch my child playing around the culverts because I don’t know who I will blame if she gets injured. I’m thinking of sending her away, so she can be safe,” he said. The parents said they tried warning their kids not to play in the ditches, but they didn’t listen. Klei Ngobeni (33) said all he wanted was for the ditches to be filled in. “We no longer know what to do so they can be removed. We are happy a road was constructed for us, but it left us with lots of worries,” he said. Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said their project management unit has been made aware of the situation for urgent attention. “The area will be cleared soon,” he said.
