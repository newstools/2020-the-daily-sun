BAROKA FC fans can now breathe a sigh of relief. This comes after Bakgaga coach Dylan Kerr agreed to remain with the Limpopobased side after he met club chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele, last week. Kerr and Baroka have agreed to continue their relationship for two more seasons. “I am happy to say our meeting went well and I will be staying with Baroka for the next two years,” said Kerr. “I am happy with what the team has achieved despite the tough time we had this season because of the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. “I have a fantastic team and I want to work with them next season to achieve our goals.” Kerr joined Baroka in December, replacing Wedson Nyirenda. Then Baroka were at the bottom of the Absa Premiership and Kerr’s mandate was to save Bakgaga from relegation, which he achieved. Kerr yesterday told SunSport that next season Baroka will not be fighting relegation. “Our aim next season is to finish as high as we can and not be fighting relegation,” explained Kerr. It is going to be tough but I have full confidence in my players,” said Kerr. This will be the first time Kerr will start a new Premiership season with a team. Kerr is well known for joining PSL teams in the middle of the season when they are struggling, and he is hired to save those clubs from relegation.
