CAPE Town City who are one of the teams who have managed to get best results in the bio-bubble camp are looking to finish the 2019-20 season with a place in the top eight after a superb run of form. The Citizens have managed to gather 15 points out of 18 possible in six matches that they have played in the bubble. And that saw them moving up from the relegation scrap and into seventh position, on the quest of qualifying for the MTN8. On Wednesday they take on Highlands Park at the Dobsonville Stadium (6pm), where a win could seal their ambition, but with their opponents having the same aim, it promises to be one of the tough interesting fixtures on the day. Defender Abbubaker Mobara says they are aware of the challenge they will be facing when they tackle Lions of the North. “Highlands Park is going to be a difficult game, they are different to a lot of teams in the PSL," Mobara said. “We have information from the coach (Jan Olde Riekerink) on what we need to do so we just need to execute as players. We need the three points to stay in the top eight.“The bubble has brought out a lot of individual brilliance in a lot of players. We are here for one reason and as a team we want to execute and go home with a smile.”Mobara’s partnership with Taariq Fielies in the centre of defence has been excellent, reuniting a pair that were last together in the juniors at Ajax Cape Town.“The bubble has been amazing for us as players to give us the time to get to know each other. I played with Taariq before, but over the years we lost track (of each other). He went his way and I went mine."But finally we meet each other again and this bubble has given me a lot of hope. His experience has made it easier for me. He is a top player and we need to compliment his brilliance.”A draw could be enough for City to seal their top-eight place, if either one of Bloemfontein Celtic and Stellenbosch drop points against Lamontville Golden Arrows and AmaZulu respectively.
