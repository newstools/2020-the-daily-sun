DILLION
Sheppard is set to form part of new Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt’s technical
team. Sheppard
has been earmarked by Hunt, who worked with him at now-defunct Bidvest Wits. Hunt is
looking for his own technical team after Chiefs sacked coach Ernst Middendorp
and his assistant, Shaun Bartlett, last week. “Gavin Hunt
wants Sheppard to be part of his technical and they are also an indication that
he (Sheppard) may coach the Diski team and Arthur Zwane is his assistant
coach,” said the mole. Just like
Hunt who was clubless before he was snapped by Chiefs yesterday, Sheppard find
himself in the same position. Sheppard
will not form of Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila after the Limpopo club bought the
Absa Premiership status of Bidvest Wits. In turn, Wits have ceased to exist. The
41-year-old, who was deadly with his left foot during his playing days, is one
of the best youth coaches in the country. He was credited for identifying an
array of exciting talent at the Braamfontein outfit. Players
such as Rowen Human (19), Solly Khunyedi (20), Keenan Philips (20), Jonovane
September (20), Mpho Mathebula (19) came through under his wings and were given
debuts by coach Hunt during this past season that was completed in a bio bubble
in Gauteng. Some of
these youngsters acquitted themselves and there’s a big possibility that some
of them will join Chiefs too. Hunt and
the Durban-born Sheppard come a long way. It was Hunt who gave Sheppy his debut
in the PSL in 1998-99 season with Seven Stars before they were then reunited
when Sheppard joined Wits in the 2014-15 season. He was part
of the Clever Boys side that won the double - league title and MTN8 in the
2016-17 season. The following season they added another accolade in the form of
the Telkom Knockout trophy.
