Pastors used to be people one could put one’s trust in. Yes, there are still some who you can tell your marriage problems to and be assisted truthfully. A pastor was someone you could ask to go talk to your teenage daughter and feel free, without any fear of any wrongdoing. But things have changed today, with some pastors having resorted to somewhat wayward and untrustworthy ways. They’ve become beasts. When I was still a Sunday school pupil ages ago, my pastor Moscow Chiloane and Sir Daniel Mokgope instiled in me the invaluable lesson that pastors don’t destroy communities, but build them. Today many pastors are con artists who destroy communities.
