 mlilo songstress, Rethabile Khumalo, is about to release the album of the century. The 25-year-old singer is releasing her debut album Like Mother Like Daughter tomorrow, and she promises songs that people will jam to for years. Rethabile told SunBuzz she wants her music to be like that of her mum, Winnie Khumalo’s. “This album will have music that people will still listen to many years from now. I didn’t just make music for now, but I made timeless music. “Just like my mum who has made great songs that people still love to this day. Her vibe is what I went for,” she said. She said all the songs on the album are taken from real life events. “Every song I write is about me because I know people will relate to my songs. “So all 16 songs are about my life. The album doesn’t just have fun songs, there are also tracks that’ll bring the youth to God,” said Rethabile. “It’ll be educational, motivational and reviving. I went big on this album. “I wanted to give people music that they’ll really love.” She released a single from her album titled Ntyilo Ntyilo featuring Master KG last Friday. The songstress said the song is about a situation she went through. “This song is about a young girl who’s having a hard time with her relationship. So she asks for advice from her parents. She doesn’t know what else to do or who else to ask because it’s difficult for her,” said Rethabile. She said the album features songs with Vigro Deep, Master KG, Prince Bulo, Miano and her mum Winnie. It is produced by Melusi Msimango.
