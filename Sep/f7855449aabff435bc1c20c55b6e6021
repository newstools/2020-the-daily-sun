THATO Radebe (21) had written in her diary about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her ex-boyfriend and how she was looking forward to a good life with her new lover. But her hopes for a new beginning were dashed on Thursday when she was stabbed to death, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend at a tavern in Temba, Hammanskraal in Tshwane. Thato’s mother, Brenda Radebe, said earlier this year Thato asked to be booked into a rehab centre. “She wrote about her dreams. I was happy that my daughter will make a fresh start and make me proud,” she said. Brenda said she was happy when Thato dumped the boyfriend. “He never left her alone. He would call and threaten to kill her.  “Neighbours told me when he was drunk he told them he bought a knife and wanted to finish Thato off,” she said. She said on the first day back home from rehab, Thato went to celebrate. “I thought she might smoke nyaope again, but she said she’d never go back to her old life,” Brenda told Daily Sun. She said on Friday she received a call and when she got to the scene, Thato was already dead. “My daughter was very beautiful. She had promised to work on her acting skills. I looked forward to seeing her on TV,” she said. The suspect was arrested on Friday after cops found him hiding in Leboneng, Hammanskraal. According to police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele, the 30-year-old suspect will appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court today. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela has welcomed the arrest of the suspect. “The police went all out as we prioritise the investigation of crimes against women, children and vulnerable people,” he said.
