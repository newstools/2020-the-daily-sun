THE situation is tense between ANC ward 6 councillor and the local traditional council after the induna fined the councillor two cows. Nyavini Traditional Council in Umthwalume on the KZN South Coast is demanding two cows from Umzumbe ward 6 councillor Nokulunga Khumalo for disrespect. The council accused her for undermining it and interfering with its work at a meeting last week after she questioned its decision to fine a local man suspected of stocktheft three cows. Induna Zibokwakhe Nzama told Daily Sun today the councillor had no authority to challenge the decision. He said Khumalo was disrespectful and didn’t want to recognise him as head of the council. Nzama said once council has taken a decision supported by all izinduna and council members, no one had the authority to challenge it, so the council felt undermined by Khumalo. “No politician is above us as the traditional council, so Khumalo as a citizen under this traditional council must respect our decision. We have fined her two cows and that decision stands.” He wrote to the mayor and Speaker to come to the council to discuss her behaviour. Khumalo said it wasn’t true that she disrespected the council and induna but as elected councillor, she had to fight human rights abuses in society. She said the council wasn’t supposed to handle criminal cases like theft because those were dealt with in courts of law. She said the council operated like a kangaroo court, where it found people guilty without fair trial and she wouldn’t pay it any fine. She said the man was accused by a stocktheft vigilante group of stealing livestock but there was no proof. Umzumbe mayor Londolo Zungu said she received the induna’s letter. She said the council had no right over criminal cases and called on the induna to stop intimidating the councillor, seeing no reason to attend a meeting.
