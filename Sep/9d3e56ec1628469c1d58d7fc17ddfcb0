AKANI Simbine made a victorious return to international competition on Thursday night in Marseille, France. The Adidas-Tuks athlete won the mans 100 metres in 10.19sec edging Ivorian Arthur Cissé who clocked 10.2sec as well as Michael Rodgers who ran 10.27sec. It was the first time in more than five months that the South African 100m record holder challenges the stopwatch. The last time he did so was in March when he competed at the Gauteng-North Championships at Tuks. Simbine impressed on his home track, early this year winning his heat in a time of 9.91sec which ranks him third in the world. It is a mere 0.02s slower than his South African record of 9.89sec. It was also the 25th time he dipped under 10 seconds. On Thursday night in the heats, he ran 10.31sec ahead of Rodgers who clocked 10.45sec.
