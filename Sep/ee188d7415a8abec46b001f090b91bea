“I PLAY my best cricket when I’m being myself!” With these statement, Lungi Ngidi open up on the discussions at the Proteas culture camp recently held in Skukuza. “If I can’t be myself, I don’t feel like I’m giving 100% of who I am and what I can do,” he said. Ngidi was part of the Proteas team that concluded a camp in Skukuza, to address various issues to work on a team culture that would reflect the current group of players and the way want to experience the team environment. “Having left there, I felt we had discussed and reached the objectives of the camp,” Ngidi continued. “I felt happy leaving as a player. I understood everything a lot better. Everyone is on the same page and that puts us in a good position moving forward. “A lot of things have been addressed. These shouldn’t be things that affect our performance on the field. I feel that people should be allowed to be themselves without fear of being judged. “I feel like sometimes people are scared or embarrassed to ask. So being able to speak out in the camp really cleared up a lot of grey areas for a lot of people.” The Proteas fast bowler also reignited the debate on transformation, most importantly, sought to keep uncomfortable discussions about race issues alive. “We all play for South Africa on merit and not because of the colour of our skin,” he said. “Around the discussions surrounding transformation and race around the team environment, it was very uncomfortable at that moment obviously. But it was something that was needed to be done. “A lot of guys shared their stories and how they felt from the different racial groups. “You understand how people feel and with transformation, we also understand that it doesn’t come from the players, it comes from the system. “A lot of people need to understand why it’s in place and having these conversations will help people understand why certain things are the way that they are today.”
