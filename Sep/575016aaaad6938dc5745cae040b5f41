EVERYTHING will be settled on Saturday. The Absa Premiership title winners, teams to be relegated and top goal scorer of the season will be confirmed on the final whistle of the eight planned matches. Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile and Gabadinho Mhango of Orlando Pirates are leading the goal-scoring charts with 15 goals apiece. The duo were on the scoresheet on Wednesday when their respective sides registered 1-0 victories over Cape Town City and Maritzburg United. It is the first time since the 2008-09 season that more than one player will end the season with 15+ goals. In that season Richard Henyekane of Golden Arrows won the accolade with 19 goals, and Mabhuti Khenyeza (playing for Ajax Cape Town then) came second on 16. The duo is currently followed by SuperSport United’s Bradley Grobler who has netted 14 times, Samir Nurkovic of Chiefs, Knox Mutiza (Golden Arrows) and Bongi Ntulu (AmaZulu), who all have 13 goals each. Shalulile is proving why his coach Owen Da Gama said he is the best striker in the Absa Premiership. At the beginning of the campaign, no one thought Shalulile would be among top scorers, except for Da Gama. Last month, Da Gama did not hide his admiration for the 27-year-old: “Shalulile is by far the best striker in the country. He’s proven it in the NFD (GladAfrica Championship), where it’s very hard. He’s proven it in his second season in the PSL.” Earlier this year, the player said he was targeting 15 goals this season, and he has achieved that goal. He is now the contender for the top goalscorer gong. Now it remains to be seen if Shalulile or Mhango will be able to surpass last season top goalscorer Mwape Musonda, who scored 16 goals to win the golden boot.
