THE body of a man believed to be the uMthwalume serial
killer has been in the mortuary for almost four weeks. This after Mduduzi Khomo (41) from uMthwalume, south of KZN,
killed himself in police holding cells the day before he appeared in court. Hearing that Mduduzi had killed himself, angry residents
chased his family out of the area. They said they also didn’t want Mduduzi to be buried in the
area. Community Policing Forum member Lucky Bhuyeni said residents
protested outside Mduduzi’s home on the day his body was expected to be brought
home for burial. “They threatened to burn his body along with the hearse
because they didn’t want him buried there,” he said. One of Mduduzi’s brothers Sandile (33) said he has moved to
Durban. He said he ran away from home on the day he heard community
members didn’t want them there. “I have been in contact with my mother as she was busy with
funeral arrangements. But when we spoke two weeks ago, she had trouble finding
a place to bury my brother. She told me she will try to cremate him,” he said. Sandile said they would ask government to bury him if the
cremation doesn’t happen. He said his family lived in different places, but didn’t
want to say where. uMzumbe mayor Londolo Zungu told Daily Sun she wasn’t sure
where the family was. “They asked me for help to bury Mduduzi. But it was very
hard to find a place to bury him. The last time we spoke, we had arranged for
his body to be cremated. “The problem is I don’t have their contacts. The person I
used to be in contact with is Sandile, but I cant get hold of him now,” she
said. The KZN cops spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said the last
body that was found burnt in Mthwalume hasn’t been identified yet. He said it was a body of a woman but she is still unknown. “We are waiting for
the DNA results,” said Naicker.
