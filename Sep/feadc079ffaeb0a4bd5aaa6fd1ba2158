AWARD-WINNING comedian PelePele Mchunu recently opened his heart and his wallet to a young man in need. PelePele, who hosts the Big Breakfast on Jozi FM, was touched when a man called Nkosana asked for clothes and money for a learnership he had been chosen for. PelePele told Daily Sun: “Last Wednesday, Nkosana came to our office and asked for help from our receptionist. Unfortunately, she couldn’t help but shared Nkosana’s story with the presenters. I sat down with him and he told me about his situation. He told me he is the oldest of seven children and their mum doesn’t work. He said he recently got a learnership but he didn’t have proper clothes for it or transport money. I told him to come back on Thursday and we went shopping.” ALSO READ | RASTA UNDER FIRE! PelePele said he liked that Nkosana was a hustler and a hard worker. “When I heard him speak about wanting to be an example to his siblings, I knew I had to help me. Most people in his situation would turn to drugs or crime but he didn’t. Instead, he wants to do good for his family. He reminded me of a young me,” he said. PelePele received backlash from Facebook users, who said he should not have posted about helping Nkosana, but he said he did it to motivate others. “I believe when other people see this, they get motivated and also want to help. I’ve received help from three people. One donated R250, another R1 500 and a third gave R500 and bought school shoes and uniforms for Nkosana’s siblings and prepared a platter of food for the family,” he said. Nkosana said his family is grateful to PepePele.“PelePele’s help made a huge difference because we didn’t know what to do or where I would get clothes for the learnership. We tried approaching relatives for assistance but no one helped. That’s when I decided to go to Jozi FM and ask for assistance. He was touched by my story and that is why he helped me and my family. We are very grateful to him,” he said.
