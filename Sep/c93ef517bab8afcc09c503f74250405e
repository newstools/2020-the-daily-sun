  Dlamini-Zuma was briefing media on Covid-19 Level 1 regulations on Friday following president Ramaphosa's speech on Wednesday.  Dlamini-Zuma said it was true that many thought that as the levels eased, it meant the risk was lower. She said this was not true, with South Africa recording over 2 000 new cases of Covid-19 the previous day.  "We had to start opening, so that people can earn a living whilst we try and save lives," she said. But she warned: "If we donâ€™t protect ourselves, the numbers will go up and up and we might be forced again to go back to tighter restrictions." "But if we try by all means collectively to avoid that by sticking to wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands, then we might be able to avert the second eye of the storm. The storm is still there, Covid is still there," she added. She said it was more important than ever to wear a mask because people would be moving about more and in wider areas. News24
