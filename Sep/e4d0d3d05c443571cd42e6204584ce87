THE Losers are an elite black ops team of United States Special Forces operatives, led by Clay and formed by Roque, Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar. They are sent to Bolivia in a search-and-destroy mission on a compound run by a drug lord. While painting a target for an upcoming air strike, the Losers spot slave children in the compound and try to call off the attack. But their superior, code-named Max, ignores their pleas. With no other option, the Losers enter the compound, rescue the kids and kill the drug lord in the process. As a helicopter arrives to pick them up, Max, convinced they know too much, orders it to be destroyed, unaware they decided to rescue the kids first. The Losers watch as a missile destroys the helicopter and kills 25 innocents. Knowing that the attack was meant to kill them, they fake their deaths and become stranded in Bolivia, lacking the funds and paperwork necessary to go home.
