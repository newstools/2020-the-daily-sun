MYSTERY surrounds the discovery of the bodies of two unknown men which were starting to decompose at Hammarsdale Falls by passersby on Tuesday. A terrified resident (33) told Daily Sun: “Cops arrived and began searching for the men on Tuesday. But the bodies were not found. Cops kept searching until they found the bodies on Wednesday. The bodies were deep down the waterfall.” The resident said no one knew who the men were. “We don’t understand how they both ended up dead in that same place. It’s not clear whether they fell or were thrown into the waterfall.” Another resident (44) said the discovery has left them in fear. “This left us with many unanswered questions. We have never seen anything like this before in this area, so we are shocked and also terrified.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said Hammarsdale SAPS have opened an inquest docket. She said on Tuesday, Durban Search and Rescue police and others were called to Hammarsdale after a report of two decomposed bodies at the waterfall. “Due to the terrain, the recovery was not possible. On Wednesday morning at 5.45am, the bodies of two men were recovered. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
