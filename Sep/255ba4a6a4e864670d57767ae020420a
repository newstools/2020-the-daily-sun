ORLANDO Pirates’ new signing, Deon Hotto, is excited to start life as a Buccaneer and can hardly wait to help the club challenge for silverware next season. The Namibian international jumped aboard the Bucs ship after his time with former club Bidvest Wits came to an end, following the sale of the top flight status to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). He joined the Soweto giants on a long-term deal and is said to have snubbed PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who were also interested in his services. Hotto has been one of the most consistent performers in Mzansi’s top-flight over the past few seasons, and it is no surprise that the big boys in the league came calling. The 28-year-old speedy winger has built a reputation as an assist king and is a constant goal threat to the opposition, attributes Pirates will be eager to exploit. He was always a thorn in the Bucs defence’s side during his days at Wits, scoring twice and creating another in his two matches against Pirates last season. Hotto, however, is now looking forward to terrorising opposition defenders in the colours of Pirates next season. “Buccaneers! My new home! Thank you very much to everyone who has played a role in my career, a lifelong dream that started in Swakopmund, Namibia has come true,” he said on his social media. “I couldn’t be prouder and feel more privileged to join Orlando Pirates FC and make my dreams come true. “I can’t wait to wear the black and white. Let’s get this work started.” Hotto is joined by his former Wits teammate and Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, who also signed a long term contract with long term admirers Pirates. The pair could soon be followed by another one of their former teammates, Brandon Peterson, who is reportedly not keen on moving to Venda with TTM.
