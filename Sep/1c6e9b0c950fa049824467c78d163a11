A GROWING list of retail giants have been removing TRESemme products from their shelves after their controversial advert. Yesterday, Pick n Pay confirmed to Daily Sun it had removed the products. The advert, which has since been removed from the Clicks website, labelled black hair as dry and damaged while white hair was labelled as fine and flat. Other stores reported to have removed their products include Checkers, Dis-Chem and Woolworths, among others. In a joint statement by the EFF and Unilever, the parties said they’d agreed the advert was offensive and racist. The EFF said Unilever expressed remorse to all South Africans, and black women in particular, and agreed to withdraw TREsemme products from retail stores for 10 days and donate a minimum of 10 000 sanitary pads and sanitisers to squatter camps identified by the EFF. “However, we couldn’t find each other on the publishing of the names of the people responsible for the racist image,” they said. It said the director involved in the campaign had left the company and the country. Disciplinary action would be taken against those involved who were still with the company. The EFF said it had put the matter to rest and agreed to hold discussions on transformation. Meanwhile, EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu announced on his Twitter account that five black kids would receive scholarships to pursue pharmaceutical studies.
