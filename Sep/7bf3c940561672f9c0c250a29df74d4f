that the 30-year-old woman who was with her male partner was pregnant and was
indeed going into labour right there on the sidewalk. “She asked a colleague to go borrow a blanket from
Johannesburg Central SAPS and before he could return, officer Sithole had
delivered a healthy baby boy on the Joburg Streets,” Fihla said. Fihla said the emergency services came as soon as the
mother gave birth and took them to Coronation Clinic to be assessed. “It's been said that they are both doing well and they
have been discharged,” Fihla added.
