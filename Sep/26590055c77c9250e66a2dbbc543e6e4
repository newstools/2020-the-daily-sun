ORLANDO Pirates striker, Gabadinho Mhango, has addressed his detractors who questioned his move to Orlando Pirates at the beginning of the season. Mhango signed for the Buccaneers from Bidvest Wits, where he had scored only 11 goals in three seasons, and the move raised plenty of eyebrows on social media as some Bucs fans were against the move. However, the Malawian international proved his doubters wrong as he became an instant hit at Pirates, banging in goals for the club. He went on to finish the season with 16 goals in the Premiership, and he will share the golden boot award (the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot) with Highlands Park Peter Shalulile, who also netted 16 times in the league. “When I joined the club, I read some comments on social media about me,” said Mhango. “Some people were saying, why sign Mhango, we need a goal scorer, not Mhango, and stuff like that. Obviously, as players, we try as much as possible to avoid reading negative comments, but sometimes it’s impossible to ignore them. But I believe in myself and that is why I never allowed the negative voices to get into my head.” The player revealed that he had set a target of 15 goals at the beginning of the campaign when he joined the club. He stated: “Before the season started my target was to score 15 goals. I always believed that I have the ability to score goals and I did just that. But credit must also go to my teammates. I have quality players around me who made this all possible.” Despite winning the award, Mhango said it would have been better if they had won a trophy for the team. “You can win a Top Goal Scorer award but at the end of the day, what matters most is what we achieve as a team,” he said. Bucs finished the season in third spot on the PSL and qualified to play in the Caf Confederation Cup.
