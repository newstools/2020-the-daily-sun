EASTERN Cape cops are hunting the suspects after six people died in tavern fire in Sweetwaters on Thursday night, after two men apparently stormed into the tavern near King Williams Town and threw a petrol bomb inside. Four people, including three women and one unidentified man survived the incident and are being treated at Grey’s Hospital. Colonel Sibongile Soci said: “Police are investigating a case of arson, murder and attempted murder after two men allegedly entered the tavern shortly after 9pm before ordering people to get out. They then threw something that was believed to be a petrol bomb inside before closing the door and left the place a blazing inferno. Firefighters found the bodies of the six victims after they managed to put the flames under control, while saving a few people trapped inside. All the victims’ ages cannot be confirmed. “No arrests have been made and the motive for the attack is unknown. A 72-hour activation plan has been initiated while the case has been handed over to the Hawks for further investigation and handling,” said Soci. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga sent her condolences to the victims, their family and close relatives. “No words are enough or appropriate to express our shock at the inhumane and brutal way the victims suffered at the mercy of the perpetrators. Our detectives must leave no nook or cranny uncombed in search of the perpetrators behind this cruel act,” she said.
