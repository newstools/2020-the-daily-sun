WELL-KNOWN businessman and alleged VBS benefactor Maanda Phalanndwa has been slapped with a R2 million tax bill. Sars approached the Joburg High Court, where a debt management-certified statement was issued against him. Phalanndwa was a director of Dyambu Investments, that had a stake in VBS Bank. His company, Brilliantel Telecommunications, once also received a controversial over R3 million tender from West Rand Municipality. According to the final letter of demand seen by the People’s Paper, his income tax debt was just over R2,4 million and Sars wanted the money as in yesterday. The legal documents filed by Sars read: “You are requested to make full payment within 10 business days from the date of this letter of demand. You may have within 10 days from the date of this letter to apply for any of the following remedies: payment of instalments where you are unable to pay the full amount, suspension of the debt where you intend to submit or have submitted a formal dispute, compromise of a portion of the tax where this will provide a higher return to the fiscus than liquidation, sequestration or other collection measures.” The letter dated 20 August also warned failure to effect payment or use the remedies provided would result in legal action. “Sars may appoint any third party who presently or in the future will owe you money or hold money for you to satisfy your tax debt with this money. “A civil judgment is being entered against you in which case a warrant of execution may be issued for the Sheriff of the Court to attach and sell your assets,” read the documents. Spokesman Siphithi Sibeko said Sars was prohibited to disclose any confidential taxpayer information, while Phalanndwa declined Daily Sun’s offer to give his side of the story.
