KAIZER Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic believes the club deserve to win the title for the way they have played this season. Chiefs have not won any major silverware in five long years and are looking to break that drought when they face Baroka FC in the final game of the season. It is in Chiefs' hands as they have a three-goal positive goal difference over Mamelodi Sundowns, with the sides equal on points. In only his maiden season at the club, the Serbian-born striker has scored 13 goals in the Absa Premiership. "I wasn't here for the past five seasons, but what I thought when I arrived at this big club Kaizer Chiefs is that it's not acceptable to not win the title," Nurkovic quoted by Sport24. "Because [the club] deserves everything, the way everything is working in the club â€“ everything is on the highest level, the players have basically everything. "So, we deserve to be on the first place, and we've fought from the beginning of the season to be there, and we're going to fight in the last game for the entire 100 minutes to secure [the title]. "Especially, I think it will mean a lot to the chairman [Kaizer Motaung Sr] because it's the 50-year celebration, and I'll be happy that in my first season to have won this title." All the Absa Premiership matches are scheduled for Saturday 3.30pm. -TEAMtalk Media
