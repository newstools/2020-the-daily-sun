OPERATION Okae Molao has brought to book more than 900 suspects wanted for various crimes. The safety programme on Thursday in Mabopane, Tshwane, was led by Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela. They were also joined by Home Affairs and Environmental Affairs officials, as well as Tracker, Gauteng Liquor Board and Sars. Mawela said six cloned vehicles were found on the road. He said they also confiscated two vehicles. “The vehicles were confiscated because their engines were being tempered with. We also took four unroadworthy vehicles off the road,” he said. He said the operation started with detectives going out to the streets on Wednesday evening to look for wanted suspects. “The detectives did a very good job arresting most wanted suspects last night and today at the roadblocks,” he said. Among those who were found on the road with an unroadworthy vehicle were the family of gogo Louisa Molopyane (58). The family told authorities that they were on the way to a sangoma after gogo Louisa was robbed by thugs using muthi. Gogo Louisa said the thugs smear muthi on her hand and robbed her of R21 000, cellphone and bank cards. “They took me around withdrawing my money and until today they are still harassing my family with calls. That is why we decided to go seek help from a sangoma,” she said. MEC Mazibuko said the rule of law was slowly returning to Gauteng. “Time for lawlessness is over. Operations like these are an indication that we will not co-exist with crime here. Law enforcement officials did a good job today,” she said.
