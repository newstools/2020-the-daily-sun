THE two accused in the Hlengiwe Ndaba murder case have abandoned their bail application. Teacher Nokubonga Dubazane (37) and co-accused Mqapheli Miya (46) appeared briefly in the Colenso Magistrates Court yesterday. The two face charges of murder and malicious damage to property following the discovery of teacher Ndaba’s burnt body in a bakkie in July. The 35-year-old from Estcourt, KZN Midlands, was eight months pregnant. The accused were bust separately and made their first appearances in the Weenen Magistrates Court. During yesterday’s appearance before Magistrate Peter Dyson, their lawyers told the court they were abandoning bail. ANC Women’s League spokeswoman in KZN, Mbali Frazer, said: “We took a decision to support victims in all cases of gender-based violence.” A teacher, who asked not to be named, wanted the accused to get a harsh sentence. Speaking on behalf of Ndaba’s family, Noxolo Ndaba (28) said abandoning bail showed that the two accused had something to hide and that they could be linked to the murder. Dyson postponed the matter to 15 October for further investigation.
