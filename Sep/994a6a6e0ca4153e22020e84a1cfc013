POPULAR Instagrammer Ramon “Hushpuppi” Abbas, known for posting his flashy lifestyle on social media, has been bust in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Hushpuppi was a regular at Italian luxury brand Fendi, but a picture of a birthday cake from the label helped lead to his arrest. He has travelled the world in jets, Maybachs and Ferraris, flashing it all to his two million followers, whom he would refer to as peasants. Before you say I’m extra and “too much”, ask yourself...

A court document claimed he and his co-conspirators targeted victims around the world in schemes designed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars. According to a secret service agent, Hushpuppi and his co-conspirators created email addresses, just letters off from those of law firms and other businesses that perform wire-transfer payments. Victims were tricked into transferring money to bank accounts they controlled and those people could never get their money back. According to Nigerian newspaper The Cable, Hushpuppi grew up poor in Lagos with a cab driver dad and his mum selling bread on the side of the road.
