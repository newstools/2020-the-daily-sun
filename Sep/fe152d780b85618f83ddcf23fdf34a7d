THIS week in another heartwarming episode of Sun’Ceda, SunHero Stoan Seate visited shoe repairman Angel Ngobeni in Garankuwa, Tshwane, who wrote to Daily Sun for help. The responsible family man needed help with a proper structure from which to run his shoe repair business because his current one wasn’t in a good state. Stoan told SunBuzz: “I really enjoyed working on this episode because it’s one episode where I got to be hands on in providing the solution, and it was such a fun experience for me because I like getting my hands dirty: from the purchasing of the material for his new place, to assembling it, and I’d like more episodes like that in the future.” The 45-year old musician said it always felt special to do something for someone who does a lot for the community “Angel does a lot for the community without being asked and expecting anything in return,” he said. “He’s a very responsible citizen that carries the spirit of ubuntu wherever he goes. “So it always feels good to do something for someone like that. “For a change he can be the one receiving rather than the one providing, and as Sun’Ceda we were glad we could do something for him that will improve his business.” The Bongo Maffin musician told SunBuzz this week’s episode was a fun and happy one. “In the most episodes of Sun’Ceda at the end there’s always tears because of the depth of the issues that we come across, but this week it was different. “ At the end we were dancing and everyone was happy. “I’m happy we could fulfil Angel’s expectations because a kind man like him deserves only the best and I hope that from here on, his business grows and becomes more profitable.”
