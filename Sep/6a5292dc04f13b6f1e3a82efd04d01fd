THEY apparently invested R130 000 in Prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s gold forex and commodities scheme in July 2017 and never got a cent back. And now the president of the Church Mandate Turn Around Movement, Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, has come to the family’s rescue. Felicia Sibeko (46) from Westonaria, west of Joburg, previously told Daily Sun  she had no food and relied on handouts. Felicia said Mboro visited Westonaria on Wednesday and bought them food, vegetables and toiletries. “I can’t believe we have so much food,” she said. “Mboro filled two trolleys with groceries for us.  “He’s a true man of God. He bought us everything we needed and still wanted to buy us more. “My fridge is full. I’m so grateful.” Felicia said she lived with her husband, Author (54), and two sons. Their daughter lived in Tshwane. She said many people who saw Mboro when he bought the groceries wanted him to pray for them. “People are asking me to tell Mboro to open a branch in this area,” she said. Author said Mboro listens to the people. “He’s the people’s prophet and he knows the people.”  He said he never expected groceries from the prophet when they visited Incredible Happenings Ministries in Katlehong on Sunday. Mboro said he couldn’t ignore hungry people.  “We make sure we support them and give them hope and courage,” he said. “I’m the father and defender of the weak, widows and the orphans.” Mboro said he’s doing this as it’s the work of God.  “This is my responsibility as a prophet,” he said. Mboro said this was their church mandate and they helped people, whether they’re members of the church or not.
