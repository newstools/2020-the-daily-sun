Dear MizzB I’M 28 years old and pregnant with my second baby. I recently found out that my fiance has made another woman pregnant. I’m thinking of terminating this pregnancy. I want this pain to go away. Dear Sister Being cheated on is never a pleasant feeling. When you are dating someone, you automatically trust them to have your best interest at heart. Anger can make a person think and act in ways that they’ll regret at a later stage. Please get counselling regarding the pregnancy and make an informed choice that is not directed by emotions.
