The government has identified the top 30 gender-based
violence (GBV) hotspots in its efforts to respond to what Police Minister Bheki
Cele described as the "second pandemic". "The list was compiled based on nine key variables,
including the number of cases reported to SAPS during the 2019/2020 financial
year," Cele said at a briefing on Tuesday. Cele was speaking after the country's move to Alert Level 1
at midnight on Sunday. The cases looked at include rape, human trafficking for
sexual offences, kidnapping for sexual offences, and domestic-related human
trafficking. In addition, figures of reported domestic violence cases of
murder, rape, attempted murder and assault were also considered when compiling
the list. "The hotspots list also includes eight other variables,
such as calls received related to domestic violence and gender-based violence. "Data was also included from victim support services,
such as Thuthuzela Centres, health facilities and other data from other
departments that paint a picture of GBV in a particular area," Cele
further explained. Top 30 GBV hotspots 1. Delft
