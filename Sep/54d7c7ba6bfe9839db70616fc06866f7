EVEN AS a young boy, Thokozani Skosana already dreamt of being an artist one day. But in a moment of excruciating pain, his life was changed forever.  THOKOzani (13) LOST HIS DRAWING HAND TO A LIVE WIRE HANGING FROM A POWER LINE. His devastated mum, Nomoya Nyakale (38), said her son went to play with other kids on Friday near their house in Duduza, Ekurhuleni. “But I later got a call that he was injured. “We went to where he was and he was seriously burnt.”  She said Thokozani was passing by when the live wire touched his hand. “He was electrocuted when he tried to pull his hand away,” she told Daily Sun. The mum of three said the arm had to be cut at the hospital because it was badly burnt. She said what made the pain worse was that her son loved drawing. “He always told me he wanted to be one of the best artists, but that won’t happen now. When I went to see him in hospital he was crying. He asked where his hand was.” She said she wanted Eskom to take responsibility for what happened. Thokozani’s gogo, Martha Skosana (54) said they were glad he was still alive. The SunTeam learnt that two more people were electrocuted by the same wire on the same day as Thokozani.  Eskom’s Tumi Mashishi said they were aware of the three unfortunate incidents. “We can’t over-emphasise the dangers of throwing objects onto electricity lines as this may lead to shock or electrocution and in the worst situations result in a fatality.” She said Eskom sent a technician to investigate the matter as soon as it was brought to their attention. “It’s unfortunate that a few days after the incidents and Eskom had removed the wire, there were reports of objects being thrown onto the same line. Once again, Eskom responded swiftly to remove the unsafe wires to avoid a potential risk.”
