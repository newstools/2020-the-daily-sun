BLAME was the name of the game, as three cops implicated in
the death of Nateniel Julies appeared for formal bail application at Protea
Magistrates Court in Soweto.  Eldorado cops Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvana (46) and Caylene
Whiteboy (26) face charges of murder, defeating the ends of justice, possession
of prohibited ammunition and discharging a firearm in public, while Foster
Netshiongolo (37) faces a charge of accessory to murder.  Through their legal representatives today the court heard
Whiteboy and her co-accused Ndyalvana were receiving death threats from the
community and Whiteboy fired the shot that killed Nateniel (16) on 26 August,
26m from his home.  Whiteboy said she was framed and didn’t know the gun given
to her had live ammunition, as it was earlier used to disperse a crowd, and was
loaded with rubber bullets. She said Ndyalvana promised to pay her legal fees
if she lied before the law, which she refused. “I used the same shotgun to
disperse a crowd in Freedom Park and the firearm had rubber bullets. The same
firearm was loaded with live ammunition when I fired to scare the deceased later,”
read her statement.    Earlier, Ndyalvane pleaded not guilty. He said his
involvement was to rush Nateniel to hospital when he realised he was injured.
The boy who had Down Syndrome died in Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. His death has sparked war between Eldorado cops and residents,
who’re accusing them of trying to cover up his murder.  Residents gathered outside the courtroom, calling for bail
to be denied. The hearing continues.
