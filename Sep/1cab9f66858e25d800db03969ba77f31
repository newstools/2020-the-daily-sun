THE ANC has lost yet another struggle stalwart, mama Dipakeng Evelyn Nkadimeng, who the ruling party said had passed on due to complications after a mild stroke on Monday. Mama Evelyn was married for almost 70 years to struggle hero ntate John Nkadimeng, who passed on last month. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said: “She will be remembered for her unwavering commitment to the struggle of the people of South Africa. She was an activist and a freedom fighter in her own right.” Evelyn was born in Randjiesfontein on 11 June 1933 and was the youngest in a family of six siblings. She left Mzansi in 1979 to join her husband in exile in Swaziland. She was later sent to Mozambique and then to Lusaka, Zambia, where she headed the Dora Tamani Day Care Centre. She returned home in 1991 after the unbanning of the liberation movement. “As a selfless servant of the people of South Africa, her contribution was aimed not at seeking personal glory, fame or material rewards. It wasn’t motivated by the pursuit of personal ambition, self-interest or an undying lust for power and self-privilege. She dedicated her life to the goal of building a non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous South Africa,” said Mabe.
