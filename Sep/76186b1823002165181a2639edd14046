BUSINESSMAN Lebohang Khitsane was buried yesterday. The founder of Bataung Memorial Tombstones, known for its unique tombstones, was buried in Fourways, north of Joburg. His family has asked for privacy to mourn his death. He died last Thursday, reportedly from renal failure. This after the family came into the spotlight over the weekend after a video of Lebohang’s memorial service emerged. In the trending video, Lebohang’s sister, Semati Moedi, makes shocking claims that his wife was having an affair and that Lebohang died in pain after she’d brought a man into their home. She said: “Lebohang was in pain. It turns out his wife had brought a man into the house. She brought a man into my brother’s house.” Semati had water thrown at her and a scuffle ensued between her and Lebohang’s daughter before friends and family jumped in to break the fight. There were more claims that Semati was not allowed at the cemetery yesterday. When Daily Sun visited the Khitsane home in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, after the burial Semati referred the SunTeam to family representatives, who said she was deeply hurt by her brother’s death and was expressing her pain during the memorial service. “At this stage we’re not in the right space to speak about what led to the incident at the memorial service. She’s in pain and we’re all in pain. We humbly ask for privacy,” said a family member. Social media was abuzz after Semati’s claims. Some people saluted her for revealing the truth, while others said she should have chosen a different platform to speak out. Bataung Tombstones have designed tombstones for personalities including Mandoza, Joe Mafela and Madiba.
