We feel better, we played better. "But you can't always be unhappy, you have to appreciate what you have. "We have been gentlemen and gave competition. Even when Wits won it in 2016 we gave them good competition. "We will give Chiefs a good run for their money again. We have closed a 13 point gap, that is what i am proud of and we did this while we were playing Caf and travelling around the continent. "We competed against a well rested team that has not even been playing top eight. We fought the Telkom Knockout, the Nedbank Cup and now are fighting for the league. You can't be that ungrateful, we've done very well.
