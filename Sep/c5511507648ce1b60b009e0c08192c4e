AJAX Cape Town coach Calvin Marlin suggested that his side were their own worst enemy after failing to win promotion to the Absa Premiership for next season. On Friday afternoon Black Leopards completed a double over the Urban Warriors beating them 2-0 in the First Division promotion/relegation play-offs to return their top-flight status. Ajax‚ were beaten 1-0 in the first leg fixture‚ they needed to win at Rand Stadium and that would have put Leopards under pressure heading to their last game against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Monday. The Urban Warriors are now going to spend another season in the GladAfrica Championship. "It's just frustrating this whole trip here. But there's always a worry when you have a couple of youngsters in the team to keep consistent," Marlin said. "It's just been the story of this whole trip (bubble camp). We've got ourselves to blame at the end of the day." This will be a season to forget for Ajax‚ the GladAfrica Championship’s runners-up as they led for most of the season but were pipped to the post on the final day by Swallows FC. Swallows won automatic promotion with positive goal difference as they have same number of points with Ajax.
