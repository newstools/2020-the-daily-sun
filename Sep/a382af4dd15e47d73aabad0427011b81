Maskandi artist Senzo “Ntencane” Zondi tackles house music like a pro. He is set to release his debut house song, titled Zolo Lami Dlula. The song is about letting go of the past. “This song talks about my past which I’d like to wipe away and forget. “It is also a reflection of good things to come,” he told SunBuzz. “I wrote it some time ago but I never had the courage to record it. But when I was asked to collaborate with Character on his song, Ngiyesaba, I also felt the urge to do this track,” he said. Ntencane is popularly known for his hit album Uboye Nkomeni. Earlier this year he also won Ukhozi FM’s summer song of the year with his song, Wawuthembeni. Speaking about his latest song, Zolo Lami Dlula, he said: “This is my first house song. Previously I used to sing gospel music. I also tried other genres and I was doing well. “However, maskandi music chose me and that’s what I’m known for. “This song shows I cannot be confined to one genre. I am also confident to say this is another hit song. I say this because DJ Tira briefly played it on his Facebook page and people went crazy over it. “This does not mean I’m leaving maskandi, but from time to time I shall be dropping a single in other genres.” On this song, he featured DJ Tira and Joocy. “I’m not signed under Afrotainment, but I have a good working relationship with their team. On this song, I featured DJ Tira, who also produced the song,” said Ntencane. “Joocy added his vocals and a verse then Prince Bulo gave us the beat. At this stage I’m not sure when we are releasing this song, but it should be this coming month.” Joocy said he is excited to be part of this song. “I was actually featured by chance. I had just arrived in studio and I found them recording the song. It felt so good that I decided to add my verse as well,” said Joocy.
