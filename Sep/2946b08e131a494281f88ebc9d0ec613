THE Yarona bus service is finally set to start operating. The Rustenburg Rapid Transport Project, which was started nine years ago at a cost of billions of rand, is expected to be operational by the end of the year. Speaking at a demonstration and key handover ceremony on Friday, Rustenburg Mayor Mpho Khunou said: “This comes many years after the launch of the project in 2011. “We had to go through a number of difficulties. We had to construct the infrastructure. The project was initially set to be completed in 2015.” Among the challenges that stopped the project was the collapse of the roof of a bus station in Tlhabane last year. Luckily, no one was killed or injured.  Parts of the project had to be redone, while lengthy negotiations with the taxi industry also contributed to the process being dragged out. Although R2 billion was initially set aside for the project, it has already cost R3 billion. Some of the extra money was spent on ensuring the buses did not contribute to the spread of the coronavirus and had hand and seat sanitisers on board. Khunou said the milestone could not have been reached without the full participation and commitment of the taxi industry. Accepting the bus keys, taxi operator Cornelius Mogau said people like him stood to benefit from the completion of the project.
