PASTOR Xolani Baartman has come to the rescue of the Atoli family. He will help to bury their child. “She was dumped on a rubbish site, but that doesn’t mean she mustn’t have a decent burial,” said Baartman from Gugulethu, Cape Town. Nomvuzo Atoli (22) from Phillipi was killed on 19 August. Her body was discovered at a dumpsite the following day. Baartman offered to take the family to the Eastern Cape for the funeral and also gave them a taxi for transport. Family member Ntombi Atoli said they didn’t know how to thank the pastor for his generosity. Nomvuzo’s cousin, Ntombi, said: “We didn’t know where to start. “We lost Nomvuzo’s mother in April. Now we didn’t have money to bury Nomvuzo.” She said they are leaving today from Cape Town to Eastern Cape. “Mfundisi Baartman has taken a huge burden off our shoulders,” she said. Baartman said he was approached by his fellow clergymen pastor Zama Mfihlo, who told him about the family. He then visited the family and offered to help them.
