CONTRA CTED Polokwane City players who want to leave relegated Rise and Shine can go. But Absa Premiership teams that are after their services should first engage with the Limpopo-based side. This was revealed by the club’s chief operations officer, Tincy Tema, after club chairman Johnny Mogaladi held one on one meetings with players on Wednesday. City players who are still contracted to the club are Cyril Chibwe, Ayanda Nkili, Charlton Mashumba, Walter Musona, Salulani Phiri, Nicholas Motloung, Mohammed Anas, Mpho Mvelase, Sibusiso Hlubi, Lesiba Nku and Puleng Tlolane. “We are happy with the way the meeting went as we wanted to know if players still contracted to us want to go down (to the GladAfrica Championship) with the team,” said Tema. “We want to come back to the top flight as soon as possible, and we want players who are committed to the team. “We are aware that some players who are still contracted to us may want to remain in the top flight. We have made it clear that we will not stand on any player’s way if he has an offer from a PSL team. All we want is for the right protocol to be followed if teams want a player from us.” He added: “We need to start planning for next season as soon as possible, as you know that there is that under-23 rule in the Championship (teams must include a minimum of five u-23 players on their team sheet). “So we are happy with what transpired from the one on one meeting, and let’s wait and see what will happen in the coming days. All we want is to have players who are happy in the team and want to fight for Polokwane City to return to the top flight, which I believe is where we belong.” Tema also said that they will have a new coach before the new season starts. Coach Clinton Larsen, who was hired in January to help the team avoid relegation, has already left after he failed in his mandate. Many are tipping assistant coach, Bernard Molekwa, to be in charge of the team in the Championship.
