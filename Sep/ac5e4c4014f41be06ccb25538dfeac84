NATIONAL cop spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo says the social media posts depicting a Tshwane building as a centre for human trafficking is fake news. He said the building on Johannes Ramokhoase Street in the CBD is in fact a residential building for policemen and women. “Therefore, the posts suggesting this building is being used for criminal activities are misleading and untrue.” Naidoo urged people not to post these messages, as they tended to create panic among people. “Anybody caught spreading fake news is likely to face charges of defeating or obstructing the course of justice. In instances where resources are being used to respond to such fake news, every effort will be made to recover the costs of such responses.” But Naidoo said human trafficking was a reality and people were affected around the world. He said the spreading of fake messages on such a serious matter was not only a crime but also showed a lack of sensitivity. “We appeal to anyone who has information on the person responsible for the creation and spreading of this message or of any other crime to please contact our Crime Stop number, 086 00 10111 or via our MySAPSApp, which can be downloaded on any iPhone or Android via PlayStore. All information will be treated with strictest confidence and callers may remain anonymous.”
