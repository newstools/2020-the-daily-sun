SHE left her gobela because she didn’t have money to finish the ukuthwasa process. But her ancestors and the gobela won’t let her rest. Dipuo Katu told Daily Sun her grandmum died before she could finish the initiation. She left ukuthwasa in June as no one else could help her financially. But her gobela wants her to come back.

The 26-year-old from Theunissen in Free State said she lives with her grandfather. Her father is still alive, but he’s also unemployed. Dipuo said she sometimes blacks out and her ancestors have made it clear she won’t be able to work until her initiation is complete. “No medication works. I only feel better after talking to my ancestors, but it’s only temporary,” said Dipuo. Dipuo runs away when she sees her gobela. “I can’t keep explaining the same thing. I can’t live with her until I have money. She needs to wait until I’m financially ready,” said Dipuo. Her grandfather, Balu (90), said he wished to help his granddaughter, but didn’t have the means to. “The only money we have is the social grant which we use to buy food,” he said. “I really hope someone out there gets touched by this story and helps. Dipuo still has her whole life ahead of her.” Dipuo’s gobela, Sophie van Rooyen, said she isn’t the one insisting Dipuo come back. “To her ancestors I appear as if I don’t want to help her and that’s not the case,” said gobela Sophie. She said she’s willing to help Dipuo with some of the things needed. “Nothing will go right for her if she doesn’t complete this process,” she said.
