KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has strongly condemned the two girl pupils’ fight on Friday at Mathole High School in Mahlabathini outside Ulundi, northern KZN that was captured on video. In the video that went viral, one is seen pulling and tearing the other’s panty while others are watching, including boys. She’s also seen kicking her in the face twice, asking: “Why you went there? What you wanted there?” Pupils who apparently took video are heard calling on the perpetrator to stop beating her. Mshengu has called for disciplinary action against the perpetrator and was speaking on Ukhozi FM this morning. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi told Daily Sun the report received by the MEC from the school yesterday was that the girls were dissing each other on social networks last week, ending in the catfight on Friday. “The MEC and all of us in the department were very much disturbed by seeing a pupil being humiliated in that manner in front of other pupils. We instructed the school to start disciplinary processes and to charge the perpetrator and all of the pupils there, because instead of separating the two, they just watched and videorised the event and then posted it on social networks.” Mahlambi said yesterday both victim and perpetrator were not at school, so it still wasn’t clear what they were fighting about. He said the bullying pupil would be immediately suspended and if found guilty, expelled. He said the victim is in grade 11 and the bully in grade 12.
