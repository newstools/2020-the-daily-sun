SUNSPORT understands that former Bidvest Wits left-back, Sifiso Hlanti, is on his way to Kaizer Chiefs. This comes as Hlanti, who was one of many players who left Wits at the end of this delayed season after the club’s status was sold to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) boss Masala Mulaudzi, has declined offers from Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns. In declining these offers, Hlanti feels he’s got a big chance to feature regularly at Naturena in the left-back position, where Chiefs struggled to fill it since Tsepo Masilela left in 2018. At Pirates, the left-back position is fiercely contested by Paseko Mako and Innocent Maela. At Sundowns, coach Pitso Mosimane is settled with Lyle Lakay and Tebogo Langerman. But at Chiefs, Yagan Sasman and Philani Zulu have been struggling and this could be the reason that convinced Hlanti to join Amakhosi. But for Hlanti’s deal to happen, it will depend on Chiefs winning the Fifa ban via the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), who heard their case on Wednesday. Chiefs were banned by the world governing body in February for signing players in the next two transfer windows after they were found guilty of unlawfully signing Andriamirado “Dax” Andrianarimanana. SunSport has learnt that Chiefs are in with a good chance to win the case, having delivered a strong argument. If Chiefs are acquitted from this case, Hlanti’s move is likely to coincide with that of his former coach Gavin Hunt. The 56-year-old coach is set to be appointed by Amakhosi as a head coach after the Soweto giants sacked Ernst Middendorp and his assistant Shaun Bartlett.
