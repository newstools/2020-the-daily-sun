Benni McCarthy has offered some encouragement to Kaizer Chiefs following their unsuccessful quest to secure a fifth Absa Premiership title. Amakhosi last won the South African top-flight in 2015 and were on course to claim top honours this season before being pipped to the post by Mamelodi Sundowns. McCarthy, who won the Premiership with Orlando Pirates in 2012, admitted it was heart-breaking after what has been a difficult year for everybody. The former Cape Town City boss added though that a club of Chiefs' stature can only look forward.He wrote on Instagram: "Heart-breaking indeed, this really has been the most difficult year we [have] all been a part of. "The pandemic outbreak has hit hard, losing the league."Dust yourself off and go again guys, Chiefs is too big of an institution to dwell on the past. Look forward to a better and brighter future. Will Rise Again. Love and Peace."Â - TEAMtalk media
