WITH one more day to go before reaching the finish line and having covered about 510kms, ‘Move the Nation’ founders - Kabelo Mabalane and Peteni Kuzwayo – have already raised more than R 1 268 034 thus far, with a few kilometres still to go before crossing the finish line. The money will help feed hungry South African school children. The duo will be running the final leg of their “Hope With Every Step” initiative, making their way into Durban on Wednesday. Crossing the finish line in the city will bring to an end to an epic purpose led run. The indomitable duo will be taking to the road at 3am on Wednesday morning to cover the final stretch of the journey that began in Johannesburg on 7 September. Speaking at the press conference on Tuesday, Mabalane said: “We are urging corporates and the public at large to continue making donations in order for us to ensure we reach our target of R6 million to feed children for an entire year.” This test of human endurance in running for 17 days from Joburg to Durban is a true indication of the commitment that the pair have undertaken to address the national food crisis, particularly affecting our young children. Over the last sixteen days, the two intrepid runners have crossed three provinces spreading hope. They have braved cold, heat, and physical exhaustion and run the equivalent of six ultra-marathons to reach their objective of raising funds for Joint Aid Management (JAM) which already provides a daily meal for 120 000 children across the country. “They have unselfishly dedicated themselves to bringing national attention to the plight of millions of our people and also raising additional funds for such a worthy cause,” says Thobile Tshabalala, Head of Brand at Old Mutual.
