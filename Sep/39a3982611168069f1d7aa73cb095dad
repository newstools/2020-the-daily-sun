ANGRY protesters killed a race horse in Port Elizabeth yesterday in a violent attack against the animals at Fairview stables, allegedly after grooms who lost their jobs were unhappy about not receiving UIF payments. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said between 150 and 200 protesters from Fairview Informal Settlement stormed onto the property and freed 28 horses. “Police responded to a complaint of angry protesters who entered the property and allegedly broke the locks of the stables. The horses were freed and forced out of the property by assaulting them. “They were reported to be running in all directions with their abusers taunting them with sticks and stones. One horse was found dead about 1km away in an opening near the houses. It allegedly was stabbed and assaulted.” Naidu said all the horses have been accounted for and the injured animals were receiving treatment from the Port Elizabeth Anti Animal Cruelty League. The exact reason for the protest, injury and release of the horses was not known. A case of malicious injury to property was opened and was being investigated and additional charges may be added. Provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga said: “The DA condemns, in the strongest terms, the violent attacks against helpless animals. Whatever the circumstances, these violent attacks can never be justified. We are calling on police and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to investigate and ensure those responsible are arrested and the full weight of the law is brought to bear against them,”
