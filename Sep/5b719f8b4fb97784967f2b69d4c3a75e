HAVE you recently been to a wedding or an event where a vintage car was used and wondered where do people still find these? Well, here is one woman, Nosipho Kholutsoane (39) who has made it her business to hunt these cars and rework them to grace the roads. Through her business, Lereku Trading Classic Cars, Nosipho finds vintage and classic cars, re-engineer them and sell them to collectors who then go on to do bigger things with them. She has now fixed four of these including a Pontiac 1947, a Valiant 1970, an El Camino 1973 and a Cortina 1976. Working with four people she now employs out in Mount Fletcher in the Eastern Cape, Nosipho buys these cars from homes where they usually become deathtraps for kids who play in them.  “I order my car parts from overseas since this car industry is still ongoing there, for instance New York. I currently have more than 20 cars and I have sold three cars and I’m currently fixing three cars Chrysler DeSoto 1960, the Fiat 850 1969 and an Austin Mini 1969.” She said her passion was ignited by seeing these cars on a TV show.  “Classic cars are one of a kind, they contain more history. I was encouraged to create this type of business because I felt I can stand up as a woman and awaken what was ought to be useless. Vintage cars are much easier to restore. It might be challenging at times but modern cars need to be updated with a certain kind of technology, which vintage cars don’t need.” She said they are very strong too as they were designed for gravel roads which makes them resist the pressure of losing quality. Her work has not gone unnoticed as she is currently completing the Small Business Academy (SBA) programme presented by the University of Stellenbosch Business School (USB).
