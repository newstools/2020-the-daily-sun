MANU World Star’s much-anticipated debut album is finally out. The talented artist known for his hit single Nalingi features some of Mzansi’s best music talent. Manu Worldstar whose real name is Emmanuel Mutendji, told Daily Sun: “Molimo is an Afrofusion album. It has a nice blend of all the sounds from across the African continent.” He said the album was a true reflection of himself and represented where he comes from. “Molimo means ‘my spirit’ in my mother tongue, Lingala. “I chose this name because I felt this body of work defines and reflects my deepest desires and thoughts. “When people listen to the album they’ll know how I feel when I am at the lowest point and at the highest point of my life.” Manu also said working on the album was fun and challenging at the same time. “This album took me two years to complete. When we started with the whole project it was good, there were a lot of ideas. “But in the middle of the making of the album, it started to get a lot more challenging, with mixing and mastering the sound. “And as we were about to finish the whole project, the lockdown happened. It created a setback in terms of working. We had to work through emails but we got through it.” Molimo features Sjava, Rouge, Rowlene, Anatii and Gemni Major and is available on all digital platforms.
