THE daily commute to the city has over the years become expensive and time-consuming for residents. But the latest development in the Joburg CBD, called Jewel City, is believed to be a solution. It provides affordable accommodation in the heart of the city. During a media tour of the area on Wednesday, Divercity CEO Carel Kleynhans said they believe all South Africans should have access to a proper living environment, regardless of their low-earning status.  “Unfortunately, the reality is that in South Africa’s past, low-earning people are often marginalised to the edge of our cities. “We are trying to create opportunities for those people to live in the centre of our cities, close to everything,” said Kleynhans. “They need to live a good and decent life.” There are about 2 700 new affordable houses, a new high school, rooftop soccer fields, primary healthcare clinic and retail amenities. The units range between R3 500 and R6 500 monthly. Kleynhans saidas crime was prevalent in the area, they were working hand-in-hand with Joburg Metro Police to keep the area safe. Divercity chairman Tebogo Mogashoa said: “The reaction to Jewel City has been phenomenal. “People naturally gravitate to spaces that are safe.” “This is a great place that benefits from infrastructure and community and we are thrilled that we were able to see its potential and redevelop this gem to make it safe and wholesome for families.” Jewel City will be officially launched on Heritage Day.
