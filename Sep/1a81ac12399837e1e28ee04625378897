CLINTON Larsen has part ways with Polokwane City. Larsen, who arrived in December last year to join the Limpopo side, couldn’t save the club from relegation. Johnny Mogaladi's club was demoted after losing 3-1 to Bidvest Wits in the last game this past weekend. Then the 49-year-old on Monday met with the club’s management, led by Mogaladi, and both parties decided to cut ties. “Yesterday I was made an offer with regards to adjusting my current contract but failed to reach an agreement, so we both decided we should amicably terminate my contract,” Larsen said. The Durban-born coach came at the club in December last year to replace Zlatko Krmpotic when Polokwane had lost nine matches on the trot. Larsen couldn’t arrest the losing slide as in his first game in charge of Rise and Shine lost to Mamelodi Sundowns just before the December break. In total, he was in charge of 17 games - he won three, lost 11 and drew three.
