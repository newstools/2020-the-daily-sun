MEDIA personality Nonhle Thema has scored herself a role on Mzansi Magic’s Gomora. Nonhle will be making an appearance as Cleopatra Mofokeng, a con artist. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “When I was called for the role, I didn’t want to do it as I didn’t want to get back into the industry. But then something told me just do it because it could be a really good opportunity for a comeback. “A lot of people have been asking me where they can see me on TV and that’s when the excitement really started kicking in.” The talented actress described her character Cleo as a charming and manipulative young woman. “She goes around defrauding people and manipulating them into investing in pyramid schemes. It’s easy for her to lure people because she looks wealthy because of the way she dresses,” she said. Nonhle said she was really enjoying playing the role. “Cleo is a kasi girl and so am I. I really enjoyed playing her and had the opportunity to show off my tsotsi taal skills,” she said. “However, we are opposites as she doesn’t want to work hard to live a good life. I’ve worked hard all my life.” Nonhle told the SunTeam if God approved, people would see a lot of her on the screen this year. “Taking a break is always good because people really start appreciating you and missing you. When you are all over the place, they don’t have time to appreciate your work,” she said. “If God approves, you will see more of me because even me being a part of Gomora was Him approving of me coming back to share my gift.”
