   AUDI SA has launched its first compact
crossover, the compact Q3 Sportback SUV coupe, combining convenience, elegance,
and agile handling. It cements its position in the A-CUV
segment of the premium passenger car market as sporty, practical, and elegant,
aimed at motorists who enjoy a sporty character as much as design. The black grille of the octagonal
singleframe is strongly three-dimensional in design, making it really sporty,
along with the trapezoidal air inlets and bumper with its flat blade. This Sportback offers driving fun in the
city, on long-haul road trips, or on easy off-road terrain. It features
progressive steering as standard, and the gear ratio becomes increasingly
direct as the steering angle increases, along with the sport suspension, also
standard, coming into play. The driver can change the carâ€™s features
via the standard dynamic handling system, Audi drive select in six profiles,
from comfortable through to sporty and off-road mode. Two petrol engines are available in
Mzansi.  The 1.4 TFSI in the Sportback 35 TFSI
delivers 110 kW and 250 Nm of torque from a four-cylinder direct-injection unit
with turbocharging, using a six-speed S Tronic transmission and producing 0-100
km in 9,3 seconds.  The Sportback 40 TFSI Quattro S line is
fitted with a 2,0 TFSI engine producing 132 kW, 320 Nm of torque, and a
seven-speed S Tronic transmission, producing 0-100km/h in 7.8 seconds.  The Sportback offers the package concept
as introduced on other new models launched in Mzansi, aiming to reduce complexity
when ordering. The model range is priced as follows: Audi Q3 Sportback 35 TFSI S tronic: R693
