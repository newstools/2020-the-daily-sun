ESKOM is tired of izinyoka. The power utility has launched a campaign to address repeated equipment failure and network overloading. The campaign was launched through an operation with various law enforcement agencies in Diepsloot, north of Jozi. According to Eskom’s Motlhabane Ramashi, izinyoka have been causing transformer and mini-substation explosions in overcrowded areas. He added that another focus area of the campaign was to highlight the importance of all communities looking after their electricity infrastructure to ensure continuous supply for everyone. “In addition, the campaign seeks to ensure the energy delivered to customers across various sectors is accounted and paid for by all customers. “Eskom is conducting proactive audits in various areas,” he told Daily Sun. Their audits included the removal of illegal connections and bridged metres, as well as ensuring networks were safe for operations. “We further wish to curb vandalism to the infrastructure in identified hotspot areas,” said Ramashi. “All these measures are to protect network equipment, which costs millions of rands to replace, all because of overloading which leads to prolonged power outages.” Ramashi said they remained committed to continuously improving their operations by maintaining their equipment and stations. He said they will deal with with illegal connections, bridging of metres and illegal operations that affected the proper functioning of their network. “Energy management is important in order to improve sales and collect and recover revenue. “Eskom in Gauteng has regrettably seen a significant rise in public safety incidents. “It’s our commitment to contain and ultimately eliminate public safety incidents that result from illegal activities and cause damage to properties, injuries and, at worst, fatalities.” Eskom urged people to report any illegal connections, illegal operations or any unsafe activities on 0800 11 27 22.
