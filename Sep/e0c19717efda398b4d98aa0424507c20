EKURHULENI Metro cops have opened a case against a man who racially abused them during an arrest on Wednesday. MMC for community safety Frans Mmoko said they were responding to a complaint, when they were racially abused. A resident called to complain about people who had parked against the oncoming traffic and when the two cops got to the house in Geduld, Springs, they got more than what they bargained for. Racist insults were hurled at them by the suspect who refused to be taken in. Mmoko said they were called the k-word, “bloody kula” and all sorts of names. The 40-year-old suspect and his 18-year-old stepson were bust on Wednesday and appeared in court on Thursday.  The MMC said it took 10 Metro cops to arrest the suspect after backup was called. “This is unacceptable. Officers are here to provide policing and ensure peace and safety prevail. We are here to ensure the rule of the law is enforced at all times and need the community to assist us to fight nonsensical acts against law enforcement officers.” The suspects face charges of crimen injuria, assault, intimidation, resisting arrest and interfering with police work. They are out on bail and will make a second appearance in Springs Regional court soon.
