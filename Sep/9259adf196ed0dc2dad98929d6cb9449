VETERAN Bloemfontein Celtic striker Ndumiso Mabena hopes to continue his dominance over Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday (8pm). The 32-year-old captain will lead Siwelele in the Nedbank Cup final showdown against the Brazilians at Orlando Stadium. Mabena has always given Downs coach, Pitso Mosimane, a headache since he scores or assists whenever the teams meet. He also scored in their last meeting when Celtic lost 2-1 to Downs in an Absa Premiership match played at Loftus on 19 February. The soft-spoken player also played an influential role for Celtic on their road to the final, having found the back of net when they thrashed Baroka FC 3-0 in the semi-final last month. Said Mabena: “This is a big game for us. It’s the first time we play in the final and we will give our all, do our best on the day. “We hope to make our fans proud. Credit should go to the boys and coach for motivating us and after a long time we have a chance to play in the final.” Mabena, who finished the Premiership season with nine goals, is aware they will get a tough task to stop Downs from winning a treble. Mosimane’s charges have already bagged the Telkom Knockout and league title. “Sundowns are the Caf Champions (2016), they have experience and are a good team. “You could tell they have experience of managing games, having come from behind (13 points) to catch Kaizer Chiefs to win the title. It shows the experience gained in Africa,” added Mabena.
