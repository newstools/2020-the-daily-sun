SAFA president, Danny Jordaan, has congratulated newly-crowned Premier Soccer League champions Mamelodi Sundowns. He said the Brazilians have shown the utmost professionalism throughout the season. Going into the last match of the Covid-19 affected 2019/20 season on Saturday afternoon, Sundowns beat Black Leopards 3-0 while long time log leaders Kaizer Chiefs were held to a 1-1 draw by Baroka FC. "This is their third league title on the trot and 10th overall," said Jordaan, "and well done to coach Pitso Mosimane and his technical team for leading the team to the top again”. He said credit must go to Sundowns president, Patrice Motsepe, for raising the bar within the professional wing. “Competing in Africa year in year out and continuing to dominate on the domestic front shows the vision of Mr Motsepe and his board," Jordaan said. "Winning the league title also means Sundowns will once again be representing South Africa together with Kaizer Chiefs in the CAF Champions League tournament while Orlando Pirates and Bloemfontein Celtic will take part in the CAF Confed Cup.” The Safa president also commended the thrilling nature at which the league was decided, saying the final matches made for a grand finale and kept fans on their tenterhooks. "Up until the final whistle, the league could have gone either way but ultimately Sundowns through their never-say-die attitude, prevailed. The club has done well in CAF club competitions and we look forward to them raising the South African flag again together with other continental representatives,“ he said. "When our clubs do well in CAF tournaments, it rubs off our national teams especially the senior men’s national team, Bafana Bafana.
