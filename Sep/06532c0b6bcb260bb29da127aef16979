THREE suspects aged between 27 and 29 were arrested by the Bela Bela tracing team and Modimolle stock theft unit. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police teams spotted a suspicious Gold Toyota Hilux with a trailer carrying cattle, that was parked along the R101 between Bela Bela and Modimolle. He said the cops approached the three suspects and demanded explanation about the origin and destination of the livestock. They failed to provide necessary documents of the four cattle and they were immediately arrested for possession of suspected stolen livestock. Police also confiscated the four cattle and Toyota Hilux with a trailer. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bela-Bela Magistrates Court soon. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has commended the Bela-Bela cops and members of the Modimolle stock theft unit for their consistent efforts in hitting hard on the stock theft syndicates.
