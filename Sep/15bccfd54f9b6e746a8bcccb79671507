THE IFP in KZN wants government to keep supporting former president Jacob Zuma’s annual Christmas party for poor people of Nkandla. The party questioned Social Development’s decision to stop financing the event after Zuma stepped down. Party spokesman on social development Mtomuhle Khawula said he questioned the department and its response was it last supported the event in 2017 and stopped after Zuma resigned. Khawula said it was unfortunate the department only felt it necessary to support the event while Zuma was president. “Government was patronising people of Nkandla. It can’t be when Zuma is no longer president that people of Nkandla are not hungry anymore. We suspect government resources were used for political reasons. We want to see this year’s event being supported by government.” Khawula said they were aware Zuma continued to host the event through his foundation without government support and warned the ANC faction not to use the poor people of Nkandla as a political football. Social development spokesman Mhlabunzima Memela told the SunTeam he was going to speak to the relevant official before commenting but hadn’t done so at time of publication. Meanwhile, Zuma was expected to appear in Pietermaritzburg High Court for his corruption trial but the matter was postponed to December.
