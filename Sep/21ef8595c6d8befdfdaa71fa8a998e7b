FORMER ANC Youth League deputy president Andile Lungisa
handed himself over to the North End Prison in Port Elizabeth earlier today. Lungisa was sentenced to two years in prison in 2018 for
smashing a glass jug over DA councillor Rayno Kayser’s head during a council
meeting in 2016. He appealed his sentence to the Supreme Court of Appeal,
last week, but his application was unsuccessful. The court said his application for leave to appeal the
sentence had no basis to interfere with the sentence on the grounds that the
court had appropriately balanced the appellant’s personal circumstances, the
nature and seriousness of the crime and the interests of society. The court also observed that Lungisa used a dangerous weapon
when he hit the complainant on a sensitive part of his body, causing serious
and potentially fatal injuries. Speaking to his supporters yesterday, Lungisa maintained he
had merely defended himself after DA councillors jumped at him.  To me this looks like a fight...He was also hit from behind! pic.twitter.com/zIs5XYpWbV  “I was attacked and that is the reality of the matter and
that truth can never be changed. The video used as evidence clearly shows who
attacked first,” he said. His lawyer Alwyn Griebenow said: “We will approach the
Grahamstown High Court on Monday to apply for a bail extension, pending the
outcomes of the Constitutional Court.” National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesman
Anelisa Ngcakani confirmed that the NPA received copies of Lungisa’s
application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the sentence and
the notice of motion to apply for bail pending the outcome of the application
for leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court.
