ISUZU SA has been doing engineering and durability testing on its up-and-coming next-generation D-Max bakkie. Senior Vice-President technical operations Dominic Rimmer said: “Despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, the engineering and product development team at Isuzu has been hard at work.” He said intensive engineering and testing was undertaken on all D-Max bakkies before they’re introduced in Mzansi. Isuzu’s made the X-Rider nameplate available with the 3,0 litre engine and automatic transmission. It’s only available with six-speed automatic transmission. The double cab X-Rider automatic has strong exterior design on all models, while the front styling features a black grill with red Isuzu badge and black bumper guard. For good looks in the concrete jungle, it’s available with two 18-inch wheel options in black or diamond cut. The interior features black leather seats with red stitching and leather-wrapped steering. Infotainment comes standard with an 8-inch AX2 TFT touch screen system and steering wheel controls, used with the rear-view camera. The rest of the D-Max model range’s had changes to enhance the luxury feel of the leisure models, which now have an all-black interior. Isuzu also announced the next generation D-Max bakkie will be manufactured in Port Elizabeth. Said Rimmer: “This next-generation D-Max is a significant step forward for Isuzu. It offers state of the art technology to enhance driving experience, efficiency, and safety. We have very high expectations for it here in South Africa, so a significant amount of work has to be done to ensure we deliver a vehicle capable of coping with our challenging environment and customer demands.”
