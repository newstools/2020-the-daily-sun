BABIZE Bonke! This is the slogan of the new sponsors DStv, who are taking over sponsoring of the premier division of South African football. SunSport has been reliably informed that the Premier Soccer League (PSL) will this week announce the new sponsors, who will be taking over from Absa. The bank announced in June that it will not renew their R140m a season sponsorship of the premier division. Last week, SunSport reported that DStv have emerged as a strong candidate to take over as a headline sponsor of the Premier Soccer League’s flagship competition the Premiership next season. After shooting a promotional advert last week, the giant broadcaster is expected to launch on Thursday. “It’s happening, they will be launching the new sponsorship on the 24th of this month,” the mole said. “Babize Bonke (Call them all) is the slogan, it was taken from Kwaito music group TKZee’s song Bona Senzani. “The music group even went back to the studio to re-record the song to put in a few elements that will complement everything as it will be used as the theme song.” The insider added: “The deal is done, however, I am not yet sure of the figures and length of the contract. But it is expected that the broadcaster will fork out more than what Absa was giving.” In the season that recently came to an end, the 2019-20 winners walked away with a whopping R15 million in prize money. The runners-up pocketed R7.5m and the team that finished third got a cool R3.75m. MultiChoice Group senior manager corporate communications, Benedict Maaga when contacted by SunSport last week, he said: “We, unfortunately, cannot respond to rumours and speculation.” When contacted again yesterday, he made the response that they couldn’t respond to rumours.
