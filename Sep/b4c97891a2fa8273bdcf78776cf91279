A GOGO and mkhulu celebrated their 100th birthdays over the weekend. Although they do not know each other, they are among a handful of people who have lived through World War II, South Africa’s first democratic election and now Covid-19. Gogo Ouma Wantins, who has 18 grandchildren and 35 great-grandchildren celebrated her birthday with family and friends at Khana Centre in Buffalo Flats in Eastern Cape, while mkhulu Bhunga Jackson, a father of seven and grandfather of 27, celebrated his birthday at Mooi Plaas in Mzwinini. Sithembele “DJ Mantofontofo” Thomas from TRU FM was at mkhulu Bhunga’s celebration and said it was humbling to celebrate such a milestone.  “Jackson wakes up every morning and that’s what keeps him fresh and active. It’s truly remarkable. He is affectionately known as Papa Action because he is always active,” said Sithembele. Boxer regional manager Lesley Naicker worked with Sithembele to ensure gogo and mkhulu were able to celebrate in style with family and friends. “Boxer organised massive cakes and food for the big day for these amazing birthday stars. We wanted to make sure they knew that the community loves them and is proud to celebrate with them on this occasion,” he said.
