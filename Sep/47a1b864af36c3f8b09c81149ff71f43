THE HEAVILY armed suspects thought they managed to get away with their stolen cash, but that lasted for just a few minutes. This is because they had a gunfight with the cops and the men and women in blue won, the money was recovered and they were bust. The SunTeam arrived just before 6am today at the crossing of George Lubbe and OR Tambo, formerly known as Church Street in Bloemfontein, where the BMW sedan and the guards’ van had smashed into each other. Firefighters were extinguishing the burning BMW at the scene. About 2km down OR Tambo, the cash van had been involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle and R200 notes and cartridges surrounded the two burning vehicles. The suspects had fled the scene and the police were searching for them in a chopper. After 12pm, the road joining the N6 was still closed. Colonel Thandi Mbambo said they were compiling information on the crime from various scenes.

A source said one suspect was shot in the hand and his finger was found on the ground. “We will be able to find that suspect by his finger. Cases of armed robbery and cash-in-transit heist will be opened for investigation. Four suspects have been arrested. The fifth suspect died at hospital after being shot in the head. Some of the stolen money was recovered. We are still busy with the scene.” Mbambo said their head office would be issuing a statement with more information.
