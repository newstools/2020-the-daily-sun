THE murder trial of a father who allegedly killed his four kids was postponed to 15 March. Lucas Phasha (50) appeared in the Polokwane High Court yesterday. He allegedly killed Adel (3), Tshepo (5), Joyce (7), and Katlego (9) at their home in Ga-Phasha outside Burgersfort, Limpopo, in March last year. The older three were allegedly hacked with an axe, hit with nails on their heads, while the younger one was smashed with a rock on the head. Phasha’s wife, Sylvia Monyela, fled from their home after a heated argument when he allegedly accused her of having an affair. He allegedly turned his anger on his kids and dumped their bodies in the nearby bush. "SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD SO I CAN DIE" He arrived in court wearing a black jersey and blue jeans. When court adjourned, he waved at his dad Daniel, who was in the gallery with three other relatives. Daniel refused to comment, stating that he is a pastor and his church didn’t allow him to speak to the media about such matters. The trial was supposed to start on Monday, but was postponed to yesterday after the suspect requested the court to grant him an opportunity to get a private lawyer. Phasha’s lawyer, John Mmola, asked for the matter to be postponed as he needed more time to prepare for the trial. He said: “The period given is enough for us to get ready for trial arguments. We still don’t have the docket and will start working on it as soon as we get it. We’re still going to find out why the suspect took so long to get a private attorney.”
