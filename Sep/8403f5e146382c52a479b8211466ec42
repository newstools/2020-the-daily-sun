THE Mr & Miss Albinism South Africa Top 30 finalists were announced last week. The group consists of 17 girls and 13 guys, and they will compete for the titles on 27 March 2021. The pageant, a first of its kind in Mzansi, was founded by Mr South Africa 2016 finalist, Godfrey Mphatswe. Godfrey told Daily Sun that choosing the top 30 wasn’t an easy task because they didn’t use the usual criteria for a beauty pageant. “The most important thing about this pageant is creating awareness. We chose people who could speak well and could be the perfect ambassador for people living with albinism. The voting lines are now open and people can vote for their favourite,” said Godfrey. The pageant is already in African countries such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Malawi. Godfrey said the South African pageant was inspired by the pageants from other countries.
