A WOMAN who heard what’s believed to have been the screams of Nomvuzo Atoli (22) during her murder hasn’t been able to sleep since the incident. The woman from Philippi, Cape Town, didn’t want to be named, saying she feared for her life. She told Daily Sun she was alone in her boyfriend’s shack on 19 August and about to fall asleep when she heard a woman’s screams. “I heard a voice screaming. I couldn’t tell if it was Nomvuzo, but the woman was calling out the name of her attacker and telling the person to stop.

The screaming then stopped.” She said when she heard the woman shouting the name of her attacker, she knew the community would find a body. “Nomvuzo’s killer is a well- known, notorious person in our community, so I knew the woman in question was going to be murdered. “I’m actually scared. I don’t even want him to know that I know what happened because my life will be in danger.” Last week cops released a statement asking the public to inform them of the whereabouts of Sive Mavesta Mpafa, wanted in connection with the murder.
