LOCKDOWN has seen many people losing jobs and being kicked out by landlords after failing to pay rent. This has led to an increase in land invasions by desperate people with nowhere to live. But Ekurhuleni Metro police sent a strong message that people must stop invading land. On Monday, cops burned down a number of shacks while evicting residents in Etwatwa, angering the owners. Community leader Stone Mohutusi said what the cops did was wrong. “We followed all the procedures and the office of the mayor is even aware, but today they came to destroy our shacks without giving us any notice.” Stone said they occupied land which was being used as an illegal dumpsite. Flora Mnisi (32) said: “We’ve been evicted by abomastandi and where does the government expect us to go?” Flora told the SunTeam she’d been waiting for an RDP for years. Gideon Nkabinde said people who applied for RDPs in 1996 were being passed over because of corruption. Daniel Pooe said: “We don’t know why they’re burning our shacks.” A few days before this eviction, Metro cops chased away squatters in Tswelopele, near Ivory Park, and bulldozed their shacks. Ekurhuleni city manager spokesman Zweli Dlamini said the municipality is aware of Etwatwa backyward dwellers. “This is one thing the municipality is doing is preventing illegal land invasions.” he said.
