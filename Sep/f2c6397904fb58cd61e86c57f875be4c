MBOMBELA United boss Oupa Matsebula says they were hard done by the Safa arbitrator who relegated his side from the GladAfrica Championship without giving them a platform to present their case. Mbombela were docked 23 points for fielding an ineligible Eswatini International striker Sabelo Ndzinisa this season as he had signed another contract with TS Sporting. Sporting launched a protest when Ndzinisa donned Mbombela jersey in their first round clash as they claim he was their player. READ: LOCKDOWN MADE ME A MAGOSHA! The verdict means Sporting who were initially relegated together with Royal Eagles when the season ended on Sunday will now retain their Championship status. Sporting finished the season second bottom and were tied on 32 points with Mbombela who had a better goal difference prior to the arbitrator’s outcome. Mbombela now finished the season at the bottom, while Ndzinisa has been banned from playing for two years for allegedly signing two contracts. Said a dejected Matsebula: “The case went in favor of Sporting. The whole thing (case) was done in our absence. We didn’t sit (have representative) on Sunday and they said we should send a junior, but we can’t do that. We need to do it properly.” Matsebula argues that his side was not given enough time to present their case. “The (PSL) prosecutor gave (date) our case against Jomo Cosmos to  the 19th and it was supposed to be on the 1st. That case was decided late, if you look at the time frame. To say when it suits them it’s urgent what about us? That would be fair if they gave us time to be present.

Murders and rapists are also given the chance to present their case in court and we never had that opportunity.” Matsebula says he will decide what to do after they had studied the letter from PSL. “We will study the outcome and then we will make a decision.”
