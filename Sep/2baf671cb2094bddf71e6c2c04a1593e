Musicians should always believe that it’s possible to make it in the industry. The milestone achieved by Master KG featuring Nomcebo Zikode on the hit song Jerusalema, when he reached 100 million views on YouTube, has made the country and the continent proud. This is a historic moment worth celebrating: the very first South African video to reach that many views on YouTube. Many famous artists have hits that failed to generate 100 million views in many years. This is huge for local musicians and it proves that anyone, whether from a poor or rich family, can work hard and achieve greatness in life. Artists must always believe in their music, but they must be patient. The South African flag is flying high because of the song “Jerusalema, ikhaya lami, ngilondoloze, uhambe nami”. Those who still doubt their talent should change their mind and attitude. Big ups to Master KG and Nomcebo. They should continue making us proud. Mzansi must continue celebrating the success of this local song, which has taken the world by storm. Let us give them both a bell. Well done for this milestone!
