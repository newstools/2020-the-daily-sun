SPEAKER after speaker at the night vigil prayer for murdered Nateniel Julies yesterday evening said his death should be a turning point in making Eldorado Park’s streets safer. Hundreds gathered at the vigil as residents of Eldorado Park in the south of Joburg came together near the spot where Nateniel allegedly was shot by police.

His death has sparked outrage. “With his disabilities, he is speaking louder than anyone of us standing here,” said one speaker.  Bishop Marcus Jacobs sent out a strong message to druglords and police in the area. Taking to the stage, he said druglords must be shut down, as well as scrapyards.  He said these were creating problems for local young kids. “Let us clean up Eldorado Park,” he said.  “We want to live in peace. To the South African Police, we want to say strongly tonight, have compassion for our people, serve our people. We want law and order. Order must return to this community. We must put value to Nateniel’s life. We are asking the station commander to clean up that police station of all the rotten apples. ALSO READ: WIDOW EXPLAINS SHOCKING TOMBSTONE! “Stop killing us. We are sick and tired of death. That little boy sent out a loud message this week throughout the nation, he said give the children of Eldorado Park that opportunity to live again, to play again, to laugh again, to sing again, to be happy again, to move wherever they want to.”  Nateniel has been described as a bubbly boy who loved to dance, even without music and was also a big fan of food. Three cops have been bust for his death and are expected to appear at Protea Magistrates Court next Thursday for a bail hearing.
