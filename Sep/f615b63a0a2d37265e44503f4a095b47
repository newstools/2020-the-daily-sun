A 40-year-old man has
appeared in the Louwsburg Magistrate’s Court. The man was found in
possession of dagga to the value of R2.5 million. Police spokesperson
Captain Nqobile Gwala said his arrest came after an operation that was
conducted on Wednesday. “The police officers
were conducting stop and search operations along the R69 Road in Louwsburg when
they pulled over a minibus taxi. Upon searching the vehicle, the police
discovered 58 bags of dagga loaded inside the taxi and in-between the seats,”
Gwala said. In a statement Gwala
said after questioning the driver, it was established that the dagga originates
from Bergville and was being transported to a neighbouring country.
