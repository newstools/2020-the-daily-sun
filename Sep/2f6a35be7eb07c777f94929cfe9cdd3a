THE ANC has volunteered to pay for costs incurred by government after a delegation used an air force plane for its mission to Zimbabwe. The delegation travelled to Zimbabwe to meet Zanu-PF following political turmoil in the country. The party acknowledged it went about it the wrong way.

President Cyril Ramaphosa gave Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula 48 hours to compile a detailed report on how the delegation ended up on a plane she authorised. Ramaphosa claimed he was not aware his party’s delegation had “hitch hiked” a lift for its Zimbabwe mission to meet Zanu-PF, even though he was part of the ANC leadership that sent the delegation there. Mapisa-Nqakula has reportedly handed over a detailed report to Ramaphosa as political parties, especially the DA, are calling for her head. The DA is also demanding that Ramaphosa must make the report public. “We know that this government is fond of obscuring its own criminality.

The party also said in light of the ANC’s admission of guilt, Ramaphosa had no other option but to fire Mapisa-Nqakula. The ANC described its mission as a success, saying a peaceful Zimbabwe would be beneficial to the country.
