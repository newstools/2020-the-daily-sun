 JACO Moyake from Schweizer-Reneke in the North West says the moment he jumps onto his bike, a Honda Blackbird 1100 CBR 1999 model, everything comes to a standstill. He’s named his bike “Nonyane - angry bird”, because it flies and roars on the road. Jaco’s love of bikes started years ago when he worked as a patroller at the border between Mzansi and Botswana. He said he used to see riders passing in groups and it inspired him. Nonyane is not his first bike. He has owned a Honda 400 Blackhawk, Suzuki 400, Suzuki 1100, Kawasaki Zx 1200 and Vulcan 900 before. Jaco said he has collected a few fines because he likes speed. He said being a member of riding club Segongwana MCC in Mahikeng helps him to remain grounded and responsible while enjoying their art. He refers to his riding jacket as his best buddy because it makes him feel comfortable. “And the badges represent all the wonderful work we do every time we donate to different charities,” he said. Biking has taken him to Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Gauteng. Jaco said most motorists are simply rude and don’t recognise bikers. “Some will even stick their middle finger out of the window for reasons known to them. They seem to forget that we all pray to be on the roads,” he said.
