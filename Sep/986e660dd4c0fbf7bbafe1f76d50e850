 HE PROMISED her pain like she had never seen. And he gave her that pain in a way she could never have imagined. IN FRONT OF HER EYES, HE POURED PARAFFIN OVER HER SON – AND STRUCK THE MATCH! RACHEL Mashego (42) never thought the day would come when her customary husband of more than 20 years would take away what she loved most in the world. On 7 August they had a terrible argument. “He beat me up badly and then took a container of paraffin from our room and went to the room where our son was asleep,” the mum of two from Acornhoek in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun. “I went on my knees and begged him not to harm our child. But he told me to watch what pain is like.” Her son Tokelo (4) woke up and started screaming as the cold liquid streamed over his skin. “Then he set him alight,” she said. “I watched my son crying and burning as the fire raged. “I ran outside for help and the neighbours came to put out the fire.” She said the father walked away. “He said he told me he’d teach me a lesson.” Tokelo died a week later. Her husband (48) was bust but later released on bail. Now Rachel is living in fear. “I don’t know why he was given bail.” she said. Rachel’s younger sister, Stella Mashego (38) said she couldn’t understand why he got bail. “That man was not supposed to get out. We don’t know what he is going to do.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed a case of murder was opened and the suspect appeared in court last Monday. He told the People’s Paper that he will appear in court again later this month.
