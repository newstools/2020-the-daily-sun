LEHASA Moloi was shocked when he recently learned people
were going on to Google to check whether he was still alive. The Muvhango actor said he wanted to reassure his fans that
he was alive and kicking. “This is strange and I take it as a laughing matter as I
have not kicked the bucket,” said the actor from Welkom, Free State. Lehasa, who plays Dr Kutlwano on the SABC2 soapie, said: “It
is only God who knows our path.” He first played the role in 2010 and came back to the show
last year. “Kutlwano is KK Mulaudzi’s family doctor. He believes too
much in other people and gets taken for a ride. He is a loving person and fell
in love with Matshidiso,” he said. “They teamed up to take revenge on KK, who wronged
Matshidiso. They poisoned KK slowly to take his money but Matshidiso made a
U-turn and suddenly turned against Kutlwano.” Lehasa said Kutlwana shot Matshidiso and went on the run. “He opened a clinic in an informal settlement and found a
new lover. However, he is now trying to get back together with Matshidiso,” he
said. Lehasa said his character was obsessive and anxious. “Unlike Kutlwano, I am committed to my wife Cleo Moloi. We
have been together for eight years and married for seven. She is close to my
heart,” he said. On top of being an actor, Lehasa is the owner of Lehasa
Moloi Marketing which helps people grow their businesses on social media and
offers copy writing, creative content and production services. Lehasa has acted in several television productions,
including Rockville and Gold Diggers 2.
