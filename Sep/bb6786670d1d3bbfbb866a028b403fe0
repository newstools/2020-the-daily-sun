THE 32 KZN artists arrested last week have been hailed as heroes by the creative industry. After protesting against lockdown regulations in Durban last week, they were charged with illegal gathering and going against the National Road Traffic Act. They appeared in the Pinetown Magistrates Court yesterday. The artists include Noma Khumalo, Character, Melusi Ndlovu, Sandile Bhengu, Igasi FM presenter DJ Bhunu and Naima Kay. Lawyer Thula Mlondo told the court actress Nokuthula Mabika was sick and her warrant of arrest was stayed. Speaking to Daily Sun, lawyer Simphiwe Mncwango said “on 23 October, we shall be filing representations to the state,” as hundreds of artists from all over Mzansi sang revolutionary songs outside the court, SINGER FAINTED ON IDOLS SA! Kwaito legend Eugene Mthethwa said: “The true leadership is in KZN. “Forget about the other provinces, because there is no leadership there. They’re cowards.” Another legend, Oskido, encouraged artists to be organised and keep fighting. “I’d like to commend the bravery of the KZN artists. They started this and it must not stop here. “We promise to stand with them, no matter what,” he said. President of the Cultural and Creative Industry Federation of SA, Joy Mbewana, said the campaign was not political. “We are not fighting with the president and our campaign must be seen as a non-political campaign. “As we are fighting for all artists, we are organising ourselves as the creative industry.” The case was moved to 23 October.
