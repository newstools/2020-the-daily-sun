Mamelodi Sundowns are expected to parade their Absa Premiership trophy around Pretoria townships in an open bus ticker-tape tour next week. This as they celebrate their 10th Premiership title - a third in a row for the Brazilians who pipped Kaizer Chiefs to the finish line on the last day of the 2019-20 PSL season. The tour is delayed a bit by their planned weekend Nedbank Cup final on Saturday night where they will face Bloemfontein Celtic to complete a double of trophies. It has been a hectic season for Sundowns who have been chasing Chiefs for the better of the season, but finally they managed to wrestle it from their grasp. There is more reason for the Brazilians players to express their joy on social media displaying their medals and the trophy. Some are hanging three gold medals to show that they have hit a hat-trick of victories with the club. It is expected that the players will share the R15 million prize money that comes with the trophy, as it is the norm at Sundowns where club boss Patrice Motsepe demands no cent from it.

I called myself a member of the team, their teammate. I'm just someone who does not want to let my team and my teammates down pic.twitter.com/rwjjZ8MDaY
