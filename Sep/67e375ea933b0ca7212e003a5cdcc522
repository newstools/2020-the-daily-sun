ANOTHER prosecutor has withdrawn from Timothy Omotoso’s human trafficking trial over controversy surrounding the indictment. In March, former prosecutor Advocate Nceba Ntelwa suddenly withdrew from the matter just before Port Elizabeth High Court Judge Irma Schoeman was about to rule on an application brought by the state to amend the indictment against Omotoso and his co-accused. The trial has seen several setbacks since it began. The original presiding Judge Mandela Makaula recused himself last year. On Monday, state prosecutor Advocate Ishmet Cerfontein, who had been assisting Advocate Ntelwa, also withdrew. Omotoso, along with Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, face 97 charges ranging from rape and human trafficking to racketeering. All three have pleaded not guilty. "SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD SO I CAN DIE" Christians of South Africa president Derick Mosoana said his organisation had noted the developments in the trial with concern. “We were told on Monday that Cerfontein had withdrawn from the case that has dragged on for over two years,” he said. “We are convinced there’s more than meets the eye with this case and this chopping and changing validates our conviction that the trial in its current form is a miscarriage of justice. “We will march to the Director of Public Prosecutions’ head offices in Tshwane on 23 September to demand that all charges against Omotoso be dropped.” Omotoso has been in custody since his arrest, while Sulani and Sitho are out on bail. NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakazi had not responded to the SunTeam’s calls or text messages by the time of going to print.
