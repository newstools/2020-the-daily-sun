VIRGINS are gatvol of perverts and want them to just voetsek! Nompilo Nkosi (17) from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, said when men try to convince girls to have sex with them and they refuse, some use force. “We can’t even walk on the streets freely because they lust after us,” she said. “We want them to know that we’re not their objects. No, means no!” Ntobeko Mdima (16) said perverts rape and murder girls. “When a girl refuses to be with them, they say they’ll teach her a lesson,” she said. “I don’t see any lesson. All I see are perverts who can’t control themselves. “Men found guilty of abusing women must get the harshest sentences possible.” Ntobeko said women should be allowed to wear whatever they want. “Whether it’s short or revealing, if I’m comfortable I should wear it without fear of becoming a victim,” she said. The virgins met in Tsakane extension 19 on Sunday to celebrate Heritage Month at Ebuhleni Bezintombi virginity testing school. Doctor Mokoena, who’s been running the school for more than nine years, said they teach girls to protect their virginity until they get married. “We also have boys in the school and we teach them to respect women,” he said. Sophie Ntombela, leader of Nomkhubulwane Cultural group in Leandra in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun they were raising imbokodo of tomorrow. “Virginity testing schools are very helpful to society because they help to remove the girl from the streets, where they’re exposed to all sorts of bad things,” said Sophie. Parent Nokuthula Ngobe (45) said her 17-year-old daughter joined the school when she was very young. “I’m happy she’s still a virgin and is focusing on her books,” she said. “I pray she stays pure until she’s married because boys destroy futures. Many are perverts.” The virgins said the death sentence should be brought back to deal with those who think they can abuse women and get away with it.
