GOGO Thandi Maringa needs closure for her son’s death. But it seems this will not happen until her son is buried. Her son, Eugene (47), burnt to death in a shack in Alaska, Mamelodi last Wednesday. The 71-year-old from B3 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, said neighbours found the burnt shack and reported the matter to the police. The People’ Paper published the story on 11 September with the headline: “Family mourns humble Eugene.” Gogo Thandi apparently collapsed when she heard she might bury her son after six months as pathologists were still investigating. The gogo told Daily Sun the police handling her son’s case were not updating the family.  “Police are telling us to wait at least six months to a year to get my son’s remains. “When I ask the police why we have to wait so long, they tell us not to bother them because they are not doctors. I’m traumatised,” she said. Gogo Thandi said she took a DNA test and was waiting for the results. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the family had a meeting with the investigating officer and station commander on Tuesday. “The body was burnt beyond recognition. They did DNA tests and are awaiting results. They explained to the family that the body will be released as soon as DNA results are available. An investigating officer is in contact with the family and is updating them,” he said.
