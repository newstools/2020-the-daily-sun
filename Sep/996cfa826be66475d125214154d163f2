“YOU cough, you get out!” That is the sticker seen behind the driver in one of the taxis, allegedly in Botshabelo. The photo went viral on Facebook with people saying it’s a taxi operating in sections A, B and C in the Free State’s second biggest township. Coughing is known to be one of the symptoms of Covid-19. While others said the sticker was putting passengers in a difficult position of being too scared to cough, others asked what would happen if the driver himself coughed. Matsitsa Nomasonto asked: “If you sneeze, is that a problem too?” Reabetswe Thene said: “I was riding in that taxi yesterday. It’s a taxi loading passengers in section A, B, C and D.” Emily Bianca agreed and said she also took a ride in the taxi after it loaded her in B section. Kgadi Kgadi said life is tough. The SunTeam had not managed to get hold of the driver of the taxi with the sticker. Taxi driver Thabo Matlape told Daily Sun: “I know the taxi but I don’t have the contact number of the driver.” Some had responded saying the taxi was fondly known as Problem Child.
