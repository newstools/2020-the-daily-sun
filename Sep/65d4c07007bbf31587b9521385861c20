DYLAN Kerr says he would love to stay on as Baroka FC coach next season and beyond. But whether that will happen or not it will be determined by the meeting the Englishman will have this week with Bakgaga chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele. “I love this team and with regards to my future, I will have a meeting with the chairman this week,” confirmed the former Black Leopards coach. “I cannot say much. We have to wait and see what will transpire from the meeting. I have made my intentions clear to the club that I would love to stay.” Kerr joined Baroka last year, replacing Wedson Nyirenda in December and has helped the Limpopo-based side survive relegation this season. Kerr has also made it clear he wants to improve Baroka, and that they should not be a side which is fighting relegation every season. The 53-year-old was forced to apologise after having made public pronouncements that he is not happy with the interference from the club when his team beat Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 last month. Kerr also said he is pleased with the signings of goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke and Augustine Mahlonoko. “They are good players and I would love to work with them next season,” said Kerr. “But as I said, I don’t want to talk much as I still have to meet the chairman to pave the way forward.”
