MEDIA personality and businesswoman Bonang Matheba had more than just coronavirus and lockdown to worry about this winter. Queen B, as she is known in celebville, lost one of her bling crowns when someone stole her expensive bracelet. She told Sandton cops her diamond encrusted bracelet worth more than R100 000 was stolen when she was moving house between June and last month. Police spokesman captain Mavela Masondo confirmed a case of theft was opened, but no one has been arrested. Bonang told Daily Sun that the matter was personal and therefore she would not comment. Pickfords, the company that was contracted to move the star’s goods, said they are not aware of a missing bracelet. Bonang’s insurance company, Discovery Insure, said they were not aware of the matter. Deputy CEO Francois Theron said: “As Discovery Insure, our clients’ privacy is of the utmost importance. We pride ourselves in treating clients fairly. “This specific case has not been brought to our attention and as such, we are not able to comment on this.”  According to a police statement seen by Daily Sun, Bonang told the cops she only noticed after a month that her piece of jewellery was missing. “Complainant alleges that on 2020-06-28, people started moving her household goods from Bryanston (address withheld) to the new place in Waterfall. They took about a week to move the stuff completely from Bryanston. A month later she noticed her diamond bracelet was stolen from where it was. “She does not suspect anyone in particular because there was a lot of movement happening during the month of June to August 2020. “The value of the brown tennis bracelet is R125 538,” read the statement. Bonang is not the first Mzansi celeb to lose her bling in recent years. Media personality Minnie Dlamini-Jones lost her Jenna Clifford wedding ring worth R250 000 when she was robbed at gunpoint while waiting at a red robot in Randburg, Joburg in 2018.
