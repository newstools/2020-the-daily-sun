JAN Steenberg is one of the oldest people in the country, but his living conditions are shocking. The 115-year-old’s wooden house, handed over to him by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality last year, has broken windows and the walls are peeling. Jan, who was born in Colchester near Port Elizabeth in 1904, told Daily Sun: “I appreciated the municipality’s assistance. However, the structure of my home is not good and I have gone back to my old house. The wooden house leaks when it’s raining. “Its walls have gaps and the wind comes through the window pane. The floor is not stable and makes a lot of noise. “I’m old and don’t like to be disturbed because I spend most of my time sleeping.” Jan’s daughter, Kate Nortie, who lives with him said: “We were promised last year that the municipality will demolish the old main house and build a new one. I hope the officials will hear our plight and fulfil their promise.” Municipal spokesman Mamela Ndamase said the commitment made to rebuild Jan’s house was delayed by the coronavirus, as all construction had to be put on hold. “We are still going to pursue the commitment and with level two in place, the engagements will now commence between the city and the provincial department of human settlements,” he said.
