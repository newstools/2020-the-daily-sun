The Botswana Football Association (BFA) chief executive, Mfolo Mfolo, says they will not have a problem releasing Zebras head coach, Adel Amrouche, from his contract depending on what he wants. According to Mfolo, Amrouche has a two year contract with the federation and has asked for three weeks to visit his family in Belgium, and we expect him back next week. "We're not privy to informational that he's talking to Chiefs weeks to attend to personal matters back in Belgium, and have not heard from him since. He said they expect their senior national team coach back in Botswana next week where they will also have conversations about the widely reported rumours that he is in talks with Kaizer Chiefs, with the hope of joining them. "By the time when the lockdown happened he was still in Botswana and could not travel, so he asked for leave to go and check on his family," explains Mfolo. SunSport understands that Amrouche's salary package, believed to be P250 000, was one of the reasons that the association could release him, but Mfolo disagrees. "We're not aware of that," he said. "We will be playing in back to back Afcon in November and we expect him to start preparing the team. "If he wants to pull out of the deal, we will deal with it when it comes, reach an agreement. "We just have to see what are the terms on his contract. There is nothing that we can do if someone wants to terminate a marriage. "I have read that he is a principled man and cannot take someone's job, but he admitted lately that he was in talks with Chiefs, according to reports."
