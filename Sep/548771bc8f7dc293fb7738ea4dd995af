ALCOHOL companies often sponsor things that make us feel good. So we start to make the link between watching football and drinking beer – or watching a comedy show and drinking wine. You’re being trained to think that the two must go together, when they absolutely don’t. Why is it that we think we need to drink to have a good time, when some of the funniest people don’t drink? Sobriety is an excellent truth filter for your life. There will probably be things that you don’t enjoy quite so much when you go alcohol-free and that’s okay. Sobriety isn’t just a matter of quitting drinking. It’s about figuring out who you really are and creating a life that’s genuinely fun and happy – one that you don’t need to numb out from. Never let anyone change you because they think you are uncool because you don’t conform to societal expectations.
