THE high school pupil who was captured on the video kicking
and tearing her school mate’s panty is in a critical condition at the hospital
after poisoning herself. Her 38-year-old mum told Daily Sun today that her daughter
was rushed to the hospital after drinking dip tank poison. She said her 16-year-old daughter is in the critical but
stable condition. The daughter told her mum  she drank the stuff to kill herself on Monday
afternoon after reading negative comments about her action on social network
where people criticized her. Her family found her lying down complaining of unbearable
stomach pains. They found the dip tank poison container next to her and
immediately rushed her to hospital where doctors confirmed that she drank
poison. In the video the grade 11 pupil is seen pulling and tearing
her school mate's panty in font of other pupils including boys. She is also seen
kicking her in the face and heard asking why she went there and what she was
doing there. The incident was strongly condemned by education MEC Kwazi
Mshengu who ordered the school to immediately suspend her and all other pupils
who are seen in the video. The MEC said those who watched the incident will also face
the disciplinary action.
