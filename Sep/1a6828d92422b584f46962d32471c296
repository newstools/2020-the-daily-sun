THE 25-YEAR-OLD allegedly killed his mum, chopped off her head and put it in a bag, left Tshwane and boarded a taxi for the North West. Unfortunately for him, cops were called and he was bust on Saturday at Montshiwastad Village, Mahikeng. The man, who even admitted to police that indeed he’d killed his own mum, appeared in Molopo Magistrates Court in Mmabatho yesterday on charges of possession of a human body part. His court appearance follows his arrest when the Flying Squad acted on a tip-off about a suspect who allegedly had killed his mother and was carrying her head in a bag. Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said on arrival at the scene, police found the bag in the suspect’s possession and a human head was inside. “The suspect allegedly admitted to killing his mother on Monday 7 September in Hercules, Pretoria. As a result, he was arrested,” he said. After the suspect’s appearance yesterday, he was transferred to Pretoria to face a charge of murder. Mokgwabone said the motive was unknown and investigation into the matter was still ongoing. North West commissioner Lieutenant-General Sello Kwena applauded the cops for their quick response resulting in the gruesome discovery and arrest of the suspect, who is scheduled to appear on 28 September at Pretoria Magistrates Court.
