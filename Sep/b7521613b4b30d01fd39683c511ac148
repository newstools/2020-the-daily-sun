NTIYISO Shilumani has been sentenced to life imprisonment. The 26-year-old was found guilty by the Limpopo High Court in Polokwane for the murder of his girlfriend Shongile Nkwashu (24), an intern doctor at Mankweng Hospital, in January. Ntiyiso begged for forgiveness from Shongile’s dad, Kenneth.During cross examination by prosecutor Advocate Eric Mabapa, Ntiyiso said he and Shongile were not on good terms before the murder. He said he sent death threats to Kenneth after hearing he did not approve of their relationship. Judge President Ephraim Makgoba said: “It’s time for the youth to learn that when relationships turn sour, they don’t threaten the lives of others.” Shongile’s father said he didn’t accept Ntiyiso’s plea for forgiveness. “How am I going to tell Shongile’s two-year-old son that his father killed his mother?” In a sworn statement read to the court on Monday, Ntiyiso said he got into an argument with Shongile, started biting her finger and throttled her with his right hand. Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba said no sentence would bring Shongile back to life but she could rest in peace now that her killer was behind bars for life. Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Ivy Thenga commended the state advocate, investigation team and Health Department for making sure the killer was convicted.
