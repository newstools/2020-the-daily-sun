The ANC Women’s League in Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality started a gender-based violence awareness campaign today in KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth. This after 55-year-old Sindiswa Boqwana-Thomas was brutally killed by two gunmen last Friday in what looked like a hit. Wearing their ANC regalia, the women waved placards and marched from Salamntu Street to Sindiswa’s home. The league’s Young Women’s Desk co-ordinator Simbulele Gosani told Daily Sun, “We are here to say crime is wrong, especially against women. We are against all sorts of abuse and femicide. We are doing this campaign throughout the metro. “Sindiswa was brutally murdered. Communities must stand up and fight against it.” Ward councillor Kholekile Boqwana said: “We are devastated as a family, especially our mother (80). “My sister was working for Nelson Mandela Bay Waste Management as a cleaner for 18 years. We suspect this was a hit because she was shot on her way back from work to home.” Captain Andre Beetge said, “On Friday at 7:25pm, Sindiswa was walking in Ngqondela Street with a 19-year-old family member, when two unknown armed men fired shots at her. She was fatally wounded in the head and passed away on the scene. The motive for the attack is unknown at this stage but leads are being investigated.”
