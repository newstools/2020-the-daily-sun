THANKS to Master KG, Sibah Musiq has got his big break. The vocalist and producer, whose real name is Sibongiseni Langa, was happy when he recently found out he had won Master KG’s Facebook competition to find new talent from 4 August until 4 September. Speaking to Daily Sun, Sibah said: “He put a beat on his page for us to work with. One of the requirements to enter was that you had to be someone unknown in the industry. “He said the winner would be featured on his album.  “I downloaded the beat and recorded a song called Dali. Fortunately, I have a small backroom studio. I ended up doing a four-minute song with two verses and a chorus. “Once I was done, I sent it to Master KG via email.” Later that day, Master KG played all the submitted tracks for his fans. “I believe he liked what I did and people also liked my work. Two weeks later, he announced the top 10, but my name was not on the list. Later that night, he posted on Facebook that I had won,” said Sibah. “I was shocked, excited and had no words at the same time.” People on Facebook soon started congratulating Sibah.  Sibah thanked Master KG for kick-starting his career.“We are working on this song and he is giving it his undivided attention,” he said. Master KG said: “He actually sang the song very well and wrote it very well. “That’s exactly what I was looking for. And I believe the song will win many people’s hearts when we release it. The competition ran for a week.”
