BOY Mashile (56) of Clare Village outside Hluvukani in Greater Manyeleti in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga told his family of his death several times. And two weeks ago he disappeared mysteriously, after telling his family and villagers that killers wanted him dead. A cop search was held at relatives, friends, the mortuary and bushes, but was unsuccessful. Worried aunt Sinah Mashile (63) said: “A few months ago, Boy came home running half-naked and bleeding from injuries. He told everyone in the village a man and his friends known to us tried to bundle him into the car on his way home from drinking in Ludlow, but he managed to slip out and ran away for his life. “He kept saying he was seeing his death in his dreams. He saw his body being buried in a shallow grave. And it happened.” Gogo Sinah said they received a call that Boy was found dead in the bushes on the outskirts of the village. “We found his decomposed and tarred body lying on its back in the bushes on the outskirts of the village. “He had cut wounds in the head and his body. So we believe he was killed elsewhere before his killers dumped him in the bushes. He had tar all over his body a few metres from the Manyeleti tarred road. So his killers must be brought to book and face the mighty hand of the law.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “A case of murder is under investigation after Mashile’s body was found in the bushes in Clare. His body was found yesterday. A postmortem will be conducted soon to determine the cause of death.
