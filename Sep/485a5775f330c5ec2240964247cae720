FORMER Ninnies Neurons day care teacher Nellie Senwametsi will appear in Oberholzer Magistrates Court today. Her sentencing was postponed last week due to the defence lawyerâ€™s inability to attend because he was in self isolation. However, this was not communicated to all relevant parties, who were unhappy about it. Senwametsi was convicted of two counts of common assault and one count of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm of three children aged four after Daily Sun previously reported on three separate videos that went viral on the 4 April showing her abusing the kids. The Women and Men Against Child Abuse organisation has called for a minimum sentence of 10 years.
