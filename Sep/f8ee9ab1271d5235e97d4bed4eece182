A QUIET night where the family was watching TV and getting ready for the next day ended in tragedy last night when the woman of the house, businesswoman Maria Hlela (51) was allegedly gunned down by two men. Two armed men allegedly stormed their house in Briardale Drive in Newlands East, Durban and Maria was heard screaming from the kitchen. Her husband rushed to see why she was screaming and was confronted by the men, who pushed him to the floor. They apparently took Maria and her son to the bedroom, demanded a firearm and safe keys. The son opened the safe and the suspects took cash and demanded the firearm from them. They then opened fire, fatally wounding Maria in the head and she died on the scene. A resident told Daily Sun a close neighbour told them what happened. “I only heard gunshots. But I stayed in the house and got out when I saw other residents. This left all of us shocked, but the family is devastated.” Another resident said it was sad the suspects killed a defenceless woman. “They should’ve taken the things and escaped. There was no need for them to kill Maria. I hope the suspects will be caught soon.” Another resident said the suspects knew they’d find money at that house, as Maria had a construction company and the family also had spaza shop. The family refused to comment. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident, saying the suspects took cash, three cellphones and a TV before fleeing the scene in the complainant’s vehicle. “Charges of murder and robbery were opened at Newlands East SAPS for investigation.”
