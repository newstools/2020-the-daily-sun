NEVER in his wildest imagination did Rhulani Mokwena think he would be celebrating a Premiership championship this season! Let alone hanging a gold medal on his neck and hoisting the last Absa Premiership trophy. Just months ago, the Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach faced a bleak future after his two-year contract with Orlando Pirates lapsed. At some stage he found himself being pushed out of Chippa United when his contract was not extended. But fast forward to today, Mokwena is a league champion, in the technical team under Pitso Mosimane’s stewardship. "I said to Rhulani he is an angel," Mosimane said. "He has got a lot of luck. And I said to him please don't miss many trophies. "Of course I must not forget to thank the board of Mamelodi Sundowns, Dr. Patrice Motsepe. The support he gives and the resources he provides helps us to be able to win trophies.” The Brazilians are on cloud nine after their latest achievement and Mosimane has credited everyone involved for the success, including the entire technical team. "I want to thank my entire technical team, from the analysts to scouts to everybody who supported me during a difficult time,” said Mosimane.
