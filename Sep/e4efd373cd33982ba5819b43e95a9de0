She said the motive was yet to be determined and investigations were under way. A resident told Daily Sun a bloody pickaxe was found near the woman’s body. “The woman’s teenage son managed to flee the attack and ran to his uncle’s house for help,” she said. “Something like this has never happened in our village.” She said women who assaulted him asked men not to intervene.
