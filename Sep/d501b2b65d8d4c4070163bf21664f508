THE family of Nomvuzo Atoli was shocked when a naked man was recently seen sprinkling water where her body was found last month. Residents of Philippi, Cape Town, said the man was seen the night the body was found and again over the weekend after the family put flowers at the scene. Nomvuzo’s cousin, Ntombi, said: “The residents told us they saw a naked man bathing and sprinkling water at the scene in the middle of the night. “They said he took off his clothes and started walking around the container where her body was found.” A resident, who didn’t want to be named, told the SunTeam they suspected it was the killer, but no one wanted to confront him. Ntombi said her family believed the man was performing rituals to be spared punishment for killing Nomvuzo. “We don’t know the truth behind this person, but maybe it’s the killer who’s performing rituals, so he won’t be haunted by Nomvuzo’s spirits,” said Ntombi. Sangoma Ncedo Ntanjana (45) from Mbekweni, outside Cape Town, believes the person is the killer. “He must have got muthi from a sangoma to wash the blood of his victim off his hands. “He may have been told to wash his body at the scene and speak to the spirit of the deceased.”
