CASSPER Nyovest’s former manager, T-Lee Moiloa, is calling for a boycott of illegal music site Fakaza. The owner of Bridge Entertainment, an events, management, brand and talent agency, recently put out a statement asking music fans and companies to stop supporting Fakaza. “Week in and week out, piracy site Fakaza continues to undermine the hard work of musicians by illegally releasing music that has a grave impact on artists,” he wrote. “This illicit activity is being supported by some of the biggest brands in the country who are advertising on Fakaza. “This must come to an end.” He said he had spoken to one brand that was advertising on the website, which had agreed to stop. “There are numerous legal cases against Fakaza and while we go down the legal route of having music taken off their site, the country needs to rally behind us by not financially supporting this illegal activity,” he said. “I’m very pleased that after a conversation with a brand that advertises on Fakaza, they have agreed to terminate their contract and are no longer advertising on that platform.” T-Lee said he was also asking musicians to help him in his quest. Fakaza is currently the biggest pirate site in Mzansi. It takes music from Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music and illegally posts it. Labantwana Amauber singer Semi Tee said he had also been a victim of Fakaza and tried fighting it. “My music has also been leaked by Fakaza before and it’s just ruining things for us. I’ve tried asking the people in the industry to help fight it, but they say it’s difficult because they don’t know who the administrator is,” he said. L’vovo said the government needed to help by blocking the site. “These people should be locked up, but we cannot get them because we don’t know who they are,” he said.
