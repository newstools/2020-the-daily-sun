SINCE Covid-19 started, we’ve seen many innovative protective gadgets, from designer masks to face shields attached to sun hats. And it seems we’ll keep seeing more of these, since masks are now part of our everyday lives. MicroClimate has now introduced its new AIR helmet. Although it might look a bit silly, it has a built-in air ventilation system. Fans inside the masks apparently help to filter the air and stop the plastic bubble from fogging up.  “From Uber to airline, AIR will keep you comfortable the whole trip. “ MicroClimate said. This helmet needs to be charged every four hours, but it doesn’t hide your mouth from view, so it’s good for lip-reading!
