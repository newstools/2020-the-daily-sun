Hundreds of Eldorado Park residents have attended the funeral of Nateniel Julies (16).  Nateniel will be laid to rest on Saturday.  Earlier in the morning, Julie's family held a private ceremony at their home. Nateniel was allegedly shot and killed by police last week, a few metres away from home. His death has since sparked an outcry. Residents have accused Eldorado police station for corruption and trying to cover up Nateniel's death. Among people who have attended the funeral included polictician Kenneth Meshoe, general secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions ( Saftu) Zwelinzima Vavi, as well as members of the Economic Freedom Fighters.  Bikers also revved their engines in a convoy, escorting Nateniel's hearse.
