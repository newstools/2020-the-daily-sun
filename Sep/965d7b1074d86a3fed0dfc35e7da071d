MPUMALANGA cops are hunting the alleged killer boyfriend of Gloria Sekome (30), who apparently dumped her body at her Marite Carlton Trust homestead outside Bushbuckridge yesterday. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said Gloria was reportedly missing since last Thursday and cops received a complaint that someone had been murdered and dumped inside the yard. “Police went to the scene and found the deceased lying down and her neck was cut off with a sharp object.” The family told police Gloria was in a sour relationship with her boyfriend, who since was nowhere to be found. “The body was found dumped at the homestead. Paramedics declared her dead on the scene and a murder case has been opened for investigation. Police have launched a manhunt for the boyfriend, who is on run. “We’re calling community members to assist with information on the whereabouts of this suspect and to contact Detective Sergeant Sibusiso Sibuyi on 082 065 1659 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Hlathi.
