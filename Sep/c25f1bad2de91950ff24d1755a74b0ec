PRESIDENT Cyril
Ramaphosa will tonight address the nation on the latest developments of the
government's approach to the Coronavirus pandemic. It is widely expected
that the president will downgrade the country to alert level 1 to further open
up the economy, as infection rates continued to fall. The country has in
recent weeks been recording fewer new cases with the recovery rate at around
89%. Hospital admissions are also said to be fewer and the numbers of those in
the ICU declining. Health Minister Dr.
Zweli Mkhize has also earlier this week come out in support of the country
being downgraded to alert level 1, saying he would recommend to Cabinet the
easing of restrictions among them the sale of alcohol. Some media reports
emerging on Wednesday morning suggested that Ramaphosa will likely open up
border gates and international travel but would ban travelers from high-risk
countries such as the US and United Kingdom as well as other few countries in
Europe. The Presidency in a statement
said his address to the nation followed Ramaphosa's Monday meeting with the
National Coronavirus Command Council and the President’s Coordinating Council
on Tuesday. He will also attend a
special sitting of Cabinet where the downgrade will likely be endorsed. "The President’s
address will be broadcast and streamed on a range of platforms that are
accessible to South Africans and international audiences," said The
Presidency in a statement. The address will be at
7 pm.
