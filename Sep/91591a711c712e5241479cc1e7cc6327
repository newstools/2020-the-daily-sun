NOW that Sengwayo and Sibongile have returned from their extra-long holiday, things are already being set into motion on Isibaya. While the Zungu family is happy that he has returned after months of being away, it will be even more difficult to digest that he won’t be there for long. Sengwayo and Sibongile have been keeping a huge secret. But Sibongile has decided to share it with Siphokazi. Sibongile told Siphokazi they are going to lose their husband. The real reason their holiday was so long was because he fell ill. He was in hospital for months because of the nail that was used to turn him into a zombie by the evil Sunday Nkabinde. Now Sengwayo only has a few months to live. What will Mancwane do once she hears of this tragedy that will affect the Zungu family again? On Rhythm City, Suffocate and Khulekani’s war is far from over. They are both fighting for Nandi and both are willing to play dirty for her. Nandi has left her husband and moved out of their matrimonial home. This was after finding out from Suffo that he was the one who produces Slaza that caused their daughter to be an addict. Now Khulekani is going to spill the beans to Pearl about how her father, David Genaro, died, implicating Suffo, who is Pearl’s business partner. Things are about to get messy.
