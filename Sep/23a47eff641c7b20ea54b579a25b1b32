UMLILO singer Rethabile released a single titled Ntyilo Ntyilo featuring Master KG on Friday ahead of her much-anticipated album. Rethabile told Daily Sun it was inspired by her own story. "This song is about a young girl who's having a hard time with her relationship, so she asks for advice from her parents. This is because she doesn't know what else to do or who else to ask because it's difficult for her," she said. The singer will release her debut album Like Mother Like Daughter on Tuesday afterÂ  taking Mzansi by storm last year when she was featured on DJ Zinhle and Mvzzle's Umlilo and has been the talk of the town ever since. In July, she also worked on a single with Prince Kaybee, which she said will be released on his upcoming album.
