CHIPPA United have started with preparations for the 2020-21 Premier Soccer League campaign. On Tuesday the Chilli Boys announced the signing of attacking midfielder Sizwe Mdlinzo, who is returning to the club for a second spell. Mdlinzo re-joins the Port Elizabeth club from TS Galaxy where he had a successful stint which saw him winning the 2019 Nedbank Cup, which saw them getting a taste of playing in Africa as they took part in the Caf Confederation Cup. “We are delighted to announce the return of midfield maestro Sizwe Mdlinzo. He has signed a 34 months contract with the club,” Chippa announced on Twitter. Mdlinzo was something of a late bloomer and rose to prominence with Cape Town All Stars in the 2014-15 campaign. After two seasons he followed coach Dan Malesela to Chippa, where he made 35 appearances in all competitions over two seasons. He again followed Malesela to new club Galaxy ahead of 2018-19, and was arguably their stand-out player in that campaign, which culminated in an unexpected Nedbank Cup win. ???SIZWE MDLINZO IS BACK ???We are delighted to announce the return of Midfield maestro Sizwe Mdlinzo.
