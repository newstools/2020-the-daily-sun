AS if 2020 has not been a crazy year for the world, one winery in Spain suffered a severe loss when thousands of litres of its wine flooded onto the streets. According to viral videos on Twitter showing the flood like red waters, the wine flowed out around tractors and cars, and into a nearby field. News.com.au reports that more than 50 000 litres of red wine  sprayed out of a tall metal vat at the Bodegas Vitivinos winery in Villamalea in Albacete in central Spain. The site refers to local reports which say the spill was caused by a break in one of the tanks.“Bodegas Vitivinos was founded in 1969 and produces up to 6 million kilos of grapes a year. The winery uses grape varieties including bobal and tempranillo to create an intense dark cherry colour.”  Villamalea, Spain: 2020 continues to flex.
