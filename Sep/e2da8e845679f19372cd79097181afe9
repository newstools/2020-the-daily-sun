FORMER Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene, along with education academic Thokozane Dyosini, has written a children’s book. Cory in the Universe is aimed at helping children understand the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ntandoyenkosi said: “We saw a gap in the conversation around the pandemic. We felt children were being left out of the conversation. “We decided to write a book that would be a true depiction of what children were going through on a daily basis.” They found a way to include kids in the conversation. “As qualified teachers, we found storytelling to be the best way in which to convey the message, so they could understand. It’s entertaining, but also educational,” said Ntandoyenkosi. “We’ve made sure the book is available in all 11 official languages, so no kid is left behind. “We’re also going to be releasing an audio book and a visual sign language book that will cater for children who are blind and disabled.” They hoped the book would be added to the school curriculum. It will be available nationwide at all major bookstores from next month.
