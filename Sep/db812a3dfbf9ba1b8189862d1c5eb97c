ANC Councillor Andile Lungisa said during a press briefing that Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is the capital city of corruption. He was speaking at the Noninzi Luzipho Building in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Lungisa was responding to the regional task team’s call for him to resign as councillor within 72 hours. The team cited the 2018 assault conviction against him as the driving force.In 2018, Magistrate Morne Cannon of the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court sentenced him to three years in jail for smashing a glass jug over DA councillor Rano Kayser’s head during a council meeting in 2016. He’s waiting for the outcome of his appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal and the ANC provincial leadership asked him to step down as the city’s infrastructure head until the outcome of his appeal. Lungisa said: “I’m being targeted  by the team because I’m fighting corruption. When we took over the city from the DA it used to be like Afghanistan. People on the ground were fighting. “Everyone in government is being told how the city should be run by those who’re not in government. “When the team was formed,  comrades implicated in corruption held key positions, making it difficult to implement national Treasury regulations.”Lungisa said the ANC’s NEC resolution was clear: people accused of corruption and serious crimes should step down. “I’m not facing corruption charges. Instead, I’m fighting corruption. I’m the first councillor to open a corruption case related to Covid-19 looting. “While I’m busy fighting corruption my own comrades are busy attacking me left, right and centre.” He said he’d challenge his removal.
