BAROKA FC coach Dylan Kerr can't help but feel sorry for Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp. This after Bakgaga denied Amakhosi their first league title in five seasons. They held Chiefs to a costly 1-1 draw at Bidvest Wits Stadium on Saturday, ending their title dreams. The result saw Baroka survive the dreaded drop to the GladAfrica Championship. It also gave Mamelodi Sundowns the opportunity to clinch their tenth league title after they won their match against Black Leopards 3-0 at Dobsonville Stadium. “I would just like to say to Ernst, it’s been tough this bubble, it’s not been fair,” said Kerr. “He was nine points clear coming into the bubble, it not been a good advert for football. Many teams have not been able to play to their level best. “I feel sorry for Ernst because he knows how hard it is in football here, we both know how hard it is because we speak regularly. “I’ve got no words for him because I could be feeling like that now. They could have have been the champions and we could have been in the play-offs. “I can understand how he feels, I will have a word with him after it has all sunk in.”
