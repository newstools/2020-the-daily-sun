RESIDENTS of Phomolong in Mamelodi
East, Tshwane said there will be no campaign, polling stations and votes in
their area if they don't get electricity in their informal settlement. The residents on Monday protested,
burnt tyres and barricaded roads as a way of sending a strong message to the
municipality. The residents vowed to continue
protesting until they get electricity. Community leader, Golf Mabusa, told
Daily Sun that the municipality has failed residents on many occasions. He said they took to the streets
because the municipality has not responded to their demand of having
transformers in the area. He said the residents have been
waiting for too long and nothing was happening.   "What we need is electricity,
we can't wait any longer. "We are tired of living in the
dark and our children are using cold water to bath while other people they have
electricity,” he said He said last year in April,
residents had a meeting with the municipality discussing the issue of having
electricity, but nothing has been done instead they are blocking any chances of
the residents to have electricity. "We want to buy our own
transformers and needed permission from the municipality to let Eskom deal with
us as we need to buy the transformers from Eskom. "The only problem we are
experiencing is that the municipality has failed us to let us deal with Eskom
direct," he said. Golf said they don't have a problem
with the Eskom but their problem is the City of Tshwane who ignore resident’s
plea. He said that in Phomolong there are
over 12 000 shacks and these people are living in the dark. "No electricity, no campaign
and no vote. We are tired of waiting we need electricity," she said. The residents said that they will
need Premier David Makhura and President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene as they
are suffering. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela
Mashigo said: "The City is aware of the protest in Mamelodi East."
