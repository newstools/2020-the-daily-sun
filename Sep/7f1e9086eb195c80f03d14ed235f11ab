A DRIVER got out of his truck in Stapleton Road in Pinetown west of Durban last night to speak to a cop and when he got back in to reverse it, it rolled down and crashed into four cars before smashing into a wall. Tragically, the driver died. Apparently, he got out to speak to Metro cops and when he got back in, tried to reverse but the truck rolled and hit the cars on the road. It’s still not clear what caused the truck to loose control. A witness said the driver tried to stop the truck and while doing so, fell out and hit his head on the road. “The truck went down an embankment and into a house, causing severe damage to the property and two cars inside the property.” He said the truck driver died at the scene. “The driver was not injured by the runaway truck but died as a result of hitting his head.”  KZN EMS spokesman Robert Mckenzie confirmed the accident. He said SAPS and Metro cops were at the scene and would be investigating the cause of the collision. Captain Nqobile Gwala said Pinetown police were investigating a case of culpable homocide. She said last night, a truck allegedly collided with several vehicles in Stapleton Road. “A 50-year-old truck driver died at the scene. Circumstances are being investigated,” she said.
