PAMELA Hove was delighted when she found out she was pregnant with her third child. But the 24-year-old from Kwena Moloto 2, outside Polokwane, Limpopo, was left shattered after the baby died during childbirth in June. She told Daily Sun the body was taken by Mark Simon Funeral Services, but as she couldn’t pay for the company’s services, and her baby was still in the mortuary. “I was told I had to pay R2 500, so my child could be buried. I’m unemployed and asked to pay it in instalments. I only managed to pay R400 and could not afford the rest,” she said. “I was told the money was for arranging a death certificate at Home Affairs, the grave and other expenses,” she said. Pamela told the SunTeam the matter was giving her sleepless nights. “It has been three months now and my child is still in the mortuary. I cannot sleep, eat or do anything else because of this,” she said. “My child’s body will end up rotting.” She said she needed a Good Samaritan to help her bury her baby so she could move on. Simon Mailula of Mark Simon Funeral Services said they made all the arrangements and even booked a grave. “She said she didn’t have the rest of the money, but we didn’t have a problem burying the baby. We got a social worker to arrange a pauper’s burial, so the child can be buried by the state. Arrangements are being made,” he said.
