TOP ANC  comrades have
paid tribute to Songezo Mjongile  during
a moving memorial service held by the ruling party earlier today. Mjongile (47), the former secretary of the ANC in the
Western Cape, died last week of colon cancer surrounded by his family in Joburg. In August he had revealed on his Facebook that he had been
diagnosed with the cancer in April this year and continued to detail some his
challenges including his diet changes in the few posts that followed. A former COSAS leader, Mjongile was very close to other
former youth leaders of the ruling party and many paid tributes to him the past
week. His memorial service in Gugulethu was attended by ANC Treasurer
Paul Mashatile who delivered the eulogy. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula and former cabinet Minister
Malusi Gigaba were some of the pallbearers of the black casket draped in the ANC
flag. The ANC’s Zizi Kodwa,Tony Yengeni and Gauteng MEC Lebohang Maile
were also part of the mourners.   Mbalula paid tribute to Mjongile praising him for his commitment
to the party and criticism when things were not according to the party’s policies. He also spoke fondly of him as a friend and comrade. “He was generous,loving,supportive as a friend. He never
complained even though he faced many challenges.” “He never saw his service to his people and country as a favour
he rendered but as his obligation.  He was
doing his country duty and always reminded us that our duty was to provide
solutions.” Songezo will be buried tomorrow during a private family service
also in Cape Town.
