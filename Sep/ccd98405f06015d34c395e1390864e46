NELSON Mandela Bay ANC councillor Andile Lungisa has been suspended from the ruling party. Lungisa was served with his suspension letter yesterday and has to appear before the PEC disciplinary committee. His suspension follows his 2018 assault conviction, when he was sentenced three years in jail for smashing a jug over DA councillor Rano Kayser’s head at a council meeting in 2016. ANC spokesman Loyiso Magqashela said: “Lungisa is suspended from all party activities and has until tomorrow to submit his resignation to the Nelson Mandela Bay council Speaker. “His membership is suspended until everything around him is resolved, then the ANC will determine his role after the disciplinary processes have been concluded.” Asked why the ANC took so long to act against him, Magqashela said: “Immediately after Lungisa was convicted, the PEC resolved he must step down, but he appealed its findings to the NEC, that took time. Then the NEC decided anyone with a conviction should resign. “Eventually the NEC came back to us and said we are correct, Lungisa must resign because he was found guilty by a court and has a criminal record.” The suspension comes weeks after the PEC forced Lungisa to step down as the city’s infrastructure and engineering political boss pending his appeal outcome at the Supreme Court of Appeal. Lungisa was not available for comment as his phone was on voice mail but last week he said he would approach ANC structures to plead his case as per party guidelines.
