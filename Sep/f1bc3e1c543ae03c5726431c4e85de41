Ladies are tired of pastors abuse power and their bodies. Their campaign is called #KwaneleMfundisi which stands against gender-based violence at the hands of pastors and churches. Today they protested outside a church in Marshalltown, in Johannesburg, saying they want justice for all the woman they claim have been sexually abused by a pastor.  Sihle Sibisi (35) told Daily Sun that pastors take advantage of women in churches and they always get away with it. He said there are many women who've been sexually abused by pastors but some of them are afraid of opening cases while some have opened cases of which dockets have disappeared. "We're marching to reopen rape cases against a certain pastor who raped so many girls and now subsequently dockets have vanished," said Sihle. Solomon Ashoms of Movement Against Abuse in Churches told Daily Sun that a lot of women have spoken to him about how they've been sexually abused by a pastor but some of them are scared because of his prominence. "Some rape cases were opened but they never made it to courts because dockets have vanished. Some women have lost hope in reporting these pastors because they know those cases won't go anywhere. Some are scared," said Solomon.  A woman, who asked not to be named, said when she opened a case of sexual harassment in 2017 it vanished and she started getting threats from people from church. "I've lost hope in churches. I haven't been to any church since 2017 and I still don't feel the need to go. I hope #KwaneleMfundisi will restore hope in those who've lost hope," she said. The Hillbrow SAPS spokesperson, sergeant Mduduzi Zondo confirmed that a case of harassment has been open against a pastor and police will check for other alleged cases against him. We couldn't get hold of the pastor or church for comment.
