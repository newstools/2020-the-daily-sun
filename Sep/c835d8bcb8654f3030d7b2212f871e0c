THEY say an early bird catches the fattest worm, right? And that every morning is an opportunity for us to arise and shine. There’s something profoundly powerful about sunrise – it almost has that morning glory to it. Much like sunrise, the 4-5 rises and shines the most in the morning. This interestingly has to do with how the 4-5 juice travels and functions during daytime. Healthy men naturally wake up with an erection every morning. Experts attribute this to a spike in testosterone between six and nine in the morning. Contrary to females, men can experience a daily 25-50% differential in testosterone in the morning, translating to a huge appetite for early sex. With women, significant changes in testosterone don’t happen daily but monthly, with the largest increase happening mid-month during ovulation. Fertility clinic experts agree: samples of sperm concentration were found to be highest when the sample was collected between 5am and 7.30am. Sperm movement was best in samples produced between 8.31am and 10am. Simply put, the 4-5 excels in the morning, and the morning glory seems to be things that make the pots cook. By also including a healthy diet to your morning routine, you are almost set for the best sexual experience.
