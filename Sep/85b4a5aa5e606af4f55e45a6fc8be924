MAGOSHAS in Mangaung say things are looking rosy, now that lockdown curfew has been relaxed to midnight. The 10pm curfew apparently made them starve – financially and otherwise. Overly competitive dayshifters would now have enough time to do their thing. . . The nightshifters were so happy they were even keen to give the president a few free pokes!

The 10pm curfew was bad for business. “That’s normally a time when business peaks. This curfew was taking bread out of my mouth. “I used to get one client on lucky nights. But I don’t stress that the curfew now starts at midnight. That’s normally the time I knock off. “I charge R100 a session. On a bad day I’d go home with R200, and R900 on good days. “I love President Ramaphosa and would gladly give him a mahala poke me just to show appreciation.” Another magosha (30) from Lesotho said she’d been chased away by dayshifters. “We have two kinds of magoshas. Those who work at night and those who work during the day,” she said. “I used to work at night but the curfew forced me to work during day. It was challenging. “The dayshift ladies chased me away. They had a point. I needed money for my 11-year-old. I agree with my colleague who said she won’t mind giving Ramaphosa a free poke.” Mathapelo (23) was happy she won’t have nightshift ladies taking her business. She dsaid: “I prefer working during the day. I’m scared of the dark. I’ve heard about the risks of working at night. “I’m looking forward to making more money. This corona has messed up everything,”
