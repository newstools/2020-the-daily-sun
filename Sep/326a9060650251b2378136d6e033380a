A 31-YEAR-OLD man is behind bars for perjury after opening a car hijacking case on 15 June. Joburg Central police spokesman, Captain Xoli Mbele, said: “According to him, he was stopped by police in a white Golf 7 with blue lights while driving his green Jetta 4 at the corner of Main Reef and Marshall Street.” He said more cops came in a white Quantum. “They told him his car registration didn’t correspond with the colour of the car,” said Mbele. “They handcuffed him and put him inside the Quantum, and drove off with him.” He was dropped off in Braamfischerville in Soweto, said Mbele, but he made up the whole story. “Preliminary investigations revealed the vehicle was sold by his mum to bail him out on 4 May. “His mum sold the car for R24 000 to a 32-year-old man living in Mofolo.” Investigations are under way and the suspect will soon appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court.
