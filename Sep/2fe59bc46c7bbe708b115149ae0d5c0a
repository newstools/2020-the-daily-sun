ORLANDO Pirates coach Wayne Sandilands seem to be a hard man to please. Despite the club securing Caf Confederation Cup spot after finishing third in the Absa Premiership table, the veteran goalkeeper is not entirely pleased with what has been achieved by the club. “You measure success in terms of silverware," Sandilands told his club website. "This is something we need to reflect on as a team but at the same time if you consider where we come from and in particular how we started the league, third is understandable and we will take it but in the greater scheme of things third is not good enough for Orlando Pirates, silverware is.” He continued: “I am the type of person who always looks to improve and try to see what we can do better as a team. "I guess it’s my attitude of never being satisfied. People close to me can attest to this. I am always looking to push the boundaries, I guess this is what has kept me going all these years.” Pirates have gone six season without lifting a silverware as they last won a cup in 2014 where they lifted Nedbank Cup. Sandilands was one of the standout performers for Pirates this season. He kept an impressive 12 clean sheets this season, the second best in the top-flight after SuperSport United’s Ronwen Williams who kept 13. “Overall, I am happy to have contributed to the team in some way this season. When you are playing regularly usually it means you are doing something right and I can only focus on working even harder next season”, said Sandilands.
