POLICE Detective Foster Netshiongolo, made his first court
appearance at the Protea Magistrate Court in Soweto in connection with the
killing of Nateniel Julies (16). He is also facing a charge of accessory after the fact to
murder. Police officers, Simon Ndyalvana and Caylene Whiteboy were
arrested last week Friday and are facing charges of murder, possession of
prohibited ammunition as well as defeating the ends of justice. Netshiongolo was arrested on Tuesday. In court Netshiongolo said he was told at the police station
that he was only charged with defeating the ends of justice and possession of
prohibited ammunition. The three suspects will remain in custody until their bail
hearing set for Thursday. Nateniel, a down syndrome child was shot and killed last
week Wednesday outside his home. It is understood that the implicated police have alleged
that Nateniel was involved in a gang fight which his family have disputed. The teenager was taken to hospital in a police van where his
parents identified his body. According to Nateniel’s stepdad, Clint Smith, he said the
doctor told them that Nateniel was barely alive when he arrived at the
hospital. Nateniel’s death has sparked a protest which saw residents
of Eldorado Park, Joburg marching to the police station demanding justice. Residents have accused the police station of corruption and
trying to cover up Nateniel’s death by insisting that he was involved in
gangsterism. They alleged that cops were on the payroll of drug lords and
residents were being ill-treated when they wanted to report crime. They handed over a petition calling for justice, a change in
the Eldorado Park police management and that corruption involving the police
should be probed. The National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman said it will
oppose bail.
