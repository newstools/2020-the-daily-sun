KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed that former Bidvest Wits defender S'fiso Hlanti is training with the club. The left-back is currently a free agent following his release by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) last week. TTM, who purchased the top-flight status of Wits, did not wish to keep the Bafana Bafana star. He is now training with Amakhosi, under the guidance of his former coach at Wits Gavin Hunt. Chiefs, however, are still banned from signing players and can only offer the player their training facilities for now. He has been on Amakhosi's radar though and will most likely be snapped up by the Glamour Boys should they be successful in their appeal. Player Updates!
