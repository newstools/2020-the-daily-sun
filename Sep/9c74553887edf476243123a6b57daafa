The Championship winners have retained coach Brandon Truter and the core of their 2019-20 squad. The club have retained the services of veteran midfielder Lebohang “Cheeseboy” Mokoena. And yesterday they announced the signing of Musa Nyatama, who joins them from Highlands Park, which was sold to TS Galaxy. “Swallows FC has secured the signature of 33-year-old midfield maestro Musa Nyatama. “Welcome to the Nest,” Swallows confirmed on the club’s official Twitter account. The Birds also announced the signing of one of the most sought after players from Championship side JDR Stars, striker/winger Moeketsi Makhanya. “We will announce two more signings,” Mogashoa told SunSport. “We are trying to blend the young players we already have in the team with players who have PSL experience. “The aim of the team is to compete on our first season and stay in the Premiership, then the following season is when we can start promising our supporters something.”
