Former OPW presenter and TV personality, Kayise Ngqula has sent a bittersweet birthday message to her son. In the Facebook message, Kayise reminded her son, Zuko (2), that he will grow up without his father, Farai Sibanda. Without mentioning the struggles she faces as a single mother, she hints that the passing of her husband has forced her to assume a double role. She titled her Facebook post, A Lioness and Her Cub. Then she wrote: “From birth you have been kept hidden from anything and anyone that could potentially harm you. And it will forever be so, for you are our pride and joy! Without the presence of your father, I’ve had to play the double role of providing for you in every way I could. But what most pleases my heart about you is the strength and bravery you continue to display each day as you grow into the honourable man I know you will be. I have no doubt or fears that as soon as it is time to let you go into wilderness, that you will rise like the King that you are! Happy 2nd birthday Vodloza... you are loved beyond comprehension!! @ Happy Birthday,” she wrote. ALSO READ: MASTER KG BOLT DRAMA! Her friends and fans showered her son with best wishes.
