OLYMPIC championÂ Wayde van Niekerk will make his long-awaited international comeback on Tuesday after a month after his planned return was halted by a positive test for Covid-19. He will compete in the 400m event at the Gala dei Castelli meeting in Bellinzona, Switzerland on Tuesday. Van Niekerk returns from a lengthy injury hiatus following a serious knee injury. Van Niekerk has made a strong recovery and cannot wait to hit the track. "My body is in good health, which I'm grateful for, and I'm looking forward to racing again," Van Niekerk quoted by Sport24. "We don't have any goals for the meeting. I'm just excited to see how my body feels again in a race situation, and it will be nice to loosen up the legs. "It will give us a good indication of where I am in my training, after having to spend 25 days in isolation, and we can then focus on what needs to be done to gain some momentum towards the 2021 season." Van Niekerk is currently in Europe with a number of other South African athletes, including 100m sprinter Akani Simbine, long jumper Ruswahl Samaai and high hurdles specialist Antonio Alkana. Van Niekerk will return home to continue his long-term build-up to next year's Tokyo Olympics. While there is no long jump event on the schedule for Samaai, Simbine and Alkana will hope for a quick turnaround, with both athletes featuring in the start lists for the Diamond League meeting in Rome, Italy on Thursday. Simbine will line up in the men's 100m race at the top-flight meeting, while Alkana will turn out in the 110m hurdles contest.
