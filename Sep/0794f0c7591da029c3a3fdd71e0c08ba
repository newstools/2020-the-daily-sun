MARITZBURG United have bolstered their technical team by roping in Rowen Fernandez as a new goalkeeper coach. The club has also appointed former Bafana Bafana winger Delron Buckley as an assistant coach. Buckley played for the club from 2012 before leaving in 2014 after spending 14 years in Germany. The duo will work alongside head coach Eric Tinkler, it is not clear whether Vincent Kobola will be kept in the side as he arrived with the former Orlando Pirates coach last year January. Fernandez was the goalkeeper coach of Highlands Park last season and he was left unemployed after the Tembisa club sold its Absa Premiership status to TS Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi. Buckley, who spent his career mostly in Germany, has been clubless since 2016 after leaving AmaZulu as Steve Barker’s assistant coach. Maritzburg are currently busy with pre-season training, awaiting the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to confirm next season's fixtures.
