JABULILE Nkosi went out on Saturday to an event, but she never came back home. The 19-year-old was found dead near a bridge in Alexandra, east of Joburg, with three gunshot wounds. Her devastated family said they won’t rest until the killer is found. Aunt Precious Mpholwane (26) said Jabulile was always open about her whereabouts. When they checked on herhours later, she said she was okay and was on her way home. “She didn’t come back. She continued to chill with her friends until it was really late,” Precious told Daily Sun. Her friends said she left before the event was over, saying she was going home. She said on Sunday, Jabulile’s brother (9) found the handbag she was carrying the day she left. “Her mum rushed to open a missing persons case.” But on Monday, the family was called to identify her body. “I can’t begin to describe the pain the family is going through.” Precious said it looked like Jabulile tried to flee as she had injuries. Jabulile’s mum, Ntombifuthi, (43) said she was deeply hurt. “Nothing can bring her back. I hope the law will be on our side.” Captain Kay Makhubele said cops were investigating a case of murder.
