that South Africa would enter what then was estimated to be a 21-day hard lockdown
starting at level 5. Three weeks ago, the president announced that the National
Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) had agreed that the country can enter level
2 of its national lockdown. People are still urged to wear masks, sanitise their hands
and practice social distancing. Gatherings of more than 50 people are still not allowed
although the sale of booze and skyf is allowed but people are urged to consume responsibly.
