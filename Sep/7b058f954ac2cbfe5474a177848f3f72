ROSE Shai is disappointed that she learnt about her daughter’s death on social media. This after the body of her daughter, Kgaogelo (20), a Letaba TVET College student, was found dumped in a dry stream on Monday. She was reported missing over a week ago. Rose (49) from Mulalani Village in Ga-Sekororo outside Tzaneen, Limpopo said she was shocked to see her daughter’s photos trending on social media with the caption: “RIP.” She told Daily Sun she expected to be the first person to know about what happened to her daughter. “The police called me on Monday after they discovered the body of a girl. I was asked to come and identify the body,” she said. Kgaogelo’s body was found by the police in Mokgolobotho Village outside Tzaneen. Her family raised concerns after her boyfriend Ronny Kgatla (35) committed suicide a day after they opened a missing persons case. Ronny had also opened a case of robbery and kidnapping at Ritavi cop shop, claiming he and Kgaogelo were attacked by four armed men, who robbed them of their cellphones. He claimed the men beat him up before vanishing with Kgaogelo. But he was found hanging from the window in his bedroom soon after reporting the incident to the police. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed a body found in a stream was that of Kgaogelo. “We are investigating a case of murder against Ronny Kgatla, who committed suicide,” he said. Limpopo Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale said: “We have just reacted with satisfaction to the life sentence handed down to a man who raped his niece. “We now have to mourn yet another promising, beautiful life. We need to find a solution or we’ll continue to stand next to open graves of women and children.”
