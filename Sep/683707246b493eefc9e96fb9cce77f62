HER MUM fears for mum of two Andile Ndlovu (23) from KwaDabeka in Durban, who left home on 8 February without telling anyone where she was going and never returned. Nomusa Ndlovu (61) told Daily Sun her daughter has never left home for such a long time. She said Andile used to go and visit her baby daddy for about three days and would come back home. “But when a week went by and she didn’t return home, I became worried. I started searching for her everywhere, but nobody knew where she was. I sent relatives to go and look for her at the boyfriend’s house but they didn’t find her. The baby daddy also didn’t know where she was.” Nomusa said she went to report it at the police station and continued looking for her. “I’ve also been to hospitals, mortuaries and everywhere I could think of, but there is no sign of her,” she said. “A week ago, a resident came and told me she saw her in another area of KwaDabeka looking mentally ill. That shocked me because when she disappeared she was okay. So I don’t know what happened to her that caused her to be mentally ill.” She said her daughter’s disappearance was worrying her a lot, as well as her two kids she left at home. “Her children (3) and (6) ask me every day what happened to their mother. I keep telling them she will be back. It’s really sad.” She said Andile was unemployed and used to get piece jobs. “I still have hope that she is alive wherever she is. But I’m worried that she is not well.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said KwaDabeka police were appealing to residents to help find Andile, who left home wearing a grey T-shirt and blue denim pants. “She is light in complexion and had light-coloured, short hair. She is now mentally unstable. Anyone with information can contact Captain Simphiwe Nene on 079 5000 299,” she said.
