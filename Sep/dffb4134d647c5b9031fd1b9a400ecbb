I put it up there at the same level as some of the big matches in Europe and South America. I am looking forward to playing in my first Soweto Derby. This is a match for the fans and communities across South Africa.” The 30-year-old emphasised that being consistent will be vital for Bucs in their bid to win the title and end a five-year trophy drought. “our goal this season is to be consistent over a period of time because at the end of the day the winning team [league title] will be the one that was most consistent throughout the entire season.” The Bafana Bafana captain is excited that the move has finally happened as he was linked to the club for the past few seasons. “This is an honour and privilege to be here because I know how long the club has been after my services over the years. Unfortunately, the club was not able to sign me for whatever reasons but thankfully now I am here, and I have both Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates management to thank for that. I have said before that one day I would like to join Orlando Pirates. I am happy, that day has finally come.” The player nicknamed Tyson says he will work hard to make Bucs fans proud. “I would like to thank the supporters for their warm messages of support. I will also need to earn my respect and I plan to do so by giving my all in every opportunity I get to wear that Pirates jersey.”
