Master KG told Daily Sun: “Honestly, I feel so broken because these are people we are trusting with our lives and our belongings.” The Limpopo-born musician, whose hit Jersualema has taken the world by storm, said the fact that the driver switched off his phone said a lot. Master KG said Bolt reached out to him but he wouldn’t be using the company’s services again. “If they can’t be loyal to me then why must I be a loyal customer to them,” he said. Bolt country manager Gareth Taylor said: “On Monday, a Twitter user posted that he had left two mobile phones in a vehicle hailed via a ride-hailing platform. “Bolt responded directly to his tweet, asking him to email the details of the trip to southafrica@bolt.eu. That initial tweet was followed by attempts to contact the rider telephonically, to get more information about his experience. “He has not yet responded to these attempts to reach him but Bolt looks forward to engaging with him directly to find out more about what happened.
