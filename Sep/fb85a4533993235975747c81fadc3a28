HE has run one of the fastest 100m races in 2020... And Akani Simbine, SA's Olympic medal hopeful, has no intention of slowing down. This much he showed at the World Athletics meeting in Marseille when he first clocked 10.31 seconds in the 100m heat on Thursday. Three hours later, the speedster returned to claim victory with a time of 10.19 seconds in the final.However, it wasn't a walk in the park for Mzansi's record holder. Simbine had to see off a strong challenge from Ivory Coast sprinter Arthur Cisse, who he edged by 0.02, as well as American Michael Rodgers who finished third in 10.27. Despite the Covid-19-enforced lockdown, Simbine has maintained his fitness levels, working with coach Werner Prinsloo.He first dipped below the 10.0 seconds barrier when he clocked 9.91 seconds back in March. The intention for him is still to compete in both the 100m and 200m at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Simbine will next line up at the Palio Citta della Quercia meeting in Italy on Tuesday and Switzerland on 15 September. He will complete his European tour with the Rome Diamond League meeting on 17 September.
