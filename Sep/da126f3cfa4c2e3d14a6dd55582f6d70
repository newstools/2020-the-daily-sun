GATVOL residents of Wafa Wafa in Alexandra, east of Joburg, don’t want to see government officials in their kasi unless they are there to deliver services. On Wednesday, they damaged two City Power vehicles and a police car during an operation to remove izinyoka in their area. Angry resident Tintsoalo Ngobeni (26) told Daily Sun they won’t back down as government was failing them. “They built flats and left them unoccupied for years until they were vandalised. A lot of people needed homes and that’s why we decided to invade them three years ago. Why were they keeping these places? We are not going anywhere. They should just register us and install water and electricity,” he said. He said they would continue with their illegal connections until they get electricity. “Poverty has taught us to be well equipped with much-needed skills for survival. We will survive with or without their help,” he said.  City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena said this joint operation was a continuation of the ones that have been carried out in other kasis. “This is one of the kasis identified as a hot spot for overloading. These illegal connections are costing the city billions in repairing damaged infrastructure,” said Mangena. He said the situation got tense at some point, but they managed to remove the illegal connections. “We had to pull out our teams because their lives were in danger, as residents damaged their vehicles. We knew we would come across trouble, hence we asked for assistance from cops,” he said.
