She revealed to me that twins actually run in our family,” she posted. “The father of my children, his mother is a twin. I have never been happier but carrying twins is wild.” In March, Sunday Sun reported that Sphelele was fired from Uzalo because of her pregnancy. “She’d faint and sometimes feel hot or vomit while shooting her scenes. In fact, she’s been in and out of hospital. The producers were out of ideas as to how they’d create a story around her real pregnancy,” read the article. She was replaced by Mpume Ngwenya.
