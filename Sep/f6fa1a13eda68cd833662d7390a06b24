Human Rights Advocate
George Bizos will be laid to rest on Thursday. The funeral service
will take place at Greek Orthodox Church and he will be buried at Westpark
Cemetery, in the north of Joburg. Last week President
Cyril Ramaphosa declared a special official funeral for Bizos and authorised
that the National Flag be flown at half-mast at every flag station in the
country until the evening of his funeral. Motorists have been
urged to use alternative routes during the proceedings of Bizos' funeral as
roads around the funeral venue will be closed. Bizos died at his home
on September 09 at the age of 92. Since his passing
message of condolences have been pouring from across the world and abroad. Bizos has been praised
as a champion for human rights. During his career,
Bizos represented a number of politicians including Nelson Mandela, Walter
Sisulu, and others accused in both the 1956 Treason and 1963 Rivonia trials. Ramaphosa has
described Bizos as one of the best legal minds in South Africa who contributed
immensely to the attainment of democracy.
