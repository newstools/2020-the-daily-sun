DStv have emerged as a strong candidate to take over as a headline sponsor of the Premier Soccer League’s flagship competition the Premiership next season.  According to a SunSport insider, DStv, the satellite television service owned by the MultiChoice Group, has taken a giant step to show their intention. SunSport understands that the giant broadcaster shot a promotional advert likely to be played when the PSL is ready to make the announcement, ahead of the new season. “DStv is set to be announced as a new sponsor of the league. On Tuesday they were busy shooting a promo. The new season is set to be named as the DStv Championship,” said our mole. The PSL is finalising terms and conditions for the new main sponsor after commercial bank Absa decided not to renew their relationship after 13 years of marriage with the league at the end of this recently ended season, which was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Other potential sponsors that have been thrown in the hat include Bidvest and Nedbank. The MultiChoice Group, through their broadcasting company SuperSport International, already have a close tie with the PSL. The leading cable TV provider in South Africa holds the exclusive rights to broadcast all PSL matches. In his response, MultiChoice Group senior manager corporate communications, Benedict Maaga, said: “We unfortunately cannot respond to rumours and speculation.” Meanwhile, PSL chairman Irvin Khoza said last month that his executive, along with his acting CEO Mato Madlala, were busy in countless meetings with potential sponsors. However, he warned that such negotiations are not straight forward due to the economic constraints brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. But he was confident that the PSL will get the new sponsor before the start of the new season, adding that he has four companies who have shown an interest to take over from Absa.
