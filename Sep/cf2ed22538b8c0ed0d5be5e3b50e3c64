Award-winning singer and songwriter Mbuso Khoza gives amahubo a modern touch. He’ll host Amahubo In Concert at the State Theatre in Tshwane on 24 September. Mbuso said the show will see him making amahubo fun. He told SunBuzz: “Amahubo is usually sung only with vocals because it’s old music. “But we decided to sing it with a band. “We realised music genres like opera are taken seriously, but traditional songs aren’t. We wanted to make it relevant for people so they enjoy amahubo.” Mbuso will perform with Zawadi Yamungu and Tlali Makhene. “It will be the three of us with the band. Amahubo are songs that were sung a long time ago and written many years back. “Songs that everyone knows – some are old battle songs. But we’ll also add new songs that haven’t been heard before.” He said there’ll be history lessons in between the music. “The concert comes as a call for the preservation of our heritage while encouraging Africans to stay in love with who they are and where they come from. “Amahubo are songs of the ancients. They are at the centre of our spiritual lives, our historical lives. “Even our religious lives. They carry messages of the past, warning us about the present.” The show can be watched on the State Theatre website and YouTube page.
