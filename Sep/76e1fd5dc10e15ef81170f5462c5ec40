Three firearms were found abandoned at the Baragwanath
Hospital in Soweto on Sunday. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the guns belong to the
State and had been reported stolen in March and April this year. “The one firearm was reported stolen from the
Johannesburg Central police living quarters in March 2020, while the other two
were allegedly stolen in April 2020 from two offices during a break-in at
Hillbrow SAPS. “No suspect has been arrested thus far. Among the items found with the firearms are live
ammunition, and SAPS uniform and operational items,” Brigadier Peters said. ALSO READ: PICS: THREE TEENS KILLED IN HORROR CRASH! Meanwhile, Gauteng Police Commissioner, Lieutenant
General Elias Mawela has called for an urgent investigation following the
discovery. “The alleged abandonment of these firearms at such an
important health facility is in no way innocent. “It is clear that had the stolen state firearms not been
found, they were intended to be used during the commission of a crime where
innocent victims would have been killed or injured,” Lieutenant General Mawela
said in a statement. Mawela also called for cops to guard and safely keep
their state-issued firearms as criminals turn to use them to commit gruesome
crimes.
