Eastern Cape cops are mourning the death of another member. Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said, “It is alleged that the off-duty 36-year-old Constable Mabhududu, attached to Port St Johns Vispol was found murdered with bullet wounds at Tombo A/A Gheto locality, Port St Johns on Tuesday at about 6am. According to information, he left his home on Monday at about 10pm to meet his wife at her rented room when he was shot and killed by unknown assailant/s. He sustained multiple wounds. “The motive for the murder is unknown at this stage and police will not speculate. A case of murder has been opened and is under investigation.” Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga expressed their deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues. “Our hearts go out to his loved ones and close colleagues during this difficult time. Any person who attacks or kills a police official will face the full might of the law. An attack on or murder of a police official is a threat to our constitutional democracy and robs our communities of their protectors. This should not be taken lightly by anyone. “Anyone who can assist with any information which can lead to the arrest of the suspect/s is urged to please contact the Investigating Officer, Detective Captain Bongani Ngxola on 082 3002 861. Information can also be shared on SAPS Crime Stop Crime Stop 08600 10111 or MySAPS App or *134*10111# or any nearest police station. All information will be treated with strict confidentiality,” Kinana said.
