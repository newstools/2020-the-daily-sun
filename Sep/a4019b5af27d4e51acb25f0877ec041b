FREE State cops are hunting the remaining Thaba’Nchu Post Office robbery suspects after two were bust on Wednesday, leaving three still at large. Staff said five men took advantage of load shedding, when the post office had to be temporarily closed that afternoon. They managed to force their way inside and fled with the staff’s cellphones and an undisclosed amount of cash. A worker said: “This is very scary and I’m glad they did not kill any of us. It shows they were strategic and knew there would be load shedding. The post office gets closed and that was the time they attacked.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele told Daily Sun: “Two suspects were apprehended by Thaba’Nchu police, the Selosesha tactical team and K9 unit after robbing a post office. “The postmaster alleged on Wednesday at 12pm, there was load shedding which forced thepost office to temporarily close. At 1pm, he went to the parking lot to his car and when he came back to open the main door, was allegedly confronted by an unknown man, who pointed him with a pistol, pushed him inside the building and four other men joined them.” He said the suspects allegedly pushed the postmaster and the rest of his staff into the strongroom safe, demanded cash and took money and two cellphones. Police were called and bust two men aged 24 and 31. Some of the money and two cellphones were recovered. “The suspects will appear in Thaba’Nchu Magistrates Court soon on the charge of business robbery,” said Makhele.
