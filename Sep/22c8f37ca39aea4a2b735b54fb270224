THE family of a missing mineworker is desperate for answers. The worker went missing after a kibble bucket fell down a shaft onto the platform where he and colleagues were working on Monday. At least two mineworkers were confirmed dead, while another one was injured and had to be airlifted to hospital. The accident happened at noon in shaft one of the Platreef Mine in Tshamahansi, outside Mokopane, Limpopo. The miner’s father-in-law, Johannes Molepo (52), said his family was desperate to know what progress had been made in searching for him. “When we heard of the incident on social media, we became curious as he had not returned home from work. When we went to the mine on Tuesday, there was no proper communication,” he said. MY SANGOMA RAPED ME! Johannes said his family was not satisfied with the rescue plan, as they had been told it was too risky to continue with the search. “We are worried that if he is still alive, he will end up dyingIt’s the second day he’s down there without food,” he said. Ivanhoe Mines spokesman Bill Trenaman said all activities had been suspended pending an investigation, which would start once the site was found to be safe. NUM’s Phillip Mankge said the union was shocked by the increase in fatal accidents at Limpopo mines. On Sunday, a mineworker at Modilwa Platinum Mine was found dead due to a lack of ventilation underground. EFF and ANC members joined concerned families yesterday in blocking the gate at the mine and demanding an urgent meeting with the management. PRESIDENT SAYS MZANSI MUST DO JERUSALEMA CHALLENGE! EFF provincial leader Jossey Buthane said they were not there for political gain, but to help the affected families. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the cops were waiting for the mine rescue team to find the person who was still missing and retrieve the two bodies in the shaft. “That’s when we will go to the scene to open cases and start with our investigations,” he said.
