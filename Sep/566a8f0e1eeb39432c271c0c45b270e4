AWARD-WINNING visual artist Blessing Ngobeni has dedicated his latest exhibition to black people. The 2020 Standard Bank Young Artist Award is running a solo exhibition titled Chaotic Pleasure at the Standard Bank Gallery. The artist said the exhibition will help black people. He told SunBuzz: “Chaotic Pleasure is going to help black people open their eyes. “It will help them recognise that they’re smart and should start rebuilding together and not tearing each other apart. “The colonial system tore us apart and it’s time we unite and rebuild together. From today black kids must start recreating their own system that will benefit the black child.” Blessing said the exhibition was inspired by history. “I constructed this body of work by borrowing from history. The aim was to visualise a good future by referring to the past. A perfect example to explain my work is by looking at the history being taught at schools. Kids are taught about history after colonialism, not about history before that. They don’t show how black people had wealth. So I’m teaching black kids to look further than what’s taught to us. We must change the system and go back to our beautiful lands that were taken from our families. The exhibition basically aims to inspire black kids to want to be more. Blessing started pursuing art professionally in 2012. “The hardships of life led me to art. I felt it was the only way I could express myself. Then in 2012 I was awarded the Reinhold Cassirer Art Award. From there I’ve had a number of solo exhibitions. “In 2016 I did Song of Chicotte, in 2018, the Enemy of Foe, and A Note from Error in 2018,” he said. The exhibition is currently running at the Standard Bank Gallery website.
