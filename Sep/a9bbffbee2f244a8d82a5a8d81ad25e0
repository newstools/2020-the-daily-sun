BLACK Leopards have retained their top-flight status after defeating Ajax Cape Town 2-0 in the play-offs on Friday afternoon at Rand Stadium. Ajax needed to get maximum points in this clashÂ  and hope Leopards lose against Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Monday tp return to PSL. However, that was not the case as Leopards proved to be too strong for them thumping them 2-0 to win the three teams mini league with a game to spare. After three matches, Leopards won all their fixtures to collect impressive nine points as they topped the standings. On Monday they will play fellow Limpopo mates TTM in a dead rubber match. Leopards got off to the perfect start from a corner-kick in the 14th minute after defender Isaac Masia gave the visitors the lead when he rose highest at the near post to guide the ball home. The Urban Warriors missed a glorious opportunity to equalise just before the break as Dale Wakefield pushed his effort wide from just inside the area. The score remained unchanged as Leopards went into the half-time break holding a 1-0 advantage. Goalkeeper King Ndlovu pulled off a couple of acrobatic saves just after the break with the latter coming in the 49th minute from a powerful Khaya Mfecane shot from 25-yards out. Ajax CT held the upper hand in large spells during the second half as they went in search of a much-needed win in their fight for promotion as Leopards were happy to sit back and soak up the pressure. Dangerman Mwape Musonda struck the killer blow for Leopards as he stroked the ball home to double the visitors' lead in the 78th minute to make it 2-0 somewhat against the run of play. Despite searching for a late fightback Ajax fell short with a win for Black Leopards meaning that they retain their top-flight status for next season with a game to spare.
