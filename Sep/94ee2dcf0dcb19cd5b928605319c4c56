TASHUME Bambore was yesterday sentenced to life in jail for raping a five-year-old last year. The 31-year-old was sentenced in the Bhisho High Court, Eastern Cape, for the crime that happened in Phakamisa, King William’s Town. NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said: “The crime happened after the five-year-old was sent to the shop by her mother to buy food items. Bambore, originally from Ethiopia, worked at the shop. He picked her up and took her to the bedroom where he raped her. “A 36-year-old customer then entered the shop and saw Bambore appearing from the bedroom while pulling up his trousers. MY SANGOMA RAPED ME! “The five-year-old also came out of the bedroom with him. “The customer then immediately called a fellow Phakamisa resident and they took the child to her mother. The child then revealed what had occurred.” Prosecutor Advocate Linda Jekwa asked Judge Bantubonke Tokota to stick to the minimum sentence of life imprisonment for the rape of a minor. “I’m requesting for the court to send out a strong message that such offences will not be tolerated, and that the accused should be sentenced to life imprisonment,” said Jewka. Deputy director of public prosecutions, Advocate Chanzelle de Kock, said he was pleased with the sentence. “This will confirm the strong message from the courts that violence against women, and especially our children, will not be tolerated.”
