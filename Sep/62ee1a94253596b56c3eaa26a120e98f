“I’M SERIOUSLY sick of this. I’m honestly going to stuff you up. “Uphaphiswa zezi awards for songs that were produced by other people and this new money of yours ... I’ll kick your ass dawg.’’ This was what Anga Makubalo recently warned Prince Kaybee as their feud reached boiling point. The trouble started when the former Isidingo star, known in music circles as Naakmusiq, tweeted that Prince Kaybee was belittling his achievements. He wrote: “Man, I’ve had a great 10 years in this game. I’m proud of the little that I’ve achieved.  “So if your achievements make you belittle mine, then do you man. I’ll see you around. Well done on your career.” Prince Kaybee responded by saying that Anga had not been as successful as him despite having started his career earlier. He challenged him to live up to his promise of beating him. “You wouldn’t dare race me. My cars are modified, yours are still stock. Lastly when you see me, do what you need to do,” he wrote. The last straw for Anga was when Kaybee, whose real name is Kabelo Motsamai, called him Kakmusiq.  He replied: “This coming from a guy who came to me and told me how much it would mean to him for me to be on his songs. Twice. Also, you’ve been avoiding that race we once spoke about. Lastly I don’t know why you want to trend this time, but my boy, I will straight up f**k you up. Enough Twitter.” In July, Anga called Prince Kaybee weak Prince Kaybee has fought with Dj Maphorisa, Black Coffee and Cassper Nyovest. His publicist Ziyanda Ralo refused to comment and Kaybee didn’t respond to WhatsApp messages. Anga’s publicist, Nyagunda Ngwenya, didn’t respond to messages or calls.
