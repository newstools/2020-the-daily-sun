IMBEWU: The Seed actress Brenda Mhlongo has become the latest celebrity to fall victim to hackers after scammers have been using her name and photo to trick people. On Monday, she wrote on Facebook that she had an unexpected visitor at work who told security guards he’d been communicating with her, but she had no idea who he was. “I don’t know what to do anymore, running out of options.” Her Facebook friends advised her to report it. Brenda said she was on set when a guard told her an unknown man was waiting for her at the gate. “Apparently the scammer told this guy I’m a forex trader and he had money to invest for him. Fortunately, the guard had the guy’s phone. He showed me the messages. I asked the guard to tell him he was being scammed and went back to my work. I am hurt.” Brenda told Daily Sun she hadn’t opened a case yet.
