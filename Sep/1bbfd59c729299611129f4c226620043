An Uber safety driver who was behind the wheel of a self-driving car that killed a woman has been charged over the death. Rafaela Vasquez pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide after the 2018 crash that caused the first recorded death involving a self-driving vehicle. The 49-year-old woman Elaine Herzberg died after she was struck by the car while walking a bike across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona. Uber escaped charges over the crash after prosecutors said last year that the company was not criminally liable. Police previously said that Vasquez was watching a TV show on her phone at the time of the crash and was repeatedly looking down instead of keeping her eyes on the road. The 46-year-old is now due to face trial in February. According to Sky News, she told investigators she did not use her cellphone before the collision. A toxicology report showed that Herzberg tested positive for methamphetamine.
