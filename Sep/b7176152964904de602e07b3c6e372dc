THE full findings of the Fundudzi Forensic Report into the administrative affairs of Cricket South Africa (CSA) haven't been made public. But the bit that has been seen by the CSA’s Members’ Council confirms the malaise afflicting the cricket governing body. The report paints a bleak picture of the organisation, unsurprising though, given the public image crisis they have been going through. The report, compiled by an independent investigative body, has already seen Thabang Moroe being as CEO and made shocking revelations about the banning of journalists last December. The Members’ Council had a ”frank and robust” exchange of views on the findings and recommendations of the forensic report. At a workshop, which is set to continue on Monday, the Council members have also committed to working with all the stakeholders to address issues surrounding the game. ”Issues pertaining, amongst others, to governance failings, financial controls, use of step-in rights, media accreditation and transactions entered into by CSA were debated, and a plan was presented and adopted to take steps to implement the recommendations and to act against relevant parties, ” CSA said in a statement. ”In addition, the Members’ Council, the independent members of the Audit and Risk Committee, and CSA’s legal counsel reflected on the root causes of the issues identified and commit to addressing the same to prevent reoccurrence. The Members’ Council agreed on the key principles of actions to improve the governance structure and the roles and responsibilities of the Members’ Council, the Board of Directors, and the Executive Management of CSA. The Members’ Council resolved to hold the Board accountable for the implementation of the steps agreed upon, with a directive to deal with priority and material matters, before the CSA 2020 AGM.”
