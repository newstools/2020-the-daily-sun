IT goes without saying Kaizer Chiefs really felt the absence of George Maluleka at the crucial stage of the league title race. Amakhosi had an option to keep the midfielder beyond June as a result of the coronavirus-enforced football suspension. This was despite him having signed a pre-contract with Mamelodi Sundowns. But Amakhosi decided against keeping their star midfielder, much to their detriment as the wheels came off at the vital stage of a two-horse race with the Tshwane giants. But Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said he would have kept Maluleka, was he the Amakhosi coach. ”George was important on set-pieces and in that diamond shape with Lebo Manyama and Katsande (Willard). He passes the ball well and he really works hard. In my opinion, they missed him,” said Mosimane. "If I was a coach at Chiefs I'd have kept him. Why not? But sometimes it's beyond you as a coach. "Its the club owners decide. ”Do you think a credible player like George Maluleka will score an own goal us? Nah, these guys are professionals? ”Your integrity has been there for eight years. Would you want to spoil your integrity? You don't want that. If he does that, we'd also ask questions of your integrity. ”People say we took Maluleka, but the guy wanted to play for us. I told him if you want to win trophies come here. Are you guaranteed that side?”
