THE family of Eugene Maringa has described him as a loving and humble person. The remains of the 47-year-old from Alaska in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, were found on Wednesday by neighbours after he burnt to death in his shack. Eugene’s sister, Anna, (44), who lives in B3 in Mamelodi, said her brother, who lived alone, was a sweet person. She said her brother got on well with his neighbours and the family believed his death was an accident. “His death has caused so much pain and we are struggling to cope as a family.” Eugene’s mum, Thandi, (71) told Daily Sun her son’s death has caused her a lot of pain. “I last spoke to my son in August when he visited me at home,” she said. Alaska community leader, Stephen Mahlokwane (46), said he last saw Eugene on Tuesday. “He loved jokes and was friendly to all people.” Another community leader, Nditsheni Mudimeli, (38) said: “This is sad because he died in the middle of the night and most people saw his burnt shack in the morning.” The family said they were still waiting for the DNA results from police and there was no date set yet for his burial. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman deputy chief Charles Mabaso said: “Unfortunately there was no fire incident reported on Wednesday.”
