ESKOM has finally switched on the lights in Ga-Phago after residents have been living in dark for years, despite having boxes and poles being installed in their village. After people from the village in Moletjie outside Polokwane had lost hope in both their municipality and Eskom, resident Liza Moloto (34) told the People’s Paper yesterday she now was happy after over five years of struggle without electricity. “We struggled with lights and it’s enough,” said Liza. She said they could now sleep peacefully. “We used to sleep with one eye open, because we felt anything could happen at anytime because of the darkness outside.” Liza said life without electricity was something else and made life difficult.“Now that we have electricity. I believe we will have good budgets for our families.” She said they had to delve deep into their pockets to buy paraffin and wood, which they couldn’t even afford. “Due to some being unemployed, we would have to wake up in the early hours to collect firewood at the nearest bush. Now life is becoming more interesting, just like our neighbouring villages and that means a lot to us.” She said she could now have a cup of tea in the morning or evening without going to fetch wood first. “Having to use candles and paraffin stoves would always put our lives in danger,” she said. Yvonne Mogofe (34) said electricity played a crucial role in people’s lives, whether in rural or urban areas. “We wanted the electricity with all our hearts because we needed it too, just like those living in suburbs.” Yvonne had been worried that having no electricity would affect their children’s future. “It was shocking to see our children using candles to study in this time of democracy.” Eskom Limpopo spokesman Dikgabane Rampedi said residents should be patient with them, especially in these difficult times. “Our mandate as Eskom is to give our people electricity and that is what we will continue to be toiling on to ensure we take services to our people,” he said.
