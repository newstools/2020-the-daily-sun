A COMMUNITY was left furious after the owner of a plot dug up graves belonging to their ancestors. Residents of Mmakau, North West, told Daily Sun John Strauss, the land owner began digging on Wednesday, but they managed to chase him away, only for him to return on Friday with security guards. Oupa Motse claimed the plot actually belonged to the tribal office. He said everyone was shocked when they heard there were people digging at the graveyard. They said a man driving a Caterpillar machine told them the land owner said he could dig there. Oupa said they managed to protect some graves, but they were afraid some were destroyed, as they were not properly marked. “The person who claims to own the land is doing a great injustice to us black people. We respect the dead and their resting place.” Florence Ngwenya asked: “When we want to perform our traditional ceremonies, where are we going to do them?” Sam Lebese, who has family buried on the plot, said he managed to protect their graves on Friday, but sooner or later, they would be destroyed. Frank Masikela said: “We need the government to intervene and help us because this is wrong.” When the SunTeam tried to get hold of Strauss, his neighbour and friend Frans Hassbrooke said he had been in hospital for a week. “But I know why he is digging. He is building a trench to try and prevent land grabs. He was not trying to destroy any graves,” he said. Frans said there were problems with land invasions in the area.
