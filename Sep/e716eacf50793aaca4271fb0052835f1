It happened while the workers were fixing an electrical problem in the area.

City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena told Daily Sun this was becoming a trend as officials were threatened several times prior to the robbery. “This will make it difficult for City Power employees to render services in volatile areas,” said Mangena. “All we’re trying to do is help and this is not normal behaviour.” He said people needed to know that City Power would not hesitate to pull out their employees from areas that were not safe. “One of our employees was hijacked at gunpoint a month ago. “We’re trying to see how we can attend to power outages without our workers being threatened. It’s worrying because at the end of the day, these people are risking their lives to try to help.” ALSO READ: WATCH: CLICKS FEELS JUJU'S HEAT He said City Power has asked police to up their game, but they needed to work with Alexandra residents in order to restore law and order and to ensure workers rendered their services without any problems. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo has confirmed that a case of robbery was opened and was being investigated. No arrests have been made yet.
