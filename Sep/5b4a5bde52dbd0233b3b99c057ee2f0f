ABEL Rakoma faces a ban from football after losing a court case against the SA Football Association (Safa). Rakoma, a former Safa NEC member, took the football association to the Limpopo High Court to challenge the disbandment of the Safa Capricon region executive committee. But his attempts were dealt a blow after the court ruled in favour of the football governing body on Wednesday. A Limpopo High Court on Wednesday ruled that democratically elected SAFA Capricorn Region executive members, led by Jacky Mogashoa are legitimate office bearers. Rakoma had earlier received a default judgement after he had approached the courts last year claiming he was still the Region’s president. "The ruling means we are the only legitimate leaders of SAFA Capricorn Region and no other person,’’ said Mogashoa who added that Safa must take strong action against Rakoma for taking football matters to the courts of law. Rakoma runs the risk of a ban from all football and football activities for violating the world football governing body, FIFA’s Statutes of not taking football matters to courts. Article 64.3 of the FIFA Statutes prohibits individuals from taking football matters to ordinary courts. "We all know the consequences of taking football matters to the courts of law. We will report Mr Abel Rakoma to head office and he must be suspended from all football activities, ” Safa said in a statement.
