AN advert asking R1,2million for Volkswagen SA’s third-last Citi Golf has appeared on the Gumtree website. The very last one, 001 is in The Pavilion in Uitenhage and 002 is in Germany’s VW Museum. According to the seller, the car has never been driven and is still in the same condition it rolled off the assembly line. When it was previously auctioned, it fetched well over R300 000. The Citi Golf was first introduced to Mzansi in 1984 and was sold until 2009 as a facelifted version of the first-generation Volkswagen Golf Mk1, which stopped production in Germany in 1983. A sedan version called the Fox was also produced, along with the bakkie called the Caddy. Both these models were discontinued before production of the Citi Golf hatchback stopped.  After production of the Citi Golf stopped in 2009, the body shape of the mid-2000s Polo was stripped down and re-marketed as the Polo Vivo, to replace the entry-level segment the Citi Golf had filled for 25 years.
