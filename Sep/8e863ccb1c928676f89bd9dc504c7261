SINCE the three girls went missing on Sunday, their families have been having sleepless nights and cops have been working around the clock to trace them. The three aged 12,14 and 15 from Duduza disappeared last week from their homes and it was relief when they were found safe and sound today. Sergeant Harry Manaka from Duduza Police Station in Ekurhuleni said they were excited the girls were found after an intensive search at Tsakane extension 19 at about 1pm after they were spotted by members of the community as they were walking around extension 17. Manaka said the two teenage boys who spotted the girls alerted social workers. “It is through collective efforts of police and residents that the girls were found”. He said: “Cops went with the community to several places in Duduza where it was suspected they could be. We informed the community to be on the lookout and with their help, we finally found them.” Their parents couldn’t contain their excitement. One said: “Girls disappear a lot these days and are never found alive. To find your child safe and sound is a real relief.” Duduza station commander Lietenant-Colonel Bheki Mhlungu was relieved the girls were unharmed and also warned parents should not wait for 24 hours when they suspect their children could be missing. Manaka said the girls were taken for medical check-up and received trauma counselling before being united with their families.
