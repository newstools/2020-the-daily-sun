Comedian and Gagasi FM presenter Felix Hlophe wrote on Facebook: “If those artists get criminal records, I will not vote.” He was supported by several other people. Nontz P Zwane wrote: “Couldn’t have said it better. We are all in full support. Abantu balambile.” Thokozani Patrick Mfuphi wrote: “I fully support artists. Corrupt officials are looting Covid-19 funds and they expect us to beg and vote for them. Big up to our artists for fighting for their rights. We are fully behind you guys.” Sbongi Mngoma, a jazz artist from I’m4the Art wrote a very angry letter on her Facebook page in support of the artists. “These are the same artists who have performed at ANC rallies, dinners and events. They stood up for their right to earn a living in the best way they know how,” the letter said in part. ALSO READ: DOUBLE JOY FOR UZALO ACTRESS!
