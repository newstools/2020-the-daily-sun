THE MUM and her daughter have decided to move out of home because they’re scared the man who attacked them might come back to finish what he started. Nonhlanhla Gumede (21) and her mum Funani Gumede (51) from Ndelu in Umthwalume south of Durban were almost killed allegedly by Nonhlanhla’s baby daddy, Mbuyiseni Nyawose (22) last May when they allegedly had an argument and he beat and hacked her with a panga. Funani tried to stop Mbuyiseni, but he beat her as well before fleeing. She told Daily Sun he always beat her daughter over small arguments. “He was very abusive. He used to beat her all the time over small things. In this incident, I don’t know what started the argument. My daughter doesn’t want to talk about it.” She said it was traumatic for both of them, as he beat them in front of his two-year-old son. “We don’t know where he went to and decided to leave our home. We are scared he might return and finish what he started.” Nonhlanhla had to find a new piece job as she had to leave her old one because the baby daddy knew where she worked. Captain Nqobile Gwala said Msinsini cops needed residents’ help to find Mbuyiseni. Charges of attempted murder were opened at Msinsini SAPS for investigation. Gwala said a warrant of arrest for Nyawose has been issued in connection with the attempted murders. “Anyone with information to help arrest the suspect can contact Sergeant Isabel Ngcobo on 079 696 3756 / 039 699 1604 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.”
