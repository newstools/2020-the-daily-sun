Health and beauty retailer Clicks should be slammed for their offensive and divisive hair advert. It’s an insult to women and black people in this country. It was wrong and insensitive for it to say black women’s hair is dry and damaged. The company further labelled the hair frizzy and dull. They are promoting negative sentiments towards black natural hair. Why must we always be made to feel like we are not worthy? Why are we always undermined? Who said that other people are better? It is now trending for all the wrong reasons. The retailer has had to issue an abrupt apology. This is disrespectful to the nation and it should be punished for that discriminatory advert. When will these retailers stop being involved in discrimination or racism? This is disappointing and hurts us as black people. Such adverts must never happen. Government is not serious about this issue because if they were, this would not be happening. Florida
