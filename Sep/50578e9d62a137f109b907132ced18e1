A 40-year-old man will appear in Hankey Magistrate Court on
Thursday for murder of a little girl.  Sergeant Majola Nkohli siad, "The nine-year-old girl
was killed six hours after she was reported missing on Monday.  "At about 2pm, police in Hankey received a complaint of
a missing child, Aqhama Tom. It is alleged that she was last seen on Sunday, at
about 4pm in Matodlana Street in Weston area. On Monday at about 8pm, the
suspect was arrested  for the murder of
Aqhama.  The suspect led the cops to the
bushes near route R330 in Hankey, where he pointed out the body of her."  Acting Sarah Baartman District Commissioner, Brigadier John
Lebok said, “It is unbelievable that in our attempts to end the attacks against
women and children, some people are not heeding our calls.  The death of anyone is painful, but losing
someone under such circumstances is very sad, and painful. But I hope the
deceased family will find solace in knowing that the suspect is behind
bars."
