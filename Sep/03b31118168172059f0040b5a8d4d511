THE Seleka sisters have started a fruit and vegetable business. They said they saw an opportunity when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the start of lockdown in March as they knew many people would be in need of food. They asked their dad to lend them money to buy fruit and vegetables in bulk to start the business. Now Queen (25) and her younger sister Khomotso (22) from Mahwelereng outside Mokopane, Limpopo, don’t regret being in the street the whole day pushing their business. Queen, who is a nursing student, said growing up, she thought being a street vendor was embarrassing, but she now knows that it creates job opportunities. “I am now enjoying being in the streets pushing my business. I’ve learnt that to be successful in this business, you need to reach daily targets.” The sisters operate from one of the busiest streets in Mahwelereng. Khomotso, who is a student at the Waterburg FET College, said they sold fresh fruit and vegetables, and that’s why many locals buy from them. “We are so fortunate we can reach our daily target because the produce rots within two days,” she said. Khomotso praised her dad for not doubting their business idea. “We have been running this business for only three months, but it is already booming,” she said.
