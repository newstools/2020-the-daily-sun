We have just moved to lockdown level 2 and people are behaving as if our lives are back to normal. The truth is that the war against the coronavirus is far from over. We have quickly forgotten to observe Covid-19 regulations, and this will badly count against us. The relaxation of rules meant each citizen must start to act responsibly in upholding all the regulations that had been put in place to help curb the spread of this deadly disease. It’s not all about the government improving the health system, it’s not about our nurses and doctors,and it’s not about police and the defence force. It’s also in the hands of every citizen. Together we’ll win, but apart we are giving the enemy venom to strike us harder. I have seen now that masks have been turned into necklaces and only put on when entering the shops, or when reminded to do so by others or officials. This fight is for everyone irrespective of age, race and nationality. We must join hands and fight tooth and nail to emerge victorious. Remember, our behaviour will either count for us or against us. Aluta continua! Letter by Elson Chauke
