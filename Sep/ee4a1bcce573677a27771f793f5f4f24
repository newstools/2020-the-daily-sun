LOCAL boxing promoter Andre Thysse wants the Boxing South Africa (BSA) board to extend the 2020-21 licenses to March 2022. The former Commonwealth champion has written a letter to the BSA board pleading for the extension of their licenses until March 2022. The Real Steel Boxing Promotion boss said he has written the letter on behalf of all BSA licensees. “I have received several calls from BSA licensees, telling me how hard it is for them not having an income and now they have to renew their licenses again when they expire in March 2021. Remember 80% of people in boxing depend on tournaments for survival. “With everyone who has renewed their licensees and with almost no boxing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I saw it fitting to step in and be their voice. There is no association for boxers, trainers and managers in South Africa, so these people have no voice,” said Thysse. According to the outspoken promoter if their wish is granted this would be a big relief to every BSA licensee. “They (BSA) haven’t answered us as yet but we are willing to give them time to respond and see how far they can help. “I hope that the BSA board see that the boxing licensees need help and extend the 2020-2021 licenses,” he said. Thysse said the majority were in favour of his proposal. “The motion was put forward to licensees on social media and WhatsApp groups and so far, only one person disagreed,” he said
