Zamalek’s French head coach, Patrice Carteron, has surprisingly resigned after less than a year in charge of the Whites. The French manager, Carteron, led the club to the Egyptian Super Cup title as well as the CAF Super Cup, before guiding the Whites to the CAF Champions League semi-finals. Domestically, Zamalek sit second in the Egyptian Premier League, 20 points behind leaders Al Ahly and are in the quarter-finals of the Egypt Cup, where they will face Smouha. The club’s performances under his guidance, earned Carteron a new improved contract last June, however, the Frenchman decided to quit and will just pay the release clause, which was included in the contract. The decision to resign is rumoured to make way for Carteron to take over the vacant head coach position at rivals Pyramids FC or Moroccan giants Wydad Casablanca, who parted company with Juan Carlos Garrido just days ago. The Frenchman is heading to Saudi side Al-Taawoun, who are currently taking part in the AFC Champions League. Carteron was appointed as Zamalek head coach last December, taking charge of the club in 31 games, winning 19 while losing only three. It’s not clear yet who will succeed Carteron this season as club president Mortada Mansour will now start looking for his third managerial appointment this season. However, according to many reports Tarek Yehia is set to be named as interim head coach to take the helm for the Whites in the upcoming weeks.
