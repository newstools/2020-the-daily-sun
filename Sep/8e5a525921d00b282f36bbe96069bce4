POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has said criminals in possession of illegal guns were a big concern for the government. This came after Sergeant Thabile Mapoma (43) was murdered in his driveway in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Thursday. Cele said the gun used to commit the crime was not registered, but was a make used by cops. “The gun was an RL5. We all know that’s a police gun. How it reached criminals is what we are working on. “There’s an ongoing investigation and in a short period of time, we will pick up some people,” said the minister. On Saturday, Cele visited the homes of two cops murdered in Cape Town last week. Mapoma was murdered on Thursday night and anti-gang unit section commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Charl Kinnear, was killed in broad daylight the following day. Cele said the cops were doing everything possible to ensure illegal guns were removed from the community. “There is an amnesty programme to get these guns back. We also have raids to try and find these illegal firearms. No doubt, they pose a lot of danger to the broader society, including members of the SAPS,” he said.  He said the issue of illegal firearms was one that needed the government and public to work together. “We have to make sure the legal guns don’t fall into the hands of criminals,” he said. Cele said both murders of Mapoma and Kinnear were committed using illegal firearms. Kinnear’s wife, Nicolette, said they were hoping cops will bring closure to the family. “As the minister said, they are investigating. We are waiting to hear from them. My husband was a committed officer who gave his all to his work for the past 31 years. He respected the oath that he took to save the community,” said Nicolette.
