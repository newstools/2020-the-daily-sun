THE Hawks bust three people yesterday night, when they found heroin with a street value of R87,5 million on them. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said they made the arrests in collaboration with Mpumalanga Crime Intelligence. He said they found 342,5 kg of drugs inside what was believed to be a purpose-built hide in a truck going from Mozambique via Swaziland to KZN. He said the truck was stopped in Hluhluwe and the team immediately started with the search. “Almost 250 packets of heroin were found hidden in a false partition, which was newly painted. Members had to cut open the compartment to access the drugs.”  Mhlongo said the driver and two passengers were immediately placed under arrest and will appear in court soon.  National head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya has welcomed the arrest and seizure of the drugs. He said these would have made a hefty profit for criminals involved in drug supply. “It is worrisome to imagine how many lives were going to be wasted through addiction and crime triggered by the use of these hard-core dependence- producing substances,” said Lebeya.
