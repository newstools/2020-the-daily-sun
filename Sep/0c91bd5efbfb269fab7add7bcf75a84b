“LAST night I cried, tossed and turned. Woke up with dry eyes. My mind was racing, feet were pacing. Lord, help me please, tell me what I have gotten into.” If like me, you’re a sucker for RnB and soul music, you’d recognise Vivian Green’s Emotional Rollercoaster lyrics. The song describes the journey of love, and how beautiful it can be despite its ups and downs. It also shows we are emotional beings. But according to our hormones, love becomes harder to deal with as we get older, and women become sad victims of love as they age. Psychologists agree that we live in a world of constant change, and this affects how we react as we get older. With women being more in touch with their emotional side, it’s only natural that they become emotionally vulnerable. Psychologists also says the rise of cougars and jaguars is due to this emotional vulnerability. Moral of the story? We are all feeling-charged beings. Yes, some more than others, but it is important to always love and care for our women. Aging is something we all can choose to embrace or cry our way through, but remember tears are not a sign of weakness, but of strength.
