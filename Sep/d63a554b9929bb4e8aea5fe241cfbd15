Kaizer Chiefs have returned to training to begin their preparation ahead of the start of the 2020-21 season. Amkhosi's new head coach Gavin Hunt is already hard at work with his new side as they look to hit the ground running. Hunt's newly appointed assistants Dillon Sheppard and Arthur Zwane are also getting their hands dirty in Naturena ahead of the new season. Chiefs are eager to put behind them the disastrous end to the previous season which saw them surrender the league to rivals Mamelodi Sundowns on the final day. Hunt has been tasked with turning the club's fortunes around and ending their five-year trophy drought.
