  COURT officials burst into laughter when a man told the Mmabatho Magistrates Court in Mahikeng that he beat up his girlfriend because she pulled his 4-5 and squeezed his balls until they hurt. Ntsimane Mokwena (59) from Majemantsho Village appeared in court today for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and crimen injuria. Magistrate Themba Shabangu asked him if he understood why he was in court and the charges he faced. He also asked him whether he wanted to speak for himself, needed legal aid or to pay for his own attorney. Ntsimane, who seemed not to understand much about court proceedings, said he did not want to accept the charges laid against him as he did not do it intentionally. He said: “My girlfriend held me by my 4-5 and squeezed my balls. It hurt. It was not my intention to beat her up, but my 4-5 and balls hurt,” he told the court. Shabangu explained to him that he had assaulted a woman during a time when government was advocating against gender-based violence. He was then released on bail after he sought a legal aid representative, who told the court that Ntsimane could not afford any amount for bail. It was also heard that he was a first offender with no previous convictions. The assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm charge was changed to common assault after the state prosecutor told the court there was no information on the docket that stated that Ntsimane’s girlfriend was severely assaulted or that she sought medical attention. Shabangu then released him on a warning. He will make his next court appearance on November 12.
