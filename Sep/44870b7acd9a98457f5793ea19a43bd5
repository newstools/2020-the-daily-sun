There are people who continue texting on the roads even though they know it’s risky. They can get killed. Many people think only texting and driving causes accidents on the roads, but texting and walking also causes accidents. It’s unfortunate that drivers are the only ones blamed when someone is killed on the road. People must understand that texting while crossing a road can get you killed. It’s important for pedestrians to obey road safety rules. As parents, we have to encourage children to understand the importance of pedestrian safety. Texting while walking decreases the ability to walk in a straight line and slows down pace significantly. Pedestrians using cellphones are getting hurt, and that suggests they’re not being cautious. Texting and walking car accidents are high statistically, specifically for teenagers. Pedestrians must just stick to basic road rules to avoid being knocked down by cars. They must never text and walk because they won’t see oncoming vehicles. Your Facebook, Twitter and Instagram updates can wait. People should pocket their phones and just enjoy the walk at hand. Texting and walking is bad. Stop doing it!
