THE 4-5 is a delicate organ and its full functionality relies on being in a comfortable state. When you’re asleep, your body’s at its most relaxed state, and your 4-5’s no different. According to experts, the 4-5 and the testicles need room temperature of 35 degrees to produce sperm and wearing and sleeping in boxers is one of the greatest obstacles to men producing sperm. Health experts advised men to sleep naked to ensure the good health of their 4-5s. Dr Brian Steixner, Institute for Men’s Health Jersey Urology Group director in the US, said men could end up with fertility problems when sleeping in their underwear. If a man’s 4-5 becomes too warm, it can negatively impact the health of his sperm. Steixner said sleeping in your underwear draws in heat and moisture to your crotch area, allowing bacteria to thrive and a much higher chance of chaffing, skin irritation and infection. This tends to affect the size and growth of the 4-5. So, if you want to always have your birthday cake, make sure you sleep in your birthday suit!
