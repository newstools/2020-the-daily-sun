THE CASE of three men accused of dealing in dagga was postponed by Mmabatho Magistrates Court for bail application. The 39-year-old suspected kingpin and his co-accused aged 24 and 29 made a brief appearance before Magistrate Themba Shabangu. The three, one a SANDF employee, were bust yesterday in a special operation with the Hawks. Hawks spokeswoman Tlangelani Rhikhotso said the operation aimed to take down an illegal operation allegedly involving complex secret activities dealing in dagga and money laundering. The three apparently smuggled dagga from Swaziland and supplied it to Mahikeng and surrounding towns. Rikhotso said after months of observation, evidence showed they were allegedly also involved in money laundering activities involving fixed and movable property. She said in February, the kingpin was bust in possession of dagga worth about R600 000 and charged, but now has been allegedly linked to money laundering activities. Two BMWs, two Mercedes-Benz, a Corsa and a VW Polo belonging to the suspects were seized, believed to be gained through crime, along with bags of dagga. The suspects will appear again on 4 November for bail application.
