HUMAN rights activists Advocate George Bizos has died. He
was 92. The SAHETI School for which he is the founding board
chairman announced his death on Wednesday night, saying the well-loved advocate
who was also served as lawyer for former president Nelson Mandela, had given
his life and energy to the SAHETI community. “As a community, we walked alongside a man who has become an
icon in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. As a great role model,
he stood up for freedom and justice. “His words of wisdom, personal life lessons and positive
nature were an inspiration and will remain with us forever,” said the school in
a statement. A later statement said the stalwart died at 17h30 of natural causes at home around his family. Details of funeral arrangements were not provided for. One of Bizos recent work was when he represented Marikana
miners during the commission to probe the massacre. When there was a delay in releasing the report, he was one
of the prominent individuals to come forward and called for its release arguing
that it was in the public interest. He was also known to have been close to Tata Mandela whom he
has repeatedly described as a friend.
