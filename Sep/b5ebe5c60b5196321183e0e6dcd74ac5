THE Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) opened a case against Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday. This after several train stations were vandalised and stripped due to a lack of security guards. Speaking to Daily Sun, Greater Joburg MKMVA Secretary Thanduxolo Ndyondo expressed concern over what he said is negligence displayed by the Department of Transport. “In November, Prasa security contracts were terminated and cases of theft and vandalism immediately spiked,” he said. “In December, they were brought back, but the damage had already been done.” Ndyondo said the contract was terminated again in April. “Mbalula and his team could have come up with a better strategy to cut costs and keep the infrastructure protected.” Deputy chairman Mavela Mabuza said: “Look at the issue of taxis. He failed to address the issue and dragged it on for months until commuters were forced to pay more for their trips.” He accused Mbalula of being an agent of capitalists. “It’s mainly trucks that deliver goods now, which are expensive. “It’s much cheaper to transport goods using goods trains, but that’s suddenly ignored.” According to Mbalula, the department is aware of the charges laid against him for vandalism of Prasa assets. “It’s a sad day that individuals who claim to be members of our movement’s Veterans’ Association, would behave in a manner that not only validates actions of criminals that continue to steal and destroy public assets, but waste state resources that should be directed at investigating these criminals,” said Mbalula. “We are mindful that security challenges at Prasa loom large. “We have been hard at work putting in place a robust security plan for Prasa. “We’ll be making pronouncements soon on these plans.”
