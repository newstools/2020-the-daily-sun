WHEN Nqobile Gumede fainted in front of the judges on national TV on Idols SA in 2016, she was disappointed and heartbroken. She knew God was teaching her a lesson and that He would help her come back. Now the 22-year-old musician has self-published her debut book titled The Queen of Comebacks. It is aimed at motivating people who have downfalls in life. Nqobile shocked Mzansi and the judges when she fainted on the show. ALSO READ: WANKOLOTA BUSHIRI! Judges Unathi Nkayi, Somizi Mhlongo, Randall Abrahams and Gareth Cliff got up to help her. Nqobile, who was born in KwaMashu, Durban, returned to Idols SA last year to prove she could sing. She was eliminated in the top eight. Nqobile said her book will help people by letting them know God’s plans and motivate them in bad times. She told SunBuzz that fainting on the show taught her many lessons about life and she wanted to teach other people about life through her book. “If you fall, it does not mean that you have failed. You can come back and continue where you fell. “Last year I had to be brave and go back to Idols where I became a laughing stock in 2016. Last year, I did well and I’m grateful. “I was so hurt at the age of 18 years old trying my luck on Idols. “I fainted on national TV and people kept laughing at me and didn’t give me a chance to explain what happened,” she said. Nqobile said after she had cried she realised that actually the fainting incident was not her downfall, but it was God’s plan to make her popular. “People should learn that God always has plans for their lives. That was not my time and God wanted me to experience the pain and teach his children about it,”she said. “This book will teach people about my pains, since I was popular for my stage fainting. “It will also teach them how I overcame those pains.” She said that those who want to buy her book can contact her through social networks.
