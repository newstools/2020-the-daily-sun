IF YOU fail to prepare, you have prepared to fail. This is what Obakeng Baloi, better known as Bucks, has learnt from his running career. The 22-year-old athlete from Rustenburg, North West, told Daily Sun his dream was always to become a soccer player, but things worked out differently. He played soccer in high school, but his principal thought he had a lot of potential in athletics. “I then stopped playing soccer and went straight to running in 2014,” he said. Obakeng qualified for the provincial competition on his first try without even proper training. “That was when I started believing in myself. I took it seriously and never looked back. “My love and passion for the sport grew and I’ll forever be grateful to my principal at HF Tlou High School in Tlhabane, who realised my potential.” In 2015, Obakeng started training properly and participated in the 400m race at the South African Athletics Championships’ Under-17 division. “I’ve also participated in the Athletics SA Senior Championships and National Championshps. For some time, I couldn’t participate due to injuries, but I came back stronger and hungry for victory,” he said. “My comeback wasn’t easy, but I didn’t give up. In 2018, I was part of the Puma School of Speed and went to the National Championships again. It’s my goal to win the Olympics. I’m working toward it.” Obakeng also thanked his fans. “I’ll forever be grateful to those who always cheer for me. You need to be passionate and consistent in whatever you do for you to prosper,” he said. “Work hard at what you want to achieve because easy come, easy go.”
