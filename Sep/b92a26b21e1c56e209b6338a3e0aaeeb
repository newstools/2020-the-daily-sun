RADIO presenter Karabo Ntshweng recently dished out some career advice. The talented media personality, who hosts 5FM’s morning slot between 4am and 6am, advised people that if ever they got an opportunity to go work overseas, they should grab it with both hands. “Guys if you have the opportunity to go work overseas, do it hey, screw SA. Our government doesn’t care anyway.” She further said it’s so stressful being young in Mzansi because of the limited opportunities that young graduates have. “You fight to get into higher education. If you get funding, Nsfas can just decide to defund you.” “If you make it out and graduate, you struggle to find work or extremely underpaid, or might get retrenched at any moment.” ALSO READ | OPERATION VULA IS GAINING MOMENTUM Many people agreed with the media personality and shared their own experiences and frustrations. “It’s very tough. You get that internship or a graduate programme and after a year or two is back to job hunting. The country has no vision,” a tweep said. TV presenter and producer Merica Monamodi also commented and said people should definitely do it. “People must go! You’re able to travel, save tons of money and experience a different life!” “But make sure your mental health is good. Life is extremely different there and sometimes lonely. It’s the sacrifice you have to make.” But some disagreed and said the grass is not greener on the other side. “Guys the grass is definitely not greener on the other side! Globally, economies are in the litter box. Workers’ rights are threatened now more than ever, salaries not keeping up. There’s mass xenophobia across the world. It’s not rosy.” Yoh guys if you have the opportunity to go work overseas do it hey, screw SA. Our government doesn’t care anyway. So ????‍??
