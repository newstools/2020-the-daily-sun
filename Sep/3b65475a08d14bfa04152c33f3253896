BISHOP Nandi Phakade of the Christian Faith Foundation Ministries in Philippi, Browns Farm, has called for young women to stop going to taverns at night. She said young women who’ve been murdered in Philippi have been linked nights outs at taverns and parties. Nandi said women’s bodies are like sought-after gold. “Girls must know they’re different: they were created in a certain way.” “When a girl child walks on the streets at night, robbers don’t just target their phone. “If you don’t have a phone they go for your body because you’re carrying gold. When they’re done with your body they go for your life.” She urged young women to be at home early and stop going to night jols. “ When it is 6pm a girl child must be inside their home. Girls must desist from going to taverns at night because their lives are always at risk. “Be at home cooking, be the one closing the curtains when it’s getting dark. When a woman is in a tavern, they are targetted – when you leave you’re followed.” Nandi said this after the murder of Nomvuzo Atoli and Amahle Quku, who were killed after they’d gone out at night. “We have the same problem of killings of women in a similar age group, in the same manner and in a short time. “This is why we’re giving suggestions that may save the young girls.” Both incidents happened in Philippi and Nandi said it concerns the church when such incidents keep occurring. Nomvuzo, the latest victim, was buried in Cala in the Eastern Cape over the weekend. Alleged killer, Sive Mpafa, appeared in court last week Friday.
