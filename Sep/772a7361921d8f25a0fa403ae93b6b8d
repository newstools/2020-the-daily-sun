THE three cops accused of killing Nateniel Julies (16) were remanded in custody as their case was postponed. Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvana, Caylene Whiteboy and Foster Netshiongolo made their second court appearance in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto yesterday. Nateniel’s mum, Bridget Harris, and stepdad Clint Smith, attended the court case for the first time along with businessman Kenny Kunene, who came to support the family. Sitting in the front row, Bridget could not hold back her tears when she saw the cops accused of killing her son. Ndyalvana and Whiteboy face charges of murder, defeating the ends of justice as well as possession of prohibited ammunition, while Netshiongolo is charged with being an accessory to murder, defeating the ends of justice and unlawful possession of ammunition. Their case was postponed to 22 September for a formal bail application.  Speaking after the court appearance, Bridget pleaded that the accused be denied bail. A relative, Cyril Brown, said: “Today was very traumatic for Nateniel’s mum. She broke down again. “This is really taking a toll on her and it breaks our hearts to see her cry all the time.”  Cyril said it was even harder for Bridget to grant interviews. Nateniel, who had Down’s syndrome, was allegedly shot and killed by the police last month. According to his family, he had gone outside to enjoy his pack of biscuits just a few metres away from home. He was buried last weekend. His death has since sparked outrage in Eldorado Park, which saw residents protesting and demanding justice for the murdered teenager.
