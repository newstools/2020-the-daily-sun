EFF leader Julius Malema and EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi are expected to appear at the Randburg Magistrate Court on Monday. The pair will be appearing for an alleged assault of a police officer during the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in April 2018. Malema and Ndlozi allegedly assaulted the officer who was trying to deny them entry to the funeral of the Struggle stalwart. Their case was postponed to today for trial after their absence last month.
