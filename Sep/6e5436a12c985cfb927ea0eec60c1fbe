Absent fathers are always blamed for not playing a role in their children’s lives. Having been raised by a single parent myself, I understand the emotional scar of growing up without a father. My dad, who I met for the first time at the age of 23, for example, left my mum eight months pregnant with me. He left us not by choice, but because he was a freedom fighter who became a wanted man by the then apartheid regime. As a result, he was exiled to Canada and came back to South Africa when former president Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990. Such an absence is understandable, but it’s unacceptable for mums to prevent dads to see their kids. Mums are also to blame for fatherlessness, hence to some money can raise their children more than the comfort of having a dad. Florida
