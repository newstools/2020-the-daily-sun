GladAfrica Championship side Jomo Cosmos have announced the signing of Mali midfielder Aboubacar Bemba Sangara, who last played for Tunisian side CS Hammam-Lif. The 20-year-old has signed for Ezenkosi as they seek to bolster their squad after a few years of struggle that almost saw the former league champions relegated to the ABC Motsepe League at the end of this season. Find out more about the new channel line-up on SuperSportOn the face of it, the capture of Sangara looks quite a coup, with the player having featured in the CAF Champions League for another of his former sides, AS Togo Port. He featured when the Togolese club beat Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in 2018, and when they drew 0-0 with powerful Wydad Casablanca later that campaign. He joined Hammam-Lif at the start of the 2019-20 campaign, but was released in January and has been clubless since. -SuperSport
