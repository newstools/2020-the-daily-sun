Dear MizzB I AM a 35-year-old woman and lately Iâ€™m no longer interested in having sex with my partner. I feel that he is too gentle and I want him to get rough. How do I make him understand my desires? Dear SisterCommunication is important in a relationship. How you speak to your partner about sexual desires plays a big role in how he will respond. Have a conversation, and not an instructing session.
