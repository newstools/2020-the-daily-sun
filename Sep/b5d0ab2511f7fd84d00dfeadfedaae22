VUSI Hadebe suspects his daughter Mbali’s death last month wasn’t an accident. The 65-year-old from Alexandra, Joburg, told Daily Sun her body was found inside a car that had crashed into a tree, but he’d heard she and her friend were arguing on Vilakazi Street in Soweto earlier. “Her friends told me at one point the guy almost hit her. They eventually left the restaurant, and that was the last time she was seen alive,” he said. Vusi said the tracker in her car showed Mbali (32) was travelling at 60km per hour at the time of the crash and he didn’t understand how she could have been killed at that speed. “I won’t be able to find closure until all these puzzles fit together. Right now nothing makes sense,” he said. Vusi said when he arrived at the scene, Mbali’s phone and wallet were missing and she wasn’t bleeding. “Police told me she probably had internal bleeding, but that doesn’t explain why there was blood on her clothing,” he said. Vusi said a few days after Mbali was buried, he called her friend to ask what exactly had happened. “We met and he told me they had a little argument, but it wasn’t a serious issue,” he said. Vusi said the friend told him he and Mbali went their separate ways after their fight. “He said he called Mbali to check if she got home safely and panicked when the phone went to voicemail,” said Vusi. He said he thought it was suspicious that the friend immediately called Mbali’s mum and said he wanted to open a missing persons case. “Her phone could just have died. Why was he assuming the worst? I just want answers and for the police not to drag their feet,” said Vusi. The Jabulani SAPS spokesman, captain Sifiso Mabizela, confirmed a case of culpable homicide was opened. “The investigation is still on. The autopsy has been done and we’re still awaiting results,” said Mabizela.
