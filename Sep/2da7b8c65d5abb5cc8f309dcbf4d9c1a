FORMER Black Leopards midfielder Tshwarelo Bereng says he does not hold any grudges against Lidoda Duvha after his contract was terminated with immediate effect last week. The Lesotho international was hoping to help the Venda-based side with their promotion/relegation play-offs against Ajax Cape Town and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and avoid relegation. Bereng joined Leopards from Chippa United and helped them get back to the Absa Premiership two seasons ago. “I had a good time at Leopards,” said Bereng. “I can freely say I enjoyed playing for Leopards and I gave my best. I have nothing bad to say about (Leopards), except to thank them for the opportunity they gave me. “I am not angry with the decision they took for me to leave the team. I have already moved on with my life as these things happen in football to players all the time. “I would have loved to be part of the team in the play-offs, but they (Leopards management) felt my services were no longer needed and I respect their decision.” The 29-year-old said he will be returning home to Lesotho to see his family before deciding which team he will be playing for next season. “I am confident of finding a team,” said the player, who also once featured for Swallows FC. “I have already had offers but I have not yet decided which team I should join. I am going home first to see my family as it has been long since I have been with them.” Bereng’s contract was terminated together with those of Mogakolodi Ngele and Thobani Mncwango.
