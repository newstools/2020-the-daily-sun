GOSPEL singer Enny Bilankulu (43) is following in her late sister’s footsteps. Like her sister Maggie Bila Bila of Bombagaza fame, domestic worker Enny has released a new album, Mulisa. “I’m a domestic worker during the day from Monday to Friday. “On Saturday and Sunday I spread the word of God.” She said gospel music is her comfort. “That’s why I promote the power of God through music. Mulisa is praise on how God is a saviour. “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and I was a herd girl,” she said. “Sometimes I’d be alone in the veld, but God would protect me.” She also said her album is testimony that God’s delay is perfect timing. Born in Nairen Village in Senwabarwana, Limpopo, Enny started singing at school and in church. She wants to keep her sister’s legacy alive. “In my next album I’ll start featuring one song from each of my sister’s albums,” said Enny. “That way her music will always be remembered. Some people mistake my voice for hers.” She said Covid-19 has affected her music career. She can no longer perform at churches.
