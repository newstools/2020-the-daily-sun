A KHAYELITSHA family is lucky to be alive after a bakkie crashed into their house while they were sleeping on Saturday morning. The inhabitants of the house told the SunTeam their God and ancestors saved them. “It felt like I was dreaming. It was so fast and scary,” said Nozibele Kokwe, the woman who was sleeping in the house. She’s happy that her daughter Athengosi Kokwe (21) missed death by a whisker after a bakkie rammed into their house along Mew Way road in Khayelitsha. “I was still in bed when I heard a loud bang and thought the car had just crushed on concrete slabs on the roadside. A few seconds later the bakkie landed into our house. “I was shocked it hit the wardrobe and some bricks fell on top of my daughter was sleeping on her bed injuring her,” said Kokwe. Athengosi was hit on the lower board including her legs and was transported to hospital. The mum said the worst could have happened to them and worse to her daughter. “I’m glad that even if she’s injured her legs still work. The worse that could have happened would have been death,” added Kokwe. According to a witness, the bakkie driver lost control of the vehicle and rammed onto the pavement before driving into a house. “The driver was speeding from the direction of Lookout Hill towards Site C when he lost control and the bakkie rammed on the concrete slabs before flying into the house,” said Manelisi Njoba, who stays in new shacks along Mew Way. The driver of the bakkie wasn’t on the scene when the SunTeam arrived.
