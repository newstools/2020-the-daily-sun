WITH a combined 214 years alive, these two centenarians are
the world’s oldest living married couple! CNN reports that the Guinness Book of World Records has certified
Julio Caesar Mora (110) and his wife Waldramina Maclovia Quinteros (105)  who have been married for 79 years. The couple are from the town of Quito in Ecuador in South America. Mora was born on March 10, 1910, and Quinteros was born on
October 16, 1915. They have survived two World Wars and the current coronavirus
pandemic which has hit their continent very hard. CNN reports that they met during a school vacation because
her sister was married to his cousin, according a statement from Guinness World
Records. “After seven years of friendship, they got married on
February 7, 1941. It was an intimate and secret ceremony with their godparents
and close friends because their families didn't approve of the marriage.” Mora and Quinteros said their relatives didn't get along at
first, but they were able to bring them together over the years. "Family unity under the rules of love, mutual respect,
honest work, and proper education based on family values are the keys to
healthy coexistence," the couple said in the statement. They went on to have five children, who all graduated
college, and a big family of 11 grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren, and 9
great-great-grandchildren. Their oldest son died when he was 58, according to
the statement. They were both teachers until they retired.
