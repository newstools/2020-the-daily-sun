THE man who apparently shot and killed his wife in front of their son was denied bail by Zwelitsha Magistrates Court yesterday. Regional NPA spokeswoman Anelisa Ngcakani said: “The court denied bail for Lubabalo Magwebu (38), as he would likely interfere with witnesses and it would give him access to a firearm, because he is a security guard. Magwebu is accused of murdering his wife in front of their 10-year-old son. Allegedly, towards the end of August, he and his wife had an argument which led to the wife leaving their home. She went to her parents’ home which is also in Dimbaza. “On 2 September at about 8pm, the two allegedly bumped into each other on the streets of Dimbaza. The wife was walking with their 10-year-old son. An argument allegedly erupted between the two and Magwebu drew his firearm and fired several shots at his wife, killing her instantly. “He then handed himself and his firearm over at the Dimbaza Police Station on the same day.” Prosecutor Cikizwa Maqiza argued that the offence was serious and Magwebu was likely interfere or intimidate witnesses, one of them being his 10-year-old son. “Releasing him will undermine the proper functioning of the criminal justice system,” she said. The case was postponed to 28 October for further investigation.
