OWEN Da Gama will discuss his future with Highlands Park new owner Tim Sukazi next week. Sukazi’s side TS Galaxy will now campaign in the Premiership having bought the status of Highlands. Da Gama says Sukazi told him that they cannot afford him and they have already appointed Dan Malesela to coach his side. Da Gama joined Highlands in September 2017 when they were still campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship. He helped the Tembisa side gain promotion to the PSL at the end of 2017-18 season and guided them to the MTN8 final in 2019 where they lost 1-0 to SuperSport United. Said Da Gama: “I spoke to the new owner, he explained that they already have Dan Malesela to coach the club in the PSL and they cannot afford my salary. I am contracted to Highlands until the end of this season and I will have a meeting with the directors early next week to clarify my future.” Da Gama had interest from GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila who bought the PSL status of Bidvest Wits hoping he will coach them in the new season. “I told TTM that I am still under contract at Highlands and they should speak with management, but they never came back to me.”
