Baroka FC might have caused one of the biggest upsets in the Absa Premiership but their job is not done as far as their own fate is concerned. The Ga-Mphahlele outfit broke Amakhosi hearts when they held them to a 1-1 draw whichh cost them the title. The victory, though, was not enough to see Bakgaga avoid the promotion/relegation play-offs where they will have to fight to keep their spot in the top flight. They will remain in the bio bubble along with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Ajax Cape Town as they fight for the last spot in the top flight for next season. Black Leopards survives the dreaded drop despite a 3-0 loss at the hands of champions Mamelodi Sundowns on the final day in an action packed encounter at the Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday.

Chiefs blew a 13 point lead having been at the summit for an entire year before being toppled by Downs on the last day. Meanwhile, AmaZulu have also survive the drop having spent a lot of time in the relegation zone. They finished 13th with 30 points, two points clear of the danger zone.
