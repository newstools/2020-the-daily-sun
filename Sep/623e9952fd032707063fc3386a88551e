 HER daughter (11) was allegedly raped by a 19-year-old suspect on 3 August. But instead of fighting for her daughter, the mum saw a chance to make money. She demanded R5 000 inhlawulo from the alleged rapist’s family, who only managed to raise R1 250. This angered the 39-year-old mum from Ivory Park near Tembisa, who opened a case of rape. Captain Bernard Matimulane of Ivory Park Police Station said the mum reported the case seven days after the incident and the suspect was arrested. “The mother was also arrested after the investigation revealed information in her statement,” he said. She was arrested for contravening Section 54 of the Sexual Offences Act. “She was obliged to report the rape as soon as her daughter told her. She’ll appear in court soon.” He said the young girl was taken to a relative in the Eastern Cape. Fuming mums said the woman deserved to rot in jail. Resident Agnes Ndlovu (42) told the People’s Paper: “A mother has to fight for her kids, but she decided to sell her daughter’s soul for money.” Community leader Gladys Ndlebe said: “Gone are the days when families used to negotiate damages with the rapists’ families. “This won’t happen again. We urge girls and women to come forward and report rape.”
