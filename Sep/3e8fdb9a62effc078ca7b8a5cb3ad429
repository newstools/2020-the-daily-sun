Highlands Park supporters are up in arms over the pending sale of the club. Siyabangena Siyabahlaba fans plan to protest at Dobsonville Stadium, in Soweto on Wednesday afternoon ahead of the club’s Absa Premiership match against Cape Town City (6pm). TS Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi has been reported to be on the verge of buying the club. Highlands loyal fan Maphuti “Mayweather GP” Moremi says management didn’t bother to inform them about selling the club as they only read about it on media platforms. He says their peaceful protest is to ensure that the team doesn’t relocate from their base in Tembisa if it’s sold. Said Moremi: “Management are selling the team without informing supporters. As the community of Tembisa we will lose a lot financially if the team gets sold. When Highlands play at Makhulong the security guards, those ladies who sell food also benefit, those who help park cars also get something. They won’t be able to feed their families if the new owners relocate the club elsewhere.” Moremi revealed that they tried to set-up a meeting with management without success. “We tried to arrange a meeting with management so that they can clarify this matter, but we never had luck. That’s why we have decided to travel to Dobsonville to protest outside the Stadium and ensure they hear our grievances. Enough is enough, they want to discard us forgetting we rallied behind this team from the Vodacom (ABC Motsepe) league, to NFD (GladAfrica Championship), then PSL, back to NFD and we returned to the elite league with them. They should be considerate and sell the team on condition that new owners don’t relocate from our backyard.”
