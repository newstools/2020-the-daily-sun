JOBURG Metro Police management is saddened after learning of the death of a female officer who collapsed on duty yesterday. Superintendent Nokuthula Pako told Daily Sun officer Elizabeth Mafale reported for duty yesterday at the compstats office in Martindale. “At 7.20am, the officer collapsed in the office and Netcare 911 paramedics were called in, but unfortunately the officer was declared dead on the scene.” Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said Mafale was a very quiet person, who’d only greet and then do her work without complaining. “She was at the compstat unit where statistics and data is captured, and that was her job. “I will surely miss her for being such a dedicated JMPD member. The department would like to send its heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of officer Mafale. May her soul rest in peace,” Minnaar said.
