DJ AND producer Prince Kaybee’s new music venture has tweeps excited. The Fetch Your Life producer, who is in studio with King Monada, posted a video of himself driving to Tzaneen, Limpopo to work with the Idibala hitmaker. He wrote: “Let me go to Limpopo and see King Monada. Wanna try something with him. I will post soon what happened. Hosh.” This left tweeps excited, unlike his last couple of collaborations. ALSO READ | LEGENDS ON STAMPS During the lockdown, Prince Kaybee has been getting together with different artists for new music. People said they know the song will be a hit and couldn’t wait to hear it. When the DJ collaborated with Rethabile in July, an Eastern Cape producer claimed the song they were doing was his. The DJ apologised to DJ Trumpet on Twitter, saying he didn’t know someone else had worked on the song before. Kaybee also worked with Mampintsha in August but received backlash because of abuse claims against the West Ink Records founder. The two then announced they would donate 50% of the proceeds from their song to charities who work with GBV victims. So far, the King Monada partnership is the only one to have made people happy. Prince Kaybee is also working on an album with 10 girls chosen on social media. Touchdown Tzaneen...Lets get to work?? pic.twitter.com/j9ZUJ5EjZF
