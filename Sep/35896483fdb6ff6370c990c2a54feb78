LESHOLE is close to obtaining his private pilot licence, but it seems he doesn’t have a lot of people backing him in Skeem Saam. His estranged mother, who’s left her other family, showed up at his door on hearing he’ll be a pilot. But she got the wrong end of the stick and was convinced her son will be flying commercial flights. Now that she’s found out the truth, she’s mocking the aviation school he’s attending and his licence. Not only that, but after he gave a speech at his old high school, many people in Turfloop, who do not understand aviation, also laughed at him, sighting he might not end up flying a commercial flight. He needs to get rid of his mum, who’s clearly back because she wants money from him. One thing is for sure Leshole will obtain his licence and become a pilot, regardless of the noise around him. Isibaya’s Dabula has made Jabu pay damages for sleeping with his wife Ntwentle while he was in jail. Dabula has asked for 10 taxis as his payment and is just being difficult.

Dabula is on a mission to get Ntwentle, whether she wants him or not. The war that’s about to erupt between Jabu and Dabula is one for the books. She’s already chosen who she wants, and that’s Jabu, but Dabula is not about to accept losing his wife and newborn child. They’re both fighting it out and it’s gonna be winner takes all.
