A MAN accused of stealing cattle has been found guilty and sentenced. Christopher Nkambule (25) from Lothair near Ermelo, Mpumalanga, pleaded not guilty to charges of stock theft and contempt of court when he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the Ermelo Regional Court today. He told the court he was hired to help move the cattle from Lothair to Amsterdam, and was promised R1 000. “They took me to the cattle kraal at night and showed me the cows that needed to be moved. We agreed and I performed my job,” he told the court. The court heard that he was caught red-handed with allegedly 20 stolen cattle from the farm after the owner discovered that the fence where the cows were being kept was cut off. The incident happened on 12 October 2016 and after accused’s arrest, he was released on bail but he evaded trial. He was re-arrested after three years. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman, Monica Nyuswa, said the accused was 21 years old when he committed the offence and that he was a first-time offender. “He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for stock theft and further suspended sentences of three months wholly suspended, and for five years on condition that he is not convicted on a similar offence during the period of his suspension. The court further declared him unfit to possess a firearm” she said
