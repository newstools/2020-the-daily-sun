A READER wrote to Daily Sunand said she sees snakes chasing her at night. She said the dreams happened every night and she had been having them for the past four months. The reader works as a PA for a well-known company and in her dreams, the snakes even appear in the office and sometimes bites her. She wants to know what the dream means. In this episode, sangoma Nzama Maluleke interprets the dream for the reader. MY SANGOMA RAPED ME! “Snakes represent someone evil to you. It could be someone you know, but you won’t know that they are evil towards you. They’ll be laughing with you, but not wishing you well,” he said. He said the problem may be at work as people could be competing for a position. “Some people may be using muthi to get a position,” he said. “When you dream of snakes, it’s your ancestors warning you. They are showing you that there’s someone doing evil deeds behind your back. You should be watchful.” The sangoma said the reader should consult a traditional healer.
