Joburg’s Emergency spokesman, Robert Mulaudzi called on the residents of the city to be observant of changing weather services and exercise caution. “Residents are urged to be safe, especially the motorists as the conditions will hamper visibility. “Those living in low lying areas mostly those in the informal settlements to be vigilant and avoid crossing flooded bridges,” he said. Mulaudzi told Daily Sun that the cities disaster management service was ready to deal with emergency calls. “We will remain on high alert monitoring all the seven regions of the city for any incident which might occur,” he said. “We also call on the public to avoid forwarding or speeding unverified social media weather messages as that will cause panic,” he added. Malaudzi shared the following tips which can help keep the residents safe ahead of the predicted storms: Recent flash floods which took place in February swept across Soweto and Alexandra forcing residents to evacuate their homes. EMS spokeswomen Nana Radebe said rising levels along the Jukskei river in Setswetla informal settlement had brought much danger to the residents. “Helen Joseph hospital was also affected by the heavy rains as the water crept inside, leaving patients sitting on their beds,” she said in a statement.
