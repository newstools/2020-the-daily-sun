EASTERN Cape cops need people’s help to bust 11 suspects who gang-raped a 17-year-old girl last Friday. Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said: “Cops are urging anyone who may have information that will lead to the arrest of 11 suspects who allegedly raped a 17-year-old at about 10pm at New Homes location in OR Tambo District. “According to information, the victim accompanied her friends who visited her at her place and as she was returning back home, she met four unknown men who grabbed and dragged her to a nearby soccer field, where they all allegedly raped her and left her. “The four suspects were later followed by others in groups of four and three, who continued to rape the victim. “It is however not clear at this stage if these suspects knew each other or had planned this crime together. It is also unknown if they originated from the same location. The investigation is expected to unpack all the truths and motives behind this act.” Meanwhile, provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga has ordered a task team to be set up. Kinana said: “The team is already hard at work to track, trace and arrest the perpetrators of this horrendous crime. “Anyone with information may please contact Detective Sergeant Soyiso Sikhunyana on 079 890 0755 or our Crime Stop Line on 08600 10111.”
