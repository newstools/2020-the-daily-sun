MARITZBURG United are set to keep midfielder Phumlani Ntshangase for next season. The Midlands club is in talks with Ntshangase, who was on loan from the now-defunct Bidvest Wits this past season. Maritzburg needs another anchorman after they parted ways with Miguel Timm, whom Ntshangase was battling for the same position last term. With Timm gone, Ntshangase has been prioritised to be kept permanently and things have been made easier as Wits are no longer part of the PSL, meaning Maritzburg are set to sign him for free. The Team of Choice chairman Farouk Kadodia said the club is close to complete Ntshangase’s deal permanently. “We are having negotiations with Ntshangase to complete his deal and in the 72 hours the deal will be completed,” said Kadodia. The 25-year-old featured in 17 games in all competitions last season, despite suffering an ACL (bad knee injury) in September last year that ruled him out for the rest of the year. Maritzburg recently signed Gabonese midfielder Nathanael Bongo Mbourou, with coach Eric Tinkler insisting that it was important to have two players in each positions for next season.
