A MAN shot in the thigh by a soldier at a shopping complex on Thursday could soon find himself in trouble with the law. According to the arrested soldier, the trouble started when the man from Dendron, Limpopo, attempted to grab his AK47. This came after the soldier asked him why he wasn’t wearing a mask. The 29-year-old soldier was arrested soon after the shooting. He appeared in the Morebeng Magistrates Court on Friday. SANDF spokesman, Captain Jaco Theunissen, said a group of civilians tried to disarm the soldier and during the scuffle, a shot went off and the man was wounded in his right thigh.  Earlier, the police released a statement saying the soldier had spotted a group of people without face masks at a shopping complex in Dendron and a heated argument started when he confronted them. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said there would be harsh action taken against the alleged victim, if it was found that he had in fact tried to grab the soldier’s gun. The wounded man is recovering at Helen Franz Hospital in Bochum. The soldier is facing a charge of attempted murder. The case was postponed to today for a formal bail application.
