TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) players need no motivation going to Sunday’s PSL promotion/relegation play-offs. The three team’s mini-league to complete the 16 Premiership clubs for next season will kick-off on Sunday (3pm). GladAfrica Championship runners-up, Ajax Cape Town, will host TTM, who finished third in the first division standings after being pipped by Swallows FC who got automatic promotion. The match is scheduled for Rand Stadium on Sunday at 3pm. The two GladAfrica sides will be joined by a team that finishes 15th on the Premiership table tomorrow when the season ends. This will be a second season in a row for TTM making a cut for the play-offs. And players have made a pledge they will do whatever it takes to win it this time around. TTM striker, Modibedi Mokoena, said the play-offs will determine their future, so they will go all out. “The club was sold and will be Sekhukhune FC next season, and for us to remain employed we need to win play-offs to Premiership,” said Mokoena. “That will increase our chances of remaining in this team and attracting interest from other clubs. We still don’t know this new management that will be taking over. They might want their own players. So winning promotion to the big league will not only be for the club, but for us as players as well. “We can now see the bigger price – promotion to PSL, and our eyes are fixed on it.” Mokoena’s contract will end after the play-offs.
