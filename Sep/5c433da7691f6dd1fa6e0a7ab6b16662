Orlando Pirates and Adidas have launched their new home and away kits for 2020-21 season. One of the big changes this season is that the Club’s traditional badge has been replaced with the skull and crossbones emblem on both jerseys. The away kit in particular is sure to get fans talking, with its striking orange colourway. It’s the first time in the club’s history this colour is being used, and it’s seen as an expression of confidence and vibrance that reflects the team’s spirit. "Orlando Pirates is a club that stands for innovation and confidence, while staying true to its roots," Bob Maphosa, Sports Marketing Manager for adidas South Africa said. "We focused on bringing unique elements to each kit, such as the iconic skull and crossbones and using orange for the first time in the club's history." ?
