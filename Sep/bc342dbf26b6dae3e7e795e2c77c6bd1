ONE of the country’s most popular junior football tournaments, the Engen Knockout Challenge, is the latest competition to suffer the impact of the coronavirus lockdown. A series of online educational webinars will now start on 23 September. Despite the setback, some high-profile names in the local game, including Premiership trendsetter and Mamelodi Sundowns coach, Pitso Mosimane, will participate. Organisers confirmed that fresh from winning yet another league title with the Brazilians, Mosimane will lead the “Coach the Coach” Masterclasses. The recently won title was his fifth and Sundowns’ 10th. Other individual coaches to participate include Bidvest Wits’ Gavin Hunt, Under-17 Basetsana head coach, Simphiwe Dludlu and head of youth at Ajax Cape Town, Duncan Crowie. Engen ambassadors, Amanda Dlamini, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Stanton Fredricks are also in the mix. “By hosting the webinars, we aim to highlight the infinite career opportunities available within football, outside of being a sportsman,” said Engen brand and sponsorship manager Bulela Mkandawire. “We will also cover topics that will enable players to make informed lifestyle decisions.” The Engen Knockout Challenge has been running for the past 18 years. It is the second high-profile junior tournament to be postponed this year because of lockdown. The Bayhill Premier Cup, hailed as Mzansi’s biggest youth soccer festival, was set for its regular Easter weekend slot but cancelled as the pandemic hit the country. – CAJ News
