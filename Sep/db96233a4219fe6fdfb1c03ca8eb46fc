WOMEN have been embracing their natural hair, leading to a rise in natural hair products. Black women have always found it hard to find products suitable for their hair or hair type and when they decided to make the products themselves, these were well received. Celebrities like Pearl Thusi and Tracee Ellis Ross always rock their own natural hair and also have their own natural hair products. After the recent Clicks scandal around black hair, many black hair brands come forward to show themselves off to the market on social media. 1. Native Child owned by Sonto Pooe is locally produced for black women’s hair.  2. Black Pearl owned by Afro Botanics in partnership with Pearl Thusi has been growing from strength to strength.  3. Earthy is a locally-owned natural hair, body and beard range, and apparently is free of sulfates, parabens, silicones or harsh chemicals and is safe to use on sensitive skin and for kids.  4. Afro Sense was launched to educate girls and women from all backgrounds how to take control of their natural hair. Its products are manufactured for black hair of all textures and curl types.  5. Masodi Organics hair and skin products were inspired by nature’s nourishment, and are made with great attention to detail, from the ingredients chosen to the essential oils used for nutrition and a refreshing fragrance.
