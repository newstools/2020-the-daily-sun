The fight between ANC leaders can be compared to elephants fighting while the grass suffers. When they fight, decisions are made for the wrong reasons. Tasks are unfinished or poorly finished. Group morale is lowered and so on. The people who are supposed to be led and protected suffer. Sometimes leaders get so caught up in their own egos, in their own accomplishments that they fight with others, and their followers suffer. Letter by Motlokoa Pakana Heilbron
