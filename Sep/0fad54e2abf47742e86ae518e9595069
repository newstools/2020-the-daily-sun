THE man accused of stabbing Thato Radebe to death appeared in court yesterday. During the 30-year-old’s appearance in the Moretele Magistrates Court in Hammans­kraal, residents gathered outside to protest. The case was postponed to next Tuesday for further investigation. Thato (22) had returned from a rehabilitation centre when she was stabbed to death, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. She had written in her diary about being abused by her ex-boyfriend, and how she was looking forward to a new life with her new lover. She was killed on Thursday in front of her helpless friends. Thato’s mum, Brenda, said she hoped the case would be resolved quickly so her daughter could get justice. Protesters outside held placards demanding that the suspect be denied bail. Resident Mami Sebola (50) said: “I work with abused women and it seems such cases are on the rise. Harsher punishments will help us to stop this war against women.”
