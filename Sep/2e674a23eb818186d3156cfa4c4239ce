THE fraud case against former Crime Intelligence Divisional commissioner Richard Mdluli, former chief financial officer Solomon Lazarus and Secret Services Agency supply chain manager Heine Barnard has been moved to the North Gauteng High Court. This was said during their brief appearance in the Tshwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court yesterday. They appeared in connection with multiple counts of fraud, corruption, theft and defeating the ends of justice. The matter will be heard on 10 November. Spokeswoman for NPA’s investigating unit, Sindisiwe Twala, said the trio would, for the first time in nine years, face charges relating to the abuse of the police intelligence slush fund. She said this case was initially enrolled in 2011, but struck off as the defence stated that the accused would not have a fair trial. “This was as the result of a lack of access to the then classified Secret Services procurement documents.” Head of the NPA’s investigating arm, Advocate Hermione Cronje, said when she took office in May last year, her team, made up of assigned Hawks investigators, brought up the request for declassification to the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi and national police commissioner, General Kehla Sitole to assist in that regard. “The investigators were frustrated with the long delays. I’m pleased that within seven days from today, the defence will receive those documents in order to prepare for trial,” she said.
