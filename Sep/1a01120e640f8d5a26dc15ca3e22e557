A 28-year-old man who had a drug problem was beaten to death
by angry residents over a pair of shoes he was accused of stealing.  The incident happened in Govan Mbeki kasi in Port Elizabeth on
Monday afternoon.  Simphiwe Mbolekwa (56) said his nephew Unathi Skwevu did not
deserve to be punished like a ruthless criminal.  He told Daily Sun, "The mob took my nephew
and stripped him half naked on the upper body. Then they took turns and beat
him up in a soccer field with sjamboks for a pair of shoes.  "After a while they brought him back home and someone was
carrying the shoes with the plastic. The beating continued my veranda and one of my friends
intervened.  "His body was badly bruised with sjamboks marks on his
upper body and thighs."  Simphiwe said his nephew's death was depressing him.  "I survive by selling booze to my neighbours. But on
Sunday night at about 11pm four armed men robbed me my R7 000. I really don't
know how I am going to bury my nephew because has no parents.  "Yes, he was stealing here and, in the community, due
to his drug problem and I warned him about his mischievous ways. But he did not
deserve to be killed like a rapist or murderer," he said.  Nomaxabiso Windvoel, Unathi's aunt said, "A woman from
next door asked me to keep her shoes on Sunday and will take them on Monday
when she goes to Despatch.  "I did not even look at them. I just said she must drop
them in my room. Now my nephew has been killed for those shoes," she
sobbed.  Captain Andre Beetge said, "Information is being
followed up that he allegedly stole a pair of shoes and was beaten to death by
a number of unknown community members.  "A murder case was opened. Any person with information
that could assist police in this investigation can contact the KwaDwesi
Detectives, Captain Shepard at 071 362 8707. "
