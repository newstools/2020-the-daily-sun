ESKOM has warned residents against illegal electricity connections ekasi after several squatter camps sprout around Cape Town. Shacks have been built around Khayelitsha and other kasis since the beginning of lockdown, and illegal connections have been on the rise. Mcebisi Yaso, the public safety officer at the power supplier, told a group of people in Khayelitsha on Saturday there will be consequences. “When Eskom installs electricity in your house we tend to have a habit of selling electricity to other people. “Worse now there’s land grabs going around here: we connect electricity to other people. Some of these illegal connections are done in an unsafe way posing danger to the public and children.” He warned against people who manipulate the system and get more electricity than they paid for. “We have what we call ghost vending, where a person buys electricity for R300 and get 1000 units. If we happen to find you we’ll disconnect and fine you R6 000,” he warned. Yaso educated the community on what to do in case a person is electrocuted. “When a person is electrocuted, we don’t touch them. We use a plank and remove the connection from his or her hands. “You don’t hit them hard with a plank: remember it must only be used to remove the connection which the victim is holding on to. You must never touch the person because you’ll also get hurt.” Recently, a young girl (8) was electrocuted to death while playing with her sister in Grabouw outside Cape Town due to izinyoka. Residents told Daily Sun the emergence of squatter camps in the past six months was a huge challenge. “Sometimes they disconnect you and connect themselves on a distribution box. Izinyokanyoka are now all over and it’s indeed a danger to our kids,” said Thozama Tom from Makhaza.
