MOQHAKA executive mayor Lucky Phooko has died. A municipality member who wished to remain anonymous said the mayor got weaker and was very ill when he was taken to the hospital. “Sadly, he died today (Monday),” said the staff. Daily Sun called the mayor’s cellphone number and it was answered by a man who identified himself as his driver. The man cried as he explained that the mayor will not be able to ever talk on the phone again. “Eish, he has left us after a short illness. It happened in Viljoenskroon,” he cried. Moqhaka municipal spokesman Dika Kheswa said he could not comment on the matter before they held a meeting with family at 2pm. “Please, call me later and I will be able to comment on the matter.” Free State premier’s office spokesman, Sechaba Maphalla, said: “Our statement will follow later, once municipality and all concerned have confirmed.” Sanco provincial secretary, Bakoena Ramosie, went on Phooko’s Facebook wall and wrote: “Comrades and friends, it is with great loss to inform you of untimely passing of Comrade Lucky Phooko, the current Sanco provincial chairperson and executive mayor of Moqhaka Municipality. Help us pass our condolences to the Phooko family during this difficult time of their loss.” Ramosie told Daily Sun: “Comrade Lucky had long time complications that kept him in and out of hospital for some years now and he continuously defeated death. We are speechless. He left at the time we were working hard towards Uniting Sanco, which currently has challenges. This is the same Sanco myself and him found tearing up in 2011 when we were first elected provincial chairperson and provincial secretary respectively. The great work we did together propelled our re-election in the same positions in 2016.
