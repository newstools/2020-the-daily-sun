AFTER a lot of bloodshed over the weekend in KZN, the police minister is expected to visit the area. A total of nine people were shot dead in KwaNdengezi, west of Durban, on Saturday in separate incidents. Five people tragically died when a total of six people were shot at Zwelibomvu. The people who got shot were accompanying a friend when the shooting took place. Among the dead were two teachers. It’s alleged the dead were stopped by men who’d covered their faces. Apparently, the men asked them for guns. They then asked them to get out of their car and lie down. While on the ground they fired shots at them. They then stole their cellphones and escaped. Meanwhile, four other people were shot on the same day at Zwelibomvu. It’s alleged the men, suspected of stealing livestock, died in a hail of bullets. Residents were pleased following the death of these men aged between 17 and 21. Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the deaths. Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit the area and families of the dead people. Cele is expected to shed more light on the murders and meet with the family.
