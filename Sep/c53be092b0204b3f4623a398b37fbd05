A TODDLER is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering severe burn wounds. The little boy from Pietermaritzburg allegedly had boiling water thrown on him by his uncle. The uncle apparently burnt the 17-month-old child on Sunday after getting into a heated argument with his sister, the boy’s mum. ALSO READ:COPS WHO KILLED TEEN DENIED BAIL! The child was admitted to Northdale Hospital with third degree burns. It’s alleged the family tried to keep the incident secret, but the social development department found out and intervened. The mother told Daily Sun: “Yes, my baby was burnt, but I don’t want to talk about the incident at the moment. My baby is still in hospital and in so much pain.” She didn’t want to talk about the matter as it would cause more trouble for her family. Social development spokesman Mhlaba Memela said MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza condemned the incident. Memela said a horrific photo of the child’s wounds was circulating on social media networks. “The incident of aggravated child abuse is very disturbing and has caused bodily harm to a child,” said Memela. “The person responsible for the incident must be arrested and prosecuted, including those who tried to cover up the matter.” He said the child’s mum was receiving counselling.
