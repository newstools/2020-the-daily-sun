TEACHERS are still in shock that a colleague allegedly
murdered Hlengiwe Ndaba. The 35-yeart-old teacher from Estcourt, KZN, was eight
months pregnant when her burnt body was found in her car in July. Teachers at Phasiwe Primary School in Mqendandaba were
devastated by the incident as both Hlengiwe and the accused were colleagues. A
teacher, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun when they first heard about
the murder, they didn’t suspect one of them was the culprit. “We thought it was just evil thugs who did this When our
colleague was arrested, we couldn’t believe it,” she said. Another teacher said the accused and Hlengiwe got on well
but were not friends. “Hlengiwe was a person who got along with everyone. She was
very calm and down to earth,” said the teacher. The teacher said there were two different rumours about the
murder going around. “We heard before Hlengiwe was killed, her stomach was cut
open and her baby was taken out. Apparently, they wanted the unborn child’s
body parts for muthi,” she said. “The other story is that Hlengiwe was killed as the accused
wanted to take over her class. The arrested teacher started at the school last year, so she
was not yet permanently employed.” SGB secretary Zandile Shabangu said the parents were very
sad about Hlengiwe’s murder. “She was a great grade 4 teacher to our children. We were
all happy with her work,” she said. Zandile said she didn’t know much about the accused’s
involvement in the murder. “I know they were not enemies and got along fine. In fact,
Hlengiwe got on with all the teachers at the school,” she said. Hlengiwe’s 37-year-old colleague and a 46-year-old man were
arrested for the murder. They appeared in the Colenso Magistrates Court last
week and abandoned their bail application.
