UNEMPLOYED youth have closed the newly-renovated Motherwell Shopping Centre, demanding new shops to employ locals as they claimed they’ve been promised job opportunities before the centre opened last Thursday. This morning, all shops were closed while gatvol youth demonstrated and threatened to stop the mall from operating if their demands weren’t met. Gcobisa Bambiso said: “During the construction of the new shops, we were told residents from ward 58 would benefit. We are demanding 30% employment, because we submitted CVs but to our surprise, most of the people working at the different shops are outsiders. “We want local residents, especially unemployed youth, to be beneficiaries of the project. This thing of employing outsiders has been happening since the centre was officially opened in 1997,” said Gcobisa. Nolokhanyo Sontsonga said: “There are a lot of qualified, unemployed youth in ward 58 struggling to find jobs. The shopping centre is in our ward. We’re supposed to be considered first when there are jobs.” Capital land Properties Marketing manager Robyn Gedrych said: “I’m not authorised to speak to the media about this issue,” and then asked Daily Sun to email her questions. She has not yet responded after numerous calls.
