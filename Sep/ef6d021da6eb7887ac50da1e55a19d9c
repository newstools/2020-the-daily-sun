Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang vowed to become an Arsenal "legend" as the Gunners captain ended speculation over his future by signing a new three-year contract on Tuesday. Aubameyang's contract saga had dragged on since last season amid speculation he wanted to join a club in the Champions League. But the Gabon forward revealed he had committed his future to Arsenal in a live Instagram stream from the Emirates Stadium. The deal is reported to be worth £250 000-per-week, with bonuses that could take it beyond £350 000-per-week contract of the club's highest earner Mesut Ozil. "Arsenal fans, finally as you know I just signed the thing," Aubameyang said. This is where you belong, Auba ???? @Aubameyang7 pic.twitter.com/sgViWSBYWf
