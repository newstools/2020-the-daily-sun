This was the weekend which virgins from all over Mzansi were supposed to make their way to Enyokeni, KwaNongoma in KZN for a reed dance. But they couldn’t because of Covid-19, only a few maidens were allowed to go there. However, virgins in Soweto under Intuthuko yezintobi didn’t let that deprive them of their chance to celebrate taking good care of themselves. They marched on the streets of the kasi singing and dancing.They had placards with the message that gender based violence must end.  Mamchunu told Daily Sun: “Gender based violence was this year’s slogan. Had we gone to Enyokeni that was going to be the main message.” She said virginity testing schools were important to girls because they were taught a lot there. “We do not only test them but we teach them other things like respect.”  She said the reason there was a lot of gender based violence was because boys were not taught at the early age to respect women. “It’s about time men start teaching boys to respect women. They must have schools where the focus is only on respecting women.” Nomaswazi said she joined izintombi when she was 14. “I want to remain pure until marriage. This will help me be safe from many things like teenage pregnancy and diseases.”  Unathi Nkabinde (16) said peer pressure made her join izintombi. “My friends had already joined and they always bragged about it. I followed them and I liked it. I don’t want to disappoint izintombi now that I am part of them.” Mamchunu said if one girl had broken her vows and ended up sleeping with a boy, that boy has to give a goat to cleanse the girls.“That’s bad luck for all the girl who go to the same school with that girl and it must be cleansed by slaughtering a goat,” she said.
