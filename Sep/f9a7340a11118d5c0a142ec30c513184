Although level 5 and 3 of lockdown were the most difficult to all of us, we can benefit a lot from self-imposed isolation like that in future. We can have a one-week lockdown and see how it works. During lockdown period, rivers and oceans will clean themselves up because of less contamination. The air will also become cleaner because of less pollution. There will be a decline in theft, murder and road accidents. Those who have forsaken God because of their endless troubles will be in a good space to reunite with Him and seek divine intervention through prayer. The earth will have the occasional rest when we are locked down in our homes. People’s hearts will also transform. We will get the opportunity to bond and rejoice with our families. Lockdown presents a rare opportunity for families to pray together. There’s also much time to meditate. Lockdown days can bring spiritual liberation to our souls, our society and the world. - Letter by SP Moffat, Mamelodi East
