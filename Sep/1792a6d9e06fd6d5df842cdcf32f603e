THE sentencing of a former Ninnies Neurons Creche employee has been postponed. This comes after the defence failed to appear in court due to being in self-isolation. This wasn’t communicated with all the relevant parties, who weren’t pleased. Nellie Senwametsi was convicted on two counts of common assault and one count of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm against three children aged four. The organisation Women and Men Against Child Abuse called for a minimum sentence of 10 years. Its advocacy manager, Luke Lamprecht, said he wasn’t happy the matter had been postponed. “There was no communication that the defence isn’t well.  “It could have saved the parents and supporters the trouble of coming here. “It’s about time this case is finalised because the longer it drags the harder it becomes for all parties involved.” He said culprits should be held accountable for their actions, so they learn valuable lessons. “The child could become slow at school and even struggle with behavioural issues,” he said.  “Hence we had to bring a child psychologist on board to make sure the victims get the help they need.” Lamprecht said Senwametsi’s actions would have a lasting physiological and psychological impact on the children. “In one of the videos, the young boys’ lack of crying and emotional response as he is being hit shows the emotional trauma of abuse on a developing child. “We’ll not be happy with anything that deviates from the minimum sentence of 10 years.” Sentencing will resume on 16 and 17 September.
