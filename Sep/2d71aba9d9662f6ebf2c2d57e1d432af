WOMEN’S Month ended on a sad note for the Mudau family. Grace Mudau (22) from Ha-Mutsha Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, was assaulted and stabbed to death on Saturday night, allegedly by her baby daddy. The young mother’s body was found lying half-naked in a pool of blood. She had apparently left the suspect and found a new boyfriend. Her mum Doreen Kgaudi (51) said Grace had told her that her ex started a fight when he saw her with her new lover at a tavern. He pulled out a knife and Grace was hurt in the commotion. “On Saturday morning, she used my phone to call the police,” she said. “They came and helped her open an assault case. “Later, she left to go to Tshilidzini Hospital as she had bad bruises on her neck and needed a medical report.” The last time Grace saw her family was when she left for the hospital. It’s believed she was stopped on her way by the ex-boyfriend. Doreen told Daily Sun: “I became worried when it got late and she hadn’t come back. I called her phone and another girl answered. “I asked around and was told she’d been seen with the monster ex-boyfriend. He was beating her up. “I called her dad and we rushed there, but it was too late. She was lying in a pool of blood in the yard of the suspect’s father’s home.” Grace’s dad, Colbert Mudau, (70) said he didn’t know the ex-boyfriend had threatened her. “I’d have gone to his family to report him. I’m very sad I failed my daughter against her killer,” he said. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspect was charged with murder and would appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court today.
