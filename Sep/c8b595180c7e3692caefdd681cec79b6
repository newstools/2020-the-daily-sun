She told the Sunday paper she was very excited and couldn’t wait for her and her unborn baby to sing their way to the top during the rest of the live performances. Although she was excited, Jerodine told the paper she had mixed emotions about viewers finding out about her pregnancy as some would assume she was only picked for the top 16 because she’s preggies. “Regardless of what people are yet to say when they realise I’m pregnant on stage, I’m still excited to be bearing this child and going through this moment knowing I’m fighting for two things at once: my baby’s life and a brighter future for all of us. “I’ve been granted a chance to continue performing and I’ll use it to my advantage. I’m ready to conquer. I want God to take control,” she said.
