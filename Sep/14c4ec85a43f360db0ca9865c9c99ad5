NATASHA Tsichlas has refused to take over the Safa vice-president post after she was unanimously vited for the vacant post on Saturday. This in her quest for axed Ria Ledwaba to return to the position where she felt was removed unfairly and took the association the legal route as she fights for her post back. "After I served on the 2010 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee as a Board member, I convinced the NEC to bring Ria back to football in 2013. I am happy that I could convince the NEC then and express my appreciation to the NEC to agree to withdraw from the arbitration and to reinstate Ledwaba," said Tsichlas. "As a business woman, I always believed that the money in football must be used to promote the development of football. I therefore requested a consultation on the matter. This consultation with the members of NEC who were present in the meeting on Saturday, took place on Monday." A group of Ledwaba supporters toyi-toyed outside Safa House at the weekend while the association's NEC was underway in demostration of her dismissal. A statement from Safa says that Tsichlas, the former Mamelodi Sundowns boss, one of the longest serving woman football administrators, immediately shared her concerns on Saturday on why she cannot take up the seat. Safa CEO, Advocate Tebogo Motlanthe said: “Safa is happy to endorse the presentation of Tsichlas and to support it from one of our selfless women leaders who offered to step back from the Vice President post for Ledwaba to return. “We want to reiterate that this must not be viewed as condonation of wrong-doing but a response from an internationally recognized woman leader in football. "We further agreed that the money that would have been spent on legal costs is better served to provide our 52 Regions with financial support to further football development.”
