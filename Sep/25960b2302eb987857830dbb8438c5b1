FILM and TV graduate Lesego Ndaba from Rustenburg has transformed her love for make-up into a successful business. The 21-year-old says: “Don’t be afraid to explore and reach out to people who’ve done something entrepreneurial. That’s the best way for you to learn if this is the lifestyle for you”. Lesego, whose passion for make-up started long ago, took make-up courses after graduating because finding a job was a struggle. “My goal was to work behind the scenes in films and TV. However, life doesn’t always go according to our time frame. As I was still working on achieving my dreams, I decided to take it upon myself to better my craft. “I do faces for different occasions. Building my brand is my main focus at the moment.The only challenge so far was getting my name out there. For customers to spend their money on your brand, they need to trust you. As a new brand, it’s a challenge,” she said. “No matter how talented one can be, it is important to educate yourself in whatever you do. Knowledge paved the way for me, while my passion was always the guiding light into entrepreneurship.” The talented make-up artist said there were totally amazing makeup artists out there, and everybody should pull inspiration from those people they admire. “Finding what works for you is what’s going to separate you from every other thing people have seen over and over again. It is very important for us as black women to start doing our own thing, creating our own businesses our own way,” said Lesego.
