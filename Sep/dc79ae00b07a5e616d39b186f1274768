What a sweet tongue our president has, especially when addressing his ANC comrades about PPE debauchery. No single race group in South Africa loves this country more yet none is more jealous of black people’s economic advancement than the Afrikaner. As much as apartheid was pure evil, the National Party didn’t treat the country and its citizenry like a village whore as ANC members have been doing for quite a while now. That is, deriving pleasure from something or someone it has no respect, let alone love for. The least said about the likes of the EFF, AfriForum, BLF and MKMVA the better. They’re disgruntled and rowdy agitators fighting for fame and relevance that would have looted the same had they been in the same exalted position of our self-indulgent ruling party. - Letter by Luyanda kama KwaDwesi
