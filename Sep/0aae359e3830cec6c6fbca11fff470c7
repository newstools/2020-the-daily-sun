My soul has been tormented by the vicious cycle of so-called fathers who impregnate their own daughters. How on earth does a man with paternal instincts find satisfaction from sleeping with his child? How do we have pride in having such fathers? My heart cries out for any girl who experiences such brutality. Do such fathers deserve have their own special day called National Menâ€™s Day devoted to them?
