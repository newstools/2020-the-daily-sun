VETERAN goalkeeper, Tapuwa Kapini, is disappointed that he was dumped by Highlands Park’s new boss Tim Sukazi without being given a chance to impress coach Dan Malesela. The 36-year-old was told on Monday that his services were no longer needed together with Musa Nyatama, Limbikani Mzava, Sabelo Nyembe, Sello Motsepe, Makhehlene Makhaula, Jerry Msane and Thabo Motlafi. Sukazi bought Highlands, but the sale was rejected due to section 112 of the Companies Act where there’s a disagreement with minority shareholder Sinky Mnisi. But the deal will go through once Mnisi acknowledges the sale. “It’s always difficult as a player when you are told that umsebenzi u phelile (you no longer have a job) because we want to play football. They gave us two days (to impress) and what can you do when you are not in the coach’s plans? I am disappointed, but I will find another job.” Kapini said he won’t hold any grudges against Sukazi or Malesela for taking away his livelihood. “I have been with the club for a long time (six years) and I was their captain. “They should have told me what is the problem. We were all in that meeting together with Musa and Limbikani. They should have said ‘guys, this is the situation’. But the coach was not even there to tell us. “I am confident that I will find another job. God makes miracles, when one door close, another one opens. I am disappointed that I won’t play for TS Galaxy, but I am not angry. Maybe he felt that I am old or earning too much, even though I believe I’m getting paid less. This is something that I cannot control.” Kapini feels pity for youngsters like Motlafi, who were starting to adapt to Highlands coach Owen Da Gama’s style of play. “He got promoted, had an injury and when he was now enjoying his come back then directors dent his dream,” said Kapini. He will now focus on his car repair business in Kempton Park to make a living while searching for another club.
