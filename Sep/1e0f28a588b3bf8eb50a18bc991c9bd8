SOCIAL grant applicants can now apply for certain social grants online. Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said at this stage, the pilot project covers child support, older persons, and foster child grants. Applications can be made on the secure website https://services.sassa.gov.za. “After reviewing the system, other grants will also be added to the portal. This should be a relief to grant applicants, as it will save them the inconvenience of standing in queues at Sassa offices to apply for their grants.” He said with online applications, there’s no risk of being infected with Covid-19, as there’s no gathering at public places to apply. “This self-service will be possible on both a computer and a mobile phone. The turnaround time is 10 days, provided the applicant supplies all stipulated documents such as identity documents of applicant and spouse, as well as banking details among others.” Letsatsi said online submission required supporting documentation linked to the application, change of circumstances like payment method, banking details, or address and status of application. He said to access the service, applicants need to have an email address to sign up and log in for further services. “Feedback will be sent through SMS notification to applicants with no email addresses, and an email response will be sent to applicants choosing to be contacted by email. A receipt will be generated when the application is completed.” He also said attached supporting documents must be certified by a commissioner of oaths.
