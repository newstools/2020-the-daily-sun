  National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the case at the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court would be held on Monday.  The group were arrested on Thursday during four days of protests over a TRESemme advertisement, which depicted a black woman's hair as "damaged" and a white woman's hair as "normal".  Clicks apologised, and said it would take action against staff members involved. It removed the advertisement and conceded it was racist.   EFF provincial chairperson Melikhaya Xego complained about the timing of the verification of the accused's addresses for the purposes of their bail application. "They only started today," charged Xego. Western Cape police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said on Thursday the 16 were arrested for the alleged contravention of a court order. Clicks applied on Monday for an order to prevent the planned protests, but were dismissed with costs. They made a second bid and were granted an order prohibiting the intimidation and harassment of staff and shoppers.  News24
