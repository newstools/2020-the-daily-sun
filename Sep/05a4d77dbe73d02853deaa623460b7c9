BAROKA coach Dylan Kerr knows nothing less than three points against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday will be good enough to secure their Absa Premiership survival. Bakgaga suffered a devastating 4-1 loss to SuperSport United in their penultimate league clash on Wednesday. Evidence Makgopa scored the opening goal at the Bidvest Stadium on seven minutes, ahead of a 26th minute equaliser from Thamsanqa Gabuza. Nhlanhla Mgaga was then dismissed for Kerr's side, leading to a one-sided second half, as Grant Kekana (63'), Bradley Grobler (70') and Kudakwashe Mahachi (75') all found the back of the net for Matsatsantsa. Speaking to SuperSport TV after the game, the Baroka boss said: "It is the big one. It is all to play for now. "We managed to keep them at bay, but when they got the equaliser, you know, it's a poor (piece of defending). "We worked on it, we went through video analysis of their set-pieces with a five-tooth comb and they forgot their jobs today. "We worked hard to ensure that we don't concede from free-kicks and corners, but we do, we conceded all four goals from set-pieces. "A win for Baroka should secure the club's place in the relegation play-offs, while Chiefs need a win to secure their first league title since 2015. TeamTalk
