AMAZULU look set to appoint Ayanda Dlamini as the club’s head coach for next season. According to AmaZulu media officer, Brilliant Mkhathini, Usuthu will hold a virtual press conference which will be headed by the club’s general manager, Lunga Sokhela. The conference is expected to address Usuthu's head coaching matter. This comes after Dlamini, who was named as a caretaker coach of the club late in February alongside veteran goalkeeper Moeneb Josephs, saved Usuthu’s PSL status this past weekend. “We are having a virtual press conference tomorrow,” Mkhathini said without giving much detail. Dlamini, who was coaching the club‘s Reserve League, was appointed as interim coach after Slovakia-born coach Jozef Vukusic was suspended following a defeat to Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in February. After the club completed its own internal investigation of what happened in Port Elizabeth, Vukusic was found guilty and was sacked on 20 August after the season had restarted in a bio bubble in Gauteng. Dlamini, with the pressure firmly on his side, was able to navigate the tough task to see Usuthu finish13th in the Absa Premiership with 30 points from as many games. The club’s former striker had already impressed the management. His first game in charge was against then log leaders Kaizer Chiefs in March before the season was suspended. In a match Usthu were not expected to win as they were at the bottom of the log, the KZN side stunned Amakhosi 1-0 at FNB Stadium. It was Usuthu’s first league win over Amakhosi in 13 years. When the season resumed last month, Dlamini’s side won once, lost once and drew four in six matches in the bubble. That was enough to see them retain their Absa Premiership status.
