BIDVEST Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo says it was sad to play their match in the club's history at the weekend. The club has been bought by Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila boss Masala Mulaudzi who will now relocate the club to Venda. Wits ceased to exist on Saturday following an incredible 3-1 thrashing of relegated Polokwane City at FNB Stadium. Hlatshwayo, who is expected to be unveiled by Soweto giants Orlando Pirates says this was an emotional farewell to the side he led for six years. Said Hlatshwayo: “It’s a sad feeling for guys to play our last game. There was a lot of emotions around everyone. I have been here for six years and I have not been in good space (since Saturday). I am happy that I have to take my mind off football, just to be in good space.” Hlatshwayo says they gave their best under the difficult circumstances to bow out on a high note. The Clever Boys ended their 99 years existence in fourth position, tied on 52 points with Orlando Pirates who finished third by virtue of a better goal difference. “We wanted to finish strong, you could see the way we played that we never gave up. I spoke to the guys that we need to appreciate what Wits have done for us. It was not easy to motivate guys who knew Wits won’t be there. I told them to put effort because other teams will be watching them.” Hlatshwayo also hailed coach Gavin Hunt who installed a winning mentality in the team. Hunt is currently jobless since Masala said they cannot afford his salary. “He is a coach with lot of character, toughness and hard to impress. He pushed us to finish as high as possible. We would have liked to win the Nedbank Cup for the team that has been good to me. We only lost two games in the bubble and we wanted to put new owners in Caf competition, that’s what we joked about.”
