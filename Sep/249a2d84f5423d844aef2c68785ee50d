House musician R.Les takes Mzansi’s people through the important things to remember during the pandemic with his new singles. R.Les, whose real name is Lesley Ratsatsi, released Maphodisa and Stay Safe two weeks ago. Speaking to SunBuzz, the musician from Polokwane in Limpopo, said he felt he needed to help educate people. “Stay Safe was just advising people to be cautious. “I gave them advice on how to take care of themselves,” said R.Les. He said he wrote his second single, Maphodisa, because people didn’t respect cops when they were trying to enforce the law. “My plea is that we should respect them and let them do their jobs.” He said his love of music was instilled by his mum. “My mother would always tell me that I was talented and wished that I’d go far with my singing.” R.Les said he is working on his debut album. “At the moment I’m working on my debut album. “It will be a mix of house, gqom and amapiano music. “I produce and do everything myself, so I promise to make great music,” said R.Les.
