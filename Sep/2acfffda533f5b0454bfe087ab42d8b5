SHE might be the oldest person in Mzansi, but gogo Elizabeth Setshedi still knits clothes and traditional carpets. The 117-year-old from Slagboom in Moretele, North West, said she has lived her life to the full, but she has one dream that still needs to come true: she wants to meet President Cyril Ramaphosa. The gogo said she wanted to ask the president to drill her a borehole and build her a house, so she could die peacefully. The gogo has 12 children, 52 grandchildren, 90 great-grandkids and 40 great-great-grandchildren. Gogo Elizabeth told the SunTeam she woke up at 3am every day to pray. She said her favourite food was amasi, pap and vegetables and in her free time, she liked to knit. She likes Coke and fresh milk.  “I feel happy that God has kept me alive until this time. My secret is to love and fear God with all my heart and soul,” she said. “The other secret is to respect the elders and people in your community.” The gogo, who was born in Nylstroom in Limpopo, said these days, children were disrespectful to elders. Elizabeth’s daughter, Bertha, (76) said her mum taught her to respect all people.  Granddaughter Francinah Setshedi (45) said: “I’m proud of how she raised me.” Sanco member Winnie Sono said it was an honour to live among elders such as gogo Elizabeth. Local MK Veterans’ Association secretary, Moss Moyo, said they hoped the gogo would get to meet the president. Daily Sun contacted acting spokesman in the presidency Tyrone Seale, who said he would respond this week.
