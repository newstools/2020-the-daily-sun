TWO suspects bust on murder charges will remain in police custody until Monday pending their formal bail hearing. The two aged 26 and 28 appeared before Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Friday. There were charged with murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances after allegedly murdering gogo Selina Mkhonto (90) and robbing another woman of her cellphone on 5 September. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police in Calcutta were investigating a case of murder after gogo Selina was found killed at her homestead in Lillydale Village after the suspects broke the main door where the deceased was sleeping alone. “A manhunt was launched for the suspects and with the help of community members, one suspect was caught after he allegedly robbed another victim of her cellphone in the bushes, where he then fled to Kildare Village to hide. He went to a homestead where they sell traditional beer and asked another woman to install Facebook for him on the stolen cellphone, but the woman reportedly searched the phone, where she discovered it had her sister’s picture and alerted her brother-in-law, who confirmed the sister was robbed by unknown suspects. “He was taken to the village induna, where he confessed he was running from the community after he killed a woman together with his friends and they wanted to robbed the deceased of her grant money.” Hlathi said both suspects were bust after police rescued them from an angry mob and charged them with murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. They have appeared in Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court and were kept in custody pending the formal bail hearing on Monday.
