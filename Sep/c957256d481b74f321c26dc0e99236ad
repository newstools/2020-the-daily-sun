JOBURG Metro cops and the City of Joburg yesterday remembered cops who’d died in the line of duty. Metro police spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun his department ended Women’s Month with a wreath-laying ceremony. This was for the seven female Metro cops who died on the job since the department was established. He said two of them were killed by motorists who were driving recklessly. “They were directing traffic in the morning when these irresponsible drivers ended their lives. “They had to pay the highest price while serving the community.” He said two were shot, another one was run over by a bike, one was in an accident, and another one was attacked from behind. “There are ongoing plans to keep female officers safe,” he said. “Right now we make certain no female officer is on duty by herself. There must be three or more officers to back them up.” Siphiwe Faku (37), the cousin of dead officer Noluthando Mboneni, was happy to celebrate her life as that was what she’d have wanted. “Dwelling on the past won’t help us. “All we can do now is remember the great law enforcer she was.” Public safety MMC Mally Mokoena said reckless drivers should be charged with murder and not culpable homicide. Mokoena said it made her angry to see people sentenced to 10 years and leave prison after two. “Families lose loved ones while those people are out living their best lives,” she said. She said police were working overtime to end abuse.
