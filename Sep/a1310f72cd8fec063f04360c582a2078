A BOOZER has been arrested following a random shooting! Residents have helped police arrest the 40-year-old man for attempted murder at the Amsterdam Flats in Joburg. Joburg Central police spokesman, Captain Xoli Mbele, told Daily Sun the suspect allegedly shot four people. “Three victims were shot in the lower body and one was shot in the upper and lower body,” said Mbele. He said the suspect was holding a beer bottle in his hand when he started shooting at random. The victims were taken to hospital, where two were treated and discharged on the same day. “The motive for the shooting isn’t yet known. A firearm used in the commission of the crime and live ammunition were recovered,” said Mbele. “It will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain if it was used in the commission of other serious and violent crimes.” Investigations are under way and the suspect will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court soon.
