AS HE was a taxi boss, people just assumed he died as a result of taxi violence. But Menzi Mcunu died after a short illness. He was the father of media personalities Khanyi Mbau and Lasizwe Dambuza. He died on Sunday. Speaking to Daily Sun at Menzi’s home in Meredale, south of Joburg, his friend Ndumiso Shezi said Menzi fell down the stairs, but didn’t pay much attention to it. He later went to the hospital for pains, but never made it back home. “We are all shattered. His wife, children and workers are not taking this well,” said Ndumiso. He said Menzi was passionate about business and never hesitated to mentor anyone. “I met him through his younger brother, who was my friend. But we ended up becoming very close. He even helped me get my first job at a local radio station and supported me when I started my businesses,” he said. Ndumiso said Menzi’s wife was strong for now. “She’s keeping strong because funeral arrangements need to be made. “But she would need professional help after the funeral,” he said. “Menzi’s children are shattered because he was hands on and made sure they all got an education. “He sent them to the best schools. He wanted them to be independent and be greater than him. I hope they hold on to that spirit,” said Ndumiso. Menzi’s memorial service will be held at his home tomorrow, while his funeral will be on Friday.
