 FORMER
crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli will be heading to the Supreme Court of
Appeal in Bloemfontein to appeal his five year sentence handed down by the
South Gauteng High earlier today.  Mdluli and
co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi's leave to appeal was also denied, leaving him
with the Supreme Court of Appeal as the only option.  Giving his
reaction to the sentence, he said "I've said initially that I respect the
law, I do respect what the judge has done l, but as I've indicated that I've
got every right to go to any court, we will petition the Supreme Court of
Appeal.  "We
are aware that there were a lot of gaps that were supported and filled in court.  "My
lawyer will start working on it from tomorrow, he will also try to apply for
bail in the meantime pending the appeal because here it was refused."  When asked
about spending the first night in prison, Mdluli said, "Even president
Mandela went to prison, I'm not a unique person I'm an ordinary person of South
Africa, whatever happened to somebody else can happen to me.  "If a
person like president Mandela was taken to prison for an offence he never
committed, the same can apply to me, I'm not better off than him.  The family
of Oupa Ramogibe, was married to Mdluliâ€™s former lover Tshidi Buthelezi, said
they were happy about the sentence, but were sad that no one was accountable
for his death.   Judge Ratha
Mokgoatlheng sentenced the pair to three years imprisonment for two counts of
kidnapping, two counts of assault against which will run concurrently. That was
for kidnapping and assaulting Oupa and Alice Manana who was Tshidi's friend.  They were
further sentenced to one year imprisonment and two years of assault with intent
to do grievous bodily harm, which in total adds up to 5 years in prison.
