So, what I’m about to share with you all is the Absolute truth. I once met this beautiful woman who made my heart touch the SKY like Dennis Ferrer. We met at corner Smirnoff and Cîroc and her first utterance was that she was a Russian Bear. Her Russian persona really turned me on and in exchange, I also admitted to her that I was also a bit of a Grey-Goose type of guy. As you would’ve read, I’m a huge vodka fan and word has it that: “A shot a day can keep the doctor away.” Now according to health experts, vodka has a lot of health benefits which can benefit your relationships. Just as you thought that wine is the ultimate drink for lovers, vodka has its own case to plead. So here are some reasons why vodka should be on your #CoupleGoals: 1. Good for your hair and skin According to hair experts, alcohol is a key ingredient found in acne or sensitive skin products. So, it comes as no surprise that vodka can do a lot more than what those expensive products can do. Vodka contains astringent properties that can help clean up clogged-up skin whilst also assist with hair growth. Now who said you can’t sip to look good for bae? 2. Relieves stress Unlike other alcoholic beverages, vodka has less calorie content which science agrees to contributing to less stress. It also has sleep inducing properties which help with sleep, and also help one relax during bedroom activities. 3. Good for your heart Relationships can toil one’s heart, but it’s comforting to know that you have vodka on your side in times of heartache. Vodka increases blood flow which then reduces clots which causes strokes and heart disease.
