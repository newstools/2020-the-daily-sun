THREE Bloemfontein hospital staff have taken the Jerusalema challenge dance. The three viral videos show staff from Bloemfontein’s Pelonomi, National and Universitas hospitals dancing to the famous song. The provincial health department said it supported any method that would help inspire frontliners. Some staff said they had fun and for a while had forgotten about sad scenes they see almost daily. A staff who wished to remain anonymous said: “We have been witnessing the deaths of patients due to Covid-19. “I’ve seen the struggle the patients go through when they struggle to breath for the virus. “It’s so disturbing when I realise many are still not taking the virus seriously. “But it also saddens me to see poor patients suffer. It takes one’s morale and it’s easy for a professional to lose hope. “I’ve seen my colleagues crying in the corridors. We needed something to uplift our spirit and Jerusalema did help us. We had fun and it reminded us we’re also human.  “That’s a great son, indeed. I laughed seeing some of my colleagues dancing the wrong way and I enjoyed seeing others doing it nicely.” Free State health spokesman told Daily Sun: “The department has supported the initiatives by its health workers. “This inspirational dance started with Universitas Academic Hospital staff, followed by Pelonomi Tertiary Hospital and National District Hospital as recently as Friday 28 August.  “Our intention is to improve morale to inspire hope and create an environment of possitivity among personnel.” Health MEC Montseng Tsiu said: “We’re glad our officials have taken this initiative voluntarily, so that it adds to the psychosocial support that we provide.”
