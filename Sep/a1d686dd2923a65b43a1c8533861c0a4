M-NET’s much-anticipated telenovela, Legacy, will premier tonight, marking veteran actress Michelle Botes’ return to the small screen. After leaving Isidingo in 2007, she joined M-Net’s Binnelanders in 2010. In an interview with YOU magazine, the actress said she didn’t want to act for a long time after Isidingo. “I was a bit burnt out and the next thing for me was not to act any part. That was my challenge after being in so many parts,” she said. She said when she was away from the limelight she travelled in an effort to find herself.
