THE KFC robbery at 2am today at Thulamahashe Plaza near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga was like a scene from a movie. There was drama after the gang of over 12 thugs surrounded the shop, firing shots in the air, shattering the side door and windows and then gained entry. Guards on patrol had to run for dear life, but called the cops. “We were patrolling the section of the plaza, but went cold when we were suddenly approached by a gang of men with guns coming from all directions, so fast they surrounded the shop. We ran for cover. They broke the windows and doors and others forced their way into the shop. We heard a loud explosion inside, and the ground was shaking. Police arrived in numbers, but the gang ran out and regrouped and started fighting with the police, before they lost the battle and ran away.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “Police are looking for suspects who bombed the safe early today. Suspects broke a side door to gain entry. They proceeded to the safe room, where they bombed it. “Security managed to call the police. The suspects opened fire at the police and they retaliated, but no one was injured and no money was taken. “ A case of business burglary and safe bombing is under investigation. Anyone with information can call Mhala Police on 013 773 0331, or Captain Malamba Khosa on 072 624 5133
