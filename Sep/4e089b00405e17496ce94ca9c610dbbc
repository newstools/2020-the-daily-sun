CAPE Town City defender, Abbubaker Mobara, says the bio-bubble has helped get the best out of players to ensure the team finish the season in a respectable position. “The bubble has been amazing among players,” explained Mobara “This bubble brought a lot of individual brilliance of a lot of players in our team. We are in the bubble for a reason; to execute our plan and go home with a smile.” Mobara revealed that he played a crucial role to help players such as Taariq Fielies excel in the team. “This bubble gave me a lot of hope and with experience, it was a lot easier for me. “Fielies is a top player and sometimes we had to admire his brilliance and add my little value to help him grow as a player,” said Mobara. The former Orlando Pirates defender said he has also had the opportunity to know his teammates better, on and off the pitch. “The bubble gave us time to know each other. I played with Tara (Duka-Tara Ebbi) before but over the years, we lost track when he went his way and I took mine. Finally we met again.” Mobara joined The Citizens in June last year after being recruited by then coach Benni McCarthy. The 26-year-old made his professional debut with Ajax Cape Town in 2013, and had three great seasons winning the MTN8 Cup.
