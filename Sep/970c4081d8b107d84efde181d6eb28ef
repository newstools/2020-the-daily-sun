BANYANA Banyana trio Rhoda Mulaudzi, Lebogang Ramalepe and Bambanani Mbane were crowned Belarusian Women's Cup champions on Monday. This after they helped their side Dinamo-BSUPC beat Minsk 5-4 on penalties to win the club's maiden trophy. They now enter the club's history books as part of the first team that lifted the trophy for the first time, more impressively over the holders Minsk. Mbane joined the Belarusian outfitÂ in April 2020 before the arrival of compatriots Mulaudzi and Ramalepe in July. Ramalepe started the match while Mulaudzi was a second half substitute. Nevertheless, the Mzansi trio will now be hoping to complete with their Belarusian side. Dinamo are nine-points clear at the top of the standings with six games to go. Dimano! Dinamo! Dinamo!????#Womensfootball @PUMASouthAfrica @pumafootball pic.twitter.com/BgMQbXP7ck We did it!!!??????#Womensfootball pic.twitter.com/XrKCtMokYb
