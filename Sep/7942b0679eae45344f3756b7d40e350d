ALL grades of fuel will be cheaper in October. Commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, the Automobile Association (AA) said petrol is set to drop by 24 cents for 93 unleaded and 33 cents for 95 unleaded. Diesel will be down by around 93 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 78 cents. According to the AA, the rand’s daily average dipped as low as R16.10 to the US dollar on September 18, following a long downward trend which began in the first week of August. “However, a steep jump to around R16.90 followed by a brief plateau and a further spike to nearly R17.20 caught watchers unawares, and there is rightly some concern about the rand’s short- to the medium-term trajectory,” said the AA. “Almost in lockstep with the rand, diesel and petrol prices spiked, and then pulled back before starting a further climb. If this trend of a weakening rand and rising international fuel prices continues, it could be extremely negative for South African fuel users, and we will watch further changes with interest,” the AA added.
