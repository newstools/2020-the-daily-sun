FAT around your belly is associated with bad health and could even cause early death, while fat around you thighs and hips is associated with lower risk of death. We often hear the saying, thick thighs save lives and it seems this might be true, according to a study by scientists, who said measuring abdominal fat and using it with your body mass index (BMI) will help to find out the risk of premature death. The latest findings published in medical journal The BMJÂ were based on the results of 72 studies of over 2,5 million participants tracked for between three and 24 years, where researchers found most people with belly fat were positively associated with a higher cause mortality risk. In contrast, large hip and thigh measurements were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.
