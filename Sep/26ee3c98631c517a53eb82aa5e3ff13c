On Monday the Economic Freedom Fighters went on a
countrywide protest against Clicks stores due to an advert that left many
people angry. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has since called for the
police to take action against the EFF after some for inciting violence during
the protests. "We will lay charges of incitement to violence and
destruction of property against the EFF and more especially it’s leadership as
made public who would welcome rioters at certain malls," DA's Shadow
Minister of Police, Andrew Whitfield said in a statement. Whitfield said the party was aware of the rage and upset
that was caused by the advert which depicted black hair as damaged and dry. ALSO READ: DA DENIES KICKING OUT BLACK LEADERS "EFF’s violent response is unacceptable and SAPS has
a duty to act against Julius Malema and others who have made explicit
statements inciting EFF members to commit criminal acts," he added. He said the party will contact the Minister of Police,
Bheki Cele, and National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, to ask
what action they will be taking against Julius Malema and the EFF’s incitement
to violence. "We can never allow individuals and political
parties to commit such horrific acts of vigilante violence and if SAPS fails to
respond with decisive action they will be in dereliction of their duty. "This is not the first time that Julius Malema and
his quasi-revolutionaries have called for violence and the destruction of
property in the name of justice," Whitfield added. Whitfield further said the party will submit evidence to
the police to ensure that the EFF does not go unpunished violent behaviour and
malicious destruction of property.
