Nkululeko Jele says he is a spirit-led Afro jazz singer. “I ignored the calling for seven years while singing maskandi and gospel music. “My late brother, Sipho Jele kept, coming in dreams in a form of a prophet with songs and beats. It was like I was crazy because I would immediately start recording the lyrics with imaginary beats.’’ Nkululeko (33) from Uyaya Village in Eshowe, KZN, said the spirit would follow him everywhere he went. “Today I’m happy that I finally followed the dream and it’s paying off,” he said. His first Afro jazz single, Baphela Omama, has been nominated in the Live Your Dream, awards which will take place on 18 November in Durban. “I’m so excited with the path I took. It shows the spirit guided me in the right direction and I am ready to pass the message of love and hope.” His single speaks about domestic violence and appeals to traditional leaders to intervene. Nkululeko is planning to release his album Amasosha at the end of October. “It is produced by the legendary producer and engineer, Vincent Sithole. It is a spiritual album that will connect everyone with their ancestors or loved ones like it did with my late brother who died after a car accident in 2000,” said Nkululeko.
