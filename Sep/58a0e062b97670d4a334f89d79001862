DON’T insult us! This is a message angry cops are sending to EFF president, Julius Malema. “I hope he apologises,” said Constable Mbalenhle Mabena. “We’re hurt by his statement. When cops responded to EFF shutting down stores on Monday because of the offensive hair advert, Juju said he doesn’t understand why police aren’t focused on dealing with real criminals and rapists. Instead the cops, with their smelly boots, were chasing after EFF members, he said, calling cops ditlayela. Constable Mahlatse Mokone felt insulted.  “We’re ordered to go to certain places to do our jobs, but these are the kinds of insults we’re getting,” she said. “It hurts. Especially when it comes from the president of a party that people love.” Mabena said she used to like Malema until the insult. “Our job is to ensure people’s safety and stop violence,” she said. “But suddenly we’re called ditlayela for trying to do our jobs.” Sergeant Phil Manyike said he was shocked to hear the things Malema said about police when they’re the ones who stand by his side during rallies. “Now we’ve become fools who don’t know our jobs,” he said. He said Malema claimed to protect people’s dignity yet insulted the police. “I hope he understands the damage he’s done.” In a video on social media, an unknown cop says politicians make them fight their battles. “Have you worn and smelled our boots?” He says Malema got many votes from the police. “I hope he’ll see his mistake and apologise. The 2021 election is around the corner. You and your friends will be looking for those votes from the same police.” EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo said the EFF won’t apologise for the remarks made about police while the EFF was fighting Clicks racism. “Police in this country need to get their priorities in order, and watching the EFF sing instead of fighting violent crime and combating gender-based violence shows the priorities of police officers are misplaced,” said Pambo.
