“TO whom much is given, much is expected”. This is the advice from Steve Komphela to new Kaizer Chiefs coach, Gavin Hunt. At the Carling Black Label Cup launch at FNB Stadium yesterday, Komphela said Hunt deserved a shot at the Amakhosi top job more than any of the available coaches locally. Komphela, now coaching Golden Arrows, endured a torrid three-year spell in the Amakhosi hot-seat and had his contract not renewed when it expired two years ago. Hunt, another local coach, has now been tasked with ending a five-year trophy drought, after being announced as Ernst Middendorp’s replacement last week. In Komphela, Hunt couldn’t ask for better advice from someone who has experienced the hot seat. “Let me first congratulate Hunt, a very close friend of mine, and wish him all the best. I don’t think, with the utmost respect for all available coaches in the country, there’s anything more deserving of a shot at the job. He has the pedigree. “But blessings and burdens are cousins. He got blessed to be in the position. However, to whom much is given, much is expected. “There’s going to be pressure. It has been there with us. I’ve grown grey hair. It’s part of the job. If there’s anything difficult to deal with in life, it is to become a coach. You’ll never understand until you are one,” said Komphela. The beer cup has always been about innovation. It is therefore hardly surprising to see the Cup organisers pull the rabbit out the hat with what is termed the “Cup of Ages” this time around. Details of the unique match, involving Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, are still sketchy, owing to the veil of secrecy around the upcoming match. But the this year’s edition will certainly be a game like no other. The match will be live on SABC1 on 3 October, of course, with no fans in the stands.
