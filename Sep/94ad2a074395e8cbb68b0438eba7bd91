FORMER Golden Arrows and Crystal Palace midfielder, Kagisho Dikgacoi, has joined the chorus of voices against the current concept of the Premiership promotion/relegation play-offs. Season after season, there are constant calls for the scrapping of the complicated post-season play-offs that determine which team is promoted to the top-flight, or if the Premiership team that ends in 15th position is able to hold on to their PSL status through playoffs. In Mzansi, the team that finishes 15th in the Premiership battles it out for the final spot in the top-flight with the runners-up, as well as the team that finished third in the GladAfrica Championship. This season, Black Leopards, who finished second from bottom in the Premiership, are battling it out with runners-up in the Championship – Ajax Cape Town and third-placed Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Dikgacoi believes that it is not fair that a team who have been poor in the top flight for the entire season get another chance to save their status, denying another team that has been impressive in the second-tier a chance to go up. “Can the Premier Soccer League (PSL) just cancel this play-off thing,” pleaded the former Bafana Bafana international on his social media page. “It serves no purpose at all.” Dikgacoi said that the team that finishes 15th in the Premiership, Leopards this season, should not be afforded another chance to save their top-flight status and should instead drop to the second tier. “They don’t deserve a second chance,” added Dikgacoi. “They will get their second chance in the second-tier.” He believes the play-offs put the runners up from the second-tier, in this case, Ajax, at a disadvantage because even the team that finishes third (TTM) has the same chance to earn promotion. This season, Ajax, who finished with the same number of points as promoted Swallows, have the same opportunity as third-placed TTM in the play-offs. “That’s not fair at all,” insisted Dikgacoi.
