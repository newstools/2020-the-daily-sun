A JMPD officer is fighting for his life in hospital and people responsible for this are still at large. The cop was shot and hijacked at Lehae, south of Joburg, last night! Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun the officer had just knocked off and was on his way home when the incident happened. “He was blocked by three males in a white car. The officer isn’t sure what kind of a car it was,” he said. They shot the officer in the tummy and robbed him of his service firearm and unmarked vehicle. The vehicle was found abandoned not far from where the incident occurred. “He was rushed to hospital and is in a stable condition,” said Minnaar. He said whoever came after Metro cops would be dealt with! “Officers work overtime to serve the public, and this barbaric behavior won’t be tolerated,” he said. A massive manhunt was under way for the three suspects. “If anyone has any information that might lead to the arrest of the men, please visit the police station or call. You can also remain anonymous,” said Minnaar. The injured cop was in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Concerned residents apparently heard gunshots, something they said had become commonplace. Said Keamogetswe Madima (36): “Can army and police visibility continue even after lockdown because, in all honesty, our country is in turmoil? “We hear gunshots almost every day, and all you can do is pray that you’re not next. This is really bad and needs to be taken seriously.” Neo Mbele (41) said several meetings had been held to discuss crime. “If these people can attack Metro cops, who are we as residents? Something needs to be done,” said Neo.
