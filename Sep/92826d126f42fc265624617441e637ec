COPS have launched a manhunt for a kidnapped 20-month-old little girl. Little Bokamoso Blessing Mpembe was allegedly kidnapped by her mother’s boyfriend, who couldn’t accept being dumped. Bokamoso’s aunt, Penny (28), from Easter Village in Mamafubedu near Petrus Steyn, Free State, said the baby was taken on Sunday. She said mum Khorny Mpembe’s ex-boyfriend stole an innocent baby who was not even his daughter. “My sister Khorny is not doing well and is worried. The baby was not wearing anything warm when her boyfriend ran away with her.”  Khorny (32) told Daily Sun about her history of abuse. “He was abusive and threatened to kill me and himself if I tried to dump him. He knew about my intentions to dump him on Sunday and beat me up. “I ran to get help. He took the baby and ran away with her. I just want my baby back. Please help me find her,” she said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed the kidnapping and said cops have launched a manhunt for the baby and the suspect, aged 33.
