The crime statistics were announced in Zwelitsha yesterday Mthatha policing precincts recorded the most cases of violence at 67, followed by Ntabankulu with 62 and Duncan Village with 61. There was less crime than between April and June. Contact crime including murder, attempted murder and robbery have dropped at 37,2% and sexual crimes were also down at 39,2% But there has been a massive rise in stock theft, with 1920 animals stolen, including 786 sheep, 468 cattle, 242 goats and 101 horses. Most stock theft happens on Fridays. MEC for safety and liaison Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe said: “The first quarter coincided with level 5,4 and 3 of the national lockdown, when alcohol and tobacco were banned. The decline in crime should not be taken lightly, as criminals are always planning ways to outsmart law enforcement. “The decline is a reflection of what can be achieved when our communities join hands with our government, because one criminal act is one too many.” Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “Most categories have shown a remarkable decrease because of the lockdown. Our police are continuing to make arrests and task teams are doing a remarkable job. All these efforts speak to the commitment and seriousness with which our province responds to the plight of our people. We are proud of the work of our men and women in blue,” she said
