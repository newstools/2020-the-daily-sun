NOTORIOUS thug Norman “Dallas” Mokoena, who escaped from custody has been discharged from hospital and will remain behind bars until Thursday. The 23-year-old suspect from Marite Trust outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga briefly appeared before Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court, where he was charged with escaping and possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition early today. He reportedly escaped from the same court last year after he was denied bail on a series of armed robberies where he targeted bakery delivery trucks in Marite. But on Saturday, he was bust by the Mpumalanga Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, tactical response team, and crime intelligence in Marite. Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said Mokoena was the most wanted suspect since his escape. “He was found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, where he was charged with escaping”. NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said Mokoena appeared in court today after he was discharged from hospital. “His case had to be postponed until next week after the state and the accused’s lawyer agreed on a possible plea on escaped charges, but he will remain in custody,” she said.
