ONLY a good offer will tempt Denis Onyango away from Mamelodi Sundowns! The star goalkeeper has revealed he has received offers from the Middle East, following yet another brilliant season. However, he insists haven't been worth the trouble of moving away from his comfort zone. Onyango, the 2016 Caf Goalkeeper of the Year, has caught the eye of scouts, reaching the Champions League quarterfinals and winning a treble with the Brazilians.”There have been offers from the Arab countries... in the UAEs and Saudi Arabias, a lot of them,” Onyango revealed. ”But they haven't been concrete offers. And you can't rely on things which are not concrete. Of course, they have to talk to the club first. If the club says, ’Look, Denis, we still want you, but you can move on. I wouldn't say no. After all, it's business. ”However, as a player, I'm still happy to play for Sundowns and still win many more trophies. I want to add another star to the badge. ”Onyango paid to the tribute to Downs coach Pitso Mosimane and to the club, acknowledging their contribution to his growth as one of the top goalies on the continent. ”As I've said before, Sundowns have been there for me when I was not playing. For two years they were paying me even when I wasn't playing. If I can play and they still want me around, why not stay? ”It's not easy to move on from a team like Sundowns and start all over again.”
