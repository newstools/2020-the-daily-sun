MAMELODI Sundowns may be on course for a historic treble. The worst thing they can do, however, is to count their chickens before they hatch. Predictions are that the Brazilians will see off Bloemfontein Celtic in the Nedbank Cup final when the two sides meet at Orlando Stadium tomorrow (8pm). After all, they sit on a cusp of another cup success this season, having already bagged the Telkom Knockout and the Absa Premiership. But coach Pitso Mosimane has cautioned against complacency, with his players still on cloud nine after they pipped rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the dramatic title race. “The treble is not there until you win the match,” warned Mosimane. “First we had one cup, second the league was not in our hands, until the last 20 minutes or so, and we managed to win it. The worst thing is to think you have won a treble without playing.” Mosimane pointed to the recent history between the two sides in the cup, acknowledging the challenge Celtic pose. “Everybody has the right to win the Nedbank Cup. You know the history between Sundowns and Celtic in the cup,” Mosimane said. “History doesn’t favour us. The reference is not good. But those were years back and I wasn’t here, neither was John Maduka at Celtic. If you look at it, you can say they need it more than us. But football doesn’t work that way. “It says whoever wants it now, on the pitch, gets it. They’ve been winning. They are one of the contributors to us winning the league after they stalled Chiefs. If they can stall a big team, then it means they can stall us.” By their standards... and financial circumstances, Celtic have over-achieved, having qualified for the top-eight. As Mosimane said, it is a team that has nothing to lose. While Sundowns will be without Mosa Lebusa and possibly Gaston Sirino and Andile Jali, Celtic welcome back inspirational skipper Ndumiso Mabena and defenders Justice Chabalala and Mzwanele Mahashe from suspension. Who wants it more?
