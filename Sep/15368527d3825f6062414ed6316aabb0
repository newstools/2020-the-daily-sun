MORE than 150 villages may soon be without water. This is because the Ebenezer Dam in Magoebaskloof, Limpopo is running dry. The villages of Ga-Mamabolo, Ga-Molepo, Mankweng and residents of Polokwane and some parts of Seshego are already experiencing shortages. Thando Sibola (49) said the situation was made worse by the low rainfall experienced in the last rain season. “Without water we are doomed. How can we go out of our houses without taking a bath?” asked Thando. The Polokwane Municipality had projected that areas being supplied by the dam will be without water in November. But it seems the time has already come. Municipal spokesman Matshidiso Mothapo said the dam level was now below 12%, and they will stop pumping water from the dam once it reached 5%. “The situation is bad. If we don’t get strong rain very soon, we are going to suffer,” he said. He said there were some areas that were already not getting water from the dam, because the pressure at the dam was low. “Restrictions have been implemented to make sure the remaining supply can sustain the water supply until the rainy season, but it is not enough,” he said. The latest average daily supply from the dam has reduced from 36 mega litres per day to about 20 mega litres. “If people don’t use water sparingly, we are going to run out of water in no time,” said Mothapo. Residents are urged to play their part to conserve the little water that is available by restricting domestic consumption to household use only.
