SPORTS Minister, Nathi Mthethwa, has slammed the ruling of the
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the Caster Semenya case with the IAAF
as "unfortunate and offensive" to the fundamental human rights of female
athletes. CAS upheld the decision of the World Athletics governing
body to compels female, believed to have unfair competitive advantage, to lower
her testosterone levels in order to compete in the 400m and 800m events. The IAAF introduced a rule that athletes with differences of
sexual development should change from 400m and 800m events or take medication
to reduce their testosterone in order to compete in those events. ”Essentially this means these Regulations are not only a
violation of human and women rights but their administration is considered
unethical by the experts in the field of medical science, ” said Mthethwa. ”As the Government of democratic South Africa, a country
renowned for its tradition of promoting and protecting basic human rights,
together with Athletics SA. ”We will study the judgement and consider various options
and avenues at our disposal in our collective campaign to fight this injustice. We call upon all South Africans, Africans and the entire
world to rally behind Caster in our quest to defeat injustice against Women in
Sport and in particular African Women.” In her reaction on social media, Semenya wrote: “Chills my people! A man can change the rules but the very same man cannot rule my life What I'm saying is that I might have failed against them (IAAF), the truth is that I have won this battle long ago. Go back to my achievements then you will understand. Doors might be closed not locked.”
