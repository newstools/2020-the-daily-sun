NOBODY’S safe! This is not just a famous line thrown by SA rapper commonly known as “A-Reece” when dropping bars. But is it precisely the way of life, even in football. After the penultimate Absa Premiership matches on Wednesday night, we can safely say nobody’s safe at the bottom of the log standings. All three Limpopo teams – Polokwane City, Baroka FC and Black Leopards, as well as AmaZulu – are still not safe. One of the four teams will finish at the bottom of the table and BE relegated to the infamous GladAfrica Championship. The club that finishes in position 15 will take part in the promotion/relegation play-offs to fight for another chance in the top -flight Polokwane City are rooted to the bottom of the table with 25 points – three behind 15th placed Baroka FC. Leopards and AmaZulu, in 14 and 13th spots respectively, are tied on 29 points, which is still unsafe to retain PSL status. Chippa United, who are 11th on the log, mathematically are also not safe as they could find themselves negotiating their berth in the play-offs, depending on the results of teams behind them. Baroka have a battle of monumental proportions when they host Chiefs at Bidvest Stadium at 3.30pm, Sundowns face Leopards at Dobsonville Stadium at the same time. “It’ a big one. It is all to play for now,” said Baroka coach Dylan Kerr. Leopards managed to get a crucial win against Bidvest Wits and now they are hoping to upset coach Pitso Mosimane’s Sundowns. Leopards coach Mongezi Bobe said: “We don’t want to lose any game. Sundowns want to win the league, but we’ve got our own problems to deal with. We are not going to rely on anybody. We are going there to get three points.” Ayanda Dlamini, whose AmaZulu face Highlands Park, said they are prepared to die on the field to save their status. He said: “It’s all about fighting...” PERMUTATIONS:
