SHE loves her husband, but can’t have him all to herself. A tokoloshe, called a spiritual wife, pokes her man almost every night. The woman said she sometimes can hear him poking the spiritual wife. She said when it’s time for them to poke, his 4-5 is always painful. The couple has been at the mercy of this spiritual wife since 2014. The wife said when the jealous spiritual wife wants to have her hubby all to herself, she creates tension between them and they end up fighting. “We sleep in separate rooms. When we fight she has him all to herself. “My husband then wakes up wet, smelling of semen. We need help. “He’s in pain as his 4-5 sometimes swells up.” She said they visited doctors, specialists and sangomas for help with no luck. “We need all the help we can get to take this tokoloshe away. I can’t be sharing my husband with supernatural forces.” Said the shyish hubby:  “we’ve been to several sangomas and all they give me is imbiza. “I’m tired of drinking it every day with nothing changing.” He said his nightmare started after he married his wife. He suspects it could be related to jealousy by one of his previous girlfriends. Sangoma Lithini Mpofu said: “They usually sleep with men and there’s a cure for it. “It needs sangomas who know how to get rid of it.”
