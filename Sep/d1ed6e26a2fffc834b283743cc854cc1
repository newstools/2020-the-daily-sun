He said the date for the burial would be announced soon. He said Daniel would be buried in Ga-Mashabela, Limpopo. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of murder was opened, but no arrests have been made. The DA in Tshwane has condemned Daniel’s killing. Mamelodi DA’s constituency leader Darryl Moss has condemned the killing and wants a thoroughly investigation. According to Moss, Daniel was killed after a lengthy campaign to get rid of the Boko Haram gang, which has invaded Mamelodi hostel. “According to colleagues, he had been receiving death threats since being appointed by the Minister of Human Settlements, Lindiwe Sisulu, to head the relocation of hostel dwellers to temporary structures for compliance with Covid-19 regulations. “We call on Police Minister Bheki Cele to institute an urgent investigation into the notorious Boko Haram gang, which is terrorising residents at the Mamelodi hostel,” he said.
