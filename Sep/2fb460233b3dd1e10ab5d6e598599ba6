HUNDREDS of gogos and madalas were left high and dry after suspects pounced on Bergendal Village’s Sassa pay point in Maleboho outside Senwabarwana, Limpopo on Wednesday. They allegedly pointed a cashier with firearms and ordered her to unlock the safe, while three disarmed security guards. They then took moneybags from the safe containing huge amounts of cash, loaded them into a white Toyota Yaris and sped off. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said local cops were called and immediately rushed to the scene, while calling for backup from Senwabarwana, Tolwe, Mogwadi and Saamboubrug cop shops. He said the highway patrol, the K9 and tactical response teams also joined in, as well as the air wing. “The suspects were pursued through the help of a helicopter. They abandoned their three getaway vehicles and ran on foot. Three suspects were cornered and bust, whereas two evaded arrest.” Five firearms were recovered, including the security guards’ rifles, as well as two moneybags and three vehicles. Mojapelo said the bust suspects aged 40, 42 and 53 will appear before Senwabarwana Magistrates Court tomorrow and the search for the remaining two robbers is continuing.  Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba commended the cops for a speedily co-ordinated operation that led to arrests and urged them to hunt down the remaining suspects.  Sassa spokesman Zwannda Kutama said they were saddened by those targeting poor beneficiaries’ payments. “We commend police, officials and villagers in ensuring these criminals get apprehended.”  Madala Elias Magoro (76) said he waited the whole day for his money. “I don’t have food and I was hoping to buy some and also settle my debts. I’m angry and disappointed.”
