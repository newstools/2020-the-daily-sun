A multi-award-winning stage play, 3 Come B4 1&2 has been turned into a film. This play shows the psychological effects of gender-based violence. Speaking to Daily Sun, the playwright Sibusiso Zondo (31) from Pietermaritzburg, said: “When we talk about gender-based violence we normally focus on sexual abuse, assault and everything that is physical. But this play shows that gender-based violence can also be psychological and such scars are deeper than physical scars.” He said he decided to turn this play into a film so that it can be seen by a larger audience. “I was actually advised to take this play to a wider audience. This was after I’d won multi-awards at the Count Me In Theatre festival. “This festival was held in Durban in March this year. Originally the stage play is 30 to 40 minutes but I have now extended it into a one hour screenplay. The film will be shot in Pietermaritzburg and the shoot is starting this coming week,” he said.

One of the sisters is filthy rich and has a daughter. The other two siblings are running their funeral businesses, respectively. “One sibling is in the business of cremating bodies while the other one uses the normal method, which is to bury six feet underground. The two siblings start fighting over their rich sister’s body once she is dead. Individually, they approach the daughter to allow them to bury the rich sister. Eventually the daughter decides not to cremate or bury her mother, instead she mummifies her,” said Sibusiso.
