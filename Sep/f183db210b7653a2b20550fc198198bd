AFTER spending almost a year off screen, actress Zinhle Mabena is making a comeback. She said that she was excited to return to the role of Sihle on Mzansi Magic’s Isibaya. “It has been a long time since I took a break to take care of my family. When Sihle returns, viewers will say there has been a lot of change in her life.” The talented actress said Sihle’s journey would not be an easy one. “People can definitely expect a rags to riches story as she is going to come back struggling, dealing with a lot of issues she left behind when she disappeared from the face of the earth,” she said. “More than anything, she wants to be there for her son. Being there for him means she’s going to desire the life she had when she left.” Zinhle told the SunTeam Sihle would still be up to no good. “Even though life has humbled her a bit, nothing has changed with her. She’s still be her vicious self,” she said. “There are new characters on the show and people are going to love the way she interacts with them.” Zinhle said being back on set had been nerve-wracking. “Even though it’s a bit scary to be back on set after such a long time, I really missed bringing Sihle to life. “It’s never easy to play the role of a villain.” She’ll be back on Isibaya tonight at 8.30pm.
