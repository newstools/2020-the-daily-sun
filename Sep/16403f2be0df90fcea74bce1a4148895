DELFT residents came out in their numbers to pay their final respects to madala Freddie Blom, who was buried at Lake Road Cemetery in Parkwood in Cape Town on Saturday.   Despite rain weather, residents gathered at his house in a huge tent and accompanied the family to the graveyard. A group of elderly women, those who were friends to madala, carried the coffin from the house to the hearse. The 116-year-old madala, who was one of the oldest people in the world, died on 22 August after a short illness. “He’s rested. He’s in a better place now,” his widow Jeannette Blom said. Senior Citizens Forum member Gadija Francis said madala will be missed. She said madala was a hero when it came to the wellbeing of young children and youth. “He always wanted to see children protected. He always encouraged young people to be productive and respect the elders,” she said. Makhulu Jeannette said in his last days, Freddie liked gardening as well as spending time on fire. He’d make fire and sit outside of the house most of the time. When the SunTeam visited madala on his birthday in May, he attributed his long life to God. Francis said they’d always be with gogo Jeanette throughout her mourning time and after. “We’ll not stop coming to her house. We have various activities for old people. We’ll ensure that she’s part of these programmes,” said Francis.
