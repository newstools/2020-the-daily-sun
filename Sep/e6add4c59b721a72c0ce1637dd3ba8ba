HOUSE music is normally associated with only dance and bragging lyrics. Up-and-coming house musician Mzwandile “Mzee Vocalist” Madiba has vowed to chance the genre style and rebrand it in romantic style. The artist, born in Umkomaas, KZN South Coast, is preparing to release his fifth single, You and I, in the beginning of October. The 27-year-old musician told SunBuzz his new song aims to teach people how to love each other and take care of each other while they dance. “House music can be romantic like other genres. Dancing doesn’t mean we don’t have to sing something that’s educational and teach our fans through music. “Giving more love to our women as men can assist in fighting against gender-based violence. “I want men and women to love each other and take care of each other. Love is everything and, if we can stick to it, we can prevent unnecessary fight in our relationships and families.” Mzee Vocalist started his career in 2016, when he released his debut single Masisi Omuhle. In February he released his fourth single, Mhlabavuleka, aimed at raising awareness against gender-based violence.
