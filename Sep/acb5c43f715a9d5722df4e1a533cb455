EFF leader Julius Malema has called their appearance in court today as irresponsible after their case was postponed once again. He said the court was putting their lives in danger as they came to court only for their case to be postponed. Speaking outside the Randburg Magistrate Court, where he was appearing with his co-accused EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, Malema told reporters: “It was unnecessary for us to come here today, because we are going to through a pandemic as a country. Any court that requires us to appear without trial is risking our lives and the lives of ordinary people, because you will know that as public figures when we come here, a lot of people will want to interact with us and we don’t know who is in a good state of health and who is not.” He said other courts, such as the magistrate court in East London where he’s accused of discharging a firearm in a public space and the court in Newcastle, where he’s charged with inciting people to grab land, have decided that they won’t unnecessary call them to appear, especial now during Covid-19. “It was irresponsible to even ask us to appear. We’ve got other matters in East London, Bloemfontein and Newcastle. All those courts have said for the purses of the postponement of these cases, it will not be necessary for us to appear especially now during Covid-19.” The case has been postponed to 13 October for trial.
