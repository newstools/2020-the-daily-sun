Aphiwe Dyantyi will look forward to taking a major step towards closure in his rugby career on Tuesday as his hearing into a doping offence kicks off. The 26-year-old Springbok winger, who was an absolute sensation at international level in 2018, has been in limbo since July last year when a routine test following a national training camp revealed he had taken three banned substances. A mandatory B-sample confirmed the results.Dyantyi, named World Rugby's Breakthrough Player of the Year at the end of 2018, in January released a statement that outlined the supplements that potentially contributed to the adverse findings but nonetheless has been serving a provisional suspension. Following numerous delays, which the South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport (Saids) attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, the deadly finisher now has the opportunity to state his case. Saids has stated that witnesses testimony will be presented on a virtual basis, while its senior lawyer will be dialled in via conference call from London. All other relevant parties will be physically present at the hearing.In an exclusive two-part interview with Sport24 previously, Dyantyi revealed his mental anguish at being suspended before finding coping mechanisms and keeping fit.Â  -SPORT24
