TRIBUTES have poured in for actress Thandeka Mdeliswa, who died at the weekend after allegedly being shot by her partner. She was 34 years old. She was best known for starring as Khanya in SABC1’s drama series iKani. She has also made appearances in several other local productions, including eKasi: Our Stories and Generations: The Legacy. Following the news of her passing, many took to Twitter to pay tribute to her. Her industry peer Florence Masebe said in a tweet that she was hurt by Thandeka’s passing. “So saddened by the news of this young woman’s passing. It hurts more than I can explain. There can never be enough flowers to comfort a grieving mother...” she tweeted. The actress’ family confirmed the cause of her death was gender-based violence, which President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a pandemic earlier this year. “It is with great sorrow that we inform you of the passing of our dearest daughter. She was shot in Evander, Mpumalanga on Thursday, 3 September 2020. She was immediately rushed to Evander Hospital, stabilised, then airlifted to Witbank after which she was transferred to Steve Biko Academic Hospital (Pretoria) as her condition was critical but stable. She passed on in the morning of the 5th September 2020 (Saturday),” said the family. The family said they were hurt by the manner in which their daughter died. “The brutality which was inflicted on our daughter has left us deeply hurt. This is another incident of violence against women (gender-based violence) which our country has to fight against. We believe justice will be served.” Funeral arrangements for Thandeka’s burial will be announced in due course.
