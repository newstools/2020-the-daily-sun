Rapper Kanye West has had another meltdown and this time, it’s music related. Kanye posted a video of himself urinating on one of his many Grammy Awards. He put the award in the toilet, peed on it and captioned the video: “Trust me... I won’t stop.” Before the video, he was on a rant about how record labels own musicians’ masters and turn musicians into slaves. He said he wanted to buy all his masters and make his children the owners. Kanye said he’s on a mission to help musicians get their masters from their labels because he knows it will change the music industry for good.

The rapper then posted Bible verses and asked people to pray for him as he’ll be fighting Universal Music and Sony Music. “I need prayer, I need coverage as I go into battle. Everyone please pray for me... you know what the system never counted on... millions of prayers at once... everyone I appreciate your prayers so much,” he continued. He also posted his contracts with the labels and asked lawyers on Twitter to look at them. Over the years, Kanye has been known for venting and having meltdowns on social media and on interviews, but over the past few months, it has become worse. A few months back, during his presidential campaign, he had a meltdown and confessed to wanting Kim to abort their daughter, North. Trust me ... I WONT STOP pic.twitter.com/RmVkqrSa4F
