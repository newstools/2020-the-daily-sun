Mamelodi Sundowns completed their treble by winning the Nedbank Cup on Saturday night. The Brazilians edged Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 courtesy of a Gaston Sirino strike at Orlando Stadium. They added the Ke Yona Cup to their impressive trophy cabinet which already had the Telkom Knockout and the Absa Premiership this season.  The drama regarding the inclusion of suspended defender Tebogo Langerman in the squad, has not dimmed Sundownsâ€™ shine. They continue to celebrate one of their best seasons ever, with players taking to social media to post their medals.
