THE Bakgatla Ba Kgafela community marched to the office of North West Premier Job Mokgoro on Wednesday. They demanded he reverse his decision to appoint a Botswana citizen as their chief. Mokgoro issued a certificate of recognition to Ramono Pilane Linchwe in July to lead the Bakgatla. Linchwe is the uncle of Chief Kgafela Kgafela in Botswana. Community representative, Morena Thale, said they’d not accept a foreign chief. “We can’t be ruled by a foreigner in our country,” he said. “Our assets belong to the people of South Africa and will only be administered by them in South Africa. “We don’t need a foreigner to tell us what should happen with our assets.” Mokgoro said the issue of recognition to Linchwe was valid for six months. The appointment followed the withdrawal of recognition from interim chief Nyalala Pilane, who’s been longing to leave the throne. Bakgatla Ba Kgafela live on mineral-rich land. Thale said: “They want to take our assets to Botswana. “We want them to recognise the existence of bogosi in South Africa. “People are targeting mines that generate an income for the community to enrich themselves.” Traditional affairs spokeswoman, Dineo Thapelo, said the tribe was led by an interim chief, hence the appointment of the Botswana chief. Mokgoro’s spokesman, Vuyisile Ngesi, said whoever feels aggrieved must seek relief from a court of law.
