FORMER Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown took orders from the Guptas. This was revealed by former Eskom board chairman Zola Tsotsi at the Zondo Commission yesterday. He said he received an email from the Gupta brothers’ lieutenant, Salim Essa, in December 2014 with a list of people to be appointed to Eskom’s various sub-committees. Tsotsi said he disregarded the list and drew up his own, which he sent to Brown. He was shocked when the minister sent him a list, which was exactly the same as the one sent by Essa. “I was surprised. And at that point it was about a week and half after the new board had been appointed,” said Tsotsi. SINGER FAINTED ON IDOLS SA! “I was very intrigued by the whole thing. I couldn’t put my finger on what was going on. It was not until I was called by the minister to a meeting, where I saw Tony Gupta and Essa. I then said to myself the minister is clearly operating under the persuasion of these people.” He said a substantial number of the people mentioned on Essa’s list were appointed to the board, including Ben Ngubane, who later took over from Tsotsi as chairman, Romeo Khumalo, Chwayitha Mabude and Mark Pamensky. Tsotsi told the commission he had difficulty getting Brown to work with him. In her affidavit, Brown claimed Tsotsi didn’t give her his own list, but rather a list generated somewhere else. “I’m perfectly clear that I communicated with the minister about the list. She was on vacation in Mozambique. I knew about her vacation because Essa told me about it,” he said. WHY SHOULD COUPLES DRINK VODKA? Tsotsi didn’t know why Brown got involved in the sub-committee. He said the minister was allowed to play a role only in the appointment of audit and risk committees. “I didn’t want to resist that because I thought it was important to keep relations with her as a shareholder,” he said. “As I indicated, before that I had difficulty working with her. I thought this would improve our relations.”
