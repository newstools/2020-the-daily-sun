The Polo Vivo brand has been dominant in the entry-level hatch segment and currently, the Polo Vivo is one of the most affordable cars to own in the South African market. The Polo Vivo Mswenko, which is based on the 1.4 63kW Comfortline manual, is a fashion-inspired derivative which features unique styling details and serves to appeal to customers that are dynamic and young at heart.
