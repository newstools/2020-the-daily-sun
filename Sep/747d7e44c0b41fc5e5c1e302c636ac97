Many negative factors have hampered the already suffocating Mzansi economy. Problems such as Covid-19 pandemic, corruption and unemployment have immensely made life difficult for many households. So in order to save this beautiful country from sinking, a new vision and strategy should be implemented. South Africa needs people-oriented leadership, patriots and selfless visionaries both at corporate and government levels. The idea of solving the country’s challenges by borrowing money from international monetary institutions and giving people R350 special grants won’t completely eradicate these problems. It will create more problems in then long run and what is known as dependency theory. Graduates must be assisted to wean from the culture of job-hunting. The lip service government and the “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours” system must come to an end if we want to be honoured by the next generations. - Letter by Pascal Machai, Vosloorus
