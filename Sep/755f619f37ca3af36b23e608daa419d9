Mpumalanga, police commissioner Lieutenant
General Mondli Zuma, is worried of individuals who often turn funerals
gatherings of their alleged gang members into a shooting range. The police boss said these individuals become
trigger happy and discharge firearms totally disregarding the law and lives of
other funeral attendees or children. “We had incident were police received reports
about certain individuals who were busy firing shots at a funeral claiming they
were bidding farewell to their friend in Masoyi near Hazyview. The four
suspects were found with two unlicensed firearms loaded with ammunition and
they are alleged to have attended a funeral,” said Zuma. They were bust and reminded in police custody
until Friday 25 September at White River Magistrate. “Therefore we condemn such incidences in the
strongest terms and indicated that such dangerous actions must not be supported
and we want to urge bereaved families to assist police and not allow criminals
to discharge firearms during funerals of their loved ones, irrespective of how
the deceased behaved while still alive,” said Zuma “I urge the community not to celebrate in such actions.
They should report these people to the police because they are a danger to the
society and they’re disregarding the law”.
