A BABY born on an Egyptian Air Airbus won an air travel lottery after a Yemeni woman named Hiyam Nasr Naji Daaban gave birth on an airplane while travelling from the UK to Egypt last Wednesday. When Hiyam went in to labour while passing the German airspace, the flight captain requested an emergency landing in Munich, but she gave birth before the flight could even land. EgyptAir then awarded her newborn free lifetime travel aboard the airline. The airline tweeted: “The pilot, Rushdi Zakaria, chairman of the holding company for Egypt, congratulated passenger Hiyam Nasr Naji Daaban and granted her newborn a free lifetime travel ticket. She gave birth on board the plane during the Egypt Air flight yesterday from Cairo to London.” ???? ?????? ???? ????? ???? ???? ????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ???? ??? ???? ????? ????? ??????? ??? ??????? ???? ???????? ????? ??? ?????? ??? ?????? ????? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? ????? ???? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ????. pic.twitter.com/WDLsBFePDW  In 2017, a baby boy born aboard a Jet Airways plane also received an unlimited travel pass after his mum went into labour over the Arabian Sea.
