IN preparation for international fixtures, including the 2021 Afcon and the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has instituted inspection visits to all national associations. This as they require stadiums that meet international standards. The confederation’s legends teamed up with experts, including experienced CAF General Coordinators, for the exercise towards ensuring that matches are hosted in facilities that meet international standards. This is for the safety of players, officials and fans. Inspection visits that took place in nine associations led to the suspension of seven stadiums, while six others got temporary approval, due to exceptional circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Samson Adamu, CAF Director of Competitions, the temporary relaxation of the requirements – regarding aspects such as the stands – has taken place due to the organisation behind closed doors of the next international matches.
