HAVING led the PSL top scorer’s chart for the better of the season, Orlando Pirates’ striker, Gabadinho Mhango, is forced to share the Golden Boot aspellingward with Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile. The two quality striker have found the back of the net 16 times apiece in 30 matches, while Bradley Grobler of SuperSport United is two shy away from the top sharp-shooters. It was a bumper season where clubs were forced to fight their way back to football after a five months break due to Covid-19 lockdown. And as professionals would say, such break would kill the momentum of a player and more importantly the hunger for strikers, which has proven to be the case for Mhango, who has been a shadow of his former self in the bubble. Interestingly, both strikers – Mhango and Shalulile – scored in their respective clubs’ closing matches of the season on Saturday, with the former hitting the back of net when Bucs beat Stellenbosch 1-0 and the latter in Highlands’ 1-1 draw against AmaZulu.
