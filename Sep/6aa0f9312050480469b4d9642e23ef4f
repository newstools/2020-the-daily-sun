KLAAS Shako has been homeless for more than 15 years. So the 49-year-old from Hospital View in Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo, said he was happy when he got a chance to apply for an RDP house in 2006. But he has been waiting since. “It has been 14 years of waiting. The people I applied with got their house, even those who applied after me have moved in. “I don’t know what I did wrong,” he said. Klaas said he always got empty promises whenever he enquired about the house. “I’m forced to rely on relatives and neighbours for shelter,” he said. He said one of his relatives allowed him to use their RDP while waiting. “The RDP does not have electricity and water. I collect cans and sell them. I also collect wood and sell it to residents. I am doing this so I can survive,” he said. Klaas said he could no longer live like this, but didn’t know who to turn to for help. “I need help so I can live a better life. My life would be better if I had an RDP. I don’t want to die in a place like this,” he said. Limpopo human settlements spokesman Motupa Selomo said they didn’t have Klaas’ records in their system. “It seems he never applied because he does not appear in our records. “He must identify a place where there’s land and people are applying for RDPs, so he can also apply for one,” said Selomo.
