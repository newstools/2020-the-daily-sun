THUGS stole groceries from a church and left the pastor with only a pack of tissues. They also stole some liquid soap and left behind empty containers. According to Pastor Themba Nhlapo of Calvary Christ Mission church in Lusaka, Mamelodi East in Tshwane, the thugs broke the window of the creche building to get to the kids’ groceries worth R2 300. The angry pastor told Daily Sun that the thugs don’t respect the house of the Lord. At the same time, Nhlapo blames the police. He said the cops have been failing the church since 2016. “I’m disappointed with the way the police are dealing with our cases. “I have called them in the past about break-ins into the church, but they never came,” he said. The man of the cloth said he had lost hope in the police because they were not helping him to find the criminals who stole from his church. Nhlapo suspects the thugs who stole the groceries are the same ones who’ve been doing so in the past. He said in 2016, thugs stole two generators worth about R28 000 and a sound system worth more than R30 000. According to the pastor, in 2017, they stole a sound system worth R26 000. In 2018, they stole cables and 60 chairs. And in March, they stole a fridge. Nhlapo has called on the cops to be visible around the church. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Maheso said a case of theft of electrical cables was opened in 2018, but there was not enough information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects. “We are appealing to the complainant to open the recent case of theft,” he said.
