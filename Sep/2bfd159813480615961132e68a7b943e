AFTER three successful seasons, Mzansi Magic reality TV show Uthando Nes’thembu’s Mselekus are back to give viewers a fresh look at polygamous marriage. They will be opening new doors for viewers as they now find themselves wanting to gain more recognition individually. It will also reveal the honesty of the Mseleku wives, which will leave viewers trying to keep up with what it takes to be in a polygamous marriage and how these wives relate to each other. M-Net’s Nomsa Philiso told Daily Sun they have big things in store. “If you thought season three was the climax of the show, then we’ve got something even bigger and better in store for you. “This season will bring you up close and personal with Mseleku’s wives and the dynamics of polygamy.” She said viewers must prepare for a roller-coaster ride. “Season 4 will expose you to a side you have not been exposed to before. As we celebrate Heritage Month, we want to deliver content that resonates with traditions still practiced by ethnic groups in our diverse society.”
