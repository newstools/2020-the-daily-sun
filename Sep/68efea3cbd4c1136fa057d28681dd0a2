Controversial actor, Sthembiso ‘SK’ Khoza is desperately looking for a tweep who created a petition for his return to the drama series, The Queen. He played the character of Ushaka but last year his character was killed. In September last year an online petition was started with an intention of bringing him back. At least more than 29 000 tweeps signed the petition and they were gunning for 35 000. Eventually Ushaka’s character was brought back to The Queen, much to tweeps delight.
