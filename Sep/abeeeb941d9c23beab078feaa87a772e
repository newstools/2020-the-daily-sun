CAMEROON bustling striker, Bienvenu Eva Nga, is waiting in the wings to join Kaizer Chiefs. Eva Nga, who joined Bidvest Wits from Mozambique side Costa Do Sol, is without a club after Wits were recently sold to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and the team will relocate to Limpopo next season. “Wits gave Eva Nga a three-month package until December,” said football agent Thomas Tloane. “He was one of many players the club gave packages, those who had existing contracts with the club.” SunSport has learnt that Eva Nga (27) is one of many players from Wits, alongside Sifiso Hlanti and Thabang Monare and Cole Alexander, who are waiting in limbo hoping for the coach’s announcement soon. Gavin Hunt and Adel Amrouche are strongly linked to take over Amakhosi following the departure of Ernst Middendorp and his assistant, Shaun Bartlett last week. But Eva Nga and the rest of the players with potential to join Chiefs will depend on the club’s appeal against the Fifa ban of not being able to sign players for the next two transfer windows period, which is still with the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS). The matter was heard on 9 September and Chiefs are waiting for the outcome on whether their appeal has been successful. The Cameroonian striker helped Costa do Sol to the Mocambola title in November last year, scoring 24 goals in the process. In the short space of time, he showed his prowess in Mzansi, scoring four goals in 18 appearances. One of them dented Chiefs’ Premiership title hopes in the penultimate game of the season. “There’s a huge possibility of Eva Nga remaining in the PSL. Since he’s here in South Africa, I’m the one who will be looking after his affairs,” said Tloale.
