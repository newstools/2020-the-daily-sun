In a democratic state, it is not normal for a political party to rule for more than two terms. But in a democratic South Africa, the ANC has been in power for more than 25 years. It seems the party will still be in power in the next 10 years or so. The problem is that people’s vote is based on sentiment, not policy and performance. That’s what keeps the ANC in power. The citizens are blind to the governing party’s shortcomings because it has played a leading role in liberating us as a country. That’s blind loyalty. As things stand, nothing looks good for South Africa. The economy is down and unemployment is high. Corruption is the order of the day. If we are waiting for the ANC to self-correct and take us to the promised land, we will wait forever. By the time we wake up, it will be too late, if not already. The country will be down and out, and it will take us years to rebuild it. In the past, we knew how to fight apartheid, but now we don’t know how to fight the ANC. We regard it as our own. This makes it difficult to take it out of power, yet it is working hard to destroy our country. After 1994, we took a back seat as citizens and gave the ANC space to govern. By so doing, we outsourced our thinking and power to the governing party. Now we don’t know how to claim it back. We should have realised that giving too much power to politicians or political parties is suicidal. We must take responsibility as citizens for the state our country finds itself in. We’re as much to blame as the ANC. It is time we claim our power back by voting right and holding politicians accountable. It is also time politicians know that power rests with us, not with them.
