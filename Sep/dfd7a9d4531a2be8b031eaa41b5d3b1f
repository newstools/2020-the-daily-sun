WHEN a concrete slab was put down in her yard for an RDP two years ago, Dudu Mahlangu was overjoyed. But the 45-year-old from Manaleni Village in Tweefontein, Mpumalanga, ended up with a broken heart and no house. Dudu, who shares a borrowed one-roomed shack with her children, told Daily Sun construction suddenly stopped and she was never told why. She said her own shack burned down and she couldn’t afford to build a new one as she was unemployed. “It breaks my heart to see the concrete slab in my yard every day. I wake up with the hope of seeing builders in my yard,” she said. “The shack I live in is leaking, and when it’s summer the rain soaks everything inside. The little money I get from odd jobs only puts food on the table. “I’ve lost weight because this is like being tortured.” Dudu isn’t the only person in the area left with just a concrete slab. Six other families are also waiting for houses. John Masanabo (57) has had the same experience. “Nobody is telling us anything. We don’t know why construction didn’t continue. It breaks my heart because the house was going to change my life for the better.” Human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe said he was aware of the situation. “The contractor was stopped by the department after she’d already started working due to budget cuts. We couldn’t afford to pay for more units. “During this financial year, all the contractors have been requested to go back to sites. “The project in the area has been affected by community strikes and business forum stoppages. “We’ve engaged with the contractor to start working again as the situation has improved.”
