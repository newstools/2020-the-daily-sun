I only knew our lobola negotiations were on Saturday, so when he proposed, I was so surprised,” said Dineo. They said wanted a white wedding and were still planning. Zimkitha Mquteni-Mabanga, publicity manager for CSI and Africa, Shoprite Checkers, said they’ll give the couple a voucher. “The Shoprite Group will give the couple a Shoprite voucher which they can use towards their white wedding. We have not informed the couple yet.” Jerusalema Challenge Shoprite edition #JerusalemaDanceChallenge @MasterKGsa @Nomcebozikode pic.twitter.com/7WE4OlfLcF
