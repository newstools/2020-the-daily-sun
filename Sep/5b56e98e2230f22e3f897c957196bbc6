WHEN France Nkosi (40) was admitted to Tambo Memorial Hospital in April, his family thought he’d recover. But he died and his body apparently vanished from the hospital. His cousin, Nozipho Maduna (40) from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the family came from all over Mzansi to bury him. “We sat on the mattress and burnt candles until we got tired,We ran out of money to buy candles,” said Nozipho. She said France was admitted to the hospital on 8 April and died on 11 April. “We were supposed to get his body on 15 April, but we were given another body,” she said. “When we told them they’d given us the wrong body, they said they’d call us back when they found his. But they never called. “We had set a date for the funeral, but had to postpone again and again until we gave up.” France’s other cousin, Hlengiwe Mkhonza (41), said they’d lost hope and hadn’t had peace since his death. “We have bad dreams. When we consult traditional healers and prophets, we’re told France isn’t at peace,” she said. They wanted answers and, most importantly, to bury France. Sangoma Mtimande Ngwenya said: “To put him at ease, the hospital needs to give the family his body so they can bury him and perform rituals.” It was important to sprinkle soil on a loved one’s grave. “You experience hardships if that doesn’t happenThere will be bad dreams and if nothing is done, more family members might fol,” he said. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said: “The family identified this body and took it overnight with the undertaker. “They returned in the morning, claiming the body isn’t theirs. No other family has claimed the body in the mortuary.” The department was assisting the family to get to the bottom of this. “DNA tests have been conducted and results aren’t known yet,” said Kekana.
