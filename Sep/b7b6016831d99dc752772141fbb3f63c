THE battle for the PSL Player of the Season appears to be Themba Zwane and Samir Nurkovic. By many accounts, Zwane, the mercurial Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder, and the Kaizer Chiefs striker are standing toe-to-toe in for the most prestigious individual PSL accolade. Even Pitso Mosimane has admitted he has been impressed by Nurkovic’s displays, despite Amakhosi finishing the season empty-handed. ”Themba Zwane must win it (Player of the Season award) Why? Because he has been consistent throughout the season, ” said the Sundowns coach. ”Unless if it's the Absa Premiership Footballer of the Year then I'd say he has a little bit of competition from Nurkovic. “I think he played well and deserves something. He attacks, he scores and he defends. He’s a monster. He's done very well.” But Mosimane believes Zwane is a shoo-in to clinch the gong. “Themba scored lots of goals, created lots of chances, and made us play,” Mosimane explained. “The difference between Themba and Nurkovic, however, is that Nurkovic plays after seven days whereas Zwane plays after two days (Caf Champions League fixtures). “The mental stress and fatigue are not the same. I just want to show you the difference. The two might be playing the same number of games in the Premier League. "But the other one lands on Monday (Caf assignment) and plays on Wednesday. The other one played on Sunday and he plays again the next Sunday.“It is not related. But that's the difference.“ Mosimane also punted Hlompho Kekana and Lebo Manyama as well as Gaston Sirino and Denis Onyango for individual awards.
