THE Eastern Cape’s top cop has expressed shock over the killing
of a woman by her spouse at a cop shop in Mthatha.  Provincial  Police
Commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga ‘s voice joins many who are still
dumbfounded by the incident that happened at the Madeira cop shop this
afternoon.  Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said, "Preliminary report
suggests that the  28-year-old deceased
had gone to the police to report domestic violence at her place. Whilst she was
busy reporting to the police officer at the Community Service Centre, the
husband entered the station and without saying anything, started shooting at
the wife who succumbed to injuries sustained at the scene.  "The 42-year old suspect who is believed to be working
as a security guard in one of the prominent security companies in Mthatha is
alleged to have attempted to escape after committing this crime but was chased
and arrested by the police."  "The fire-arm he had in his possession was confiscated
and will be sent to the forensic laboratory for ballistic testing," he
said.   “The fact that the suspect followed the deceased all the way
to the police station demonstrates a premeditated onslaught on the woman. This
is very sad and unfortunate. I am however delighted at the rapid move by the
police to arrest the suspect. Acts of Gender Based Violence and Femicide cannot
be forgiven, therefore the suspect must face the law and answer for his
actions” General Ntshinga said.  A murder case has been opened against the suspect for
investigation. Once charged, the suspect will be appearing in Mthatha Magistrate
Court on the murder related charges.
