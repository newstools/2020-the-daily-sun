SuperSport United climbed up to third place on the Absa Premiership standings following a comprehensive 4-1 thumping of Baroka FC at Bidvest Stadium on Wednesday evening. Bakgaga took the lead through Evidence Makgopa but goals from Thamsanqa Gabuza, Grant Kekana, Bradley Grobler and Kudakwashe Mahachi spearheaded Matsatsantsa to all three points. The defeat drops Dylan Kerr's men into 15th place on the log standings and into the relegation playoff places with one game remaining.Good skill from Tshiamo Masiya teed up Makgopa for the game's opener after just eight minutes. The Baroka forward received the ball inside the six-yard area and guided his deflected effort past Ronwen Williams in the SuperSport goal. SuperSport hit back in the 26th minute through Gabuza who nodded home from a free-kick and Baroka were dealt a further blow shortly after as Sbonelo Ngubane received his marching orders. The match official was left with little choice but to show Ngubane a red card mere minutes after coming on for the injured Denwin Farmer, following a horrendous tackle on Matsatsantsa's Guily Manziba who was duly replaced by Mahachi late in the first half.SuperSport made good use of their man advantage after the break and took the lead through Kekana who punished Baroka after they failed to clear from a corner-kick.Grobler doubled the hosts' lead in the 70th minute with a neat back-heal from a Gamphani Lunga cross. The strike took the SuperSport forward up to 14 goals for the campaign as he remains firmly in the running for the golden boot award. Mahachi's rasping shot five minutes later completed the rout as SuperSport boosted their chances of playing in Africa next season.For Baroka, defeat leaves them in a whole heap of trouble heading into a final round showdown versus league leaders Kaizer Chiefs. -Supersport.com
