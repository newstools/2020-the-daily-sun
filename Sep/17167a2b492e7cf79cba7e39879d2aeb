THE SACP does not agree with Cosatu on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s approach to fighting corruption. The party has said the president needs to be supported. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande yesterday told journalists at a conference following the party’s central committee meeting that Ramaphosa demonstrated his commitment to fighting corruption. He said the commitment was cemented at the recent ANC NEC meeting where it was decided members charged with corruption should step aside from their positions. Cosatu, after its central executive committee meeting, criticised the way Ramaphosa was dealing with corruption, saying he was tip-toeing around “criminals” instead of putting his foot down. But the allies have come out of their own meeting batting for the president. “Let’s all stand up against corruption and not throw stones. Let’s mobilise to support the president, that is our approach,” said Nzimande. But the party came out against the leadership of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, who they said was working against workers to please the West. First deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said it was tempting to conclude Treasury represented the conservative and right-wing section of the government. “We have a massive opportunity in this country to grow, but this Treasury has always anchored us in international organisations like the IMF and World Bank,” said Mapaila.
