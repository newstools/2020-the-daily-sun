FORMER 3Sum member Amstel Maboa closed Women’s Month by helping magoshas. Through his new foundation, the Amstel Maboa Foundation, he donated food parcels to 60 sex workers in Mapleton in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, this week. The socialite said he felt he needed to help them because it was Women’s Month. “I handed out food parcels to sex workers because Covid-19 has affected many people and their businesses. I also feel their industry is one that people are afraid of being associated with. “My foundation is about human rights and giving back, among other things. Since it was Women’s Month, I felt I needed to target them. I managed to get them together and give them food parcels and they were grateful,” he said. Amstel said the foundation aimed to do more in the coming years. “It will not just focus on sex workers. We plan to help other people. “We’ll work with the gay community, orphanages, gender-based violence cases and community projects. This foundation wouldn’t be able to help all these people if it wasn’t for dinners. Many companies and people are committed to helping us and have helped a lot with the food parcels.” The musician said he was excited to help people. “This is the beginning of greatness. I’m excited and scared at the same time, but this is the time to give back to communities that have supported me with charity work.”
