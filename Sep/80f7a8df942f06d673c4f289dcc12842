MZANSI made global hit song ‘Jerusalema’ is not loved by big celebrities such as Janet Jackson and Christiano Ronaldo but also his has a fan in President Cyril Ramaphosa! Just before closing his address to the nation on Wednesday evening, the president congratulated Master KG and Nomcebo on their smash global hit which has set off the Jerusalema dance challenge across the world.  He also said fortunately people would be celebrating the Heritage Day in a little more than a week in more favourable conditions as the nation will have moved to alert level 1 of the lockdown.  "I urge everyone to use Heritage Day as family time. To remember those who have lost their lives and to quietly rejoice in the progress we made. I urge everyone to participate in the Jerusalem challenge. Jerusalem a song that I love very much," he said. I urge everyone to use this public holiday as family time, to reflect on the difficult journey we have all travelled, to remember those who have lost their lives, and to quietly rejoice in the remarkable and diverse heritage of our nation.  “And there can be no better celebration of our South African-ness than joining the global phenomenon that is the Jerusalema dance challenge.”  “So, I urge all of you to take up this challenge on Heritage Day and show the world what we are capable of.”  People reacted on Twitter to the president’s request with excitement while some were dreading possibly doing the group dance at their workplace.
