THE family of a pregnant woman found burnt in her car has welcomed the arrest of two suspects. A man (46) and a woman (37) have been bust in connection with the murder of Hlengiwe Ndaba (35) from Estcourt, KZN. Hlengiwe was eight months pregnant when she was burnt to death in July. The arrested woman is believed to be a teacher at the school where Hlengiwe worked. Hlengiwe’s sister, Noxolo (28), told Daily Sun her family was pleased with the arrests. “All we wanted was closure. The DNA results came back positive and we buried my sister on Saturday,” she said. Noxolo said they were shocked to hear one of the suspects was Hlengiwe’s colleague. On 23 July, a burnt bakkie with bullet holes and human remains was found in the Winterton area, and Hlengiwe’s family was convinced the remains were hers. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said they made a breakthrough when they arrested the female suspect. “She appeared in the Weenen Magistrates Court last week and will remain in custody until her next appearance on Thursday. A 46-year-old man was arrested last week in the Emmaus area. “He is expected to appear in the Weenen Magistrates Court soon.” Gwala confirmed that DNA tests confirmed the remains belonged to Hlengiwe.
