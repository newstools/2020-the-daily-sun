THE
Department of Health stated that the number of detected Covid-19 cases
countrywide continued to decline since mid-August. Mzansi has
seen under 3 000 cases a day with the recovery rate reaching almost 90% in the
recent week. But while
the country seems to be controlling transmissions, Wits University announced
that they have resumed with their Oxford Covid-19 (Ox1nCov19) vaccine trial. This week,
the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority and local ethics
committees approved resuming the vaccination in the country. According
to Wits Senior Communications Officer Deborah Minors, the vaccination in the
Ox1nCov19 vaccine trial in the UK paused last week following a medical event in
one trial participant in the UK. She said
the spokesperson for the University of Oxford said the UK’s independent review
process had concluded and following the recommendations of both the independent
safety review committee and the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency, the trials will recommence in the UK. Executive
Director of the Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Analytics Research Unit
(VIDA), Professor Shabir Madh who leads the Ox1nCov19 trial in South Africa,
confirmed yesterday (Wednesday) that vaccination resumed in South Africa on
Tuesday. “The South
African study is overseen by the same independent Data and Safety Monitoring
Committee as in the UK, so all sites in South Africa paused vaccination. “The
South African Health Products Regulatory Authority and Wits University ethics
committees have now approved resuming vaccination and we have done so,” said
Madhi. He said
globally some 18 000 individuals have received study vaccines as part of this
trial. He also
added that trials such as this it was expected that some participants will
become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful
assessment of safety.
