The new home and away kits for Mamelodi Sundowns have officially been unveiled by Puma and it includes the words 50 years with a redesigned team logo. The kit is in refreshed colours of yellow, green and blue, true to the colours of the Brazil national team from which Mamelodi Sundowns earned their nickname The Brazilians.   The nickname extends far beyond shared colours, as Masandawana play with an African-flavoured Samba style inspired by their South American brothers. “PUMA is honoured to be able to continue to partner and support Mamelodi Sundowns, a club which has always lived the ideals of The Beautiful Game. Every match is a carnival with the players bringing fans to their feet, to applaud moments of artistry and to celebrate yet another exhilarating victory,” said Brett Bellinger, PUMA South Africa Marketing Director.
