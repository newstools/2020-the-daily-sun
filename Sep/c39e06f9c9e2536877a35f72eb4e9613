OBERT Salani liked his cellphone. Although it was not a smart phone, it had a torch and radio. This was all he needed in a phone. But Obert’s cellphone was an insult to thugs and he was stabbed for it. The 38-year-old from Plastic View, Tshwane, said he met a group of thugs after playing pool at a local tavern last month. He said the gang demanded money from him. “I told them I didn’t have money and they asked for my phone. “When I showed them my phone, they said I was insulting them,” he said. He said the thugs searched him to satisfy themselves that he had no money or smart phone. “After they realised I only had my phone, one of them produced a knife and stabbed me. “I couldn’t fight back because it was a group and they were armed. I kept apologising for insulting them,” he said. Obert said he went to the clinic after the attack, where he was given a form to open a case. “I didn’t open a case. A lot of people have been robbed here and no one has been arrested. Some of the thugs are illegal foreigners who can’t be traced.” He said he never thought his phone was an insult. “I receive and make calls and it has all I need. I’m not going to buy an expensive phone when there’s so much crime here,” he said.
