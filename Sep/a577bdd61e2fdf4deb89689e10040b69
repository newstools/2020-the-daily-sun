IN Mzansi, an average sheep sells for just under R2000 and the meaty animals are one of the most stolen. But in Scotland in Europe, one sheep was bought for R8-million!Business Insider reports that one ram has just become the world's most expensive sheep after selling at auction for nearly half a million dollars. Double Diamond is a Texel sheep, and it's not unusual for them to be sold with five-figure price tags, according to the Texel Sheep Society. Texel sheep originated on the island of Texel in the Netherlands.   They have a muscular build and produce high-quality lean meat. “The six-month-old sheep was sold following at bidding war at an auction in the town of Lanark, near Glasgow, Scotland on August 27.” “The bidding started at £10,500, about R230,000, and went up quickly to the final selling price of £367,500, about R8.1 million. Diamond was sold by breeder Charlie Boden to three farmers, who hope to breed the sheep.” BI reports that the sheep's selling price blew past the previously set record of  another Texel called Deveronvale Perfection sold for £231,000, or about R5 million in 2009. One of the buyers, Jeff Aiken, told the Guardian he had been eyeing the sheep prior to the auction. "We knew it was going to be something really special. He was just an outstanding animal, backed up by all the best genetics. There was about seven or eight people who really, really wanted him and that's what led to the price," he said.
