BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic head coach, John Maduka, is proud of his players despite losing 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns in the final of the Nedbank Cup at Orlando Stadium on Saturday night. Maduka was pleased with how his team were unflustered by the occasion and kept Sundowns at bay until Gaston Sirino punished them in the 80th minute with the only goal that was enough to see Downs claim the Ke Yona Cup, and the treble. The former Phunya Sele Sele captain has reason not to be too disappointed. This was Celtic’s first loss since the season restarted in the bio-bubble in Gauteng last month. Maduka admitted Sundowns got over the line because of their experience of playing on big stages. This was a first cup final for many Celtic players. “The boys so far have done very well to reach the final. I’m so proud of them,” said Maduka, who suffered his first loss since he was appointed as head coach on 6 July. “It is time to rest now. We are now looking forward to the upcoming season.” But Maduka did express his disappointment that his team failed to close Sirino down before the Uruguayan scored the solitary goal that ensured Downs earn the R7 million prize money. “We should have put pressure, but we allowed Sirino to take a shot after we warned them,” he said. “Sundowns are a team that combine very well and in the final third. They are very, very dangerous. In the second half, I told my players not to drop too much and let’s take the game (to them) so that we can be able to deal with them before they can enter the danger areas.” Despite the loss, Celtic qualified for the Caf Confederation Cup next season as Downs have already qualified for the Caf Champions League as league winners.
