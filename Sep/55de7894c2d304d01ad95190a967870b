Talk is cheap. How many cases of corruption have we heard since democracy was born? We had the Tony Yengeni case, Jackie Selebi’s case, Bheki Cele, Jacob Zuma and now VBS. Recently, we have the Beitbridge border fence corruption scandal, as well as the case linked to the president’s spokeswoman. The list is endless. Just imagine how much money in total was lost in these cases, and how it would have benefitted millions of citizens. A few millions would have built houses for the poor, schools for our kids, roads, running water in remote areas, and improved our security and justice system. But billions have benefitted few people who already have ample means to get by, while the poor are completely drowning in poverty every day. Corruption isn’t only in the ANC-run government, but anyone who gets an opportunity to lay his hands on money joins the looting club. We’re sick and tired of listening to corruption cases day in and day out. How are they changing the situation? Mr President, please. We need the action you have been talking about now. Your comrades are stealing money right under your nose because you’re too soft. The Scorpions must be brought back. - Letter by Elson Chauke, Witbank
