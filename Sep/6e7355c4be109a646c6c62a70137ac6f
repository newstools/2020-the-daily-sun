TOURISM Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubeni led from the front when she took part in the adrenaline-filled zip lining in the drive to get South Africans to explore the country, but had to settle for the light version after her bodyguards refused to allow her to bungee jump. “This is my first time. No, I was not scared at all. The only time I got scared was when I turned around,” she told Daily Sun afterwards. Kubayi-Ngubeni was in Eastern Cape to promote tourism this month, which is dedicated to getting citizens to tour the country. Earlier, she revealed she would speak to the tourism industry to introduce special prices for locals so people can get to know and tour their country. Before taking to bungee-jumping, Kubayi-Ngubeni had to convince her security, who were against her taking part. “They are refusing me to bungee jump. They say I must ask permission from the president. I want to bungee jump,” she said. That left Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane to take the lead, as his bodyguards did not stand in his way. Mabuyane, who said he was breaking his virginity in the activity, took to it like duck to water. “Yhoo! It’s very scary. You see everything from up there. But it takes you up and down,” he later said. The minister will spend the weekend in Tsitsikamma outside Port Elizabeth, where she will be leading activities to get South Africans touring after months of being trapped in lockdown. She’ll also be visiting the Khoi community and villages to encourage people to know their country.
