The case against TV personality and model, Maps Maponyane has been postponed for legal representation. Maps, who is the son of former football star, Marks Maponyane, was wearing blue jeans, a black jacket and brown sneakers. He made his first court appearance before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court on Friday for charges of reckless and negligent driving. When asked if he will need legal aid services or he will conduct his own defence, Maponyane said he will be represented by his own attorney. The 30-year-old who is out on a R500 bail, was arrested while driving in his Mercedes-Benz SUV, towards Mbombela on Wednesday. He was driving at 178km/h in a 120km/h on the N4 toll road near Alkmaar at his time of arrest. State prosecutor Leane Jones asked for the case to be postponed to 29 September for Maponyaneâ€™s legal representative.
