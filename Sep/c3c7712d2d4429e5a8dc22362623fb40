TWO years ago, Lyle Lakay was on the fringes at Mamelodi Sundowns. But now he is part of the big success story unfolding every season at the Tshwane giants.Lakay has bucked the trend of players who arrive at the Brazilians with big expectations, only to grow blisters warming to bench. In fact, he has reflected with pride on the treble success, pointing to some individual moments of brilliance. Those moments include the last-minute free-kick he netted against Maritzburg United in November, as well as the winner against Wits, which sent Sundowns to the Nedbank Cup final. ”Earlier in the season we were 1-1 against Maritzburg and I came on in the last few minutes and scored the goal. The three points eventually contributed to the league title.” With the Nedbank freekick, it all comes down to training. The exact situation that played out with the goal is something that we did at training... the placing of the wall in front of their wall and the direction of the ball.” Lakay, who has now won five major titles in his career, is under no illusion with regard to the challenge he still faces cementing his place in the team. ”One of the main reasons I came to Sundowns was to win trophies, ” Lakay added. ”Actually, I was here on trial in 2014, didn't sign with the club, and went back to Bloemfontein Celtic. Now I have a chance to cement my place in the starting team and if I continue to do well ill hopefully get a call-up to the national team.”
