THREE cops implicated in the killing of Nateniel Julies are expected to hear whether or not they’ll be granted bail. Simon “Scorpion” Ndyalvana (46) and Caylene Whiteboy (23) are facing charges of premeditated murder, defeating the ends of justice, possession of prohibited ammunition and discharging a firearm in public. Foster Netshiongolo (37) is facing charges of being an accessory to murder and defeating the ends of justice. They’re appearing in the Protea Magistrate Court in Soweto. On Monday morning, Nateniel’s family held hands and said a prayer outside the courtroom ahead of the bail judgment. The state has argued that, should the trio be granted bail, that will undermine public order – and that the accused know the witnesses.

Whiteboy, who’s now known to have pulled the trigger, said she thought the gun was still loaded with rubber bullets and did that under the instructions of her senior, Ndyalvana. She said she was threatened by Ndyalvana to lie before court. The court also heard Ndyalvana has three previous convictions, two of which relate to violence. The 16-year-old Nateniel was shot and later died at Chris Hani Barangwanath Hospital last month. His family and community members have since called for the accused to be denied bail.
