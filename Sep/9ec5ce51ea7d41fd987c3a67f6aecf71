A MOM was in her kitchen busy cleaning after the family had dinner. She then heard a knock at the door and went to open. But the 47-year-old mother of two from Enqobheni in KwaMakhutha, south of Durban, didn’t know that she was opening for a hail of bullets that would claim her life. The mother was shot several times and was declared dead in her kitchen after unkown gunmen entered her home yesterday. Her two children aged (12) and (16), who were also with her in the house, were also shot by the gunmen and they were injured. The children were rushed to hospital where they are receiving treatment. A family member, who asked not to be named, said the family is still traumatised following this tragic incident and are not ready to talk about it. “I cant talk right now. We are mourning and scared to even talk about this matter,” said the family member. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the KwaMakhutha SAPS received a complaint of murder at Enqobheni area and police proceeded to the scene. She said on arrival they were informed that a 46-year-old woman was confronted by unknown suspects who opened fire, fatally wounding the woman. “Two children aged between 12 and 16 sustained gunshot wounds on the right knee and abdomen and were taken to hospital for medical attention,” said Gwala. She said charges of murder and attempted murder were opened at KwaMakhutha police station for investigation. “The motive for the attack is uknown,” she said.
