OWEN Da Gama is the right man to lead Venda-based Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the PSL next season. This is the opinion of former Platinum Stars and Maritzburg United midfielder, Tshilidzi Doboro, who worked with Da Gama at Dikwena when they were still called Silver Stars. Da Gama could be without a job if his current club, Highlands Park’s status is sold to Tim Sukazi, who owns GladAfrica Championship side TS Galaxy. Highlands have been sold to Sukazi, but they are waiting for the PSL’s ratification to make it official. “Owen knows the Venda environment very well as he worked in the region for years,” said Doboro “It will be easy for him (Owen) to adapt fast as he knows the weather conditions in Venda. “I wish Tshakhuma can appoint him as he will be available if Highlands are sold.” He added: “Owen is a very experienced coach who knows local football well. “He (Owen) has been with many teams and has done well. “He has also coached national teams and understands our football well. If he is available, Tshakhuma should do their best to get him.” Da Gama had been linked with the Tshakhuma coaching job for a while. Now with Highlands sold, it remains to be seen where Da Gama will be next season. Galaxy have reappointed their former coach Dan Malesela, who helped them win the Nedbank Cup. However, Da Gama’s name has also been mentioned at Galaxy should the sale go through. But Malesela, who made history when he guided the lower division side to the Nedbank Cup victory last season, is already in Siyabuswa.
