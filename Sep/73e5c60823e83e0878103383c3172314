THE case against two officers accused of killing Nateniel Julies has been postponed. Yesterday, Simon Ndyalvana and Caylene Whiteboy made a brief first appearance in the Protea Magistrates Court in Soweto. The two, based at Eldorado Park Police Station, were arrested on Friday and face charges of murder, possession of prohibited ammunition, and defeating the ends of justice. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said one of the accused didn’t have legal representation, and that’s why the matter was postponed.

Members of the EFF were among the people who gathered outside the court to support the Julies family. EFF MP Kenny Motsamai said the accused should be treated like criminals until proven otherwise. “I’m here to support the family and the coloured community. Those who committed the crime must go to jail because they’re killing machines,” he said. Earlier in the day, members of the community gathered outside court and held up placards in support of the Julies family. They called on the court not to grant the accused bail. Nateniel (16), who had Down’s syndrome, was allegedly shot by the cops on Wednesday near his home in Eldorado Park. He later died in hospital. According to his family, he went outside to enjoy a biscuit after dinner when he was shot. The case was postponed to next Thursday and the accused were remanded in custody.
