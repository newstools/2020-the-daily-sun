SHE trusted her uncle and never thought he’d harm her. But he did something that left her scarred for the rest of her life. She said her uncle raped her and told her he’ kill her should she tell anyone. She opened a case a couple of weeks ago and the uncle has been on the run since. The 15-year-old girl from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, and her mother left their home to hide with another family. “We had to leave home because we were living in fear. “We don’t know where he is. Perhaps he is watching us, but we have not seen him,” she said. Residents are baying for the man’s blood. “We are not going to live with people like him. “He has destroyed the life of a young girl,” said a resident. The grade 8 pupil told Daily Sun that on the day she was raped she was preparing food for her other uncle. “He told me to stop making the food. Then he took me to his room,” she said. She said he locked his room and told her to undress and then raped her. She said her uncle is bisexual and she never to be attacked by him. “I’m so hurt.” The girl’s gogo said: “He’s bisexual. He sometimes sleeps with girls, sometimes men. We think he learnt the behaviour of sleeping with men in jail because he was once arrested.” A case of rape was opened at Etwatwa Police Station and cops are looking for the suspect.
