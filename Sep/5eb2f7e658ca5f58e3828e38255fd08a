TUMELO Mannya, who produces a mix of mouth-watering pickled vegetable atchar, says being an entrepreneur is the way to a better life. The 31-year-old from Senwabarwana outside Polokwane is the founder of Soldado T Enterprise whose atchar is a mix of pickled vegetables including cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, onion, green peas, garlic and habbanero peppers. It comes in hot and spicy, mild and spicy and garlic flavours. Tumelo told the People’s Paper she wanted to pursue her passion for food through her business. “All my products were started from scratch until I finally got the best product I believed people would love and enjoy.” She said she loved doing things at her own pace, being self-directed and helping others in creating employment. “I am young entrepreneur who loves to experience different things and face every challenge I come across.” Tumelo said in the beginning, money management, balancing quality with growth and acquiring new clients was tough. “However being in the business for years now has taught me a lot and with the experience, I am a different person from previous years. In life, I believe hard work will always outweigh talent. It is crucial that as young entrepreneurs we have enough confidence to accept our faults and learn from the past.” She also said education was the best investment one could make in business. “We need to be consistent in business and also design rules around customers for us to survive.” She said that was because time was a valuable asset in business. Tumelo’s dream was to see her business growing. “I believe this will see my business being able to fight the unemployment the country is facing. Having several branches across the country is one of my goals I want to achieve as an entrepreneur,” she said.
