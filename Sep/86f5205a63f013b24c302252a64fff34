MURDER suspect Sinovuyo Selela was denied bail when he appeared before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga yesterday. The 28-year-old was charged with conspiracy to commit murder after the death of Hawks investigator Lieutenant-Colonel Leroy Bruwer (49), who was part of the Hawks’ serious organised crime, wildlife-trafficking investigation team in Mpumalanga. Bruwer was allegedly shot and killed on his way to work along the R36 between Nelspruit and Sabie on 17 March. Hawks spokeswoman Captain Lucy Sekgotodi said Selela was bust after handing himself over to police in Tsolo, Eastern Cape on 7 April, apparently admitting to have assisted in the murder. “He made several court appearances to get bail, but it was vigorously opposed by the investigators and the court denied the accused bail,” she said. The case has been postponed to 3 November for further police investigation.
