DURBAN businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize could be in hot water with the PSL. It is alleged MaMkhize, as she known, has been involved in the running of GladAfrica Championship club Real Kings despite the fact she has been barred from owning or being involved in another club as she is currently serving a 12 month cooling off period as per the league’s rules following her resignation as co-chairperson of another Championship club Royal Eagles. SunSport has learnt her case will be dealt with on Monday. The case stems from her resignation from Eagles last year in a bitter split with her ex-husband Sbu Mpisane. When they reached a settlement of 50-50 on who takes what within the club, Mkhize took some of her players and staff and loaned them to another KwaZulu-Natal side Kings. It is alleged she was directly involved in the running affairs of Kings which is owned by Bongani Ngidi. “The PSL is dealing with the matter of Real Kings and Shauwn Mkhize,” said the insider. “She didn’t serve the cooling period and she entered games where she wasn’t allowed to.” This is not the only matter Kings are set to be sanctioned for. The club will also face the PSL DC for breaking Covid-19 regulations as they failed to adhere to the NSL Covid-19 protocols. At this stage, it is not clear what regulation or regulations the club broke from the NSL protocols that all 32 clubs were required to adhere to when the season restarted last month in a bio bubble in Gauteng. PSL prosecutor Nande Becker could not comment on the cases he is dealing with. “Luxolo September (PSL media manager) will release the findings (on Monday),” said Becker without going into details. “But I can tell you Real Kings are involved.”
