WHEN Ben Mkhatshwa saw a woman in need of a place to stay, he offered her a part of his shack. But little did he know that his good gesture would land him in trouble. Now the 63-year-old from Plastic View, Tshwane, can no longer live in his home. He said the woman left, but her two adult sons have been terrorising him. He said the sons told him he should leave his shack if he wanted to live in peace. “I have been living here for eight years and these men have been living with me for seven months, but they want to take over my home,” he said. Madala Ben said the woman, who is known as Martha, came in February and only lived with him for two months. “She left without saying anything. I don’t even know where she went and her sons also don’t want to tell me because I wanted to report them to her,” he said. He said the sons terrorised him so much he feared for his life. The madala said they made noise when he was sleeping by hitting the shack and bringing their friends to booze throughout the night. “I’m afraid to confront them. “My health is not good and they are doing everything in their power to have me move out,” he told Daily Sun. Madala Ben said he reported them to community leaders, but they also struggled to chase them away. One of the community leaders, Joseph Mhlanga, said it was difficult for them to chase the men away as the madala gave their mother a place to stay. He said they didn’t approve what they have been doing to the old man and they tried to talk to them. “We don’t know what to do anymore. Ben complains to us almost every day. “We are looking for a stand for him where he can build his shack and live in peace,” he said. When the People’s Paper tried to contact the two men they refused to comment.
