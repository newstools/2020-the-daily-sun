JAZZ musician Abdullah Ibrahim will be happy to know he has a great fan in Pitso Mosimane. But his namesake, Safa head of referees Abdul Ebrahim, perhaps not. Ebrahim recently came under fire for his interpretation of the disallowed goal in a league match between Kaizer Chiefs and Baroka. And Mosimane seemingly doesn't know who Ebrahim is, seeing as he mistook him for the pianist. ”That guy, Abdul Ebrahim, I thought it's that guy who is a musician. Do you know the song Mannenberg?” Mosimane said. It could have all been said in jest, but Mosimane didn't mince his words as he laid into the referees' boss. ”I said, ’Who is this guy?’ But I realised this guy didn't talk about the Baroka goal that Orlando Pirates conceded. That was offside. ”When Gaston Sirino scored against Polokwane City, he didn't complain about it. He went to Kaizer Chiefs. ”He must comment about other goals that Sundowns didn't get. I don't know why he goes to Chiefs. I mean, the last time there was another debate about that goal that touched Castro's hair and they chose Sundowns against Chiefs, and all the time for Chiefs, why? "What about those people who might be relegated and missed the top eight? There have been many mistakes that referees have done in the bubble. We can all see. ”So sometimes I do complain, yes. But I also have to be objective to say, 'You know what, there has been a lack of consistency.' "What I'm disappointed in is this Abdul Ebrahim guy. I mean, does he wants to be famous or what? Who is this guy?"
