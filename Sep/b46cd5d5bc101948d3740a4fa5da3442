TODAY, a defence lawyer in former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede’s case told the court the Hawks brought fruit and vegetables to their interview with a state witness. Advocate Griffiths Madonsela, representing eThekwini municipal manager Sipho Nzuza, said investigators brought fruit and vegetables for Nzuza’s 84-year-old mother, claiming cops wanted to bribe her to get a statement against her son. Madonsela said his client viewed the action as bribery because it wasn’t common for police to buy groceries when they went to take statements and the aim was to get her to testify against her son. Magistrate Dawn Sumaroo ruled that the state prosecutor should investigate and come with an explanation when the case resumed on 10 December. The court was expected to hear a permanent stay of application by Gumede but the state said it has finished the investigation and was ready for trial. Prosecutor Ashika Lakan said the state needed three months to finalise forensic reports and its report would be ready by 10 December. Gumede’s lawyer Jay Naidoo postponed the application until 10 December. He said his client would bring the application if the state again asked for another postponement. Speaking to supporters outside court, Gumede lashed out at the prosecutor for another postponement. She said it was surprising that for a year and five months, the state was still failing to provide her with charges. “Comrades, our arrest is an attack on the ANC, so you must rise up and defend the organisation. This prosecutor again today failed to give us charges. We are under attack here, therefore it is up to you as branches to deal with this.” Gumede and 20 co-accused, including municipal officials and councillors face corruption charges in relation to the R208 million waste tender scandal. She was bust last year and is out on R50 000 bail.
