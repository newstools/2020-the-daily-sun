Dear MizzB I’M a 17-year-old girl who is confused about her sexuality. I am attracted to boys and sometimes to girls.  Does it mean I am gay? Dear Sistas Being attracted to both genders is something that happens quite often. Just because you are attracted to someone does not always mean you want to date them. During teenage years, that is when a lot of emotions and feelings come to play. This is to help you find and identify your sexuality. Don’t jump into conclusions and label yourself. You’re still in the exploration stage.
