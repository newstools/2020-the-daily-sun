WE BOW our heads in honour of the contributions that George Bizos has made to our democracy. These were the words of President Cyril Ramaphosa when he paid tribute to the renowned human rights lawyer, who died on Wednesday at the age of 92. Political parties, civil society and prominent people all sang from the same hymn book to pay tribute to Bizos, who left a glorious legacy of fighting for justice and equality. Ramaphosa said he spoke to Bizos two months ago and he was already not in good health. The ANC, whose many leaders Bizos represented during apartheid, said the country has lost a champion of the downtrodden. “As a lawyer, Bizos was fearless, principled, committed and a legendary cross-examiner who was ruthlessly effective in exposing the lies, brutality and moral bankruptcy of the apartheid regime,” the party said.  The EFF said Bizos, against the wishes of the UDF, represented Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela during the Stompie trial. “His loyalty to the cause of freedom and human rights can never be doubted, and his integrity was reaffirmed when he declined judicial and political positions offered to him,” the party said. The DA said: “Bizos spent his life in service of his country and advocated for the rights and dignity of the most vulnerable members of our society. “A giant has fallen,” the party said in its tribute.  Cope, whose leader Mosioa Lekota was represented by Bizos, described him as a people’s hero who placed the freedom of the people before personal gains. Former Joburg mayor and head of Action SA Herman Mashaba said he was saddened by Bizos’ death.
