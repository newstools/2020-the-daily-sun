NORTH West Arts and Culture MEC Galebekwe Tlhapi has shared her story of recovering from Covid-19 earlier this year. The 40-year-old tested positive in July and recovered within three weeks. Tlhapi said keeping a positive attitude helped her fight the deadly virus. Speaking about her symptoms, she said: “I went from feeling better to feeling extremely cold.”  She said she was very scared of the virus because she feared infecting her loved ones. “Drinking warm fluids and steaming helped me a lot. I am grateful for the support I got from work. Colleagues kept me going.” Tlhapi said the responses she received from family members made her realise there were still people who didn’t understand the coronavirus. “The stigma is there, but I couldn’t let negativity get to me.” Tlhapi appealed to people to always wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth when in public.
