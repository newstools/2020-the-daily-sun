EFF’s Selloane Motjeane is facing disciplinary action after taking a naked photo with other women. The photo of the acting regional secretary of the Fezile Dabi District in the Free State went viral a few days ago. Motjeane posed for the photo along with six other naked women, none of whom were wearing masks or observing social distancing. Provincial secretary Bosanku Msimanga said the party supported the message against GBV the women were sending with the photo but took issue with the group’s failure to adhere to lockdown regulations. Daily Sun spoke to Motjeane, who didn’t want to comment further about the photo and would only say: “What Bosanku Msimanga has told you is the truth.” Msimanga said: “We are aware that Covid-19 rules were broken. “There are internal processes and we are still engaging with Motjeane. We take this pandemic seriously.” Motjeane said the photo was taken by the women to show that their bodies belonged to them and no one else. Msimanga said: “Remember this thing of the government forcing sterilisation on women who are HIV-positive? “The message behind the photo is about that, and also about women who are raped in South Africa. “The photo was taken two weeks ago and the message was directed at closing Women’s Month with the fight against GBV,” he said. “In that regard, we applaud their efforts as far as promoting and raising the women’s flag in South Africa. Our only concern is the social distancing.”
