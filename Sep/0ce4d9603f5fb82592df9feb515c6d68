South Africa needs a public service that’s ethical, value driven and rejects corruption. Corruption steals from the poor, undermines service delivery, and stifles economic growth. The Constitution outlines values that should be embraced by our public service: which include a high standard of professional ethics, development orientation, responsiveness and fairness, and encouraging public participation in public policy making. Public servants are expected to use public resources effectively and economically, and services rendered to citizens should be without discrimination. These values are the steering mechanisms for the achievement of a professional and effective public service that’s transparent and accountable, as envisaged by the African Charter on values and Principles of Public Service and Administration. The increasing expressions of dissatisfaction by citizens in the form of petitions and service delivery protests are not only about service delivery. They’re also about the failure of public servants to remain accountable and responsive to the needs of the very people they are meant to serve. It’s also about the failure to include the poor and voiceless in development programmes meant to improve their well-being. The public service must be about citizen-oriented institutions. Strong institutions depend on the professionalism, career orientation, performance and, in our context, the representatives, especially race, gender and disability of the public service personnel corps. Our public service must put the people first as directed by the Batho Pele principle. Letter by Bushy Green.
