FUMING residents belonging to a political party Better Residents Association (BRA), formerly known as Bushbuckridge Residents Association, marched to Brooklyn Plantation in Bushbuckridge on Saturday. Supported by the EFF, which was led by Mapex Molobela, they demanded Delta Mokoena to step down as party president. But Mokoena was not available when they handed over their memorandum of grievances. Association spokesman Advice Lebjane said: “Mokoena is cheeky and everyone is fed up with his dictatorship. He knew we were coming here to handover the memorandum, but a lady told us he instructed her not to sign our memorandum.” Association interim president, Olifant Machate, said they were consulting their legal advisors for a way forward and for an elective conference, so they could restructure the party. “We also demand that all six councillors expelled from the party be reinstated with immediate effect. Mokoena has hated me since we were in the ANC because he knew I was stronger and more active than him,” said Machate.  He said Mokoena, ANC Mpumalanga acting chairman Mandla Ndlovu and politician Milton Morema were friends when they were in the ANC, but fought. Machate said Mokoena and former secretary Cleopas Maunye destabilised the BRA in 2016. However, Maunye said Machate was making up the whole story. Mokoena rubbished these claims against him. “They lost the case in the high court. I’m the party president,” he said.
