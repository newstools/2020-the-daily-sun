THE coronavirus pandemic has delivered a devastating blow to featherweight contender Aphiwe Masangwana’s career. The Eastern Cape fighter was eyeing the national featherweight championship, but the Covid-19 outbreak has wrecked his plans. He moved to Gauteng in a quest to realise his goal. Masangwana said that he has given up on his short-term goal. “Covid-19 has set most of us back. I moved to Joburg with the hope to take my boxing career to the next level. “My aim was to get a fight to get back to winning ways and strengthen my confidence, but the unexpected struck (with the virus),” said Masangwana. In his last contest, the promising fighter suffered a knockout defeat against an equally talented Thembani Mbangatha in December in a SA title eliminator. According to the up-and-coming pugilist from Duncan Village, he is taking a break from boxing as there is no hope that he will get any action this year. He is working as a personal trainer in one of the Joburg’s fitness facilities. “I will not renew my license this year. We are left with only a few months before the end of the year and there is no guarantee I will get a fight. I decided to focus on getting an income while there is no boxing,” he said. However, Masangwana, who was trained by top East London’s trainer Mzamo “Chief” Njekanye, has not joined any boxing gym in Gauteng.
