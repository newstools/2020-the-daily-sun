The battle for the final spot in the Premiership next season has begun. And Ajax Cape Town have laid down a marker early on. This after they came from behind to beat fellow GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 3-2 in a thriller played at Rand Stadium yesterday. Eleazer Rodgers, Sonwabile Mfecane and Kegan Johannes were on the scoresheet for the Urban Warriors with Thembisani Nevhulamba and Tebogo Thangwane scoring for TTM. The two Championship sides are battling it out with top flight outfit Black Leopards for the remaining spot in the money spinning Premiership next season. The Urban Warriors narrowly missed out on automatic promotion to the land of milk and honey. They finished second behind champions Swallows FC, who are back in the top flight after a five year absence that saw them plunge as low as the third tier. Ajax are desperate to make their second chance at promotion count as they look to avoid spending a third season in the second tier of Mzansi football. TTM, on the other hand, are already guaranteed a spot in the top flight next season after they bought Bidvest Witsâ€™ status. However, the Limpopo outfit, who sold their own status for a reported R10 million, are looking to earn promotion on the field and leave the club in good position for the new owner. The new owner, Simon Malatjie, is set to rename the team Sekhukhune United and will be based in Limpopo.  The next play-off match will be between Leopards and the Urban Warriors at FNB Stadium on Wednesday (3pm).
