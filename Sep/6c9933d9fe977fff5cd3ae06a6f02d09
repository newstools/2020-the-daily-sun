BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt is again faced with a selection headache as many of his regulars will miss the penultimate Absa Premiership game of the season against relegation haunted Black Leopards at FNB Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Hunt will be without his skipper Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo, who picked up his fourth booking in their 1-0 victory over leaders Kaizer Chiefs at the same venue on Sunday, and is suspended for this match. Hlatshwayo’s defensive partner, Buhle Mkhwanazi, is also out with a groin injury. Other players who will miss the clash through injury are Thabang Monare, Solly Khunyedi and Brandon Petersen. Hunt said he’ll be forced to play some of his the under-19 team players against Leopards. “We need a centre back pairing and more than likely I’ll give an under-19 centre back a debut,” said Hunt. “We have given few youngsters debuts already and others will play on Wednesday. But under the circumstances, we have done well with what we have.” He has given debuts to youngsters such as Lisakhanya Mlonyeni, Janovane September, Keenan Philips, Mpho Mathebula, Cuwen Prince and rising star Rowan Human. With the 99-year-old club having been sold, Hunt wants to finish in style. “For me, the biggest accomplishment was producing many young players and that will live long in my memory. Giving them opportunities, earning more money, and sad that it’ll come to an end next week (when Wits cease to exist after the club was recently bought by Limpopo businessman Masala Malaudzi).” Wits still have a mathematical chance of snatching the league title. “When you come to this time of the season with a few games to go, sometimes a point is not bad,” said Hunt, who has won four league titles. “The pressure is immense, especially for Chiefs because it is a club that is expected to win trophies. What you do between now and the next game is important.”
