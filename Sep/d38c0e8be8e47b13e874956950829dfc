A VIDEO of a police van lying on its side next to the road has been doing the rounds on social media. It’s not clear where or when the video was taken but the van appears to have been in an accident. The 29-second video was taken by a passenger of a taxi that passed the van. The people in the taxi can be heard saying the van is from Inanda Police Station, north of Durban. A voice is heard saying in Zulu: “Take a video, These are police. They often say it’s the Polo drivers, why is this? If you want to see police officers throwing away alcohol, come to Inanda.” As the taxi drives off, someone opens the door of the van and it looks like people are climbing out of it. The video then ends. A 34-year-old resident, who asked not to be named, said it was possible that the cops were drinking in the van and got into an accident. “I hope they are charged for damaging the state’s property,” said the resident. Another resident (44) said VW Polo drivers were usually blamed for drinking and driving, causing accidents, but it seemed like the cops had also started doing it. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that two cops had an accident while driving in Inanda on 29 August at 9 am. She said there was no alcohol in the cop’s van. “A case of reckless and negligent driving is being investigated by Inanda SAPS after the state car overturned,” said Gwala.
