IN THE latest edition of her Showmax reality show Life With Kelly Khumalo, the singer bares her soul on Senzo Meyiwa’s death. She tells her psychologist Anele Siswana she had nothing to do with his death and that out of all the men she has dated, she loved him the most. “He was the only man I’ve ever loved from all the men I’ve dated. I have been labelled as a killer and as the woman who kills men. “I can’t even sit next to you and take a picture with you, they are going to say I’m going to kill you,” she said, tearing up. Kelly said if she really killed Senzo, why then would she roam around freely without being arrested? “I must really be that powerful. How can I work around with blood on my hands if I killed Senzo? Society has taken my loss and used it against me. This hurts me, because I’m not the person to justify myself to anyone. “How can people, who don’t know me and who have never met me think like that about me or my journey?” asked the mother of two. “There are so many murders that go unresolved in South Africa and you want blame me for Senzo’s murder? I’ve been carrying this hurt for a very long time”. This episode comes on the back of City Press reports that Kelly allegedly hired a hitman to kill Senzo.
