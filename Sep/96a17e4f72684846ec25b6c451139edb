ONE of Mzansi’s busiest Ministers has heeded President Cyril
Ramaphosa’s call for South Africans to participate in the Jerusalema challenge
in honour of Heritage Day today. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and his team took time from leading
the country’s Covid-19 fight and participated in the wildly popular global Jerusalema
challenge. The song by Master KG and Nomcebo is one of the biggest in the
world, having been posted by the likes of Christiano Ronaldo and Janet Jackson
among others. The smash hit song which is traditionally a gospel song has
also become an anthem for healthcare workers across the world who are fighting
the Covid-19 pandemic and a chance to take a break and celebrate some of their
successes. In his last address to the nation last Wednesday, President Ramaphosa
not only announced Mzansi’s moving to alert Level 1 but also urged people to
take part in the dance challenge. Mkhize said people must the challenge to have fun and uplift
themselves as the country has experienced a difficult time. “We still have possibly difficult times ahead, but this is
to  take a break. This song represents
that during a crisis we found space to be loving to be compassionate to enjoy
ourselves and to comfort and encourage each other”, said the Minister.  The Ministry of Health has accepted President Cyril Ramaphosa's challenge to participate in the #JerusalemaChallenge ! Happy #HeritageDay South Africa! Watch the full video here:https://t.co/uWobZFcyqI
