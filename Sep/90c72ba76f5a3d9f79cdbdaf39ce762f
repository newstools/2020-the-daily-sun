A lot of professionals, especially in the healthcare sector, are job hunting as it is. One would think that a stable and constant salary should be enough, especially considering that the health sector is one of a few sectors where jobs were not lost during lockdown. But as reality shows, there’s more to work than just money. Some people can make it hard for you to enjoy being at work. Unhappiness at work can be caused by employers or fellow employees. There are also issues of some employers not wanting employers to take their leave when they want to. In other instances, employees do not get bonuses or danger allowances. Healthcare workers work tremendously hard. The least they ask for is to feel appreciated and respected in the work place. Letter by Sibongumusa
