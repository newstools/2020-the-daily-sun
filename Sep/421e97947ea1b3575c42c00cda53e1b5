EXPERTS say sex is a physical and emotional cocktail. While there’s a lot of emphasis on penetrative sex, which apparently only amounts to 20% of orgasms, we tend to forget sex goes beyond 4-5 sizes and sex positions. Sex therapist Vanessa Marin says the ability to use your hands can come in useful during sex. Here are some tips to master the art of fingering during sex. The skin around the genitals is very sensitive. You don’t want your fingers pulling and tugging at the skin when touching them. Lubrication provides fertile ground for you to plant your sexual pleasures. The woman’s outer labia has two lips covered in pubic hair. This is the main area you should be focusing on and it can be traced even when clothed. A gentle rubbing around the outer and inner labia is enough to arouse her. Every person’s body responds differently to touching, so there’s no harm in gradually locating where she likes to be touched. Women like either to be touched on the clitoris through fingering or usual penetrative sex. Sexologists agree focusing on the clitoris will hit the right notes during sex. Constant clitoris stimulation and finding the right stimulus rhythm is key and will almost certainly leads to her climaxing.
