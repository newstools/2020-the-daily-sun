THEY should be making millions of rands, but are instead living in poverty. This is because the money they make from a farm has allegedly vanished into thin air. Now 37 beneficiaries of De Paarl Farm near Lichtenburg, North West are crying foul and want the people who were appointed to handle the farm’s finances held accountable. In 2006, government restored the farm and said it was ready for production. The beneficiaries immediately started working on the farm and received skills development from government. They used part of the land to farm crops and livestock while other hectares were leased to other farmers. In 2014, beneficiaries complained that the farm generated money, but they had not yet received their dividends. The committee they appointed to handle the finances could not give answers on what happened to the profits. One of the beneficiaries, David Lesabe, said they wanted investigations to be speedily conducted. “Our farm makes millions of rands, but we are still living in poverty. Our millions vanished right in front of our eyes. We know how the farm works. We know the crops it produces, but that is where it ends and we do not know who our committee sells these crops to.” De Paarl Farm managing director, Trevor Ngesman, asked for five minutes to prepare answers, but failed to pick up his cellphone afterwards.
