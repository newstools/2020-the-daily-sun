“WHAT you see is what you get from me,” said Gavin Hunt about his achievement in South African football. According to the former Bidvest Wits coach, no one has approached him at Kaizer Chiefs, but he surely hopes they do sooner than later. Chiefs fired their coach Ernst Middendorp on Wednesday before releasing his assistant Shaun Bartlett the following day. “We are aware that the supporters are hurting, and the outcry is too loud to ignore. “It is important for our loyal supporters to know that we feel their pain. We are a listening organisation and we respect their right to express their dissatisfaction with the team’s overall performance,” said Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung when announcing Middendorp’s sacking. Now with Chiefs fans calling on the club to bring in Hunt, who is freely available after Wits was sold, it remains to be seen whether Motaung will live up to his promise by roping in Hunt, or will consider other options like the vocal Benni McCarthy. Hunt and McCarthy’s names have been bandied about by Chiefs fans as the club pick up the pieces after a terrible season that gave them false hope since November last year. The 56-year-old Hunt yesterday told SunSport that he appreciates the support and call from Chiefs fans who want him in Naturena, but he reiterated that he hasn’t been contacted. But he promised that there will be another game for him soon, maybe one day, he said giving an impression that he has not retired. “There’s nothing I can guarantee you now,” Hunt said. “I would like to get involved in football in another project somewhere, but right now there’s nothing. We’ll just wait and see what transpires, if anything transpires.” Hunt previously won a treble with SuperSport United, and could be the man to take Amakhosi out of their misery of having not tasted a trophy in almost five years.
