TWO suspects have been terrorising residents since 2015 and no one could pin them down. But Sergeant Nkhato Raseboka finally bust them and on Friday they were handed sentences of 60 and 30 years by the Springs Regional Court, Ekurhuleni, for armed robbery with aggravating circumstances. Residents of KwaThema and Tsakane praised Raseboka for his dedication to his work. Thapelo Motaung (44) said: “We want cops like him to fight crime in our community. “Those thugs have been terrorising us and we’re relieved they are finally behind bars.” Sonnyboy Nyathi (63) told the SunTeam: “We encourage him to continue with the good work and arrest more.” Raseboka, who is with the Ekurhuleni Trio Task Team and is based at KwaThema Police Station, told Daily Sun last year he was tasked with looking at armed robbery cold cases from between 2015 and 2018.  “I worked hard following leads until I cracked the case and bust the suspects,” he said. Raseboka said the experience he had gained over the years as a detective and his passion for the job made him remain optimistic that justice would prevail.  His investigation positively linked suspects to a number of robberies. Thamsanqa Ephraim Zwane (36) and Mafika Alfie Mabena (32) were arrested on 20 February last year. They were both later found guilty of robbery with aggravating circumstances. They were sentenced without possibility of parole and declared unfit to possess a firearm. “I will continue to fight to get criminals off the streets,” said Raseboka.
