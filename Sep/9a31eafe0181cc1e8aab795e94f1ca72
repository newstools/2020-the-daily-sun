GLOVES are off!  This is how one may sum up the sale of Highlands Park to businessman Tim Sukazi of TS Galaxy. SunSport understands that Sinky Mnisi appeared before the PSL executives on Monday where he was interrogated on his disapproval of the sale of the Premiership club. The information reaching SunSport is that the club’s co-director has written to the league expressing his protest against the team being sold “behind his back”. “Yes, I can confirm the fact that I was called by the league into a meeting on Monday and put up my case. There was consultative correspondence with the league but the response and outcome thereof will be sent to my legal team,” Mnisi said. It is, however, unclear when will the league respond to Mnisi’s legal team but indications are that the fight for the sale of the club might take longer than anticipated. It is believed that the announcement was due to be made this week. Legal experts consulted by SunSport said Mnisi might be in a tight corner but it will be difficult for him to win the case, especially that he is a minority shareholder. “When the people who contributing financially to the running of the club say they are no longer able to sustain running the club and opted to sell, then Mnisi cannot stop them. Much as he has a case to fight for, but it will be difficult for him to win it,” said our expert.
