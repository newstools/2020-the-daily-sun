THINGS will be different this year at the cultural festival the Zulu nation prides itself on, the Umkhosi WoMhlanga reed dance. In the past, thousands of maidens from across the province came to Enyokeni Palace in Nongoma, KZN. But this year only 30 are allowed and will arrive at the royal palace today. All other maidens are expected to observe this important day at their homes due to Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini will deliver his keynote address on different media platforms today. Royal spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu said this year’s ceremony will focus on gender-based violence. He said instead of the king being presented with reeds, he will be presented with placards with messages against violence. “The king requested only 30 maidens from those who have undergone processes of getting married and would be attending the ceremony for the last time.” Zulu said the chosen maidens will present placards to the king on behalf of all maidens. “The king has always used the Reed Dance to educate society on vital social issues such as practising sexual morals and behaviour.” He said this time, the king will focus on the fight against GBV and the coronavirus pandemic. “The king has requested the Department of Arts and Culture to work with maiden guardians in the entire province to identify at least 30 maidens who will partake and represent thousands that will this year not embark on this year’s usual reed dance,” he said.
