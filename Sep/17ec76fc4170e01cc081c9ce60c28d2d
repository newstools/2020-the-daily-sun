NEHAWU will stage a national strike over proper PPE and protection of its members today. Yesterday, shop stewards went to health institutions to reassure workers they’d fight to get them adequate PPE and danger pay as they worked in risky conditions during the pandemic. Speaking to Daily Sun outside Ahmed Kathrada Private Hospital in Lenasia, regional secretary Mzikayise Tshontshi said: “Nehawu took a decision to take action because a lot of our members are infected by the coronavirus and are dying. “Many employers aren’t providing adequate PPE.  “A lot of our members work under difficult conditions and are not receiving danger allowance. “They’re exposed to conditions that are very hazardous with no protection.” A few days ago Nehawu visited Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto and Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Joburg to deliver a message of support to health workers. Tshontshi told Daily Sun: “We’re here to thank them for the hard work. “We want them to continue working under these difficult conditions, so we’re here to pass the message that Nehawu is with them. MAPS MAPONYANE ARRESTED! “We’re with them under the conditions they were working under and they must trust that we’ll fight for adequate protection in the workplace.” Nehawu will hand over a memorandum of grievances today to President Cyril Ramaphosa and Premier David Makhura. Tshontshi said: “We’re demanding provision of adequate PPE and respect for collective bargaining processes. “In the public service, government and parastatals fail to implement agreements.”
