IN high school, Koketso Motau used to mimic some of Thobela FM presenters in front of 30 pupils in the classroom. “I’d record myself presenting a show and claimed that I work for the station. They believed me and one day my teachers encouraged me to pursue a career in radio presenting,” said Koketso. Today, the 30-year-old from GaMathabatha Village in Limpopo is the host of Moswa le Bokamoso on Thobela FM from Monday to Friday, between 2pm and 3pm. His show has more than 500 000 listeners. Koketso speaks to the youth and tackles social issues, career guidance and politics. He said his show is a platform where people’s lives are changed. “It fulfils me to know that I have helped somebody. Every day I leave the studio refreshed and renewed.” Last year, he invited drug addicts and different professionals, such as social workers, cops, medical doctors and representatives from rehabilitation centres to his show. Koketso said the outcome of the special broadcast, which was held in an auditorium, won him the Promotions Event for Public Broadcast Service award at the Radio Awards. “This shows I’m not just telling stories, but providing solutions.” He’s passionate about radio and haworked for Radio 702’s Eyewitness News as a journalist between 2016 and 2018 before joining Thobela FM in April 2018. Koketso joined Thobela after taking part in the station’s talent search for new and youthful voices. “My first show was Moshito from noon to 3pm on Sundays. I presented it for a year,” he said. His ex-classmates and teachers would always remember him as an entertainer who mimicked Moloko Mashamaite and the late Joe Mabotja.
