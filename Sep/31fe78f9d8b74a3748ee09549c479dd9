When Daily Sun contacted Nelly, she said she wasn’t drunk. “That video was not a mistake. “I hear people say I was showing off my punani, but I wasn’t,” she said. Nelly said she always danced without panties on. “That’s my brand. I like showing off my bum,” she said. “The point of the video is to tell people I am back. I was advertising my work in that video. I was working.” Nelly said that her new music video will be released tomorrow. Many social media users had a lot to say about Nelly’s video.
