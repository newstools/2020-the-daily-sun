MODERN Pedi traditional music singer Aubrey Komane, better known as Sekobo, has the ability to teach the youth about the value of heritage. Sekobo (35) said it is important to preserve our culture and tradition through food, attire, music and dance. On one of his songs, Bjala bja Bakgalabje from his first Pedi traditional album with the same title released last year, Sekobo makes us aware that traditional beer can be used when we communicate with our ancestors. “It’s part of our daily gesture to respect our ancestors because they send positive vibes towards us and influence events in our lives.” ALSO READ | ACTRESS ZINHLE MABENA BACK ON ISIBAYA His new album, Magwadigwatjana has a hit song called Diroba. “Diroba is a sorghum mixed with ashes used to welcome the bride, groom and elders when they come from Mafoiyeng (a sacred place outside the yard where elders instil discipline to the bride and groom during a wedding day),” he said. Born in Tsatlane Village in Sekhukhune, Limpopo, Sekobo used to be a lead and tenor player for Bashimane Ba Tsatlane Brass Band. “This is where I fell in love with music and since then I’ve been hooked,” she said.
