SOUTH Africa’s Olympic team coach, David Notoane, says he was impressed with the young players in the recent bio-bubble camp. Notoane was monitoring the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship games with an eagle eye, as he will be starting with preparations for the Tokyo Japan 2020 Olympic Games, which will be played next July and August. “From the GladAfrica Championship, we’ve seen a lot of players getting their opportunity,” Notoane said. “With the fixtures being compressed the way they were, we also realised that most of them can handle the pressure and that is giving us more options as we are looking at starting preparations for the Olympic Games. “As the technical team, we have been wondering if some of these players can perform on the big stage and handle pressure but after the bubble, we are convinced. We saw quality, even the likes of Rowan Human, who will represent the Under-20 team in the Fifa World Cup were exceptional when pitted against the big boys. It is interesting times with such talent at our disposal.” The Tokyo Olympic Games will start on 23 July until 8 August next year after being postponed for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Olympics will still be called Tokyo 2020 despite taking place next year. The former Mamelodi Sundowns MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach said they are still negotiating to get training matches in the upcoming Fifa break in October. He said: “At the moment we are facing unpredictable times. It is very tough as borders are still closed, so we are not sure if we will be able to get one or two friendly matches to put these players in the set-up. “We have to negotiate with the government. But we would love to have warm-up matches in the upcoming Fifa break, but it is difficult.”
