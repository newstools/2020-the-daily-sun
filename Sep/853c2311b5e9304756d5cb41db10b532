THERE was water shortage in Makau, North West about two weeks ago. And the shortage affected the clinic in the area. There is now a smell coming from the clinic, affecting nurses and patients. Nurses claimed that instead of providing water trucks, the Department of Health said they should use sanitisers as an alternative. A nurse told Daily Sun: “We do not even mop the floor. “Pregnant women have to use a toilet that does not flush. “This can be dangerous, but we just have to do it.”  Another nurse said the department should close the clinic temporarily to protect them and the community. “We are health professionals. “We cannot be allowed to work in such conditions. “Can they at least make provisions to refill the tank, so that we can have water?” asked the nurse. “We work on top of filth everyday. “It’s unhygienic.” Resident Malebo Mokgantshi said he had no choice, but to keep on going to the clinic. He said he had a wound that needed to be dressed frequently. “It is the nearest clinic and I need my wound to be dressed,” he said. Another patient, Lerato Moiloa, said they avoided the smell by wearing masks. “Corona helped us because at least we put on face masks, but the situation at that clinic is appalling,” she said. North West Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said he has since asked the district manager to give him a full report about why the clinic didn’t have water.
