ANGRY former Western Cape Boxing South Africa (BSA) provincial manager, Mickey Klaas, has expressed his disappointment after he was removed from his position. The veteran boxing administrator claimed that the local boxing regulatory body terminated his contract without giving him a reason. Last week, Boxing SA advertised the Western Cape provincial manager’s post. Said Klaas: “I feel disrespected by BSA after I have served them with distinction for so many years. In fact, I’m angry. “I have been in this position for 15 years. I have given BSA my all and worked to my best ability, but it seems it was not good enough for them. “At least they should have sat me down and told me what I have done wrong. It’s not like I don’t want to be removed, but they should have done it better. “On 28 February, on my way to supervise a tournament, I received a four line email terminating my contract, but it did not say why I was fired. I feel BSA does not have respect for me. I should have been given a reason.” But BSA acting CEO Cindy Nkomo said she cannot comment on Klaas’ removal because he has involved lawyers. “His contract expired in February, so I don’t understand why Klaas comments on this matter because he has involved lawyers. So I would advise you to contact his lawyer. All the current provincial managers are on a three-year term,” said Nkomo. However, Klaas added: “Last week Cindy Nkomo was here in Cape Town and told people that my contract has expired. “My question is: why only my contract had expired? What about other provincial managers? I still want to know why I was singled out from other managers.”
