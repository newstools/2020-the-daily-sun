Mamelodi Sundowns have unveiled their upgraded logo in celebration of their 50th anniversary. The logo has been modernized to reflect the history and journey the Club has embarked on to the pinnacle of African football. The changes include the ribbon being shortened so that the proportion of the crest could be slightly magnified, the ribbon is bolder, the hands are more defined and the centre circle within the logo surrounding the hand has been removed. “The unveiling of the upgraded logo as part of the 50 year celebrations is important for the Club,” said Sundowns Spokesperson Alex Shakoane. “The rich history has given us the platform to grow the brand and achieve continental success. “Sundowns made history in 2016 by becoming the first South African Club during the PSL era to win the African Champions League and to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup. “We have ambitions to be one of the best Clubs in Africa and to compete globally. Sundowns strives for victory and inspires its supporters and people in Africa and globally to pursue and realise their dreams. Hence our motto: ‘The Sky is the Limit.” @Masandawana unveiled their new logo as part of their 50th anniversary celebration.
