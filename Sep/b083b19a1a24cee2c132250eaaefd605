Proteas coach Mark Boucher has emphasised the importance of his young team forging ahead with their new vision when they return to play in what he hopes will be the near future. Cricket South Africa (CSA) is currently working tirelessly to bring a return to play and finalise dates for both the domestic and international seasons after more than six months of no action due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019/20 campaign was prematurely ended in March when the virus forced Boucher and his charges to cut short their limited overs tour to India, whilst local cricket also ended abruptly a few days later. ”It’s been interesting times for everyone,” said Boucher. “We were always meant to have a bit of a break… but no one thought in their wildest dreams that it would be this long, so to have all the guys in one place at the same time was really nice, just to catch up.” Boucher says he and his assistant, Enoch Nkwe, feel the next generation of Proteas have the capability to grow and mature quickly. The Proteas Test side has lost a significant number of experienced players in the recent past, with the likes of Hashim Amla, Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel, JP Duminy and Dale Steyn all retiring. They have dropped to sixth in the ICC Test Rankings and are ranked fifth in the two white-ball formats. Boucher says he wants to see an improvement in their global standing. Boucher added: “It’s all about performance and that’s key for me. We don’t want to be a nice group of guys and be eighth in the world. ”I’d rather be a challenging group of guys and be competing for the number one spot and they all want that as well which is great to hear.”
