GABADINHO Mhango was back among the scorers as Orlando Pirates bagged their second win in the 'bio-bubble' The Malawian scored a late goal to hand Pirates the all-important three points in a 1-0 win over the Team of Choice at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday. The KwaZulu Natal outfit thought they had done enough to clinch a point against the Soweto giants but Mhango popped up late to break their heart. Mhango, who had not scored since the resumption of football, broke his scoring drought to take his tally to 15 league goals, equal with Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile. Bucs, whose inconsistency has been the hallmark of their season so far, are determined to finish on a high note and appear to be well on their to achieving that. Their form in the ‘bio-bubble’ had been less than impressive prior to their win against SuperSport United, however, that result seems to have sparked them back into life. They were made to work hard for their latest win by a stout Maritzburg outfit who have proven to be a tough nut to crack this season. The defeat, though, did little to dent Maritzburg’s season as they are guaranteed a top eight finish regardless of what happens in the final round of fixtures. The KwaZulu Natal outfit have grown in leaps and bounds this campaign and have grabbed their second chance with both hands having survived relegation through the play-offs last season. Meanwhile in other results, AmaZulu did their survival hopes the world of good after they drew 1-1 against Stellenbosch FC at Tuks Stadium to earn a valuable point. SuperSport thumped relegation threatened Baroka 4-1 while Highlands Park also enhanced their top eight chances with a 1-0 win over in-form Cape Town City at Dobsonville Stadium. Bucs will wrap their season up with a clash against Stellies at Emirates Airlines Park while Maritzburg face Bloemfontein Celtic at Tuks Stadium. All final round of fixtures will kick-off at 3.30pm on Saturday
