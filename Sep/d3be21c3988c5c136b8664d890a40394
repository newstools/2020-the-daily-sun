On Wednesday, 32 KZN artists appeared in Pinetown Magistrates Court. They made their first appearance in front of Magistrate Pree Pillay. They were arrested last week on Wednesday for contravention of the Illegal Gathering Act and National Road Traffic act. Among the artists are, former Idols winner Noma Khumalo, hip hop artists Character, Melusi Ndlovu, Sandile Bhengu ‘Sandy B’ Bhengu, actor and Igagasi FM presenter Khaya ‘GC’ Dladla, Naima Kay, DJ Bhunu, Mduduzi Mkhize and comedian Tsoro. Actress Nokuthula Mabika was not present in court. Her lawyer Thula Mlondo told the court that she is sick. As a result her warrant of arrest was stayed. The case has been postponed to 23 October. Their lawyer, Simphiwe Mncwango said: “On 23 October 2020 we shall be filing representations for the state.” Prosecutor Ndoda January told the magistrate that the adjournment is for further investigation. “But there’s not much to investigate as the charges are self explanatory,” he said.
