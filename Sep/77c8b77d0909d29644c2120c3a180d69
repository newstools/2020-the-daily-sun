THIS is the time of the year that Maritzburg United chairman, Farook Kadodia dreads. His stress levels go up as big clubs who have deep pockets always come for his prized assets. And because he has to survive without strong sponsor to call upon to manoeuvre under the current economic challenges, mostly brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, he might be forced to sell some of his top players. His two best players of last season, Richard Ofori and Rushine de Reuck, are reportedly wanted by other PSL teams, and the chances of them remaining with the Team of Choice for the new season are small. “It is a stressful time for me,” admitted Kadodia. However, the Maritzburg boss revealed that so far no club has submitted an offer for either player. At the end of the 2018-19 season, after the team retained their Premiership status via the promotion/relegation play-offs, he unwillingly had to sell Siphesihle Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe to Orlando Pirates. At the end of 2017-18 season, Mamelodi Sundowns came in with a big offer for Lebohang Maboe that Kadodia could not refuse. In the January transfer window of the same season, Maritzburg sold Zimbabwean striker Evans Rusike. “In the last two years, we have lost some valuable players and we had to search around to sign players to play the kind of football that we play,” added Kadodia. “Lots of players don’t enjoy enough game time at the big clubs. “We always change their careers at Maritzburg. “But we’ll continue to assemble the best possible squad as we owe it to our fans and to our brand that has grown in the last five years.”
