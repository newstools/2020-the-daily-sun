THE driver of a bakkie escaped with his life after colliding with an Audi and ending up in a ditch. The accident happened in Hospitaalpark in Bloemfontein on Saturday morning. It’s alleged the driver of the bakkie was driving on Pasteur Street and failed to stop at a stop sign when he collided with the Audi. The driver of the Audi lost control and hit a church fence. A witness said: “The Toyota Hilux bakkie skipped the stop sign and hit the Audi. “The bakkie ended up in a ditch and the Audi hit the church gates. There were no serious injuries. “Both drivers were just limping a little bit and managed to walk around the scene. “It’s alleged the bakkie driver had borrowed it to attend a funeral at Bobbiespark when he collided with an Audi. “I heard he’s pastor and the bakkie belongs to a friend, a doctor.” Hennie Aucamp from Cobra Towing said they’d tow the bakkie after it was pulled out of the ditch. Bloemfontein police are investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving.
