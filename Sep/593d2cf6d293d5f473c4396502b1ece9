VINTAGE Eleazar Rodgers! The vateran striker wrote himself into the Urban Warriours folklore with a hat-trick as Ajax Cape Town came from 1-0 to thrash Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila 5-1 in a promotion / relegation play-off match on Tuesday afternoon. Tshakhuma found the back of the net in the 11 minutes of the game after Thembisani Nevhulamba volleyed into the near corner following a ball from the right-hand side. Ajax went to the break trailing by a goal to nil, however, they managed to bounce back strong in the second stanza of the match with the veteran striker scoring a hat-trick. Siphesihle Mkhize and Chumani Bustaka scored the other two goals for Calvin Marlin's charges. The results now sees Ajax top the three teams mini-league with six points with positive goal difference, as they are equal in points with Black Leopards. Ajax who lead the GladAfrica Championship for almost rest of the season before Swallows won the title on the last day of the season also came from behind to beat TTM 3-2 in the opening game of the playoffs. A win for Ajax on Friday against Leopards on will put them in a good position ahead of the final play-off game between Tshakhuma and Leopards on Monday. 5-star performance! ??
