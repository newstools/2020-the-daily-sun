BIG Fish will be praying for the nation to heal this month. The gospel star, whose real name is Sipho Makhabane, told Daily Sun he’d be asking for help for those who lost loved ones to the coronavirus and people who lost their jobs during lockdown. He said he’d host the Heal the Nation prayer and gospel festival virtually from 1pm to 3pm on Heritage Day. The festival was supposed to take place on 4 April, but had to be postponed because of lockdown. “We’ve decided to host a prayer day because many people have lost their lives, others are sick, and some have lost loved ones. People are in debt and businesses have closed,” he said. Big Fish said he’d be partnering with the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency.  He urged people to watch the show as artists would be performing live on social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. He said the line-up included Sbu Noah, Takie Ndou, Omega, Israel Mosehla, Makhabane, Pretty Mhlongo, Phindile Phoki and Mxolisi Mbethe. Big Fish especially encouraged those who’d lost loved ones or jobs to stay strong and unite.
