THE case against the five ANC members accused of assaulting a mayor was yesterday postponed to 25 September. This is to allow for a decision from the director of public prosecutions on whether the matter should continue or be struck off the roll. The suspects appeared in the Mokerong Magistrates Court in Mahwelereng, outside Mokopane in Limpopo. The ANC members allegedly attacked Mogalakwena mayor Andrina Matsemela in June last year. Both parties have reconciled and want the case withdrawn as they’re from the same political party and work together. Before court started, Matsemela had submitted an application through her lawyer pleading for the withdrawal of the matter. But the accused’s attorney, Sonti Maphoto, argued they’d asked the complainant to withdraw the matter for a while and had prepared for trial and wanted to continue with it. The court later postponed the matter for the director of public prosecution’s decision. Maphoto said: “We’ve been talking to the complainant to forgive the accused. “Unfortunately, this is a political ploy played on the wrong ground. “We welcome the withdrawal and want the matter to be struck off the roll. It’s a waste of time.”
