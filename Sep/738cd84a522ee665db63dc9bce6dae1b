ABC Motsepe League clubs will be out of pocket following a ruling by the SA Football Association that the clubs must foot the bill for the implementation of new Covid-19 protocols in order for the league to complete the disrupted season next month. All football in Mzansi was suspended in March due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The 144 clubs in the nine provinces have been mandated to appoint their own compliance officers. The Covid-19 Health and Safety Directive for the Motsepe League 2019-20 season were formulated by Safa chief doctor, Thulani Ngwenya. He stated that all clubs should appoint their own compliance officers. Once the compliance officers have been appointed, clubs must inform Safa in writing of their appointment. They will then report to provincial officers (appointed by Safa) who will send a report to Dr Ngwenya. Some of the requirements include: match commissioners will, in addition to their regular duties, be responsible for overseeing compliance with Covid-19 match day safety protocols. Each region should identify a central venue where a minimum of three to four matches may be played in a single day. All training venues and buildings are to be sanitised and all club employees (including players) screened for Covid-19 daily. All match balls are to be sanitised before training and matches. With all these requirements coming at the each clubs’ pocket, Phumlani Ndwandwe – the chairman of Happy Wanderers in Margate, Kwa-Zulu Natal, said they were powerless to argue. “Safa said we have to pay for these requirements ourselves. We complained in the meeting, but the instructions came from Safa and it was clear and there’s nothing we can do as clubs,” said Ndwandwe.
