SAM Ngonyama recently introduced his mobile TV, believed to be the first of its kind in South Africa. On Wednesday last week, NTV started broadcasting on people’s cellphones. As its name suggests, NTV can be downloaded and played on any smart phone. Sam said NTV works like any other normal TV station Said Sam: “Currently, we have four presenters including comedian Church Boy, Siyakha Khitha from Joyous Celebration, and Pastor Ngwenya. Our shows include comedy, drama and gospel shows.

At the same time it had to be easily accessible to the public. Unlike other online channels, NTV is light on data,” he said. He said the entire process took more than two years and they’d been shooting for the past six months.
