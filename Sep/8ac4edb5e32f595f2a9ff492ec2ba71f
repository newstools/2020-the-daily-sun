ACTORS Salamina and Howza Mosese will celebrate 12 years of marriage in a few days. The sweethearts, one of the most loved couples in Mzansi, met on former e.tv soapie, Backstage. Salamina posted on Twitter that their 12th anniversary is coming soon. She also announced they’d be on the new season of SABC3’s Celebrated Love and posted the trailer. “Wow!! Can’t believe it’s been 12 years already. And with our anniversary coming up in a couple of days, we’re inviting you to take a walk down memory lane with us. Join @HOWZA_SA and I on @SABC3’s new show, #celebratedlove- we’re on tomorrow night (Sunday) at 19h30,” she wrote.
