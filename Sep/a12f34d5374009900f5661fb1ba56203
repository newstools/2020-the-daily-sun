THEO and Vourne Kgosinkwe are expecting a baby. The newly wed couple recently took to Instagram and shared pictures of their gender reveal party. Theo, who is a member of musical group Mafikizolo, which is affectionately known for their hit song Ngihamba nawe, shared that they have been praying for this miracle to happen. “We prayed for this child and the Lord granted us what we asked Him,” he wrote. He further shared that they are expecting a baby girl. “We had a great day with few friends and family at the gender reveal, you can take a guess. Is it a boy or a girl? “Some said it’s a boy, some said its a girl, some said its twins. Thank you all for the lovely message. We are humbled.” “My wife and I are going to have a beautiful baby girl,” he wrote. While Vourne shared the same pictures and said: “May you always know my baby that you were wished for, longed for, prayed for and will forever be loved.” Some said it’s a boy,some said it’s a girl,some said twins ??,Thank you all for your lovely ?? messages we are humbled and grateful ????.
