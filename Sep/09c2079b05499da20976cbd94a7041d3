MEDIA personality Somizi Mhlongo-Motaung has broken his silence over claims of him allegedly stealing someone else’s idea leading to him creating his cooking show Dinner At Somizi’s. Somizi told Newzroom Afrika channel he only spoke to Hastings Moeng once in 2013. “He told me he wanted us to do a cooking show, but I’ve never seen any documents. I don’t dispute he sent me emails, but I’ve never opened a document or read an email,” he claimed. He said people know he’s not an email person. “I started having an email address again two months ago. I’ve got a management team that deals with anything to do with emails on my behalf. If he says he sent it to my personal email, I never opened it. When he approached me, I had never thought I would have a cooking show. It was never on the back of my mind.” Somgaga, who said he only thought about a cooking show two years ago when thinking of starting his own YouTube channel, has left a bitter taste in people’s mouth on social media, who said his statement was an admission of guilt.
