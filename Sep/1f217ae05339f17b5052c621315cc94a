IF you thought Jomo Cosmos boss, Jomo Sono, only listens to jazz, blues or even Papa Penny's traditional songs, then wait until he hits a high note singing R&B songs. The Cosmos chairman-coach has raised up his arms and thanked the All Mighty as his GladAfrica Championship club survived another season in the first division.

"You saved me, you saved me," Sono sang to the chorus on the R. Kelly's hit song.  He says he will not be releasing any players that helped save the club from being relegated to the ABC Motsepe League. Referring to the R. Kelly theme song, "You saved me", Sono says the bubble has been good to them and they are today living to tell the story. "It was just hectic in camp, but those players played exceptionally well and they all deserve to be given a chance," said the Cosmos boss.

They finished the 2019-19 GladAfrica Championship season on 13th spot with 33 points from 30 games. This is as a result of a splendid bubble showing where they lost once having scored six goals and conceding four goals.
