DJ PRINCE Kaybee is out to make up-and-coming producers’ dreams come true by giving away his laptop. The Gugulethu producer said he started the #PrinceKaybeeProducerChallenge on Twitter because producers were complaining about the lack of opportunities. “Bafe2 a lot of you were complaining there are no opportunities for producers. Well I’m giving away my laptop that produced all my albums up to date, each and every song! This laptop has everything I have used,” he wrote.

Kaybee said to enter the competition, producers should send him the songs they’ve produced and he and his team will choose the winner. The #PrinceKaybeeProducerChallenge comes a month after Kaybee started #ProjectHope, which saw him making the 10 female vocalists’ dreams come true. He took to social media to look for a female vocalist to work with, but ended up choosing 10 instead of one. Kaybee took them on a music bootcamp, where musicians Kelly Khumalo, DJ Tira and Aus Tebza taught them about the industry and he now is working on an album with the 10.
