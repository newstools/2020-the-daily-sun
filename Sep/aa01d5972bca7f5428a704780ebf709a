WHILE four rival taxi associations, cops and Limpopo Transport are in serious talks over a route to ferry commuters from town to Mall of the North in Polokwane, a video clip of a taxi shootout found its way on social media. The fight between between Mankweng, Seshego, Flora Park and Moletjie taxi associations started yesterday morning, when Grobler Street, used by taxis on their way to Mall of the North, was blocked for hours. In the video, a group of taximen is seen approaching and throwing stones at a taxi that stopped in the middle of Buite street. A man from the taxi wearing a red T-shirt and black shorts is pointing a firearm at the group of taximen and then starts firing shots. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a suspect (33) was bust after a case of attempted murder and two counts of malicious damage to property were opened.  “Allegedly, the fight continued at Buite Street. One person aged 41 was shot and injured. He was taken to hospital, where he was later discharged. The suspect was arrested on the spot after being pointed out by witnesses.” Mojapelo said a 7,65mm pistol with an expired licence was confiscated. The suspect will appear in Polokwane Magistrates Court soon on a charge of attempted murder, while the investigation continues.
