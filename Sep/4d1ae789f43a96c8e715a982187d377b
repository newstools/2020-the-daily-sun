WORKERS at Mangwaza Resort in Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga are relieved the giant python roaming around their workplace was finally removed earlier on today. The python was reportedly seen early this year at the resort’s main gate but when they tried to kill it, it disappeared into the nearby mountains. Resort owner Keith Matsane told Daily Sun one day his worker reported he saw the giant snake but it slid into the rocks nearby. “It was seen again but when we tried to kill it quickly, it went to hide and because it was a long snake, we were scared one day it could harm the staff. “But someone recommended we ask the guys from Bushbuckridge Municipality who deal with removal of snakes in the community. I’m glad it was caught and removed and I will now urge my staff to be on the lookout for another snake, because I want them to be safe in their workplace,” he said. Municipal worker Cockroach Mdluli said after the python was spotted, they told resort staff to guard it when it came out. “They saw it and we managed to catch it from its hiding place and we had to use rescue tools to push the rock so we could safely remove it without the snake sustaining any injuries. “The python is 6m long and it was found to be shedding its skin, so we have since taken it into Kruger National Park to continue living in the bushes. We want to warn residents they shouldn’t try to hunt snakes,” Cockroach said.
