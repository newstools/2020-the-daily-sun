TOURISM Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubeni has passionately appealed to the sector to introduce affordable prices for locals, so they can explore our beautiful country. Speaking during the launch of The Big Tree precinct in Tsitsikama outside Port Elizabeth as part of Tourism Month, she said it was time for the industry to sit around the table and come up with special prices. “Maybe this is time for us to talk about prices for locals. South Africans don’t have American dollars or pounds, so I will be talking about prices until we find a solution.” She said other countries have introduced special prices for citizens to explore their countries. Kubayi-Ngubeni said many people could barely afford to visit the places in which they grew up because of the outrageous prices, but poured cold water on suggestions that government should subsidise poor people who wanted to travel around the country. As part of the SA National Park week, South Africans will be allowed free entry to any national park of their choice for day visits. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the week this year will take place from 16 to 20 November. Kubayi-Ngubeni said as Mzansi went down to lockdown alert level 1, people should get out of their homes and visit sites to support the industry. She said those who put wedding plans on hold because of the lockdown, should now go ahead. “Go get married. Spare a thought for those wedding planners and bed and breakfast owners who haven’t had an income for six months. Most of them are women. “We have been behind our walls for far too long. Let’s get out and explore our country.” Kubayi-Ngubeni also appealed to citizens to treat visitors well when they visit our country as international borders open for travellers but stressed charity must start at home, saying with affordable prices, locals could keep the fires burning.
