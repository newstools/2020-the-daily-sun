CLICKS has delisted all TRESemme products and will expand the range of local hair care products. It has also committed to working with government to develop the local beauty market. Group CEO Vikesh Ramsunder said the senior executive responsible for publishing the offensive hair advert has resigned, and all workers involved in the advert suspended. Earlier yesterday, the Joburg High Court ordered the red berets to refrain from intimidating, threatening, and stirring violence after stores were vandalised and forced to close since Monday. Clicks went to court to stop the disruptions, but the EFF said it would step up efforts to ensure stores did not operate, despite the court order. “We have not engaged in or commissioned violence against employees, customers, or operations,” said EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo. “The lawful and peaceful protests will continue until Friday.” This comes after Clicks published a TRESemme hair advert on its website, which described natural black hair as “damaged, dry and frizzy.” The company has since apologised. By 2pm yesterday, the red berets had already left the shops in Sandton, but the party’s Defenders Of The Revolution stayed behind to make sure the store wouldn’t open. In a statement, the EFF said its actions were peaceful protest across all outlets and to voice dissatisfaction of the violence of racism in the form of a picket does not constitute violence. “Clicks has lost in its attempt to interdict the protest action, as the interdict issued by the court does not speak to the protests undertaken by the EFF across the country.” At Mall of Africa in Midrand, the EFF continued to sing outside Clicks to ensure the store remained closed.
