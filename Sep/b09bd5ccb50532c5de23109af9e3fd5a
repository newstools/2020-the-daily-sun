THEY feel they can’t connect with God. A pile of rubbish next to Hope Restoration Covenant Church in Olievenhoutbosch extension 20, Tshwane, attracts flies. And the big green and gold flies make noise and bother congregants. On top of that, there’s the unbearable smell inside the church. Pastor Daniel Mokoena said the community throw rubbish next to his church and the pile had been bothering them for two years. “They dump dead dogs, cats and chickens,” he said. “They also throw away nappies, kak and any kind of rubbish you can think of. “Congregants can’t focus on my sermon because of the stench from the rubbish.”  They were no longer on good terms with the community because of the rubbish. “The residents are rude when I try to explain the challenges the church is facing because of the smell,” he said. According to the pastor, some residents had even told him the dumpsite wasn’t inside his church. “It’s sad that instead of listening to God’s word during the service, we’re disturbed by green and gold flies,” he told Daily Sun. He said congregants were at risk of contaminating diseases because of the rubbish. He’d tried and failed to talk to municipal officials who collect rubbish in the area. Tshwane administrator Mpho Nawa was unaware of the matter. He asked for details of the affected area, so he could follow up on the matter.
