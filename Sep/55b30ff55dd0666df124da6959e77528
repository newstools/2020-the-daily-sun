THE Adoons family from Phomolong, Tembisa, lost 22-year-old son Tshepiso after he was allegedly shot by a cop on Monday afternoon – and they want answers. Tshepiso’s uncle, Xolani, told Daily Sun his nephew’s behaviour changed two weeks ago when he became reserved and started talking to himself. “He went into the house to make food. Then he demanded a phone from his grandma. She refused and Tshepiso became aggressive,” said Xolani. Xolani said neighbours heard the noise and jumped over the wall to try and intervene. “My mother called the cops, so Tshepiso could be taken to hospital,” he said. When Tshepiso’s other uncle, Thulani, arrived from Tshwane, there were four cop vehicles. “They tried talking to Tshepiso, but he didn’t co-operate,” he said. “The cops saw he wasn’t normal, so we decided to open the side of his shack so they could to take him out.” Thulani said the cops then called for backup and asked for space so they could work. “An Afrikaans officer went to Tshepiso. He asked him if he wanted to die because he’d shoot him,” he said. “Then I heard two gunshots. I thought the cop wanted to scare him, but Tshepiso was killed.”  Thulani said the cop called his colleagues. “I thought the van was meant to help Tshepiso, but they were helping the cop to escape.” When they went to the cop shop on Tuesday to open a murder case, they found the cop who allegedly killed Tshepiso carrying on with his duties. “The cops at the scene earlier saw that my nephew needed to go to the hospital, but this one cop who came later shot him,” said Thulani. Ipid spokeswoman Ndileka Cola said they were investigating a death as a result of police action. She said Ipid investigators attended the scene at the deceased’s home. Cola said preliminary investigations indicated there was minimal co-operation from the deceased. “The deceased allegedly charged towards the police with a retractable knife and the police fired shots.” She said the investigation into the matter continued.
