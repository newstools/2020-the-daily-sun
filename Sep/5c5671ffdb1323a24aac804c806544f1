THE Sibanyoni family in Carolina, Mpumalanga is struggling to accept that their son Thulani allegedly was killed by three mlungus. The 35-year-old died last Tuesday in Witbank Hospital. His sister Lindokuhle Moshoe (19) said Thulani was with his friend when a woman working at a local shop accused them of insulting her. She claimed the woman went on to tell her managers about Thulani’s alleged behaviour and they went with a security guard to hunt them down. “They found them in town and took them to the shop’s storeroom and assaulted them with iron rod pipes. They then went to dump their bodies in a nearby bush.” The two were allegedly beaten for three hours. They were found by residents, who called their families and were then taken to hospital. Lindokuhle said: “We are still traumatised. It’s hard to come to terms with what happened. We don’t know if we will be able to go through this ordeal. We wish to see them serve time in jail and pay for what they did. “Who beats someone for three hours and doesn’t stop? They killed him like a dog and only justice can bring us closure. They meant to kill him and we want them to pay.” Apparently it wasn’t the first time the suspects have assaulted people in the area. Lindokuhle hoped the suspects would rot in jail. “It won’t serve any justice for the family if they get bail. We want to see them suffer beyond what my brother went through,” she said. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and murder was opened. He said the three suspects aged 29 – 32 were arrested and appeared before Carolina Magistrates Court on Monday and their case was postponed to next Wednesday. He also warned residents not to take the law into their own hands.
