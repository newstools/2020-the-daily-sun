COPS in Orkney near Klerksdorp in the North West are investigating after two young men, Sibusiso Ngubane and Sibusiso Hlwili, said they were assaulted with whips and canes by men who identified themselves as community leaders. Four men were due to appear at Orkney Magistrates Court after being bust on Wednesday afternoon. Ngubane said he was assaulted four times, while his friend Hlwili was assaulted twice. It seemed the so-called community leaders were targeting young men loitering in the neighbourhood. The victims told Daily Sun the assaults happened on different days while they were hanging around inside an empty house in Orkney, when the group of men found them and accused them of doing crime. They said the last time they were assaulted was on 6 September and both ended up at Klerksdorp’s Tshepong Hospital. Ngubane said: “We were assaulted with sjamboks, pepper-sprayed, choked and forced to make false confessions on a video recorded by these old men. We were forced to be recorded claiming one of our parents was selling drugs together with some police officers. Hlwili said: “I was just hanging out there with my girlfriend and yes, sometimes we do smoke weed, but we did not commit any crime. These old men once came with plastics loaded with ID cards and bank cards and said we must say it’s for us, while telling false stories.” They said the group of men shared the videos with community members. Parents Philda Shoroma and Nosi Ngubane said they feared for their children’s safety. “We are not safe anymore with our children. These people are misleading the community members to hate us as if we are bad people. Let the police do their work.” Colonel Adele Myburgh confirmed two cases of assault were opened and said suspects aged 44, 45, 52 and 55 were bust and were due in court yesterday. Efforts to get hold of the so-called community leaders were fruitless.
