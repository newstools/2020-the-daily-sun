BMW unveiled a new performance derivative to its 1 Series model range. It wears a 128ti badge and is powered by a two-litre turbocharged engine with 195kW and 400Nm. The new model is positioned below the flagship M135i xDrive and sends its power to the front wheels drive via 8-speed automatic sport transmission. It also features a mechanical Torsen limited-slip differential BMW claim the 128ti will reach 100km/h from standstill in 6.1 seconds. Driving dynamics BMW says the entire suspension and steering were specifically tuned to offer extremely sporty and driver-oriented driving dynamics. The 128ti is aimed at the drivers who want an exclusively front-wheel drive car hatch that targets a particularly young target group. The 128ti features a M sport suspension including lowering by 10mm and is 80 kilograms lighter than the four-wheel drive M135i xDrive, from which it takes the highly pre-stressed stabiliser bearing and the stabilisers. During its final test phase, the new compact sports car 128ti is currently undergoing thorough calibration test drives on the hilly roads of the Eifel around the Nordschleife of the NÃ¼rburgring. The new model will be brought to market in Europe in November 2020. SOURCE: WHEELS24
