MAMELODI Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene says they will never get tired of winning. The Zambian stopper has won nine trophies with the Tshwane giants, and is still hungry for more. He helped Sundowns clinch their tenth league title over the weekend, the fifth of his career. He has also won the CAF Champions League, the CAF Super Cup as well as two domestic cup competitions. "We will never get tired of winning," said Mweene. "I will give an example of our President Patrice Motsepe, rich people never get tired of making money. "They always want to make more money to become millionaires, billionaires, trillionaires and so on. "It's the same with achievements, you never get tired if you want to achive more because at the end of the day history will remain there even after you stop playing football. "For me i think its the mentality we have as players at Sundowns, we want to win, make history and make it difficult for the next generation." Mweene says they never stopped believing they would catch rivals Chiefs, who were 13 points clear at some point. "It wasn't easy but its more sweeter because Chiefs were 13 points ahead of us when we were sill busy with the Caf Champions League," added Mweene. "We were just running our race, we told ourselves that there's a lot of football to play and we continued to focus on ourselves. That is why we find ourselves where we are, because of our mental strength."
