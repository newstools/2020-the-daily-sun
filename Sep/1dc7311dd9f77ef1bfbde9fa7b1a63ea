AMAZULU are determined to plan properly for the new Premiership season and not fight relegation again. Ayanda Dlamini was recently appointed as head coach after he impressed the management by avoiding the relegation axe when he given the coaching job on interim basis in February, Dlamini  helped Usuthu finish 13th after the club found themselves in the relegation zone for most of the past season. Under Dlamini, the club have prioritised the pre-season as the basis of a successful season. Club general manager Lunga Sokhela admitted this past season was very difficult for them on and off the field. Said Sokhela: “It is critical for us to pick up points early and to go back to where we were before. This past season we had a really poor home record and it is critical for us to change that and pick up a lot of points (at home).” Sokhela described themselves as “gypsies”  last season as they had no home venue available which was up to PSL standards. Their first home venue at King Zwelithini Stadium uMlazi was closed down after the surface got a hammering from music concerts last December. They then move to their second home at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu, but again the venue was closed following music concerts also in December. Their third alternative venue was the Moses Mabhida Stadium. The club’s first game of the year against Mamelodi Sundowns was played there but the pitch had a lot of brown spots after Durban experienced heatwave during the festive period. Due to the problems at Moses Mabhida, Usuthu moved to Kings Park Stadium.
