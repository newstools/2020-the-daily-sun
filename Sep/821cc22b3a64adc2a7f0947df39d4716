POET Mbalezinhle “Magcwabe” Mabaso (29) from Esikhaleni kasi in Richards Bay, KZN has big dreams for her community. She runs the annual King Cetshwayo Poetry Competition, where poets must send in poems about Covid-19 or gender-based violence. “The competition is open to all age groups and the entry fee is R50. The closing date is next Wednesday, 19 September and on 24 September, we will be announcing the winners. Winners stand a chance to win a drivers licence, cash, a trophy and certificate. The event will take place at Gumani Lodge at Empangeni.” She said it aimed to uplift up-and-coming poets in her community. “Cracking the creative industry is very hard, especially for youth in rural areas. I know this because from a young age I was doing poetry. As a Sunday school pupil, I’d memorise, recite and act out Bible verses. It was a kind of good for nothing performance, because the environment didn’t give me the right platform. But those moments because haped me as a stage performer.” In 2009 she moved to Durban and started taking her craft seriously. “I started developing myself as a professional poet, attending poetry sessions and entered lots of competitions. I later entered the poetry competition hosted by the KZN Department of Education and officially launched myself as a professional poet. “From there, I volunteered at community radio stations including including Izwi Lomzansi, Inanda FM and Vibe FM.” But Magcwabe wanted to stand out from the rest. “There was too much competition, so I started mixing radio presenting and poetry acts and listeners loved this. I then started getting gigs from Durban University of Technology and University of KwaZulu Natal. I was spotted by SABC presenter Bongani Mavuso and we started working together on Ukhozi FM.”
