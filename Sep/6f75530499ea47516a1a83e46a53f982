WE live in a sick society where some people think they can just rape a gay man or lesbian woman to punish them into changing their sexual preference. Mzansi has been battling these criminals who are hell-bent on “straightening up” or “curing” members of the gay and lesbian communities because according to them, only straight people deserve to live in our country. Today the family of 14-year-old teenager, Zinhle Sekgoapa from Chochocho near Hazyview, is living a nightmare that no parent wishes to face. Brave Zinhle had embraced her sexuality positively with her family’s support, and had dreams of joining the navy. Cruel killers snuffed out her dreams. Her only crime is that she was a young lesbian woman who was proud of her sexuality. The killers’ actions demonstrate high levels of homophobia that have made many of our kasi’s unsafe for gays and lesbians. Since the spate of corrective rapes and murders that regularly hit Mzansi from the ‘90s, activists have warned the problem will not go away unless there were laws that would specifically look at combating this evil practise. Criminals found guilty of corrective rape and murder should receive tougher sentences to actively combat this violent hate crime. – Editor
