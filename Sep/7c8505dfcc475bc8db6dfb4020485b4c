CENTURION residents couldn’t believe drugs were being made right under their noses. On Saturday, they were shocked when a couple in was bust for manufacturing drugs at their home. Their home looked like any other and nobody suspected them, but the Hawks were hot on their heels. The 44-year-old and his 33-year-old wife were held in custody on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs by the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Monday. Gauteng community safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said they were arrested on Saturday after a search and seizure operation by the Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation unit and the crime intelligence counter narcotics division. “The team discovered a fully functional illicit crystal meth and mandrax manufacturing laboratory worth an estimated R2,5 million.” She said chemicals and containers used to manufacture drugs were also seized. “The suspects were immediately arrested and we commend all law enforcement members who made sure the couple was brought to book.” The case has been postponed to Friday for formal bail application and further investigation.
