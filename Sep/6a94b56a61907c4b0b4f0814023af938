RAP megastar K.O, whose real name is Ntokozo Mdluli, has shocked his social media followers after tweeting he could’ve died a few months ago. He didn’t give further details but said if it wasn’t for God, his soul would have left his body. The 43-year-old, who scooped a gong for best collaboration at this year’s Samas for his album PTY UnLTD, said he’d have long been in a coffin if it wasn’t for the Lord.

This is my personal story over the past few months, no rap crap,” he tweeted. In a recent interview, he told Daily Sun he had no plans of quitting the music industry, his calling. “The only way I’ll quit is if I die,” he said. Regained my sanity & mojo soon as I blocked out all the outside noise. Your inner voice is your intuition.
