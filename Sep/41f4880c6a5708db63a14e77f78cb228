MAMELODI Sundowns have
confirmed the signings of Peter Shalulile and Mothobi Mvala from Highlands
Park. Both players joined
Pitso Mosimane’s side on a five-year-deal each player. Shalulile finished the
past season a joint-top goalscorer alongside Orlando Pirates Gabadinho Mhango
with 16 goals. “I joined Sundowns
because I think it’s one of the best clubs in Africa and I want to win
trophies. It’s a platform for me to play in Africa with the CAF Champions
League, ” Shalulile told the club website. Mvala is set to join a
star-studded Sundowns with experience having represented Bafana Bafana and SA
Under-23 national team at the Olympic Games in Brazil 2016. Mvala said: ”Every
season Sundowns competes for trophies, which is something you want as a player,
to win something for yourself, for your family, for the supporters, for
everyone, I’m looking forward to meeting all the players so that we can share
good moments and keep winning.”
