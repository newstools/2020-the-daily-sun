AS Clicks gears up to open their stores today, the EFF vowed to continue with their protests despite a court interdict against the party. This after the Joburg High Court granted an interdict on Tuesday preventing the EFF from intimidating and threatening employees and customers, and inciting violence against commercial operations. Clicks closed all stores to engage directly with staff and provide counselling and support. But EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo said they would intensify the protests at outlets.  Speaking to Daily Sun, Pambo said: “As far as the court interdict is concerned, there’s nothing that bars us from protesting. The interdict essentially reaffirms our right to protest, a right to peaceful protest and therefore we will not stop. “Our protests are not violent, and we have never said people must burn Clicks.” According to the EFF, Clicks’ action to cut ties with TRESemme, suspend employees involved in the racist Ad and resignation of a senior executive were all just a publicity stunt. Police Minister Bheki Cele denounced the acts of vandalism and malicious damage to stores. This after one of the stores in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, was petrol bombed on Monday.  Ten people, including an EFF MP, were bust for charges relating to the destruction of property. The MP was charged with assaulting a cop and resisting arrest. Cele said the advert that sparked the public outrage must be condemned from all quarters. However, he cautioned against the damaging of property as an act of protest. The minister also noted the investigation of a case in Port Elizabeth where a 52-year-old woman pointed a gun at EFF members picketing at a mall in Welmer Park.
