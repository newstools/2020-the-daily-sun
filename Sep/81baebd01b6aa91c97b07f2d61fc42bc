BAROKA FC have roped in Augustine Mahlonoko
into their ensemble, to join returnee goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke. The Limpopo outfit survived relegation by a
whisker on points-difference between themselves and Black Leopards who are now
renegotiating their PSL status via the PSL promotion/relegation
play-offs. The 19-year-old Mahlonoko, who was released by
Orlando Pirates in June, joins Baroka alongside Masuluke who was nominated for
the Puskas at some stage of his life. The duo, along with many others, will be
announced by Baroka in due course as they prepare for the season ahead, which
is expected to start late next month. It came as a shock when Mahlonoko was let go
by Pirates as he gave an indication that he is the future of the club in the
Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC). He made his debut for the senior team while
aged 16 and the future looked bright until the shock parting of ways. Masuluke was Baroka's fan favourite until he
was caught with his throat wide open drinking in a team bus in 2018 alongside
captain Olaleng Shaku, as well as axed coach Kgoloko Thobejane, Sipho Moeti and
Lewis Macha following a trip from Free State Stars.
