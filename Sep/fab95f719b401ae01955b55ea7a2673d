POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has warned restaurants, taverns and shebeen owners that they risk losing their operating licences if they ignore the alert level 1 lockdown rules. Briefing the media, Cele said he was disgusted at the way managers and owners of these establishments were disregarding the rules. “We are laying criminal charges against those who break the rules and report them to the people who issue licences to decide what action to take,” he said. He said he was talking about those who break the rules for profit. “I want to express my shock and disgust about the blatant disregard of the health of our people by some liquor outlet owners.” Cele said he witnessed this first-hand during a joint operation of police, soldiers and traffic officers in Ekurhuleni, where several shebeens and taverns were found operating way past the stipulated 10pm curfew. “He said some outlets squeezed patrons inside venues and shut windows and doors to make it look as if the business was closed for the night. “Meanwhile, drinking and socialising in the confined space was on going until the early hours,” he said. Establishments are now allowed to serve customers alcohol until curfew kicks in between midnight and 4am. He said an inter-ministerial committee established by President Cyril Ramaphosa continued to tackle gender-based violence. “If we all play our part, the country will successfully combat the coronavirus. But the same cannot be said for the second pandemic that is at crisis levels,” he said. Cele said since the beginning of lockdown, 310 494 people have been arrested and charged with contraventions of the Disaster Management Act. These violations range from selling and transporting liquor and cross-border related offences. The Western Cape recorded the most arrests with over 72 000, followed by Gauteng with 59 000. He said cops have contracted over 16 000 infections and 15 000 have recovered, while 215 lost the battle against the virus.
