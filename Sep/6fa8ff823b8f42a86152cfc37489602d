KAIZER Chiefs are expected to announce Adel Amrouche as their new head coach. SunSport have it on good authority that negotiations between Amakhosi and the Algerian coach are at an advanced stage for the latter to take over from Ernst Middendorp. Amrouche, 52, is in charge of the Botswana national team, having previously guided MC Alger and Libya. But he is understood to be keen on joining the Soweto giants. Amakhosi have come under fire from their angry fans after they failed to deliver on a single trophy in five years, but more painfully, losing the league title race bitterly to Mamelodi Sundowns recently. But the club management have been swift to ring the changes as they got rid of Middendorp and his assistant, Shaun Bartlett. The name of Gavin Hunt, former Bidvest Wits coach, has been bandied about, as well as that of Benni McCarthy. Amrouche is currently head coach of the Botswana national football team, Zebras, since August last year and will be leaving them for neighbouring country South Africa to take refuge in Naturena. In February 2013, Amrouche was named coach of the Kenya national football team taking over the position from James Nandwa who was there on temporary basis after the departure of Henri Michel. After 18 months at the helm, he was sacked on 3 August 2014 following Kenya's 1–0 aggregate loss to Lesotho in the second round of qualification for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. Amrouche began his managerial career in 1988 by coaching the youth ranks of local club OMR El Annasser while playing for the senior team. He held the same role during his playing stints with USM Alger and RC Kouba.In 2002, he was appointed as the manager of Congolese club Daring Club Motema Pembe.HIS CAREER: 1995–1996: FC Brussels (Technical Director) 1996–2002: R.U.
