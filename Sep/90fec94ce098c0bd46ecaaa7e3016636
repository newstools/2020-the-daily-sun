THE BAN has been lifted, but fake skyf is stronger than ever! On Sunday, investigations by Tax Justice South Africa (TJSA) exposed a manufacturing company that sells illicit cigarettes directly to customers through the internet. The TJSA claimed the company, which sold most popular illicit brands, was dodging taxes and did bad deals. It appears that online, customers can buy a carton of 10 packs for R225 compared to the market price of more than R300. Earlier last week, TJSA said organised crime syndicates were using gangland tactics to keep control of the cigarette trade they captured during lockdown. It said illicit traders have used their vast tax-free profits to expand their supply networks. TJSA founder Yusuf Abramjee also claimed the company, which is operating from Sandton, doesn’t check that their buyers are above 18 years old.  Abramjee said: “In less than a minute on the internet, we were able to register online as a trade partner without any checks or verification of our identity, age or status.” He said cigarettes were then delivered to a residential address with no questions asked. “Our investigations showed that even schoolchildren can register as a so-called trade partner.” Daily Sun spoke to smokers who said they were still smoking illicit brands. A 33-year-old smoker from Soweto said: “Illegal cigarettes were here before the ban and are still here. I have gone back to my original brand, but I still get loose draws from spaza shops.” A 40-year-old smoker said: “Before the ban I hated fake brands, but the ban humbled me. The ban has been lifted but I’m still stuck on those fake brands because they are cheap.”
