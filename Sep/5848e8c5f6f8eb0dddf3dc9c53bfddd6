VHUDI Mamphwe has reached the end of the road. The MyYoki Yoki singer was eliminated from Idols SA on Sunday after going through to theatre week. Vhudi impressed the judges in his audition by singing his own song. On Sunday, the 20-year-old performed So High by John Legend, which failed to impress the judges. He said he forgot the lyrics during his performance. “From here, I have a song I’m going to release and I’m going to push it,” he said. Many fans were not happy to see him go and wished him well in his career. Speaking to Daily Sun, Vhudi said: “Leaving the show so early was painful for me because I had hope that I’d win, but I’ve accepted it now. “I can see where God is trying to take me because better days are coming.” Vhudi said he learnt a lot from the experience and would be announcing the release of My Yoki Yoki this week.” Vhudi said Tresor had expressed interest in working with him. “I finally got to meet Tresor. I met him a few days ago. He’s such a wonderful guy and it was an honour meeting him. We’re planning and hopefully we’ll be releasing something soon,” he said. After Vhudi was eliminated from the show, his fans took to Twitter to express their disappointment.
