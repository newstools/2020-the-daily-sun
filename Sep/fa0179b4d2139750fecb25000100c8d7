BUSINESSMAN Lebohang Khitsane’s memorial service got everyone’s tongues wagging. His sister Semati “Rakgadi” Moedi spilled the beans on their personal lives, revealing her tombstone tycoon brother died in pain because his wife once brought a man to her brother’s house. This led to many others also sharing their experiences on social media, including seasoned broadcaster Redi Thlabi, who said that after her father died, his sisters stopped at nothing to maker her mum’s life a living hell, with her aunt accusing her of murdering her husband. “Before Mom even found out her husband was dead, Bo Rakgadi were screaming in broad daylight that she had killed their brother.” “Because 1, she was younger, 2, a Xhosa, and 3, wanted his three-roomed house, never mind that she was the high- income earner with a company car. “Throughout the week of mourning and after the funeral, they told all who came to pay their respects that my mum had murdered my dad because she wanted a younger man. “Some neighbours would repeat this in front of my nine-year-old ears. My mum kept her cool. She was phenomenal.” Redi also went on to share that 25 years later, they went to the newspaper, saying she sold their brother’s house. “Decades later, long-lost Bo #Rakgadi and half siblings went to Sunday World: ‘Redi and her mom sold their brother’s house.’ This was in 2012, 25 years after Papa died. I was 12 when the house was sold, yet the headline screamed, ‘Tlhabi Family House Drama’. “This issue had nothing to do with my husband and me. Which 12-year-old can sell a house? “Anyway, 33 years after Papa died, beautiful Mom is thriving. She has gone on to live a meaningful life. Her grace dazzles.” My father was stabbed to death at age 49. My mom was 35. She was educated, conservative, quiet yet tough. Her parents were educated. He grew up very poor. He turned out to be kind, hardworking & so loving to us. He was loud, streetwise, self-assured & progressive. #Rakgadi
