A MAN was electrocuted on Sunday night after he broke into a substation to steal cables. His body was found burnt beyond recognition by residents of Springs in Ekurhuleni yesterday morning. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said a second man was shocked by cables, but survived. “We found his cellphone lying outside the substation. It looks like he dropped it while fleeing the scene,” he said.

The search continued yesterday as cops were looking for the man at local hospitals. Ramphora said a witness saw a group of men standing next to the substation on Sunday night as he was passing by. “He said he went to ask what they were doing there, and they told him to leave. He told us when he got home, he heard an explosion. Yesterday morning, he went to check and found the body of a man,” said Ramphora. The whole area was plunged into darkness and was without electricity for the whole of yesterday. Affected areas included Geduld and Springs Extension, adding to residents’ frustration. On Sunday, angry residents of Mzumbe and Wright Park in Springs took to the streets, demanding electricity. They blocked the KwaThema and Springs roads with burning tyres. Ramphora said an inquest docket was opened at Springs Police Station.
