By mid-August, the limited-edition Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR had already sold 85% of the 300 units made available for the South African market. The Golf GTI TCR is a derivative from the racing car of the same name, the two-time overall winner of the international TCR racing series. The TCR only comes in a 5-door version in Mzansi, it is distinguished by the standard black 19-inch Reifnitz alloy wheels, perforated disk brakes, matte black exterior mirror caps, sill extensions, front splitter, TCR roof spoiler, and a diffuser at the rear. The Golf GTI TCR makes a further strong impression even before the driver settles behind the wheel, as the TCR logo is projected onto the road when the front doors are opened. The Golf GTI TCR, packed with a 6-speed DSG, reaches 100 km/h in just 5.6 seconds. The standard Vmax increases the maximum speed from 250 km/h to 264 km/h, while the torque is 380Nm at 1 950 â€“ 5 300 r/min. PRICE 2.0 TSI Golf GTI TCR 213kW DSG R669 000
