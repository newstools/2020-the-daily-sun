TRAFFIC cops impounded five Big Sky buses that were found loaded with pupils on Monday afternoon. With many rumors suggesting traffic cops were afraid to impound the buses in Bloemfontein, Free State, and were only targeting taxis, the officers showed they were not biased. The buses with no permit to load pupils were escorted to Lengau traffic department, and the pupils got alternative buses. When the SunTeam arrived at Lengau traffic centre, the Interstate buses were arriving to wait for the pupils and transport them to their kasis. A Brebner High School pupil said they had been transported by the same buses to and from school for the past few weeks. “They are so luxurious inside and I was shocked to hear they did not have permits to transport us. I just hope that this matter is sorted so that I could feel the exorbitant funds that my parents pay for the school,” said the pupil. A bus driver said: “The Big Sky buses are very comfortable and roadworthy, but that doesn’t mean they can load anyone. A special permit is needed to do that. These kids deserve to be transported in a legal way.” Taxi driver Phemelo Sejake said: “The traffic cops have been on our necks when it comes to permits. This is the first time I see the buses impounded. I now have faith in our traffic department. They should not be biased and I’m now happy that we are all equal in the face of the road and traffic laws.” The high school pupils were taken to their homes in kasis such as Kagisanong and Ehrlich Park. Big Sky spokesman Vuyo Ondala told Daily Sun: “On Monday, five of our buses were impounded by the traffic authorities in what was viewed as traffic violations. Alternatively arrangements were made to collect the pupils. We can confirm that the charges were withdrawn this morning and we will continue with our operation as it was discovered that we’ve been operating within the confines of the law.”
