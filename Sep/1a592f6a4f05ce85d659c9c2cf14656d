YOUNG SABC writer and publisher, Muntomuhle Mcambi, has had a reason to smile during lockdown. While many were struggling he was mentoring young writers. The result of this is a series of seven books published with his company, Iziko Art Company and Publishers. Speaking to SunBuzz, Muntomuhle said: “I invited Ukhozi FM listeners to write short stories and submit them to us. “More than 100 short stories were received but not all of them could make it. “They were edited, proofread and evaluated by my company. Out of those stories I chose 20 and compiled them to release the first book, Isivivane Sokhozi Volume 1.” Some of the stories were fictional but others were based on real events. “For example, there’s a story about the coronavirus where the writer talks about its effects.” Muntomuhle said he’s passionate about writing and wants to inspire the youth to write about South Africa’s history. “For this project I’ve also allowed the writers to sell this book so they can make extra cash during lockdown. “I’ll soon be releasing volume two, but I’m currently focusing on the first volume. I want to see how it’s received by the public.” He said the books were written by young, new writers from various parts of KZN and were already in bookshops across the country.
