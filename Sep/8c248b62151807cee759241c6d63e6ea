RELEGATION threatened Black Leopards should not expect any favours when they face in-form Bidvest Wits in their penultimate Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Wednesday night (6pm). This was the warning of former Lidoda Duvha midfielder and now Clever Boys star, Phathutshedzo Nange, ahead of this must-win clash for Leopards if they hope to avoid surviving the axe and dropping into the GladAfrica Championship. “Leopards are my home team but I am now at Wits and I have to do what is best for my team,” said Nange, who spent five years at Leopards and helped them gain promotion to the Premiership two seasons ago. “I had a good time at Leopards. They are the team that helped me to realise my dream of playing in the top flight. I do have a soft spot for them (Leopards) as they are my home team. But we have goals at Wits and we want to achieve them.” Leopards are second bottom, with 26 points – one ahead of bottom club Polokwane City with two matches to play. Added the 28-year-old: “It is unfortunate they are facing us while they (Leopards) are fighting relegation. I am a professional player and there will be no favours today when we face Leopards.” Wits come into this clash without defeat in seven consecutive league matches. Gavin Hunt’s side have won two and drawn five matches since the restart of the league last month. The last time Wits lost a game was in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals against Mamelodi Sundowns, losing 3-2 on 8 August. The Students are currently third on the log with 49 points. They also have two league matches remaining to end the season. And Wits still have a slim mathematical chance of lifting the title, but only if they win both their remaining games and leaders Kaizer Chiefs and second placed Sundowns lose their remaining matches. Leopards are not in a good space coming into this crunch encounter. This after they suffered two straight league defeats to SuperSport United and AmaZulu.
