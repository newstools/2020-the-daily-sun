SAMWU has described its departed president John Dlamini as a
dedicated leader who served the union with passion and love. The union announced that Dlamini, who it said was affectionately known as “student of the revolution” or
“young man”, died on Thursday morning after a short illness. Since morning, tributes have been pouring from the union
fraternity for him. "We lower our banners in honour of Comrade John, we
salute him for the dedication, love, passion and commitment that he had for
SAMWU, its members and workers in general. " We send our heartfelt condolences to the Dlamini
family, friends, colleagues, members and municipal workers in general,"
said the union. SAMWU said Dlamini was a policeman by training and service,
who rose through the rank in the union. He was elected councillor at the Borough of Howick
Municipality which is now the Umgeni local municipality in the early 90’. Years later he was employed by the same municipality where
he was elected the union’s Regional Secretary and Deputy Provincial Chairperson
and ultimately SAMWU KZN Provincial Chairperson. Dlamini also served as Cosatu deputy provincial Chairperson
before he was SAMWU first deputy president at the union's 10th national
congress in 2012. "In April 2019, Comrade John was elected the union’s
President in Mangaung, he and his collective were tasked with rebuilding and
taking the union to its 12th National Congress this year," it said. Funeral and memorial arrangements will be announced in due
course once they are finalised.
