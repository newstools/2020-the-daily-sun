FORMER president Jacob Zuma has demanded that Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo recuse himself as chairman of Zondo Commission, or he would not take part. In a letter through his lawyers, Zuma accused Zondo of being biased and that he has already prejudged him as guilty. Zuma revealed that he and Zondo had a strained relationship from the past, which Zondo should have disclosed before accepting to chair the commission. But he did not give details of the nature of the relationship, but promised this would form part of the information to be included in a detailed affidavit to be deposed when he goes to court. It seems what broke the camel’s back was a recent press briefing where Zondo announced he would no longer negotiate dates on which Zuma would appear before the commission. His lawyers argued that this followed other briefings last year, where Zondo addressed Zuma through the media. Zuma said the latest briefing took place with no indication from him that he would honour the new dates for him to attend. “It was an unnecessary and premature public rebuke which, in our respectful view, resides outside the realm of legal processes and judicial comity,” Zuma further argued. His lawyers said they have noted Zondo’s attitude towards the legal team, which they said was “inappropriate and bereft of the requisite judicial decorum this process deserves”. The lawyers said Zuma concluded that Zondo was no longer capable of being impartial, given his unwarranted public statements. Zuma believed Zondo’s conduct has stripped the commission of its legitimacy.
