MZANSI will be on level one lockdown by Monday and most South Africans will return to work. This will allow for increased numbers at gatherings. As with the other drops in lockdown levels, this will bring about some changes for South Africans. Drivers on the road will again need to give drivers that were not driving much, some allowance. “The new influx of drivers returning to the roads will not have the driving confidence that they did when lockdown began. Should you come across more drivers like this on Monday, be considerate of this and give them some extra slack,” managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert said. “This is also important to avoid road rage in a driving environment where some drivers are more likely to make mistakes while others are dealing with additional stress and challenges during this time. This is particularly true of drivers who already had time, on quieter roads, to regain their confidence. “As we teeter on the verge of a Second Decade of Action for Road Safety with the UN, we can re-emphasise road safety. Companies will again have greater capacity to send drivers for training as there will be less strain on smaller workforces to deliver on normal operational demands.”
