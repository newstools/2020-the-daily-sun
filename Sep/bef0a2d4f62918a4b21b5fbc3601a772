Let’s celebrate Heritage Day at all times. Heritage is a special thing to us, especially as Africans. Most of us don’t follow our heritage anymore. Knowing your heritage is like knowing where you come from. Our attire, hairstyles and behaviour represent us as Africans. Let’s celebrate Heritage Day tomorrow. It’s our heritage, let’s celebrate it.
