THE Carling Black Label Cup has always been about innovation... more about thinking outside the box. It is therefore hardly surprising to see the Cup organisers pull the rabbit out the hat with the ”Cup of Ages” this time around. Details of the unique match, involving Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, are still sketchy, owing to the veil of secrecy around the upcoming match. But the 2020 edition will certainly be a game like no other. The match will be live on SABC 1 on 3 October, of course, with no fans in the stands as per the lockdown regulations. Who will be playing? Your guess is as good as mine. But from the bit that was revealed at the launch at the FNB Stadium yesterday, past and present stars of both teams will renew hostilities as they come face to face.
