FORMER Bidvest Wits defender Lorenzo Gordinho has wasted little time finding a new home. Gordinho has joined Danish 1st Division side Viborg on a  two-year-deal after leaving Wits at the end of the 2019-20 season. The 26-year-old  played a total of 14 games for the now defunct Clever Boys last season having joined in January from Kaizer Chiefs. His former Chiefs teammate, Matthew Rusike, has suggested he had a role to play in Gordinho's move. "Congratulations to Lorenzo Gordinho for signing with Danish outfit Viborg FF Flag of Denmark happy to have assisted you. Great player, great friend," said Rusike on Twitter. Gordinho also thanked Rusike for his role in making the move possible.
