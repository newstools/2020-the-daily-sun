TS Sporting boss Slungu Thobela says they as still in the dark whether his team has indeed survived relegation or not. This after they won their Safa arbitration case against fellow Mpumalanga GladAfrica Championship rivals Mbombela United who were relegated in the boardroom after being docked 30 points for fielding an ineligible striker Sabelo Ndzinisa this season. The Eswatini International striker was also banned for two years from playing as he donned the Mbombela jersey while he signed a contract with TS Sporting. The arbitrator’s verdict means Sporting, who were initially relegated together with Royal Eagles when the season ended on Sunday will now retain their Championship status. Sporting finished second bottom tied on 32 points with Mbombela who had initially survived due to a better goal difference prior to the arbitrator’s ruling. But instead of celebrating their survival via the boardroom, Thobela says he doesn’t want to jump the gun until they receive confirmation from the PSL. Mbombela have already received their letter revealing the bad news. Said Thobela: “I am not in a better position to talk right now. The PSL have not made a pronouncement. Let’s respect the process and we will wait for the league.”
