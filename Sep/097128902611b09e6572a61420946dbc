DJ and record producer Profound has decided to step out of the shadows of production and has released his debut single. The award-winning producer, whose real name is Morapeli Dennis Masilo, features Riky Rick and Emtee on the track. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “Abangani Bami is a fun song which celebrates successes, and it doesn’t matter how big or small. “The song encourages everybody to pat themselves on the back for enduring such a tough year by proposing a celebration with friends.” The talented DJ said he enjoyed working on the song and described the studio sessions as vibrant. “We had two studio sessions when making the song and both of them were highly energetic and vibrant, and each session felt like a party. I really enjoyed working with the two stars,” he said.

I felt the need to provide for my family was higher. Although it’s a risk, he said, it will be rewarding in future. He wants to positively influence people’s outlook on life. “I want people to gain self-confidence and believe in their dreams, even when reality says otherwise,” he said. The single will be available on digital platforms on Friday.
