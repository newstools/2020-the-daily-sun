THE Red Berets arrived in large numbers at the Clicks store at Mall of the North in Polokwane, Limpopo. As a result, the store remains closed as the disruption continues. EFF leader JuliJUJUus Malema was accompanied by provincial leader Jossey Buthane at 9.am. Malema arrived at the mall in a black BMW X5 and walked straight to the Clicks store. Police arrived a few minutes later and asked to speak to party leaders, but Malema refused to. The disruption continued despite Clicks CEO Vikesh Ramsunder’s apology for the “insensitive and offensive” ad published on its website. Others stores closer to Clicks are closed. CIC @Julius_S_Malema says if any store of clicks is open, inform the EFF and we will close it.We are tired of white arrogance. #clicksmustfall pic.twitter.com/8khEld3Ejw
