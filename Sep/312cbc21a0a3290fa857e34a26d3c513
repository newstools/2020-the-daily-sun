A three month old baby girl flew out of a Toyota Corolla after a drunk driver collided head on with a VW Polo in Ottawa near Verulam, while fleeing another collision on Sunday. The Corolla driver was apparently hired to transport three people from Inanda to Verulam. While on their way the driver apparently crashed into a Hyundai in Verulam, north of Durban. Reaction Unit South Africa spokesman Prem Balram said they received a call about the initial incident. “As reaction officers arrived at the scene, the driver of the Corolla sped off and drove towards Ottawa,” he said. Balram said the officers attempted to stop the car at the Ottawa intersection but the driver turned into Tottenham Road. “He then tried to overtake three vehicles before crashing head on into the VW Polo,” he said. The baby was found lying on the road next to the vehicle. “Officers secured her and called paramedics. On arrival the baby, her parents and aunt who were also in the vehicle were examined and found to have sustained moderate injuries,” he said. Balram said two occupants of the Polo were also injured. “They were stabilised at the scene before being transported to hospital by ambulance. The driver of the Corolla was arrested by the reaction officers and handed over to the police,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the Verulam police are investigating cases of drunken driving, reckless and negligent driving. “A 32-year-old suspect was arrested. He is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court soon,” she said.
