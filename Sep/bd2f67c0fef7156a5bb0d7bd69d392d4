MPUMALANGA Education Department has put Masizakhe Secondary School’s principal and two teachers on precautionary suspension after claims of them using corporal punishment for pupils at the school in Breyten. They were arrested on Tuesday and charged with assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and common assault. The three appeared before Ermelo Magistrates Court on Wednesday and got R1 000 bail each. Their case was postponed to 18 September for further investigation. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the SGB would meet with the department today. “These teachers are charged with misconduct and will have to explain their actions before the departmental disciplinary hearing. The department will continue to render counselling to the affected pupils,” he said.
