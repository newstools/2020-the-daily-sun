Mamelodi Sundowns Pitso Mosimane was left delighted and 'emotional' after seeing his side claim a historic 10th Premiership title. The Brazilians beat relegated Polokwane City 3-0 at Dobsonville on the final day of a massively elongated season with a hat-trick from Lebohang Maboe. Kaizer Chiefs had led the standings prior to kick-off but ended up ruing their missed chances in a 1-1 draw with Baroka FC to end the season in second place. After the tie, Mosimane said it was difficult to accept that 'a lot of people didn't believe in the team'. "Okay, of course very emotional. 'La Decima', I think it's best way to give Absa a good send off. I think we've won it the most," said Mosimane after the match. "It was difficult because we never had a chance to go up (to the to of the league), we only had one chance for half an hour where Chiefs lost to Wits, that was the only sniff we had. 'But as I said I said to you when we lost to Cape Town City. What can I say, if you play for Sundowns, you have to play every week that's why some of the players struggle to keep up because there's a lot of work and I'm too demanding, I push the players. "And some crumble, some run away, some cannot take me because I'm too harsh on them but if you want to win the title, we're here to win cups but ja. "To be honest I'm not so happy like when we won it against Free State Stars (last season), I'm a little bit emotional on this one because of many important things inside that makes me very emotional to be honest, sometimes a little bit sad but it's okay. I won the trophy. "A lot of people didn't believe in the team, a lot of people didn't believe in me, only the yellow nation, those who come here every time, they are the people who support us."
