BAROKA’S new signing Cheslyn Jampies says he can’t wait to play in the Premiership again. The 30-year-old defender signed a three year contract with Bakgaga from GladAfrica Championship outfit Uthongathi last week. Jampies last played in the top flight three seasons ago with Bloemfontein Celtic and since then the Cape Town-born defender has been playing in the Championship with the likes of Richard Bay and Steenberg United. “I am so thankful to God for giving me another chance to play in the top flight,” said Jampies. “I am so happy to sign for Baroka and thanks to chairman Khurishi Mphahlele and coach Dylan Kerr. I wish the league was starting tomorrow. It’s good to be back in the PSL. All I have to do now is to work hard and fight for my position.” The former Celtic player also promised that Baroka’s day of fighting for relegation are over next season. “We had a good talk with the coach as a team and we agreed that it’s time we repay the chairman for the hard work and a good treatment he is giving the team,” explained Jampies. “Our aim is to fight for the championship or to end the season in the top eight. We also aim to fight for a trophy. And with the days I have spent training with the team, I believe with Kerr we can achieve our goals.” Asked why he chose the Ga-Mphahlele based side as they were other PSL teams were after his signature, Jampies said: “It is true they were three other teams that wanted me. But after I had a talk with the Baroka chairman and coach it was easy to choose Baroka. I wanted a team that I will play football in the top flight again. I am already feeling at home at Baroka. The guys and management have been welcoming.”
