BRACE yourself for super Saturday of the Absa Premiership! It will be the last round of matches and the campaign will finish in style with everything set to be decided from top to bottom. Without a doubt, all eyes are at the top of the standings on who will win the Premiership title which is a two-horse race between Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns. But another interesting battle is at the bottom of the table where two of the bottom teams are in danger of being relegated. Polokwane City remains at the bottom of the log with 25 points after a 3-0 loss to Sundowns on Wednesday night and they will need a miracle on Sunday to save their top-flight status. AmaZulu and Baroka FC are in position 15, 14 respectively with 28 points each team. Black Leopards who, managed to get a crucial victory defeating Bidvest Wits 1-0 on Wednesday night (to increase their points tally to 29), are still not safe as they are just a point ahead of Baroka and Amazulu. Chippa United occupy the 12th spot in the table with 31 points which do not really guarantee them safety as anything could happen at the weekend. On Saturday, a team that will finish at the bottom of the table will be relegated to GladAfrica Championship, while number 15 will contest in the promotion / relegation play-offs with Ajax Cape Town and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila. A winner of the three teams mini-league will be promoted to Absa Premiership for next season which is set to commence in October.
