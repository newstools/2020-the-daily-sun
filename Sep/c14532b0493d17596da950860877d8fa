LIMPOPO cops bust six cash-in-transit suspects after a robbery on the R555 in Burgersfort, Limpopo on Monday. Colonel Brenda Muridili said some of the stolen money was recovered, along with five unlicensed firearms with ammunition and five cars. “It is reported that just after 6.30pm on Monday, an unknown number of suspects robbed security guards of an undisclosed amount of money after allegedly using explosives to bomb the armoured vehicle,” she said. A police team followed up on a tip-off, which led them to Polokwane, Mokopane, and Lebowakgomo, where six suspects were bust at their hideouts. Muridili said cops confiscated five cars suspected to have been stolen, while the fifth belonged to one of the suspects. “Five unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as an undisclosed amount of money were also seized,” she said.
