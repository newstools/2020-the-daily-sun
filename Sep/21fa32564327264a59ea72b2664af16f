UNDOUBTEDLY the past 2019-20 season went down as Khama Billiat’s worst campaign since his arrival in South Africa. The Zimbabwean star battled with injuries over the course of the campaign, he was in and out of Ernst Middendorp’s squad. However, the arrival of new coach Gavin Hunt has left the player optimistic that the former Bidvest Wits mentor will help him get back to his best. “I’ve always wanted to work with him,” says Billiat. "He’s a great coach who knows how to win.” Last season Billiat scored three goals for Chiefs in 21 appearances which was his lowest in his time in the PSL. During his previous nine seasons in the country with Ajax Cape Town, Mamelodi Sundowns and now Chiefs, Billiat played less than 20 league games in a season just twice (2013-14 and 2017-18). With the arrival of Hunt who started training the team this week Billiat is excited and confident as he claims there's different energy in the team. “We have seen with him, while coaching other clubs, that no player is ever guaranteed to play. He’s a coach who brings the best out of you. “He makes players feel happy and that’s what we needed. You can feel it at training, there is a different energy.” “He made clear what he expected from me,” Billiat reveals. The Zimbabwe international says that despite their last day disappointment, the 2019-20 season has given them something to build on.“We had a good season as a team. We came so close to winning the league. It means that we have the soldiers and the capacity to succeed. We have to challenge ourselves to do just a bit more.“A new coach will bring in different things, which is good. Challenges always bring the best out of us, players. We all want to do better than last season.”The Premier Soccer League is expected to announce the details around the 2020-21 campaign at a media briefing on Wednesday morning.
