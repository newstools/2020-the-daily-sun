THERE is really no way of separating the wheat from the chaff when it comes to selecting coaches. But outspoken Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane reckons a screening of coaches could help local football attract better coaches from overseas and not the palookas. Almost every season, the PSL welcomes a foreign mentor, some with dodgy qualifications and some who ride on the credibility of their country of birth as a footballing nation. This phenomenon has often closed doors for budding local coaches, who can't get opportunities to guide PSL teams. Mosimane, who invariably advocates for the hiring of local coaches, doesn't mince his words when he shares his opinion on the appointment of coaches, mostly from European countries. ”I think they must screen the coaches, the same way the English football screen players such as Percy Tau who can't get a chance. ”You can't come here when you haven't won anything. What are the chances of you winning here when you haven't won anything before. Let's be honest, if I'm unemployed somewhere in Europe, I come here. ”Most of the guys who come here don't have a job. So, perhaps we should screen.”
