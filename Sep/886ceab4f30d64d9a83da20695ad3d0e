AMAZULU general manager, Lunga Sokhela, has stuck to his guns and vowed not to sell their talismen Bongi Ntuli and Lehlohonolo Majoro. Sokhela said Ntuli is an important player for them in the upcoming season and retaining him is a priority to support new coach Ayanda Dlamini. Cobra, as Dlamini is affectionately known in football circles, was appointed on a permanent basis with a three-year contract last week. The Usuthu boss maintained his star striker is going nowhere. Ntuli was crucial for Usuthu this past season, scoring 13 of the club’s 20 goals in 30 league matches. His performance helped them stave off the relegation axe to finish 13th on the Premiership table. The former Mamelodi Sundowns striker’s importance in the side was evident. He was way ahead of everyone in the team and came third in the league’s top scorers charts. His striking partner Lehlohonolo Majoro scored two league goals. The goals both came when the season restarted in the bio bubble in Gauteng last month, following the suspension of the PSL due to Covid-19 in March. Sokhela said no club have approached them for his burly striker. “We haven’t had any official interest for Bongi Ntuli,” said Sokhela. “We’ve heard a lot of rumours, but nothing official. Ntuli is a critical player in our squad in terms of his position and what he brings to the table. We are not looking to release him. “He is contracted to us and will be continuing with the club.” Sokhela stressed that Majoro, despite looking shaky in the first half of the season, was also staying. The 34-year-old, who rejoined the club from Bidvest Wits at the beginning of the season on a two-year deal, repaid the club’s faith in him when it mattered most by scoring the two goals in the bubble. “Majoro still has a contract with AmaZulu and we are definitely continuing with him,” said Sokhela. “He really stood out, especially in the bio bubble. We hope he can resume on the same form next season.”
