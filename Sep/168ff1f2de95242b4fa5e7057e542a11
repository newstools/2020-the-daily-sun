THE ANC in Mpumalanga has summarily suspended a senior official over rape allegations. This after the official was arrested yesterday for allegedly raping his twin daughters, aged eight, in July. The girls’ mum lives in the Western Cape and they live with their dad. Mpumalanga ANC spokeswoman, Sasekani Manzini, said: “The official has been summarily suspended as a member of the ANC and PEC until the case is concluded by the courts consistent with the resolutions of the most recent ANC NEC meeting and 54th national conference, which resolved that all members charged with corruption and other serious crimes should step aside from all activities associated with the ANC. “The call for the official to step aside will happen concurrently with other formal ANC procedures, which take place when members and leaders are found to be in conflict with the law, which among them is appearing in front of the integrity commission and disciplinary committee.” However, this isn’t the official’s first brush with the law. In 2012, he was charged with the rape of a 26-year-old woman, but his case was withdrawn. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that a 48-year-old and 26-year-old were arrested for the rape of the twin girls. “The case was opened in July and the suspects were arrested yesterday. Their matter is already in court,”  he said. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman, Monica Nyuswa, said the case was postponed  today in the Mbombela Magistrate’s Court to 1 October.
