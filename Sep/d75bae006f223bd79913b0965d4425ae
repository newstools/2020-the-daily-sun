TSHEGOFATSO Pule’s (28) murder case has been postponed to the 20th for yet another pre-trial conference. The case against murder accused Muzikayise Malephane (31) was referred to the Joburg High Court from the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court last week, following a brief appearance. READ: BOY SAW HIS OWN DEATH! The decision for the postponement was made by Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng yesterday. “The defence only got the docket on Monday and there are certain admissions that were made that the state and the defence need to reach a consensus on,” he said. Muzikayise was charged with the pre-meditated murder of a heavily-pregnant Tshegofatso, who was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep in Roodepoort in June. She had been missing for four days. Muzikayise was arrested on June 17 while travelling back to Gauteng from Mpumalanga. The families of both the victim and accused were not in court.
