AMAZULU have appointed Ayanda Dlamini as their head coach on a three year deal. This comes as Dlamini was able to save the club from the relegation axe this past weekend. “We have appointed Ayanda Dlamini as head coach on a three year deal,” said club’s general manager Lunga Sokhela. Dlamini, who coached the club‘s Reserve League, was previously appointed as interim coach after Slovakia-born coach Jozef Vukusic was suspended after the club lost to Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in February. He was then able to navigate the tough task to see Usuthu finish 13th on the Absa Premiership with 30 points from 30 games. Cobra, as he known, said: “I’m looking forward to the challenge. I have been at the club for many years and I’ll continue to bring the happy days to the team." The club’s former striker had already impressed the management. His first game in charge was against then log leaders Kaizer Chiefs in March before the season was suspended. In a match that was mismatched as Usuthu were at the bottom, Usuthu stunned Amakhosi 1-0 at FNB Stadium. It was Usuthu’s first league win over Amakhosi in 13 years. When the season resumed last month, Dlamini’s side won once, lost once and drew four in six matches in the bubble. That was enough to see them retain their Absa Premiership status. In total, Dlamini won two, lost once and drew four of seven games in charge.
