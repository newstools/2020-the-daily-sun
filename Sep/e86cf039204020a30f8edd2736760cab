MPEILE Sesele (43) is pleading with the person who walked away with her daughter Boipelo Mesi to bring her home. After the nine-year-old vanished with an unknown man in blue overalls last Tuesday, residents of Maokeng near Kroonstad have taken it on themselves to search the town for her. Taxis have joined the search, with many residents pleading for the return of the grade 4 pupil. Mpeile told Daily Sun: “I last saw my daughter on Tuesday morning at 11am, when she went to play outside. This is the first time she disappeared and I’m very worried. She was wearing dark purple trackpants, a grey long-sleeved shirt, grey jacket and black boots. She has no visible birthmarks or marks.” What worried her was her daughter was seen with an unknown man. “I reported the matter to police and they are investigating. There’s no way she can go to relatives’ place alone. She has a phone but has to leave it at home when she goes to play. I tried to check for her at the hospital but we were told no visitors were allowed due to Covid-19.” The community is helping the family through the “#Bring back our Boipelo” campaign.
