FORMER president Jacob Zuma has been given new dates to appear before the Zondo Commission: from 16 to 20 November. Commission chairman, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, said yesterday he’d previously determined that today up to Friday would be the week Zuma would appear. He said Zuma was notified, but after some time his attorneys wrote to the commission and said he’d not be appearing this week. “The reason they gave include that he was busy preparing for his criminal trial and his doctors had advised he limits his movement because of his age and Covid-19, and that he was seeking legal advice on the implications of recent amendments to commission regulations,” said Zondo. He didn’t want to comment on Zuma’s reasons for deciding not to appear this week. “I know that in the letter his attorneys have said dates should be negotiated with them or him. No dates will be negotiated with them or with him. “This commission has made it clear to attorneys who represented him before that this commission doesn’t negotiate dates with witnesses.” The commission had set 9 October for the hearing of an application by the commission’s legal team to authorise summonses against Zuma. Zondo said the former president’s lawyers had been informed that, unless he was satisfied there were good grounds for them not to appear, that application would continue without them. He said Zuma could apply to make use of virtual appearance. “But that application will proceed with or without them unless I’m satisfied there are good grounds for them not to be heard,” said Zondo.
