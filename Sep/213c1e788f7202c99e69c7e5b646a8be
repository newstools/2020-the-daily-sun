DEPENDING on where you are, drivers not only have to deal with the first rains, but cold weather too. MasterDrive managing director Eugene Herbert has tips for driving in this weather, as first rains often can even be more high-risk than the middle of the rainy season, because it lifts the oil and waste collected over winter. • Don’t brake harshly, specially if you start to skid. • Brake earlier and with more caution. • Keep both hands on the steering wheel. • Check if wiper blades have weathered over winter. • Give yourself more travel time to not rush. • Don’t use cruise control. • Turn on headlights. • Avoid pooled water on the road, but if you can’t, drive through it slowly in case of hidden debris or potholes. • Leave a larger following distance. • Driving recklessly and speeding increases your chances of sliding out of control. • If you slide, slowly lift your foot off the accelerator but don’t brake harshly or move the steering wheel violently. • If skidding, look where you want to be. If there’s a tree in front of you, don’t look at the tree, but at where you want to go. • Go for driver training on a skidpan on how to react if you lose control in rainy weather.
