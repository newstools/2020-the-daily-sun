GOGO Tselane Soyisa has no living relatives or kids.  So in 2006, she put the Grace Bible Church down as the beneficiary in her will. But the 75-year-old from Tshepisong, west of Joburg, is now angry with the church and changed her mind. The gogo said she would not be leaving the house, which has a swimming pool, to the church anymore. She said this because when she was in hospital for six months, no one from the church bothered to visit her. She said she wrote a new will, but mamfundisi Gege Sono from the church was refusing to return the title deed. “I have been fighting to get my title deed from her since 2017. I feel they don’t want me, but want my things,” she said. Tselane said she joined the church in 1998, and was a devoted member. She said she was admitted to hospital in 2017, and informed the church that she was sick. “I was heartbroken and left without hope when not one of them visited me,” she said. The gogo said Gege visited her in 2006, after she informed the church of her will. “The very same Gege couldn’t visit me in hospital, but could come to assess my house,” she said. The gogo said she had decided to leave the house to her adopted son Tello Motseki, but she needed the title deed. Gege told Daily Sun: “I have had enough of this woman. It’s not a decent thing for an elderly person to spread lies. She just wants attention. I’m not interested in her property.” When asked about the title deed, the mamfundisi said the gogo handed over a document, but she didn’t know if that was the title deed.
