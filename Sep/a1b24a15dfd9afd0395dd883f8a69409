IT’S the moment of truth for Ajax Cape Town in their bid to earn promotion back to the top-flight. The Urban Warriors, who have been in the second-tier of Mzansi football, the GladAfrica Championship for two seasons, are eager to return to the big time. However, they face a mammoth task in the PSL promotion/relegation play-offs against Black Leopards and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM). Leopards, in particular, have been faultless in the three-team mini-league with a perfect record, so far. Lidoda Duvha currently top the log with six points from two matches, showing the other two teams a clean pair of heels in the race for the final spot in the Premiership. But the Urban Warriors could still topple Leopards if they win both their remaining matches, and the Limpopo side falter. Calvin Marlin’s side are back in action on Tuesday afternoon (3pm), when they take on TTM at the Bidvest Stadium. “The six days have been good for the boys to rest,” said Marlin. “Of course, their minds have been focused on our next match and on fixing the mistakes we made in our last match. “But the rest has done the boys well. They feel refreshed and have regenerated well. They are up for the next tough game against TTM.” Marlin admitted that Ajax now have a mountain to climb if they are to earn promotion, but he believes it is not impossible.CONTINUED ON PAGE 15
