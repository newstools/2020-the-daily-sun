It has been six months since Mzansi started its hard lockdown which closed its borders and economy. "Although we have made progress, we are still during a
deadly pandemic. "Our most important task is that we do not experience
a new surge in infections, "he said. Ramaphosa said with the infection declining and the country
was ready for a new phase of the pandemic. " Now is the time to return our country to a situation
that is more normal. It is time to move to what we call our new normal.  International travel will also resume from  1 October. “International travel in and out of South Africa will be restricted and from certain countries with high infection rates”,said Ramaphosa.
