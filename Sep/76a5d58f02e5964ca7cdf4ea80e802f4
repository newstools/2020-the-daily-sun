COPS are looking for suspects who broke into the B3 Funeral Parlour in Springs early this morning. Two unarmed suspects locked up the security guard and started to ransack the office. They stole two computers, got into their car and left. A case of business robbery was opened at Springs Police Station in Ekurhuleni. The 45-year-old security guard told police he was on duty when he heard a noise outside and went out and saw two men, who told him to go back to his guardroom. They locked it from the outside and then forced open the front security gate and door to gain entry. “The suspects removed two computers from the office of the funeral parlour and left,” cops said. There was no CCTV footage of the incident and the suspects didn’t have firearms. Cops are looking for the two.
