Calculators are the order of the day. Pitso Mosimane and Ernst Middendorp must be without nails having bitten them throughout the season, when their teams went on a roller-coaster ride, until Saturday when it all comes to an ends.  And Limpopo is in control!Clubs based in the northern part of the country – Baroka FC and Black Leopards – hold the key to the final destination of the 2019-20 Absa Premiership title. Bakgaga host log leaders Chiefs at Milpark’s Bidvest Stadium (3.30pm), while their provincial rivals Lidoda Duvha battle it out with second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns at the Dobsonville Stadium on the same day, at the same time. Chiefs and Sundowns are equal on points (56) following their respective wins against Chippa United (1-0) and Polokwane City (3-0) in midweek.  The Limpopo sides have their own relegation worries and they certainly will make it difficult for Chiefs and Downs to clinch the title with ease. By all indications, the PSL’s dreaded axe has already claimed its first victim mathematically, Polokwane City, on Wednesday.Baroka and Leopards are also involved in their own battles to avoid fighting for their PSL status via the relegation/promotion play-offs. The title race has certainly kept spectators on the edge of their seats with the Brazilians closing the 13-point gap on log leaders Amakhosi to push the race down to the wire. Much as he is unhappy with the rate in which they are scoring goals, but Mosimane is satisfied with a collective 80 goals scored this year. "We're playing against a team that I would say is a well rested team," Mosimane said. He added that on Saturday they will "leave their skin on the pitch".They want to bow out competitively. Shabba on Chiefs and the final lap “It’s all about those 90 minutes. Of course, the coach will do the line-up and discuss the tactics with the team, but thereafter it’s up to the players to do the job." -@siphiweshabba https://t.co/bHTBSJRSVE#Amakhosi4Life
