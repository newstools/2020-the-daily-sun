A GATVOL mum took matters into her own hands after izinyoka wires shocked her five-year-old child. Lwakhe Nyakatya’s son, Luminathi, was the third child to touch the wires at Pango squatter camp in Munsieville, Mogale City. Two other children were not as lucky as him when they were electrocuted over two years ago. Last week, Lwakhe single handedly removed all the illegal wires in her area. ESKOM WARNS IZINYOKA! Speaking to Daily Sun, the angry mum said: “Last Thursday, I was cleaning my house and my child went out to play. “I then heard him screaming and when I got to him, he came to me crying that he was burnt.” She said that she took Luminathi to the clinic and he was transferred to Leratong Hospital where he spent a week. Lwakhe said she went alone and took everything out, including the point where they were connected. “Later that night, the residents put them back and insulted me. Our kids are not safe here,” she said. Resident Thumeka Tsotso (51) said they thought the izinyoka would leave when the area started being formally connected, but this never happened. Mogale City spokesman Lucky Sele said: “Last month, the mayor went there to electrify the area. “Phase one covered 700 households, while phase two is underway for the remaining homes.” He said those with illegal connections were probably people who had not done the correct paperwork to qualify for a subsidy, many of whom were not South African citizens.
