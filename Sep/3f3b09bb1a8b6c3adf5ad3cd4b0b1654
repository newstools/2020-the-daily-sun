MAMELODI flood victims want answers from the City of Tshwane. Yesterday, they marched to the municipal offices in Denneboom after waiting for almost two weeks after handing over a memorandum of demands on 21 August. Community leader Kgaugelo Masemola (33) said they protested against the unlawful relocation of people. “We need to know when our relocation process will resume. There are unlawful people who are now benefiting as they don’t even have documents. “We signed papers to authorise us to settle on the new land. They are delaying and wasting our time. The municipality bought the land in Mooiplaas, east of Tshwane to relocate us,” he said. Masemola said they were disappointed by the city’s leadership and accused them of failing residents. “How can we be patient in a dangerous flood zone? In other words, they are telling us to wait for death.” He said the relocation started in July and the solution was to move residents before the rain season started. Masemola said the priority was to move flood victims and other informal settlements residents near danger zones. Another community leader, December Matlala (28), said it was sad to be waiting for a response while the rainy season was almost here. “We will take to the streets and shut down Mamelodi if our grievances are undermined,” Matlala said. Former Tshwane acting mayor and current ActionSA Gauteng operations director, Abel Tau, said the community faced many challenges. “We have taken it upon ourselves to help the flood victims to resolve their issues. The relocation is being delayed and we will not allow corrupt elements to taint this process. “We can’t afford to have another incident before we move on, so we can’t allow people to die before we act,” said Tau. The City of Tswane did not respond to Daily Sun’s queries at the time of going to print.
