THE family of Festus “Mchini” Matshogo is struggling to find closure following his death a year ago. The Rand West City councillor’s house in Mohlakeng kasi was petrol-bombed last year and has still not been fixed, making it a daily reminder of the family’s loss. Members of the family said the house was never fixed, despite the municipality receiving insurance money. Mchini’s brother, Bantam, (60) said he was worried the money was stolen. “We want to know why they’re not distributing the money the insurance paid out. “They must give us money for the house and furniture. “During the funeral, the mayor at the time publicly promised to help rebuild the house. “We were under the impression it was something not to worry about.” He said after making several trips to the municipal offices, the manager finally told him the money had been paid out. “He said it was paid into the municipal bank account, yet no one came to tell us what was happening with the house.” The family has a dispute with Mchini’s partner, Annah Kgaje, over ownership of the furniture in the house. Annah told the SunTeam she helped buy some of the furniture and wanted her fair share. She said the house belonged to the family and she wasn’t claiming it. Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Thlaripe said the life insurance and funeral benefit money was paid to Annah. “The payment for the house and contents were also made to the municipality. “But due to family issues, it hasn’t yet been paid to them. “Meetings were held with family representatives on two occasions. “The municipal manager decided to take the matter to council.”
