TS GALAXY will start their camp on Friday in preparation for the new PSL season. Sunsport has reliably learnt that Galaxy boss Tim Sukazi had a meeting with Highlands Park players on Monday to outline his plans. Although the sale of Highlands has yet to be ratified by the PSL, Sukazi seems to be forging ahead with his plans having roped in coach Dan Malesela to be in charge in the top flight. Said the Source: “The new management told the  players about their ambition and informed those who are not interested to play for Galaxy to come forward since they won’t stand on their way to seek for greener pastures elsewhere.” Malesela decided to take players for camp in order to blend both sets of players from Galaxy that used to campaign in the GladAfrica Championship and Highlands ahead of the start of new season in October. “Malesela and his technical staff doesn’t have enough time to gel the players and that’s why he decided to take them for camp so that they can also get used to each other," explained the source. Galaxy are expected to use Mbombela Stadium in Mpumalanga as their home ground. Sukazi was not available for comment as his mobile phone rang unanswered.
