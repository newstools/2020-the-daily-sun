OWNERS of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivandila (TTM) could get much more than the R10 million they have made from the sale of the club. TTM, campaigning in the GladAfrica Championship, bought the Premiership status of Bidvest Wits for over R50m and are guaranteed a spot in the PSL gravy-train. But it seems little did they think they could actually make it all the way to the PSL without paying a cent. This is after TTM qualified for the promotion play-offs, having finished third in the GladAfrica Championship, which has just been completed. They will battle it out with Ajax Cape Town and the team that finishes 15th in the Premiership, for a spot in the elite division. Success for TTM in the play-offs will mean Simon Malatjie has acquired ownership of the club at a bargain. But perhaps maybe not. According to a source close to the Trust that owns TTM, Malatjie would have to pay more than the R10m, should the team gain promotion to the Premiership. TTM official, Masala Mulaudzi, was quoted as saying the selling price for the club depended on where the team will be based, with the franchise going for R10m for those residing in Limpopo and R12m for outsiders. Malaudzi further explained the sale could not wait as Wits were ready to sell their franchise, as a matter of urgency. “Imagine if we did not opt to buy the PSL status now and TTM failed to gain promotion at the end of the season, we could have lost everything,” Mulaudzi said. The league has provisionally approved the sale of Wits, but are yet to ratify the transaction. Should the executive committee approve the sale, Wits will relocate to Limpopo at the end of the season and campaign as TTM.
