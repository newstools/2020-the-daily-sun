THE Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) trophy has reportedly disappeared from the cabinet in Egypt. Former Egyptian FA vice-president Ahmed Shobier has sensationally claimed that the most coveted title in African football has been stolen from the EFA headquarters in Cairo. He said they were informed by an employee inside the association that it was last held by former Egypt captain, Ahmed Hassan, who refuted the claim. “Officials of the committee which meets every five years and currently manages the Football Association were surprised that the trophy was not available, in light of their desire to create a museum at the federation headquarters, which would feature the trophy and the national team’s kits, ” said Shobir. ”However, (they) were surprised to find that the Afcon trophy was lost, and decided to open an investigation. “The committee searched for the trophy, but then an employee told them that Ahmed Hassan, the former captain of the Egyptian national team, who won the cup three times in a row, has kept it.” After learning of the trophy’s disappearance, Hassan took to social media to express his dismay at the loss. “I wish I had kept the cup in my house instead of it being lost and I am surprised that I’m being questioned about the cup after nine years, despite the presence of two FA boards, and the five-year committee for a year and two months…but they’re only now looking for the cup,” said Hassan.
