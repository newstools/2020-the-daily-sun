THEMED “The show must go on”, the Durban Fashion Fair is happening on virtual platforms next week from Wednesday until Friday. The glitzy event will celebrate fashion and boost the city’s economy, featuring over 25 top designers, including Indoni Fashion House, Lordes Designer Wear, Duke “Clothe Your Soul”, Nguni Shades, Vyagor Louvre (Sihle Hope), Treasure Cindi, Mita-N Dzyns, Sibu Msimang and Sindi M. eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said: “Identifying and optimising empowerment opportunities is crucial to ensure sustainability of businesses. The festival is one platform to assist in the city’s economic recovery efforts. Often, we focus only on traditional manufacturing and services sectors when it comes to growing the city’s economy, but we should never forget the important contribution made by the creative industries. The textile and clothing industry, which includes both big businesses and SMMEs, is one of the most important segments.” Kaunda said the close association between the fashion world and the economy stretches even further, as the festival was an important part of the 2020 Durban Business Fair. “This premier business gathering, proudly hosted by eThekwini Municipality through the business support, tourism and markets unit, has reflected local government’s commitment to boosting business growth for more than 22 years. “Since the festival was launched at the SMME Fair with just under 100 participants, it has grown to a major event on the business calendar and features over 600 successful enterprises across diverse sectors. It is an important platform for businesses to access new markets, acquire much-needed information and forge business linkages that translate into sustainable growth.”
