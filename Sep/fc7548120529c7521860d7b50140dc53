WAYNE Sandilands and Happy Jele are set to renew their contacts with Orlando Pirates next week. SunSport can reveal that the 37-year-old is set to remain with the Soweto giants for the new season. The future of skipper, Happy Jele, is also up for discussion, but indications are that he will renew. Jele, the club’s long-serving defender, saw his current deal expire at the end of this delayed season.  Club administration officer, Floyd Mbele, said the players have been given time off due to the recently ended season and issues relating to contracts will be dealt with next week. Sandilands, who joined Pirates from Mamelodi Sundowns at the beginning of 2017-18 season, dominated Bucs’ goalkeeping department this season ahead of Frenchman Joris Delle and Siyabonga Mpontshane. Mpontshane (34) didn’t play a single match while Delle (30) featured in four matches in all competitions. However, the nomadic keeper conceded a whopping 11 goals (including four in a 4-3 loss against Bidvest Wits and three against Cape Town City in a 3-3 draw). The numbers favour the Benoni born goalie Sandilands. Sandilands appeared in 27 of 30 Absa Premiership matches the Soweto giants played. In those games, he conceded 21 goals and kept the clean sheets 13 times. In total, in 30 games in all competitions, he conceded 24 goals. He played a huge role as Pirates finished third in the Absa Premiership, saving two penalties in the penultimate game of the season against SuperSport United at Emirates Airline Park Stadium in the bio bubble. Sandilands is in the running for the 2019-20 Goalkeeper of the Season award along with Ronwen Williams (SuperSport United), Richard Ofori (Maritzburg United) and Cape Town City’s Peter Leeuwenburgh.
