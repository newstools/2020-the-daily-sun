DO want yourself a new Toyota hatchback? Well, just buy yourself the Suzuki Baleno. I’m not joking – the new Starlet is basically a Suzuki Baleno with a Toyota badge. I guess the Japanese automaker is serious about fixing its badge to cars rolling off other manufacturers’ production lines – remember the current Toyota Supra is based on the BMW Z4.  When the Supra was launched, many Supra fans were not impressed with Toyota’s move, but as it is, the current BMW-based Supra is drawing back those critics. Now, we’ll wait to see if the Starlet will do the same.  Targeted at African countries, it’s powered by the naturally aspirated 1,4-litre petrol Suzuki K14B engine.  The engine produces 68kW and 130Nm. All that power will be sent to the wheels through a five-speed manual gearbox or four-speed automatic transmission.
