Former African National Congress (ANC) Western Cape provincial secretary Songezo Mjongile has died. Mjongile, who also served as the president Congress of South African Students (COSAS), died of colon cancer at his house in Johannesburg last night. ANC’s national spokesman Pule Mabe said the death of Mjongile is not only a loss to his family but the party as well. “Comrade Songezo, through his selfless and dedicated activism, went on to be elected as the Provincial Treasurer and later Provincial Secretary of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape,” said Mabe. On 29 August Mjongile posted on his Facebook announcing that he was diagnosed with colon cancer in April. He wrote that some of his wishes were “to contribute to the renewal of the ANC and the success of the National Democratic Revolution (NDR)”. Mabe said: “This was a reflection of the commitment Comrade Songezo had to the ANC, the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM) structures and to the broader society of South Africa.” On the day he announced about his sickness, Mjongile said: “To all my friends and comrades, I have discovered in April that I suffer from colon cancer. Chemotherapy did not work, instead of side effects have led to two incidents of kidney failure and a mild heart attack. I survived with the grace of God. I’m living my second lease of life and pray to God to give me the power to raise my kids and family.”
