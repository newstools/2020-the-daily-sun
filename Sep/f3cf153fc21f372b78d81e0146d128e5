   CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink and forward Kermit Erasmus have been named the Absa Premiership Player and Coach of the Month for August / September, respectively. The pair are the last recipients of the individual monthly accolades for the recently concluded 2019-20 Absa Premiership season. It is the first time Riekerink has been named the Coach of the Month since assuming the reigns at the Mother City-based club in November 2019. The Dutchman guided The Citizens to five wins out of their seven games in the bio-bubble since local football’s restart in August. In the process, they scored 10 goals and conceded five goals. The impressive victories, which included some big games for the club, moved City from a lowly position on the log to finish season impressively on position six. Erasmus played extremely well throughout this period and his Player of the Month award largely hinged on the four goals he scored in the seven outings for the club, mostly match-winning goals. Thabiso Kutumela, the Maritzburg United forward, walked away with the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award for this period. His stunning low drive from outside the 18-yard area in his club’s 2-2 draw against league champions Mamelodi Sundowns, earned him the nod. Each of the goals selected during the monthly voting will now go towards the list of goals that will be voted for the Absa-lutely Awesome Goal of the Season to be revealed during the PSL Awards. 2019/20 Absa Premiership Goal of the Month winners: August: Hlompo Kekana (Mamelodi Sundowns) September/October: Thabo Nodada (Cape Town City) November: Dumisani Zuma (Kaizer Chiefs) December: Samir Nurkovic (Kaizer Chiefs) January: Gabadinho Mhango (Orlando Pirates) February: Lebogang Manyama (Kaizer Chiefs) August/September: Thabiso Kutumela (Maritzburg United)  -PSL MEDIA
