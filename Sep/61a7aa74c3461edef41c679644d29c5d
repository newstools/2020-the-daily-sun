LONDEKA Mchunu is gearing up for a new role on Isibaya. The actress – known for playing blessee Snegugu on Isithembiso – told Daily Sun she was excited to play her new character, Londiwe. Londeka, sister to funny Uzalo actress Nelisa Mchunu, spoked to the SunTeam from the Isibaya set. “I love this new character. She’s very different from my breakout role as Snegugu. “Londiwe is louder and more traditional than my previous character, who spoke English.

I read it and loved it.” Londeka never thought she’d take up acting as a career – “it was God’s plan”. “I don’t have any formal acting training,” she said. “I never thought I’d pursue this career. “It was all coincidence, but I’ve fallen in love with it. “I can’t imagine myself doing anything else.” Londeka’s character will start appearing on Isibaya later this week.
