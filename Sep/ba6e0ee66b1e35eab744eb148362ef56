EIGHT tactical response team cops will spend the night behind bars after they were arrested today by the anti-corruption unit on charges of business robbery, defeating the ends of justice and perjury. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “Allegedly on 20 June, tactical response team members from Welkom had an operation at a supermarket in Station Street, Kroonstad, where they arrested the owner and his wife for contravention of the Disaster Management Act for selling cigarettes during the lockdown period. A large amount of money and cigarettes were confiscated. “According to statements by members, they found an unknown man outside the shop smoking. They confronted him and he told them he bought the cigarettes inside from the owner. Members went inside the shop, where they arrested the owner and his wife. The two were later released and money and cigarettes handed back to them. That is when it emerged the amount handed back to them was not the same as the one taken. “Intensive investigation was conducted and it was discovered the money handed in during the arrest of the shop owners was not the same as initially confiscated. It was also discovered the alleged unknown man was related to one of the members. The anti-corruption unit arrested eight members based in Welkom this morning on allegation of being involved in a business robbery, defeating the ends of justice, as well as perjury. They will appear in Kroonstad Magistrates Court on Friday.” Anyone who might be the victim of similar incidents is urged to call Sergeant Tebogo Seekoei at 060 981 1458 or Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
