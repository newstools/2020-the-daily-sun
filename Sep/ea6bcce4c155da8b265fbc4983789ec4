We are living in a time where people care more about other people’s lives than their own. Some people will go on to gossip about their neighbours or friend’s shenanigans while their own problems mount. We must beware of such people because they have the ability to destroy. If someone speaks ill of you, it means they’re digging a grave for you. They’re killing your spirit. My view is that if I’m not happy about somebody, I must tell them face to face. Gossip destroys. We should cut out such people. Even a friend or family can plot your downfall. To the distractors, get a life and focus on your own lives. Don’t waste your resources on things that won’t build you. - Letter by Godfrey Malibe, Acornhoek
