ACCORDING to a report by The Telegraph, Vietnamese cops have bust a ring dealing in recycled used condoms and nabbed an estimated 345 000 used condoms, which had been cleaned and resold as new. Footage broadcast by Vietnam Television showed dozens of large bags containing the used condoms scattered across the floor of a warehouse. The cops said the bags weighed over 360kg. The owner of the warehouse told newspaper Tuoi Tre they received a monthly input of used condoms from an unknown person. A woman detained during the bust told cops the used condoms were first boiled in water and then dried and reshaped on a wooden phallus before being repackaged and resold.
