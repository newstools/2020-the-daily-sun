THE radio presenter was left furious after his kid was hit by a municipal bakkie. Thabang Senyatso, who presents Mmabatho FM’s afternoon drive show, said it was difficult to see his child go through pain every day. The 28-year-old told Daily Sun last month a van ran over the child’s leg while waiting at the gate of the family home in Lichtenburg, North West. “My child saw the van coming and waited for it to pass and was in serious pain after the accident and even now, the leg is still painful,” he said. Thabang said the kid was at Bophelong Hospital in Mahikeng for five days and was still struggling to walk. “My child needs counselling.” "SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD SO I CAN DIE" Thabang blamed the municipality for being irresponsible. He said officials failed the family and should have paid for his kid to go to a private hospital. “I need the municipality to take care of the bills and pay me back the money I spent. The municipality must now take care of my child.” The child’s mum, Mami Moswetsi (25), said the incident left her heartbroken. “My child needs counselling and starts crying when a car comes by and has nightmares. This is not good for my child and I don’t know when the leg will be all right. “What I need is help for my child to walk properly again.” Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said: “A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened.” Ditsobotla municipal spokesman Pius Batsile said they were conducting internal investigations about the crash. “We will get in touch with the family soon to convey our sympathy and to take our discussion to another level.”
