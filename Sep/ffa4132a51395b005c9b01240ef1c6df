Kaizer Chiefs may have ridden their luck as they benefited from a disputed disallowed goal, but coach Ernst Middendorp says all that matters is the three points after they claimed a narrow 1-0 victory over nine-man Chippa United in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday. Khama Billiat gave Chiefs an early lead as they moved to within one win of a first trophy in five years, but again were less than convincing and profited from a poor piece of refereeing from Jelly Chavani when he disallowed a goal for Chippa with a little over 10 minutes remaining, claiming a foul on Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune. Replays showed that Khune, playing his first game since February, had actually tripped over his own feet and the goal should have stood.     “It’s about points now. It’s about winning. I’m fully aware about that. It’s what presents Kaizer Chiefs there’s no doubt about it. You could see today there was two days less recovery time,” Middendorp said.“They [Chippa] played on Friday and we played on Sunday and this makes a huge, huge difference. We had a lot of players before the game already, I was aware about it how far it is possible to bring them through.“Good, I’m very happy with the entire team, technical team and players that we have on what they have gone through and successfully. It was a win with a lot of fighting spirit and that’s something we needed today and need on Saturday.”Chiefs finish their season against relegation-threatened Baroka FC, where victory should secure them the league title, unless Sundowns get a massive win against Black Leopards.Chiefs are level on points with Sundowns with a +21 goal-difference, while the Brazilians have +18. Chiefs have also outscored their rivals 47-40, meaning Sundowns would in fact need a four-goal swing in their favour to move above the AmaKhosi.
