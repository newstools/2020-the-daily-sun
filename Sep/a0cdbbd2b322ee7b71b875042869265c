NEW DStv Premiership club Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are set to announced their new coach this week. A source told SunSport that it is likely to be Zimbabwean and former Chippa United coach, Norman Mapeza. Mapeza joined the Port Elizabeth outfit last October. But the Harare-born mentor resigned after spending only five months with the Chilli Boys. Vhadau Vhadamani have also been linked with the likes of Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama and former Bafana Bafana coach Gordon Igesund. However, Tshakhuma president Masala Mulaudzi is believed to have been pleased with the 48-year-old former Zimbabwean international. The source also revealed that Da Gama is the Venda-based side’s preferred coach. But he is still having issues with TS Galaxy who have bought Highlands Park status and the former Orlando Pirates coach still has a contract with The Lions of the North. Galaxy have already appointed Dan Malesela as their new head coach. The source also said TTM were also talking to Igesund, but they couldn’t agree on financial terms. “They (Tshakhuma) will have a coach this week as they want to start to prepare for new season. “Mapeza, Da Gama and Igesund were the ones the club have been talking to, but they are happy with Mapeza,” said our source. Tshakhuma communications manager, Tshidino Ndou, declined to comment when contacted on Mapeza being linked with TTM “I cannot talk about the new coach issue,” said Ndou. All I know is that the club will announce a coach this week.” “We know that we have been linked with many coaches but people should wait for the announcement.”
