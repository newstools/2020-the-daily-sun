BLACK Leopards are smelling blood and looking to go for the kill in the underway PSL promotion/relegation play-offs. They will be determined to take another massive step towards saving their top-flight status when they face Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at the Bidvest Stadiumon Saturday (3pm). Lidoda Duvha head into the encounter high in confidence, having secured three valuable points against Ajax Cape Town last time out. They currently sit at the top of the three-team mini-league standings by virtue of a better goal-difference over the Urban Warriors. And their opponents, TTM, are yet to register a point on the table after they went down 3-2 at the hands of Ajax in their first match. Leopards coach Morgan Shivambu was pleased with his side’s start to the play-offs against Ajax, however, he is now crossing fingers that they keep their foot stuck on the accelerator. Shivambu reckons a win against their neighbours TTM would put them in a commanding position in the play-offs, as they look to hang on to their spot in the money spinning Premiership. “In the play-offs it’s only four games, so it is very important to start strong and maintain that momentum,” said Shivambu. “If you can get three points in the first game, then you can try and use that advantage to add more points in the second game. “Ajax already had three points, so it was important that we beat them and also get off to a good start. We didn’t want to drop points there.” Shivambu, though, is not underestimating TTM and is expecting them to bring the fight to Leopards as they search for their first points. “They are a good team,” added Shivambu. “It’s a derby away from home. I believe we will be ready for them. We just need a win against them.”
