Mngoma is currently appearing at the Tshwane Magistrate's Court this morning on
charges related to malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. Mngoma who
was previously known as Gigaba was arrested by the Hawks in July after her
husband, former Cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba, opened a case against her. He had
claimed that she damaged a Mercedes Benz G-Wagon. Mngoma
spent a night in police holding cells in the Brooklyn Police station before
being released on an R5000 bail by her lawyer Victor Nkwatshu. Norma Mngoma looking stylish in a grey three-piece suit during her second court appearance at Tshwane Magistrate court on charges related to malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. pic.twitter.com/IIMkOGXyDL  On her last
court appearance at the Hatfield Magistrate court, her lawyer said he wants the
case declared unlawful and invalid due to the involvement of the Hawks. While
Nkwatshu was the only representative that arrives at the Magistrate court,
Mngoma has also brought two legal power kings, Advocate Dali Mpofu and Advocate
Thembeka Ngcukaitobi to assist her in her case.
