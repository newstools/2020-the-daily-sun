WHILE dread diseases are killing millions, the humble Solven Mathebula (42) and his wife Veronica Mhangana (28) say their incredibly powerful and healing muthi has saved many people. Speaking to the SunTeam at their home in Croquetlawn Village outside Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, they said they use indigenous muthi to beat disease. “We heal TB, ulcers, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, bed-wetting, mafulatsa, STIs, mental disorders and kidney problems, as well as doing 4-5 enlargement and cleansing of the system. My gogo and her brother were famous powerful healers in Rolle Village,” Solven said. He said his gogo showed him the secret healings before she died some years ago. “So many of our clients were on medication prescribed by doctors for acute chronic illnesses, but after using the two-litre muthi for at least for two to three weeks, they come back happily when they test negative at hospital. They eat what they like,” he said. Veronica said marrying Solven was a blessing in disguise. “Our ancestors miraculously made us met. I am a healer and underwent intensive training after I fell sick and was bedridden. After heeding the calling, I was a happy woman. The ancestors came in my dreams happily, showing me the crowd of sick people for me to help them,” she said. An excited Marta Xivangelo (55) said: “I was sick with breast cancer. I could not sleep from the pains and had been in and out the hospital, but I am now healed and happy,” while gogo Nyankwabe Shilote (67) said: “I was diabetic for almost 14 years, but this couple incredibly beat the diabetes and my doctors were shocked when I tested negative.” Andile Shongwe (35) said he had kidney failure and his cousin’s son was epileptic, but they now are healed as well. “Our government must ensure it protects this couple’s rare and wonderful indigenous knowledge to save the dying world,” said Andile.
