AS he inspects the wreckage of Kaizer Chiefs’ PSL title
crash, Ernst Middendorp finds himself with more questions than answers. Will he still be in the Chiefs’ hot-seat next season or
should he be preparing for his exit interview already? But the one thing not in question is Middendorp’s
disappointment at how his team let the league title slip. On the last day of the dramatic league title race, Amakhosi
saw closest rivals Mamelodi Sundowns snatch the title from right under their
noses with a comprehensive 3-0 win against Black Leopards to finish on 59. Leading at the top by as many as 13 points at some stage,
Middendorp’s men dropped talk massive points in their 1-1 with Baroka... and,
of course, it ended in tears.  ”Of course, ending up with the possibilities in our own
hands and ending up being second after having over 28 match days being in
position one is of course disappointing," said Middendorp. ”We are all disappointed. It’s not only the technical team.
It’s the players, of course, the supporters, the fans who were hoping that
their birthday 50th year achieving it to be the champion. ”It is obviously disappointing on my side... definitely to
mention that we had a terrible finish last season with losing the cup and being
out of the top-eight. “And with nearly as I said before they turned it around and
worked hard. There’s no doubt about it in the end. Good, we haven’t achieved
what we wanted. Position one and we have to at this moment now accept it, that’s
it.”      -- tso
