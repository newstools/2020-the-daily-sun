 Hugh Masekela’s Thuma Mina, a song which evokes the lyrics of a hugely popular South African gospel chorus, was written by Masekela, Sello Twala and Peter Mokoena and became one of Bra Hugh’s most memorable hits. It’s a song highlighting themes of self-sacrifice and individual responsibility and perhaps there’s no better time than now to re-ignite South Africans to contribute to rebuilding the country. Now, some celebrated producers, musical directors and musicians – including Abigail Kubeka, Vusi Mahlasela, Thandiswa Mazwai, Zolani Mahola and J’Something – have put their voices together in a masterful remake of Thuma Mina to urge everyone to answer the call.
