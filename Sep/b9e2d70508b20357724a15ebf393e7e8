The flamboyant family the Kardashians will no longer grace E!’s Entertainment channel. This follows an announcement by Kim that the show will not return for its 15th year. The reality TV star shot to fame after a sex tape leaked with Brandy Norwood’s brother Ray J. She posted on Instagram: “It is with heavy hearts that we’ve made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” She said as a family they were grateful to the viewers for watching their show for the last 14 years. “After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who’ve watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We’ll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we’ve met along the way,” she said. ???? pic.twitter.com/PaAF4hgmU5
