PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has paid a glowing tribute to author and political activist Achmat Dangor, crediting him for inspiring writers and giving a voice to the voiceless. After Dangor died on Sunday aged 71, Ramaphosa said his death was a loss to the literary, arts and culture community. “Dangor was born into a family whose members have played a leading role in this country’s history and development. I convey my deepest sympathies to the family who have lost a son, a brother and a father.” He said as one of the founders of the Congress of South African Writers, Dangor published novels and a short story collection. Dangor became involved in the freedom struggle in his youth and played a leading role in mobilising the literary scene against apartheid and promoting protest writing by black authors locally and internationally. “Among the many lessons we draw from his life is the importance of supporting the arts and culture as key pillars of a country’s development,” Ramaphosa said. After the fall of apartheid, Dangor was active in civil society and headed the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund and Nelson Mandela Foundation. Ramaphosa said Dangor would be remembered for his powerful writing that captured the bitter conditions South Africans suffered under apartheid.
