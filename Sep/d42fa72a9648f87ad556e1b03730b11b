  The organisations called for accountability and transparency. "The  kind of sacrifices South Africans have made [during the pandemic], the last thing they expected was for the funds to help alleviate poverty, ensure that our frontline healthcare workers have the necessary PPE and equipment to do the work that was required, [was] to find that it was of inferior quality or not delivered at all," Ahmed Kathrada Foundation executive director Neeshan Balton said.   The country has been rocked by allegations of Covid-19 corruption. One of the most recent being the Gauteng PPE scandal, which implicated presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko and her husband, as well as Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku, and his wife, Loyiso.   "When the people who call themselves our leaders steal from the poor, the hungry, the sick… that's when you know that you have begun to sow the seeds for the downfall of this country of Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela's dreams," he said. The organisation said they met with a government delegation, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, on Friday, 11 September 2020, to emphasise this call for a transparent and accountable government. In their presentation to Ramaphosa, the group's demands included the following: - Name and shame the corrupt, and support and strengthen honest public servants and whistleblowers; - Call for the government to ensure that all public representatives and political party executive committee members and their immediate families, as well as all civil servants, not be allowed to conduct business with the state; - That the law enforcement agencies investigate, recoup the money and prosecute those in the public and private sector involved in Covid-19 corruption; and - We want to see Covid-19 looters in orange overalls, they stated.
