SOUTH Africans should continue to reclaim, not only their heritage, but their pride and dignity. This was President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Heritage Day address yesterday. He called on Mzansi to join the global #JerusalemaChallenge craze, which many did. “As much as we celebrate our customs and traditions on this day, let’s also appreciate that in practising our cultures freely and openly, and in speaking our native languages, we’re reclaiming not just our heritage, but our pride and our dignity as South Africans,” he said. The president said the country shouldn’t allow gender-based violence to become part of our heritage. He said as long as women and children lived in fear of violence, the nation was not free. “Abusing women is not our tradition, nor is it our custom. It’s not, and will never be, our heritage. Throughout the history of this continent, women have built and shaped our societies, he said. Getting back to positive aspects of Mzansi, he said: “We’re a nation of 11 official languages. That also celebrates other languages commonly used by various communities, including German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. “We’re a nation that protects indigenous languages that are facing extinction such as N|uu, Nama, isiHlubi, Khelovhedu and other indigenous languages,” Ramaphosa said. He said this year’s Heritage Month was dedicated to Esther Mahlangu, the internationally-renowned Ndebele painter, Mama Madosini Latozi Mpahleni, the queen of Pondoland music and Mama Ouma Katrina Esau, the champion of the San people’s culture. “Heritage shapes, moulds and gives us a sense of belonging It is the inheritance passed down from generation to generation, linking the present to the past,” he said.
