PITSO Mosimane says: “We don’t envy our neighbours.” An impression created by the Mamelodi Sundowns coach is that one must fend for themselves instead of salivating at a neighbour’s steak. Their battle for supremacy with Kaizer Chiefs, in the final lap of the Absa Premiership championship marathon, is going down to the wire tomorrow. Chiefs face Baroka FC at Milpark. Sundowns will be in Soweto negotiating three points against relegation-threatened Black Leopards at Dobsonville Stadium. The final PSL matches round tomorrow starts at 3.30pm.   Said Mosimane: “I’m unhappy about not scoring as much as we should have. My unhappiness isn’t about logs, but goals. We play better now since I’ve implemented 4-4-2.  Chiefs and Sundowns are tied on 56 points from 29 matches. The winner will walk away with R15 million. What if they both win tomorrow? Chiefs will be crowned champs on a superior goal difference, having three goals more.  Sundowns need to win 5-0 and hope Chiefs win by a small margin of 1-0, giving them the goal difference.  Coach Ernst Middendorp is looking after Naturena’s interests. “It’s all about winning and Saturday will be no different,” he said. SEE SUNSPORT
