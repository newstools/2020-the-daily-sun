Black Leopards have appointed former Simba SC manager Patrick Aussems as their new coach ahead of the 2020-21 PSL season. The 55-year-old has reportedly agreed to a three-year deal with Lidoda Duvha and is expected to arrive in the country next week. Aussems takes over the reins from Morgan Shivanbu and Mongezi Bobe who were holding the fort as co-caretaker coaches after the shock departure of Alan Clark. The pair managed to save Leopards status through the play-offs as they went unbeaten. However, Leopards boss David Thidiela has decided against keeping the pair at the helm and has instead entrusted Aussems with the task of leading the team next season. "We've said before that we don't just want to throw Morgan and Mongezi into the deep end. As up-and-coming coaches, they need to learn the ropes from someone experienced," Thidiela told City Press. "So, Morgan will remain as assistant coach while we're still finalising details regarding Mongezi who's done well in his first season as our MDC head coach."
