AFTER taking a giant step to survival, AmaZulu coach Ayanda Dlamini says the morale is high in the team ahead of two crucial fixtures. Usuthu edged Black Leopards 1-0 during the weekend to move three points clear from bottom-placed Polokwane City. Bongi Ntuli who has been carrying the club on his back since the beginning of the season is expected to continue playing a sterling role in the remaining fixtures to ensure the club remain in the top flight. The hard-working centre forward netted his 13th league goal of the season in the win over Leopards and he is the club's top scorer this season. Ntuli will be hungry for another goal and he could be key to Usuthu's win. "We have taken a step in the right direction with the win against Black Leopards.Â "It is certainly a confidence booster for the boys heading into the last two games," Dlamini quoted by the club's official website. "The performances we have been putting out has been very encouraging, it goes to show our intent and the positive fighting mentality of the players." Dlamini also commented on the successful combination of Lehlohonolo Majoro and Ntuli upfront, praising them for their performances. "They play extremely well together, the partnership they are starting to build has proved beneficial for us," he added. "Both players are keen on helping each other, and the team, going forward. It is evident to see that they understand one another and that will prove the difference for us in the final third." AmaZulu's next encounter they take on Stellenbosch FC on Friday at Tuks Stadium (6pm).
