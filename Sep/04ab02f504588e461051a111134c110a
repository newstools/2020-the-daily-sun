[Gaston] Sirino has an injury, we don’t know if he will make it. We rested Hlompho (Kekana) because of all the minutes he played in the bubble. “Denis (Onyango) is training well, so hopefully he is OK. Mosa (Lebusa) has not started training. Ricardo (Nascimento) has a wrist injury that is giving him a problem. “AJ (Andile Jali) was training yesterday and today, but you know game and training intensity is not the same thing. But he is getting better. “Ricardo has a wrist that's also giving him problems, that's why he's been playing with a wrist band. But I don't know, we should be okay by Saturday.”
