CROSSROADS residents in Cape Town are shocked after five people were shot while sitting in front of their friend’s home. One died at the scene and three in hospital, while one is still fighting for his life. Nonceba Dyantyi said her brother Lungile Xelelo was killed on Sunday evening after he’d come back from church and then decided to chat with friends in front of their home at about sunset. A white VW stopped in front of their house. “Three men came out of the car with big guns and fired at my brother and his friends My brother was never a person who liked fights. He loved singing and was committed to the church.” She said the family was devastated, since they buried their father in February. Family member Ludwe Ndilili said they were still in shock. He said their street was cursed, especially during this month. “In 2018, on 24 September, a similar incident happened where three people were shot on the street. Two died and another one is walking on crutches.” Ludwe said cops weren’t doing enough to deal with killings in their area. “Even with that incident, cops just came after it happened and never followed up. Thugs do as they wish because they know cops do nothing.” Brigadier Novela Potelwa said detectives from Nyanga were on the hunt for the killers. “Reports show five men all in their early 30s were sitting in front of a house in Noxolo Street when a white VW pulled up and three occupants fired shots and fled. One person died and three victims succumbed to injuries in hospital later. A fifth person was admitted to hospital where he is receiving treatment.” Potelwa urged anyone with information to call Detective Sergeant Mlonyeni on 083 719 3621, Detective Captain Pakaman on 082 469 247, Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or the MySAPSApp.
