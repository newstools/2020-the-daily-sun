PEDI Afro pop and jazz singer Kholofelo Kolobe, better known as Greeco, is honouring her late mum on a song Mosadi wa Mopedi. The 35-year-old from Makushwaneng Village in Zebediela, Limpopo, said the song was a hit on Thobela FM and a number of community radio stations. “It’ s not surprising that it was nominated for the Sepedi Music Awards in the best Afro pop category in 2018, and best Sepedi music video category last year,” said Greeco. She said even though she did not win, she’s proud of the wisdom that her mother Miriam Mathete imparted on her. “She taught me respect, humility and how to project my voice. I found my voice through her and I am using it in Pedi music,” she said. Greeco said Mosadi wa Mopedi is from her debut album, Motho ke Motho ka Batho, which was released in 2017. “This album is teaching us ubuntu and it also emphasises that we are all important on this planet.” She released a new single, Serurubele, last month and it was officially launched on YouTube yesterday. “It’s a praise song to my sister-in-law. I compare her beauty to a butterfly,” said Greeco. She said she grew up in a musical family. “My mother was a gospel singer and leader of Thabang Moreneng gospel choir. I was also a member of that choir. “I was the alto and lead on some of the songs,” said Greeco. She said she used to sing hymns with her mum, but she did not follow in her mum’s gospel footsteps because her compositions are inspired by jazz guitarist Selaelo Selota and percussionist Sello Galane and other Afro jazz artists or Pedi traditional singers. Apart from music, Greeco is a Pedi bead artist. “I’m planning to have bead exhibitions soon in order to showcase our tradition to the masses. “Beads are part of our beauty, culture and heritage. “They were worn in the olden days and are still relevant even today. “I also wear them when I perform,” she said.
