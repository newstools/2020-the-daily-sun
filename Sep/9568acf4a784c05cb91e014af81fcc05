JOHN Pitsi believes there are future soccer stars at Letswatla Village in Ga-Maleboho, Limpopo. The 57-year-old founder of Letswatla Football Academy said his wish was for soccer agents and scouts to look for players in the area. He said their aim was not only to play soccer, but to keep young people off the streets. “We are so far heading in the right direction and hope to produce professional players,” said John. “Our area has a lot of talented young players who can represent us well in big teams if they get the opportunity.” John said Ditshipi FC is under his academy and they often take part in local tournaments. Last week, Ditshipi beat Wegedraai FC 4-1. John Mokgawa from Letswatla Development Forum said they were looking for information to help teams from various academies in their area to get involved in leagues such as Vodacom. “For now we are hosting tournaments every weekend. “In December we will host a big tournament with prize money of R50 000, which was donated by our local pastor,” he said.
