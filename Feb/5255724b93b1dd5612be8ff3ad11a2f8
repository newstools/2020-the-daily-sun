A group of men who allegedly posed as Fidelity
cash-in-transit guards escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash and valuables
from food retailer Pick n Pay in Alberton, Gauteng on Sunday. A Fidelity Cash Solutions employee, who did not want to be
named, told News24 the company could not comment on the incident as the footage
did not clearly identify the suspects as wearing Fidelity uniforms. "They are not Fidelity guards. There is no indication
that they are from a specific company and therefore we cannot comment,"
she said. "It can be anybody. We tried to enlarge the footage
yesterday and we still couldn't see whose uniform that is and don't know who it
belongs to." Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told News24
police were searching for the suspects and have opened a case of theft under
false pretences. "It is alleged that two suspects entered the shop
dressed in Fidelity guard uniforms, pretending to be cash collectors,"
Masondo said. "The suspects took an undisclosed amount of cash and
used a VW Combi as a getaway car." He appealed to anyone with information to help in the
investigation by contacting their nearest police station or Crime Stop on 08600
