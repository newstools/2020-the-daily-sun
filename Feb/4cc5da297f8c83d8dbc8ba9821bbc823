THE schoolgirl (18) accused of bullying a fellow pupil spent the weekend in prison. The pupil from Modiri Secondary School in Ga-Rankuwa was bust on Thursday after two videos of her assaulting the fellow pupil trended on social media. She made a brief appearance in court on Friday. Her case was postponed to Wednesday for a formal bail application. She’s facing charges of assault. In one video, the uniformed girl is seen assaulting a pupil in front of others and in the other is seen pouring what looks like milk over the pupil’s head and then hits her with a container before walking away. The videos sparked outrage, and people demanded intervention by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi.  Lesufi visited the school on Thursday and announced the girl had been suspended and the victim would receive counselling. Before her arrest, the girl released a number of videos, including one where she said she accepted the MEC’s decision. “I’d like to apologise for what happened. Please forgive me for what I did in tainting the name of my school and fellow students,” she said in Tswana. She asked to be allowed to write exams. On social media, some people felt she deserved to be arrested while some felt she needed help. On Facebook, Maureen Kalane wrote: “What did you learn at home? One needs to do research on how this evil child was raised.” Charmaine Thipe wrote: “Taking her to prison won’t help. Clearly her behaviour is a cry for help.”
