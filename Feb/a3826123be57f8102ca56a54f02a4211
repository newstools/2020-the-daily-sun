POLICE say it’s too early to decide the motive for the killing of up-and-coming rapper Pop Smoke, who was shot dead in the early hours of Wednesday morning in Hollywood Hills. While reports said the fatal incident was a home robbery, Los Angeles police were still investigating. Captain Jonathan Tippet said: “There’s a lot of information available. We have some work to do.” Tippet said detectives were looking for evidence in the neighbourhood as well as scanning the internet for clues. “There’s a lot of social media information out there. The house is in a neighbourhood surrounded by video cameras.” Unauthorised sources said the rapper could have posted to social media an image showing the address of the home where he was living. But detectives aren’t ruling out other elements. As Pop Smoke was seen by police to be linked to the Crips street gang, cops suspected the killing was gang-related and that the attackers were gang members. But it has not been decided whether the killing was motivated by gang rivalry, officials said. Captain Steve Lurie said cops responded after someone calling from the East Coast reported several people, one of whom wore a black mask and was armed with a handgun, entered their friend’s home in Los Angeles before 5am. When cops arrived at the mansion, they found the 20-year-old rapper, whose real name was Bashar Barakah Jackson, with gunshot wounds. He was taken to a hospital, where he later died. Photos and videos on Pop Smoke’s Instagram story showed him in LA on Tuesday and posing by the pool at the home where he was later killed. In the evening, he posted a photo of the skyline from what looked like the home’s backyard. – LA TIMES
