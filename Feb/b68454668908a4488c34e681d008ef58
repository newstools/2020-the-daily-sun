AmaZulu have confirmed the appointment of Ayanda Dlamini as the assistant to head coach Jozef Vukusic. He takes over from Mabhuti Khenyeza who vacated the post for a head coaching role at TS Galaxy. Through their official Twitter handle, AmaZulu General Manager, Lunga Sokhela confirmed the elevation of the former striker into the first team with immediate effect. Meanwhile, AmaZulu are yet to come clear on how they will handle the Khenyeza issue after Sokhela said "situation will be handled internally" which raised eyebrows that their parting of ways with Khenyeza was not mutual.
