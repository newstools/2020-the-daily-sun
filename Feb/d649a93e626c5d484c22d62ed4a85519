Mamelodi Sundowns
defender Thapelo Morena could be out for the entire season after dislocating his ankle this weekend. Morena sustained the horrific injury while tackling SuperSport United's Onismor Bhasera in their Nedbank Cup last 32 clash at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday. Videos that have been making rounds on social media show the 26-year-old's leg get caght on the ground before his ankle pops out of place dislocated. Messages of comfort have been sent to
Morena and his club on social media.  A SunSport
source said MorenaÂ would most likely only be ready to return after three months or so. "The
leg has been located in its right place, but doctors will have to look more
into it that it is stable. Such processes takes long but he will be sorted in
no time." Coach Pitso
Mosimane was also down while talking about the injury, saying that he wanted
Morena for the entire Absa Premiership season and the Caf Champions
League. The injury brought back memories of some of the worst injuries in PSL history. Jimmy Jambo and Dillon Sheppard suffered arguably two of the most horrific injuries seen in Mzansi.
