Following a
ruling by the Eastern Cape High Court in Makhanda on December 12, that schools
should admit undocumented children, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) has
now issued a circular instructing schools to comply with the ruling, GroundUp
reported. On Tuesday,
Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga sent a circular to provincial
education departments, heads of provincial government sections, district
directors, school governing bodies, school principals, all South African
schools and governing body associations to follow the precedent set by the
court. Judge
President Selby Mbenenge had ruled in Makhanda in December that the education
department could not remove or exclude "children, including illegal
foreign children, already admitted, purely by reason of the fact that the
children have no identity document number, permit or passport, or have not
produced any identification documents". However, at
the start of this school year, GroundUp found schools that were still turning
away undocumented immigrant children despite the ruling, and a previous
circular sent in July last year by the acting director-general of the
Department of Basic Education, SG Padayachee, instructing public schools to
accept undocumented children conditionally, while their parents try to obtain
documents. African
Diaspora Forum spokesperson Amur Sheikh said: "We hope to see the full
implementation of the circular. We will also be visiting schools that have been
known for making admission difficult for migrant children." SOURCE:
