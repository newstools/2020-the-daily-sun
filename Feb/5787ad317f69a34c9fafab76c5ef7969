THE notorious R81 road passing through Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, is known for horrific car accidents. Villagers and motorists are now happy the road is being upgraded. A contractor was appointed in June 2017 and work started in August last year. Construction of the 10km road will take a year and a half to be completed at a budget of R141 million. The SunTeam spent a few hours on the road speaking to motorists and villagers. Motorist Thapelo Malatjie (31) said he was overjoyed when he saw the contractor starting work. “We’re tired of seeing horrific accidents on this road. I believe that once the construction is complete, traffic will flow smoothly and we’ll see fewer accidents. We’ll drive smoothly without worries, and this is a good thing.” Some motorists were not happy with the construction. They’re worried about the stop-and-go’s. “We’re thankful for the road upgrade, but these stop-and-go’s make us late for work,” said Thabo Selowa (38). “It takes them more than five hours to blast while the road is closed. We wait there for ages and other motorists are too impatient. They end up passing by force and causing unnecessary accidents.” Villagers said they were happy the construction created job opportunities for them.
