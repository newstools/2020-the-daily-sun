MOLEFE Mokhari’s been married for 18 years. But the 50-year-old from Temba in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, didn’t know this! He made the discovery after his pastor submitted forms at Home Affairs after he married his wife Constance Morare (42) in a traditional wedding in 2018. But Home Affairs said he married a woman named Sharifa Nanakuwune in 2002. “The marriage certificate says we got married in a civil marriage in 2002. “What is surprising is that my so-called wife doesn’t have an ID number on the certificate and is a foreigner, meaning she used my ID and the marriage certificate to get citizenship.” He said he didn’t know who Sharifa was and wanted her to be bust for fraud. “I now can’t list my wife as a policy beneficiary,” he said. “I was so hurt when I heard I was married already.” Constance said: “It feels as if I’m nonexistent as they want this mysterious woman everywhere we go. “It hurts me so much because she might be waiting for something to happen to Molefe so she can come and cause trouble.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said Molefe should get an affidavit stating he was never married to the other woman. “We’ll then investigate the matter, including verification of fingerprints. “If the investigation is in his favour, the marriage will be annulled and his status will be updated accordingly on the system.”
