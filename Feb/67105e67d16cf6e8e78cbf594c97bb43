PHUTI Mabotja is shocked after the men in blue allegedly manhandled him when he was about to perform at a concert in Polokwane, Limpopo, last Friday. Since the incident, the 23-year-old sound engineer, pianist, drummer and producer said, he was now scared to accept gigs. “I was about to go on stage to do a sound check when rude cops approached me and started accusing me of being a thief. “My home in Seshego was searched but nothing was found as I hadn’t stolen anything from anyone. “I was taken to Delmas Police Station in Mpumalanga and the assaults and beating continued,” said Phuti. He said the cops used shoelaces to tie his hands, which left him with bruises. “What hurts me the most is that I was kept at the cop shop for four days before I could be charged. I had to fight to make a call to my lawyer and mum,” he said. Phuti claims his former boss, who leads a church in Delmas, got him arrested. “We had a dispute over a payment and I guess he was bitter,” he said. He said the items the pastor accused him of stealing were give to him when their working relationship was still good. “He once gave me a laptop, mixer and printer, saying I could use them to make extra money,” he said. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed a case of assault against the police was opened in Delmas. Hlathi said as the alleged assault implicated the police, the case would handed over to Ipid for investigation.
