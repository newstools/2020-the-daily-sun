Embattled former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has hit out at the DA for its criticism of her State of the Nation Address (SONA) attendance last week. In an emotive statement issued on Monday, Gumede lashed out at DA caucus leader in the metro, Nicole Graham, who has been a vocal critic of the former mayor. Graham criticised Gumede's presence at the SONA, saying she flew into Cape Town, "comfortably seated in business class". "Who paid for this? Her place card at SONA indicated that she was representing Salga, the South African Local Government Association, which is a public entity that accounts to Parliament." Graham's comments came after Gumede was released on R50 000 bail in a Durban Solid Waste tender fraud and corruption case, involving R389m. "She attended the Salga national executive committee meeting on Wednesday in Durban, indicating that she remains very much involved in its business." But, Gumede responded that she expected Graham "to know that I am still the deputy president of Salga and have always been a part of the SONA delegation". "It is not surprising that she is ignorant about local government and yet she leads a mob of councillors with such spurious utterances." Responding, Graham told News24: "It is quite a ridiculous thing to say. We operate on a party system where we evaluate people based on their strengths and weaknesses in that particular time." Graham confirmed Steenhuisen was her choice of DA leader candidate and said party members were free to choose who they believed were fit for the position. "It [Gumede's statement] is a desperate attempt to detract from what she's doing," Graham said.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/corruption-accused-zandile-gumede-and-da-in-war-of-words-over-her-sona-attendance-20200217
