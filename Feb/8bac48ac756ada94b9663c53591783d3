LOCUST swarms wreaking havoc in East Africa have arrived in the country, the government said on Tuesday. Billions of desert locusts, some in swarms the size of large cities, have already chomped their way through Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Tanzania, Sudan and Uganda. One of the wettest rainy seasons in the region in 40 years has boosted their breeding. Experts warned the main March-to-May cropping season is at risk. Eggs laid along their path are due to hatch and create a second wave in key areas. The locusts could be a disaster in South Sudan, where war, drought and floods already left six million people facing hunger. Agriculture Minister Onyoti Adigo Nyikiwec said the locusts have crossed the eastern border with Uganda on Monday. Food and Agriculture Organisation representative Meshack Malo said about 2 000 locusts were spotted, and if not controlled quickly, could have a devastating impact. Nyikiwec said the government had prepared a contingency plan. This month, Somalia declared the invasion a national emergency. â€“ NEWS24
