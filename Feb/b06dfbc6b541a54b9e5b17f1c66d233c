KARABO Motaung can give birth at anytime but lives in fear as her boyfriend (24) is allegedly threatening to kill her and her family. The 19-year-old from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said her nightmare started when she told the man she didn’t want him anymore. She said he cheated on her and would often pass her place walking hand in hand with another woman. “He hurt me a lot and I don’t know why he shows off his girlfriends. He can do it where I can’t see him. He’s disrespectful towards my family.” She said she told him to leave her alone, but he refused. “He tells me I’m carrying his child and I’m not going anywhere. He said he’s going to kill me should I dare. “I live in fear and I’m always indoors.” She showed Daily Sun some of the SMSes she received from her boyfriend. She said she opened a case at Etwatwa cop shop, but police told her to apply for a protection order. “They said they’d arrest him if he violated it.” She applied for a protection order at the Daveyton Magistrates Court. Karabo’s gogo Dineo said they took the threats seriously. “Women are being killed these days. That boy doesn’t respect us.” The boyfriend denied threatening Karabo. “We have differences, but I never threatened to harm her,” he told the People’s Paper.
