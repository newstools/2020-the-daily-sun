For years, there have been social media hashtags, such as the #MeToo movement about how women were sexually assaulted by men, who promised them fame. But because they feared victimisation, some of them never came out to tell their stories. With the conviction of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who on Monday was found guilty of sexual criminal act and rape in third degree, this issue is in the spotlight yet again. Veteran actress Rami Chuene has warned those who have committed similar acts in Mzansi will soon be caught. "S.African Harvey’s been ‘opening the industry’ for desperate artists in return for sexual favors for years. Fear of victimization and blacklisting silenced a lot of talent. Soon they’ll break their silence & come for you, powerful big shots. Even your money will not save you," she Tweeted.
