SHE felt her baby’s head coming out and limped towards the nursing station to ask for help. But a nurse who was chatting on the phone allegedly told her to stop being a nuisance and return to her bed in the maternity ward at Heidelberg Hospital. Karabo Phillemon had to deliver her own baby. “The baby’s right leg got stuck in me and I had to pull it out myself. Nurses weren’t helping. “I felt her soft bones breaking as I was pulling the leg out.” The 24-year-old Karabo from Ratanda in Heidelberg, Gauteng, fears the baby’s right leg might not work properly again. The mum wants the hospital to pay. She gave birth on 15 December. Karabo said while giving birth, a woman next to her who had already given birth, told her what to do. “I pushed and it was painful as my skin was tearing.  She said the nurse only came when she heard the baby crying. “She only said ‘askies’ and took my baby away,” said Karabo.  Daily Sun spoke to health spokesman Vuyani Sabani, who said they were aware of Karabo’s case. “The hospital has been in contact with the family with a view to addressing their concerns. “As such, we had a meeting with the patient’s family.” Sabani said the baby would undergo further tests and treatment to ensure the leg was okay.
