WHEN her daughter Aniki’s friends phoned her after Aniki had been stabbed,  her mum Susan rushed out to look for her. But what Susan Maluleke (47) found at the scene of the stabbing left her traumatised. Aniki and a man known to her were celebrating Anik’is birthday at a tavern on 3 June. Susan said she bumped into her daughter’s alleged killer on the way to the tavern in Hebron, North West. The man’s shirt was allegedly soaked in blood!  “I was on the lookout for him when he disappeared for five months before he was arrested,” she said “I heard he’s applied for bail. What if he comes after me and my grandchild? “I think about the pain my daughter must have gone through when she was being stabbed.” Susan claimed Aniki’s boyfriend is dangerous and always armed with knives. “Whenever my daughter got a phone call, he’d accuse her of cheating and a fight would break out,” she claimed.

She said the 25-year-old man was bust in November. Funani said the suspect will appear again on 29 April for a bail application at the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court.
