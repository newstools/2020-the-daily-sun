A 40-year-old Mpumalanga woman is out on R500 bail after she was arrested for allegedly assaulting her grandson with an axe. According to the statement released by the police, this was not the first time the woman had assaulted the six-year-old. It is reported that last week Friday a resident found the boy roaming the street after school still in uniform. The resident then took the victim to the school where the boy told the story of being constantly abused and assaulted by his own grandmother to the teacher who was still at school. The boy is reported to have been shaking, crying and complained of pains all over his body due to the bruises. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the police were called and the victim was taken to Mayflower Clinic where he was transferred to Embhuleni Hospital due to the seriousness of his injuries. He said after a case of assault with an intent to cause GBH was opened, the matter was then handed to Elukwatini Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) who arrested the gogo. Hlathi said the boy is currently out of the hospital and has been taken to a temporary place of safety where he will be under the supervision of social workers. The woman will appear again at the Mayflower Periodical Court on 30 March.
