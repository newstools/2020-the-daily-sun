LEBOHANG Mahlangu has been trying to get her sister-in-law Emily Shikwambane out of her house for 10 years. Lebohang from Soshanguve, Block DD, Tshwane, didn’t have a title deed, but that changed when her story was published in Daily Sun on 20 January. She told the People’s Paper Emily was refusing to leave after they made a family agreement in 2005 that she would occupy their RDP temporarily. “I went to the municipality to have her evicted but they needed a title deed. I went to the human settlements department in our area but they refused to give me the title deed,” said Lebohang. She said when her story was published, there was light at the end of the tunnel. “After Daily Sun published my story, I showed the department the article and they gave me my title deed,” she said. “The paper can solve any problem. “I’m within my rights to have Emily evicted so that my kids can have a place of their own.”
