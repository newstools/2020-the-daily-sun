He said at the centre of these problems was a deep frustration of how political parties chose candidates on their own and threw them in voters’ faces as councillors, mayors, premiers, MPs and presidents. “This system serves political parties and career politicians and not the people who vote for them. “While there is no question that our electoral system must change, this would take considerable time.” Mashaba said their movement would begin this process by giving voters the final say over who they wanted as their candidates. “When we launch, voters will have the opportunity to register with us.

If a representative fails the assessment, we will replace them with another candidate selected by voters of that community.”
