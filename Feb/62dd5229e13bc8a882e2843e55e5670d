 DA federal
council chairperson Helen Zille has announced she will be closing her existing
Twitter account in exchange for a new private one, as Twitter had been reduced
to "a platform for irrationality and mob-lynching". On Monday,
she tweeted that she was opening a private Twitter account for "people
interested in rational debate only". Her
announcement followed a tweet on Saturday, in which she shared photos of her
and granddaughter Nceba cooking during load shedding. Some
Twitter users asked if the little girl was her slave or being trained to be a
domestic worker. On Monday,
she said goodbye and "good riddance to the haters, bots and sock-puppets
that constitute such a large percentage of my 1.4-million plus followers". Explaining
her decision, she said: "Twitter has degenerated into a platform for
irrationality and mob-lynching. Everything that can be distorted and twisted
for a hate-filled agenda, is used for the purpose of manufacturing outrage and
inflicting maximum damage." "For a
long time I have sought to promote Twitter as a platform for rational and civil
debate, but it clearly is not possible. It has degenerated into a space of
distortion, de-contextualisation, demonization, delegitimation and double
standards." SOURCE:
