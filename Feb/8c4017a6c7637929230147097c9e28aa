Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng has been in the Free State for two weeks helping to bury drowning victims. Last week the Incredible Happenings Church pastor helped bury Musa Mbele (8). This week he buried Pastor Makgola Motaung (35) and Thato Mokgatla (16). They died Wednesday on 22 January after Thato went for a swim with friends. Thato apparently struggled in the water and the other boys screamed for help. Pastor Motaung, who was passing by, tried to help. However, he too didn’t make it out of the water alive. The two were buried on Saturday at two separate cemeteries. One service was held at Tharollo Combined School. Maluti-a-Phofung Mayor Masechaba Lakaje was present. Mboro had earlier gone with Thato’s loved ones to the Motaungs to pay tribute as they felt bad the pastor had died trying to save their son. The Motaung family understood that it was an accident and used the opportunity to tell the prophet of their difficulties to bury him. Mboro and the mayor vowed to assist both families and agreed to build them houses. Mboro would build a house for the Mokgatla family, while the mayor would build one for the Motaungs. Thato’s mum Sibongile (46) said she had hoped her son would grow up to be a big man one day. “I’m grateful for what the prophet and the mayor have promised to do.” The pastor’s wife Fikile Motaung (36) said: “We were happy when the prophet and the mayor came to our rescue. “I’m sure this will make my husband happy in heaven. It was his wish to build a home for us.” Lakaje thanked Mboro for his continued support to the people of QwaQwa.
