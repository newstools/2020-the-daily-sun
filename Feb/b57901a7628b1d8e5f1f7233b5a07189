ALWAYS check your blind spot. This expensive crash could have been avoided had the driver of the Audi R8 Spyder checked his blind spot. In a video that has gone viral on social media, the R8 can be seen braking and then indicating to the right side. Soon after that, the R8 moves into the right lane but there is already a car in that lane. The R8 then crashed into the grey car on the right and then smashed into the car in the front. A white Lamborghini Murci√©lago and a red Porsche seem to be caught up in the mix, but they survive without crashing.    ?? always check your blind spots!
