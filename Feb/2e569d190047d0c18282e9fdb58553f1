NKELE Phiri (43) told Daily Sun she believed her son was safe at school – until she got a message he was in hospital. Nkele from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said she went to the hospital on Wednesday and found her son Amogelang (6) had been struck on the head by a soccer post, which had fallen on him. “When I got to the hospital I found my son unconscious with tubes and drips inserted in his body,” she said. “They later told me he was dead. The doctors said he had bad head injuries.” She said she didn’t know how this could have happened. “He was a small boy and he couldn’t have made the post fall,” she said. “Amogelang’s friends said he was just passing when the post fell on him.” Nkele said she thought her son would change their lives one day. “He was so focused. “He had a bright future,” she said. “He said he wanted to be a teacher. “Even his class teacher once told us he loved teaching his classmates. “On the Wednesday before he died, he was standing in front of the class teaching them.” Amogelang’s sister, Boitumelo (25), said they needed donations to bury her little brother. “We don’t have money for the funeral. We need everything so my brother can be laid to rest.” The Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi: said: “We wish to convey our sincere condolences to the bereaved family during this time of grief.”
