 FOR years they have been fierce enemies. But it seems relations between Mamelodi Sundowns and Wydad Casablanca are improving by every game the two sides play. At least that is what can be deduced from the warm reception Sundowns recently received from the once hostile Wydad fans, and lately the message of support the Moroccans club have sent to Thapelo Morena, following the horrific injury he sustained. The Sundowns utility player sustained a fracture and damaged ligaments on his ankle in their Nedbank Cup win over SuperSport United at Loftus on Saturday. According to the club, Morena is due to undergo operation and is out for the rest of the season.But among the messages of support that have been flooding in for Morena has come from far away in North Africa. “In the name of the players and the components of Wydad, we wish a speedy recovery to Sundowns player Morena and that he gets back to the field as soon as possible to help his team,” said Wydad captain Brahim Nakach.  Salaheddine Saidi echoed Nakach, adding “We hope to see Morena back on the field soon." Morena will miss the two-legged quarterfinal tie with Al Ahly and possibly another match-up with Wydad in the semifinals.
