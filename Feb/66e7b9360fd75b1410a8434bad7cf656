I just know him from the area. “I’ve always found him dodgy because he always wanted to know if my family is rich.” The woman said she suspected the guy was involved in getting her raped – the suspects asked the same questions he did. “I had gone out to withdraw money at the ATM when four men in a BMW attacked me and my friend. “One of the men pointed a knife at me. The other pointed a gun at my friend before dragging me into the car.” She said her face was covered with a black bag before they drove off to a bush. “When we got there I was taken to the back seat, undressed and raped.
