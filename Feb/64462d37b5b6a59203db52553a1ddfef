WHEN a fan asked to take a photo with him and her kids at a mall, he didn’t have a problem and agreed. But the ex-Uzalo actor, Sibonile Ngubane, who played Khathaza on the soapie, later learnt the fan posted the picture on social media with the caption: “Family.” This angered him so much he took to Instagram to vent.  In the post, which he has since been deleted, Sibonile said: “You see? You guys ask us to take selfies with you and your kids when you see us in the malls. When you later post the selfies, you claim we’re fathers to your kids. You guys are irritating. I’m not doing selfies anymore.” This post was shared in the famous Ladies House group on Facebook. Some ladies were in support of Sibonile’s post, while others supported the woman who posted the photo. When Daily Sun contacted Sibonile, he said the woman apologised for her actions. “We ironed things out. The matter is now water under the bridge. It’s done. I don’t want to continue talking about it anymore. I’m tired.”
