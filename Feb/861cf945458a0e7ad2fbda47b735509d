THE ANC in KZN has critisised Jacob Zuma’s lawyer after Judge Dhaya Pillay issued a warrant of arrest for the former president. Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli blasted Zuma’s lawyer Daniel Mantsha and the Pietermaritzburg High Court judge for not seeking clarity with qualified doctors. Ntuli said both were wrong in acting as experts in health matters. Said Ntuli: “What happened on Tuesday was unfortunate and created an impression Zuma is being persecuted. “The lawyer and judge are not experts in health matters.” People on social networks criticised the judge, while others defend Pillay’s decision. Pillay on Tuesday refused to accept the sick note and issued a warrant of arrest. She questioned the alteration in the date, which wasn’t initialed, and said the sick note had no clear doctor’s practice number. Ntuli also lashed out at 1 Military Hospital, which according to Zuma’s lawyer provided the much-contested document. He said the party didn’t doubt Zuma wasn’t well as he’d missed its 108th rally celebrations in Kimberley and the provincial leg of the celebrations in Port Shepstone two weeks ago.
