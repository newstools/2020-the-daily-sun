FUEL burning inside your engine creates combustion chamber temperatures that can reach more than 500ºC. For an engine to perform properly, the operating temperature should be controlled and that’s the job of a car’s cooling system. Failure to maintain the cooling system often results in overheating and eventually, a breakdown. Cooling system warning signs: ) Coolant light comes on The engine temperature warning light on the dashboard is activated. It tells the driver that the engine might start to overheat. When your cooling system is operating properly, the needle of the temperature gauge will be in the “normal” range (often halfway between high and low). If the needle begins to creep upward or downward, it’s an indication of a fault in the car’s cooling system. Coolant loss can be either external or internal. Seeing a green, pink, or orange puddle in your driveway or garage indicates leaking anti-freeze. Your car’s engine runs most efficiently within a very tight temperature band. Proper operating temperate allows fuel to burn more efficiently. If the engine temperature drops below range, fuel doesn’t vaporise properly, negatively affecting your fuel economy.
