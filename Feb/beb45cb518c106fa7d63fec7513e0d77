Wayne Sandilands was full of praise for everyone at Orlando Pirates after he received the man of the match award following their 1-0 win over Black Leopards. The goalkeeper pulled off numerous impressive saves at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday to help the Buccaneers clinch a narrow win, thanks to an own goal from Thabiso Mokoena in stoppage time. The victory moved Pirates back up to second position on the Absa Premiership standings, where they trail Kaizer Chiefs by six points after securing a sixth consecutive league win. "I don't know where to begin, it's just amazing what this team is doing, it's just amazing to be a part of this team. I mean it's not just me to deserve this [award], it's the whole team," Sandilands told SuperSport TV. "The effort from the top to the bottom, the coaches, the players, everybody. Orlando Pirates, this is the place to be, we just got to continue, remain humble. We know that this is such a hard place to come. "Like I said, it's just amazing what's happening in the team right now, we can come here and get the three points. "Credit should go to our goalkeeper coach, we push each other in training like I said, it's a team effort. I'm just grateful for the three points today, hopefully, we can continue to push on. Very grateful (for the clean sheet)." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
