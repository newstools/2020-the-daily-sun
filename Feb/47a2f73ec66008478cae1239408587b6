A man is expected to appear in court for the murder of his cousins. The 28-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday after ten months of investigations. This comes after Thabo, Sboniso Maphumulo and Siyabonga Shabalala, all 28 of age, were burnt beyond recognition when their house was doused with petrol and set alight, on the 5th of April last year. The man was arrested at his place of work in Isipingo in KwaZulu-Natal and charged with three counts of murder. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said: “Initially an inquest was opened at KwaNdengezi police station. Following a rigorous probe, the investigating officer was able to connect the dots with regards to the suspect involved and the docket was changed to murder. “On Monday night the suspect was traced and arrested. The investigation revealed that the deceased and suspect are related,” said Naicker. The motive for the killing is unclear at this stage and the suspect is expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on Thursday. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said: “These arrests send a clear message to the perpetrators of crime that the long arm of the law will always catch up with you. We hope this arrest will bring closure to the family,” he said.
