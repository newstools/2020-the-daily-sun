AJAX Cape Town are not prepared to spend another season in the GladAfrica Championship… it appears. This has been evident in the way they have gone about business in the second division so far this season. They beat Real Kings 2-1 at Cape Town Stadium yesterday to continue their charge towards promotion. Abednego Mosiatlhaga and Cohen Stander’s goals were enough to hand the Mother City outfit the all-important three points. Kings’s goal was scored by former Ajax striker Sedwyn George. He opened the scoring in the 20th minute, however, Championship top scorer Mosiatlhaga bagged the equaliser for Ajax before half time. It was the former Stellenbosch winger’s 16th goal of the season. Stander then popped up with what would prove to be the winner in the 61st minute. The left back started and finished a flowing move to ensure Ajax bagged maximum points. The victory saw them extend their lead at the top of the table to five points heading into the final nine league fixtures of the season. The Urban Warriors have hardly been dominant, however, they are showing enough to suggest a return to the land of milk and honey could be immanent. Uthongathi and Swallows FC, who are equal on 37 points in second and third place respectively, are also determined to push Ajax until the end.
