Over the weekend a mere R600 divided black Twitter when a lady tweeted that she doesn't expect to transport herself to a date. DJ and music producer Kabelo Motsamai, popularly known as Prince Kaybee, reflected on a time when he was broke and stayed with his ex-girlfriend. Responding to a tweep who said people should stop acting cool and be supportive towards their broke partners, the talented music producer went down memory lane and shared a story of how his ex-girlfriend endured all sufferings with him. “Funny because I had the same girlfriend, she used to do the same for me. Even worse I was staying at her place, but soon as I got my sh*t together, she was NICELY rewarded,” he wrote. Furthermore, the Gugulethu hitmaker said even though they are no longer together they are civil towards one another and he wouldn’t hesitate to help her if she ever reached out for help. “Even today though we not together I don’t see myself not helping her if she reaches out,” he wrote.
