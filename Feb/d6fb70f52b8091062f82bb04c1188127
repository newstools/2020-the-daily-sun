THE destiny is in Maritzburg United’s hands to go fourth on the Absa Premiership table on Friday (8pm). A win for the Team of Choice against Stellenbosch FC at Harry Gwala Stadium will be enough. The KZN side have 33 points on the log, and it looks likely that they’ll overcome the Cape-based side as they boast an impressive statistic in their backyard. Maritzburg, who were grappling for every ounce of points this time last season, have made the use of playing on Friday at home to their advantage. They are unbeaten in 21 games now. The last team to beat Maritzburg was Free State Stars in September 2017, when the late Sinethemba Jantjie scored. Despite being dumped out by Bloemfontein Celtic in the second round of the Nedbank Cup this past weekend, Maritzburg are still the team to beat. They raided Gauteng by defeating fifth placed Bidvest Wits1-0 and then leaders Kaizer Chiefs, to complete what was a good week a fourth night ago. Maritzburg coach Eric Tinkler said beating those teams has taken a lot of pressure off his lads in what has been, so far, an improved season for the club. “We obviously reached that 30-point mark, which was our objective to get there as quickly as possible,” said Tinkler. “The fact that we won against two massive teams – Wits and Chiefs – we have done better compared to last season. But the hunger, the desire, the passion, determination, everything that they have shown in the last 22 games, needs to continue against Stellebosch.”
