PATRICK Tignyemb has hit his lowest! The 34-year-old shot stopper is begging for his job back at Bloemfontein Celtic, a club that he has served with distinction for 11 years, as a regular ans captain in the team. The veteran goalkeeper is twiddling his thumbs at home without a job beseeching Celtic’s coaching duo Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka to offer him a job. The Cameroonian was released by Chippa United before the festive break, as he made a series of blunders in the first half of season that were costly for the club. He played 12 matches in all competitions – conceding 13 goals and kept four clean sheets. Tignyemb was eventually dropped from the team when new coach Norman Mapeza replaced Duran Francis at the helm in October last year, aiming to move the team away from the relegation zone. Mapeza gave Veli Mothwa a chance between the goal posts in a bid to remedy the situation and the 29-year-old grabbed the opportunity with both hands, playing 12 matches in all competitions, conceding nine goals with seven clean sheets. According to a source, Celtic management refused to give Tignyemb a second chance as he was accused of bringing the club into disrepute prior to his sacking in May last year. He confronted management about unpaid salaries and bonuses that were not paid to players and threatened to take the matter to the South African Football Players Union (Safpu). Tignyemb joined Chippa in July last year having spent 10 years with Siwelele. Explained the source: “Tignyemb is frustrated at home since he was released by Chippa management. That’s why he called coach Seema and Maduka hoping they will sympathise with him. “But he forgot that he burnt his own bridges by insulting and disrespecting management. That’s why they refused to take him back. They could have made a plan to give him a role within the club’s development structures.” Tignyemb was not available for comment at the time of going to print as his mobile phone rang unanswered.
