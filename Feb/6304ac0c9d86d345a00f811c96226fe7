CHINESE university lecturers visited Neville Mathopa’s home in Motlatla, Thaba Nchu, after he got 33 distinctions in his engineering studies and was seen as the best student in China. But the 24-year-old died in a crash in Bloemfontein on Sunday. His family thought he was drugged and thrown out of a moving taxi. In December 2018, Chinese lecturers visited his home after he did better than other students. He graduated in civil engineering in July last year.  Mum Veronica Mathopa (64) said her son was attending a seminar before he died. “We were told he fell from a moving taxi. I hope God will reveal the truth. I was looking forward to seeing my son succeeding. Chinese lecturers said our son was the smartest of all the students. They said they’d welcome him back if he wanted to do a master’s degree.” Veronica said when they went to see him in hospital, doctors said his brain was swelling from his head injuries. “We asked the hospital to wait for relatives to say goodbye before the machine would be switched off.” Neville posted photos of the lecturers visiting on 26 January on social media, writing: “Only God knew I’d go to China for five years to study Mandarin and civil engineering. Only God knew I’d be number one out of all students from all over world.” Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela’s spokesman Setjhaba Maphalla said she expressed sadness after the death of the Free State Provincial Government bursary recipient who graduated with distinction in China. “Ntombela assures the community government is in communication with the family to find the cause of this terrible loss.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “An inquest docket was registered after a witness said on Sunday she was with the dead man, who got into an argument with a taxi driver. “He was at the back of a taxi and allegedly fell out. He died in Pelonomi Hospital.”
