TEACHING young children to save at a young age gives them a vital sense of disciplined financial habits which they could adapt when they hit adulthood. The knowledge of money and savings gives them confidence to deal with and to understand financial challenges when they growing up. Ithala Bank recently visited Gcwalamoya primary school in Mandeni, north of KZN, to teach pupils about the importance of saving money. They believe that teaching kids the tradition of saving some of the little money they get at home will go a long way. Ithala SOC limited public relations and media officer Thembekile Mdletshe said they decided to teach money literacy in schools to catch youngsters while they are still kids and to build a nation that will be able to budget. “Most children take around R2 everyday to school and we are teaching them that they can use only R1 a day and save the the other one. By the end of the week it will be R5 and two weeks R10. This will help them to grow a savings habit,” she said. “Children need to understand that if they want something they will have to value the importance of it. We start by teaching them the difference between wants and needs. “Being taught at a young age has huge possibilities when it comes to adapting that lifestyle when they are working,” she said. Grade 6 pupil Nozipho Maphumulo said she learnt that there are things that she can live without and that she can start saving for her future now. Another pupil, Zakhele Zulu, said: “I’ve learnt so much about money and I will also teach my elder brother so that we can start saving our own money.”
