FACE of Devotion is about empowering young women. Co-founder of the pageant Oscar Mabuza (20) said the aim of the initiative is to shape young women and prepare them for success. He said young women are always told to work hard in order to live the life of their dreams, yet most of them have never tasted the good life. “With our pageants, winners don’t win cash prizes, but we take them on trips to give them the experience of the life they should be working towards,” he said. “We feel that money won’t do justice. “Giving them something that creates happy memories is the best.” DFS Entertainment will host the 2020 auditions of Face of Devotion Mzansi 2020 on 1 March at GOG Lifestyle Park in Soweto from 9am to 4pm. “For auditions, contact Trevor Dlamini on 062 915 9421. People can also check out our work on Facebook and instagram, devotion mzansi,” said Oscar.
