He is big, tall, smart, funny and – above all – gay! One feels his warmth and presence whenever he enters a room. This is Sthembinkosi Junior Bikwa, the Zimbabwean-born entertainment personality with many hats. Known as Bujy, the 32-year-old has entrenched himself in the industry as a radio host, TV presenter and producer. “I’m very calculated and intentional in whatever I do. I’m well-read and I know many authors. At 21, I was already a content producer. Being gay is something you don’t question. What you see is a gay man and he is Bujy.” A nominee of several awards, Bujy co-hosts popular Metro FM Saturday show The Weekender with DJ Mo-G, born Mpho Madise. Their team also consists of Angie Khumalo on the news front and Andile Ncube in sports. Bujy said they always made sure the show’s content was informative. “We have lifestyle, sports, current affairs and different features. We help listeners use what they have at home for different purposes. For example, vinegar is commonly used for food. However, it could be used for soaking your nails or getting rid of flies.” He said their music formed a critical part of the show. “We play timeless music that takes listeners down Memory Lane to give them an easy Saturday morning.” Bujy has been with Metro FM for the past two years. He hosted Top 40 with Dineo Ranaka before his current show. The duo have had a beautiful chemistry on and off air since their days at YFM. Raised in Orange Farm, south of Joburg, Bujy was introduced to radio in grade 11 in 2003. “Youth mentor Dumisani Kunene recognised my talent and lured me to YFM. I had an opportunity to interview Brad Pitt after he released his movie Troy,” he said. Most people will remember Bujy from Dance your Butt off on SABC1 in 2010. He was one of the four finalists. He later became the content producer and presenter of Mzansi Magic’s Cula Sibone.
