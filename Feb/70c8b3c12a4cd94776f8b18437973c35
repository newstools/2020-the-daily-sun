 EFF commander in chief Julius Malema and his wife Mantoa want ANC MP Boy Mamabolo to retract his defamatory statements or face a lawsuit. MAMABOLO: I WON'T APOLOGISE TO JUJU! The couple through their lawyers sent Mamabolo separate letters demanding he retracts defamatory statements he repeated to the media which he made in Parliament. During the debate of the State of the Nation Address debate on Tuesday, Mamabolo stood on a point of order when Malema was delivering his debate and asked him to state under oath whether he was abusing his wife or not. When Mamabolo said it in parliament he was protected by the privilege of freedom of speech on MPs but repeating them to the media in an interview has opened him up for a lawsuit. It also emerged that the ANC whippery had caucused to Mamabolo, who is Malema’s boyhood friend but have fallen out, to attack Malema during the debate. The move backfired on Tuesday when Malema denied he ever abused his wife and announced in parliament that his lawyers would be writing Mamabolo a letter. Malema also fired back, telling the house that President Cyril Ramaphosa once abused his former wife who has since passed on. Malema even dragged former president Jacob Zuma into it, saying Zuma could also confirm as Ramaphosa’s former wife, Nomazizi, confided in Zuma. Now Malema’s wife has also demanded that Mamabolo should also retract the statement and apologize publicly in all his social media accounts. In the letter, she tells Mamabolo that she doesn’t want him to be her voice and she could have reported the alleged abuse to the police if it had happened. She said the accusations have damaged her family and exposed her children to being mocked at school. “Your false accusations have caused grave harm and damage to the family,” she says in the letter. She reminded Mamabolo that if he doesn’t retract the statement by end of business today, he will be slapped with a million rand lawsuit.
