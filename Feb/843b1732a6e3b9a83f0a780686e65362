 IF YOU are one of the 90,000 soccer fans which are expected at FNB Stadium on Saturday for the Soweto Derby, you are advised to arrive early to avoid the traffic chaos that could unfold when in-form Orlando Pirates host rivals Kaizer Chiefs. This was a passionate plea made by stadium management director Berti Grobbelaar, Premier Soccer League General Manager Jacques Grobbelaar and Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Wayne Minaar on Tuesday. With Ultra Music Festival taking place on the same day at the Expo Centre, Nasrec from 12-afternoon traffic is expected to be hectic. Minaar said they are going to close some roads near the stadium from 9 am until 6 pm. Talking at Orlando Pirates Media open day he said: "Soweto Highway between N1 and Booysens road will be blocked from early as 9 am, then the league road which is the direct side of the stadium will be closed from eight in the morning. "The roads will remain closed until after the game."We want to encourage people going to the derby to make use of N17, M1 and also Nasrec road when they are coming from Soweto." "Those people who will be going to Ultra Music festival must use N1, Nasrec and Rand show because it is going to be two events at the same time." Minaar added: "We expecting a full capacity for the derby and we expecting another 30 000 people going to the music festival."
