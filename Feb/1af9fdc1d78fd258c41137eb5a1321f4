NATIONAL police commissioner General Khehla Sitole yesterday gave residents the opportunity to share their problems. Residents of Alexandra, north of Joburg, told Sitole crime, drugs and the lack of respect for the law were their major concerns. Sitole came to discuss the tragic death of Samantha Radebe (28), who was killed in the crossfire between cops and suspected hijackers last month. “We have a turnaround vision which sees Alexandra Police Station as one of the most troubled in the country,” he said. Gauteng commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said there were more liquor stores in Alexandra than schools. “We will impose strict measures to issue liquor licences,” he said. Resident Nomsa Thela (33) said: “Criminals do as they please as the police presence is lacking.” Youth Desk chairman Marvin Tsotetsi said: “Taverns never close and make noise so we can’t study or sleep. Drugs have taken over and cops are at the forefront of all things happening around Alex,” he said. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate confirmed Radebe was killed by a police bullet.
