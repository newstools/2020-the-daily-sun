MPUMALANGA cops believe Moses Mosemba (36) and Ntombizodwa Ndwandwa (41) can assist them in their investigation into the rape and brutal murder of a 62-year-old pensioner. Wanter Dlamini was raped and strangled last month, allegedly with the view to cashing in on an R80 000 insurance claim. Her body was dumped in a nearby bush in Barberton. On Saturday police bust a suspect, Stanley Mashikeng (36), after he was found hiding under a bridge in Mbombela by residents. He was accused of conspiring with the gogo’s two daughters to rape and kill her.  Mashikeng appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court yesterday on murder and rape charges. The case was postponed to tomorrow for a formal bail application. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Halthi said investigations would continue.  Dlamini’s 30-year-old daughter allegedly invited her for a visit and organised a friend and two men to kill her. When she arrived, she was allegedly assaulted and raped by the men while her daughters and a friend held her down. When they were done, they allegedly wrapped her body in a blanket and hid it in an outside toilet. Dlamini’s other daughter (39) allegedly organised transport to get rid of the body.  In November, a life insurance policy was taken out in her name by an unknown person. Dlamini’s other daughter, Basie van der Merwe (29), said the family was happy with the police’s progress. “We hope the two suspects will be arrested soon,” she said.
