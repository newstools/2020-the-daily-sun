Magatle cops have launched a manhunt for a man who is suspected of raping an 18-year-old grade 12 pupil. The pupil reportedly was walking alone through the bush along a road between Magatle and Mapatjakeng in Limpopo on her way to Saturday classes when sheÂ was grabbed by the suspect, who threatened and raped her before fleeing the scene. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim's desperate plea for help was heard by a passerby, who then informed the police. A manhunt was immediately activated and the young girl was taken to hospital for medical attention. Provincial commissioner of Limpopo, Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba instructed the police to hunt down the alleged rapist and bring him to book. He also urged pupils to be careful when walking alone in isolated areas and to always have in their possession the contact numbers of the nearest police. The alleged rapist is said to be middle-aged and was wearing a red T-shirt, brown trousers and All Stars tekkies. Ledwaba urged anyone with informatio to call Detective Sergeant Steven Mogale on 082 625 1333 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
