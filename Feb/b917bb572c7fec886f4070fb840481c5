Media personality Khanyi Mbau was trolled on Twitter on Monday after she photoshopped YouTuber Lasizwe's nose and made it thinner on a picture. The two posted the same picture on Instagram but Khanyi's picture was edited. Tweeps said Khanyi hates the way she looks and that is why she changed herself and Lasizwe by using too much light on the picture. Khanyi has over the last few years spoken freely about her bleached skin and several corrective surgeries she did on her body, including a nose job and a tummy tuck.
