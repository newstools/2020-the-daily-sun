A FAMILY believes a mum is lying about her daughter’s death to cover up for her boyfriend. This after a four-year-old girl was found dead and the mum’s 28-year-old boyfriend was arrested for the murder. But the mum (26) denied her family’s allegations. She said her boyfriend accused her daughter of not listening to him when he spoke to her. “I was afraid of him and couldn’t do anything when he took a water container, poured water over my daughter and started pinching her. By that time he had put a facecloth in her mouth so she didn’t scream while he beat her mercilessly. I could see my baby was going to die as he kept beating both of us.”  But the mum’s cousin (38) said: “I personally went to the scene and according to my understanding, the girl was beaten with a cable, but that’s not what led to her death.  A neighbour said they heard a noise from the house. “I knocked on the door to check if they were alright and she told me they were okay. I knew something bad had happened when I saw police vans and an ambulance. We could have saved the baby, but her mother kept telling us they were fine,” Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspect would appear in the Mokopane Magistrates Court soon.
