More tragedy has struck Gauteng schools, as the Department
of Education said on Wednesday that it had learnt of the death of a 11-year-old
Grade 6 pupil from Soshanguve.  The pupil attended Raikana Primary School and was allegedly
knocked by a teacher from Arethabeng Primary School, according to departmental
spokesperson Steve Mabona.  The pupil was rushed to a local clinic, where he later died
while receiving medical care.  The death toll of pupils in the province now sits at 13
since the start of school on January 15.  Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Tembisa, a 15-year-old
girl with autism at Ecaleni School for Special Needs wasÂ  raped, allegedly by a 17-year-old boy at the
school.  Mabona said it was alleged that the boy had followed the
girl to the "autism phase" classrooms, which are barricaded from the
vocational area, and allegedly raped her.  "An assistant teacher saw the perpetrator coming from
behind the classroom, zipping up his pants, and the victim was also seen
pulling up her pants," he added.  The boy was arrested and later released into the care of his
parents, while the school governing body was taking necessary disciplinary
actions.  Mabona said the department's psycho-social unit would be at
both affected schools to offer counselling.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/13th-gauteng-pupil-dies-after-being-knocked-down-by-car-20200212
