  THERE is nothing sweet
than winning the league championship in football. For Ronwen Williams, though,
it is even sweeter when he does it with his SuperSport United “family”. The United goalie revealed
he had a chance to join the PSL big guns but couldn’t be swayed by the big money
moves. His decision to stay with Matsatsantsa
has been influenced by his love for the team and the drive to win the league. “I could have taken the
easy way out and went to one of the big teams with guaranteed success. But I’d
rather do it with SuperSport, at home… with the family. I’d rather bring
success at home,” said Williams. “There’s nothing better
than having a challenge and beating it. And the challenge is to win the league.
There are not a lot of points, really. It’s just the small margins we need to change.” The Bafana Bafana
international, however, admitted they were being let down by their inconsistent
run of results. Though they often put up a
fight against the powerhouses, United mostly struggle to eke out results against
the smaller team. “This season we’ve got one
of the best teams we’ve had in years. We have the core of our team. It’s the
same old story,” said Williams. “We beat the big teams but
struggle against the smaller teams. It’s the mentality we need to change. That’s
been the upsetting part in the last five years. “We’ve had the players,
the coach. But there’s just something lacking. We need to take the leaf out of
Sundowns’ book and demolish these small teams, show them there is a reason why
they are down there, that they are not at our level.” Williams, who came through
the youth structures at United, has further express his wish to become a
regular in the Bafana Bafana team. But his performance at club
level are key to his goal. He added: “I’m sure I’m
going to the next five years, I’ll make sure win the league championship. Maybe
when Dean (Furman) leaves, there’ll be an added responsibility on me.”
