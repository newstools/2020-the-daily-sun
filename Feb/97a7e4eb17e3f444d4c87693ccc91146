THERE has been no teaching and learning in some classes at Dikgatlong High School in Delportshoop, Northern Cape, since the start of the new academic year. Pupils said many classes had no teachers. A number of teachers reportedly left the school last year and their positions haven’t been filled. Pupils claimed this had resulted in many of them having a lot of free time in their hands that they used to either loiter in the schoolyard or chat with friends on their cellphones. On Friday, concerned parents and pupils set tyres alight and threw rubbish around the school in protest against the shortage of teachers. Parents said it was the department’s responsibility to see to it that there were teachers. “Our children haven’t been taught since the beginning of the year. This is a worrying matter. The school is packed with pupils and I’m concerned they’ve already lost a lot of learning time,” said a concerned parent. A grade 11 pupil said: “We come to school but only get one lesson a week. Teachers who are at the school are already overwhelmed with work. Most of us do nothing on most days. We go to the school to just stand in the sun and chat.” Northern Cape education spokesman Lehuma Ntuane confirmed the principal had to send pupils home after the protest. “The school made a request for two more teachers in addition to the complement of 19. “These two additional posts are to fulfil the curriculum needs of the school. “One additional teacher has already been approved and has started working. “The second additional teacher position is up for consideration and approval. “The additional teachers will offer maths in grades 8 and 9 and mathematical literacy in grade 10,” said Ntuane.
