THE ANC in Gauteng might have accepted Tshwane Mayor Steven Mokgalapa’s resignation, but it wanted him gone sooner! According to provincial secretary Jacob Khawe, the party had big plans for Tshwane residents, but they could only happen if the mayor vacates the office sooner. On Sunday, Mokgalapa shocked many people when he announced he’d leave the mayoral office before the end of this month. Khawe said the party instructed its caucus to reject the date on which Mokgalapa wished to leave office. He described the resignation as another delay tactic by the DA. “He’s been out there with scandals and has not been running the city. He has nothing to resolve.” Khawe said the motion against Mokgalapa must still stand. “The ANC in the capital city must petition the speaker for a motion of no confidence in Mokgalapa to be presented and debated. His resignation confirms what the ANC has been saying: The DA has no plan to run the city,” said Khawe. Mayoral spokeswoman Omogolo Taunyana told Daily Sun the ANC had no grounds to have the mayor removed. She said Mokgalapa would only leave office once his resignation had been finalised on the date he had set.
