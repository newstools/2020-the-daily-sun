UMKHANYAKUDE is planning on blocking rivers from flowing into the sea to fight the water crisis. This was revealed to Daily Sun by the district municipality’s manager, Mxolisi Nkosi, on Wednesday. He said the plan was discussed by Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. Nkosi said the municipality would soon build dams next to the river mouth. He said the idea was used by farmers in the past Nkosi said the target, Umfolozi River, was one of the biggest in the district. He said according to research, water saved in these dams could supply the whole district for four months during winter. “I think we have found a solution to the water crisis in our district. We have seen a lot of water being wasted because the sea doesn’t need any water from inland.” Nkosi said the municipality would ensure the environment was not harmed and that water flowed into the sea. The system would only allow overflow to go into dams. Residents have in the past protested, asking why they have no water even though the Jozini Dam is in the area.
