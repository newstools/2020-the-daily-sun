LIONEL Messi’s unlikely move to Manchester City could finally be a reality. According to reports, City might be his likeliest destination after he had a fall-out with Barcelona director of football Eric Abidal. Messi has a contract until next year at Barcelona, but with a clause that means he can leave for nothing at the end of the season if he is unhappy. Man City feel that if Messi did leave Barcelona, they’d be first in the queue to sign him, according to the Manchester Evening News. Meanwhile, Barcelona coach Quique Setien said on Wednesday he would not get involved in “Lionel Messi’s life” following a row with Abidal. Messi hit back at Abidal on Tuesday after the Frenchman had earlier blamed slackness in the dressing room for the departure of recently-fired boss Ernesto Valverde. In an interview with Spanish newspaper Sport, Abidal said under Valverde, who was fired in mid-January, many players had been unhappy, had not worked hard enough and had not communicated properly. “I’m not going to get into Messi’s life, or anyone’s life,” said Setien, who replaced Valverde. “What interests me is football, everything else are situations that I will not be able to control, therefore I do not sweat on it,” the 61-year-old added. Setien said his only focus was Thursday’s Copa del Rey quarter-final tie at Athletic Bilbao. Messi criticised Abidal’s comments, saying that his former teammate should “name names”. “Sincerely I don’t like doing this kind of thing but everyone has to be made responsible for their actions, and what they say,” Messi said on Instagram. “We, the players in the dressing room, are the first to admit it when we haven’t played well. “The directors need to take their responsibilities too.” Barcelona visit Real Betis on Sunday in La Liga, where they trail leaders Real Madrid by three points.
