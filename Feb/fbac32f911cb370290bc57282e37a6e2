MANY patients brought into the emergency rooms following car crashes present injuries caused by wrong sitting positions in the car. Women, in particular, tend to be more vulnerable to injuries as a result of sitting too close to the steering wheel. Masterdrive shares a few tips to help protect drivers from further injuries due to incorrect seating position: Locked arms limit the range of motion when moving the steering wheel and reduces possible evasive action in a crash. Your seat inclination should always allow for bent elbows and free movement of the steering wheel. An ideal position is where your shoulders rest on the seat and if you extend your arms in front of you, your wrists rest on the steering wheel. Your hands should be placed in the three and nine oâ€™ clock positions to allow for optimal range and control of the steering wheel. This will prevent your head from snapping forcefully backward. Avoid letting your seat belt rest in the crook of your neck. It should run across your shoulder so that in case of an impact it distributes the impact evenly across the strongest parts of your body.
