Social Media went ablaze last Friday after Balwin Properties announced its plans to develop a waterfront and man-made beach worth R9 billion. The luxurious lagoon and lifestyle centre development is said to be located in Midrand and will be named Munyaka. Munyaka translates to "crystal" in Venda.  "Munyaka in Waterfall is releasing for sales on 7 March 2020. R9 billion development with largest crystal clear lagoon in the Southern Hemisphere! 1,2 and 3 bedroom apartments and penthouses for sale starting from R799 000. T&Cs apply," the group captioned their post on Twitter.  Balwin Properties also developed the The Blyde Riverwalk Estate, which is situated Pretoria.  The apartments are said to include Scandinavian style kitchens; as well as free eco-friendly appliances, a balcony for outdoor entertaining, plus pre-paid water and electricity meters. “We have worked very closely with our architects to bring something exceptional to South African sectional title buyers and believe that it will not only set a new standard for lifestyle estate living in Waterfall, but indeed in the country," CEO of Balwin Properties, Steve Brookes said. “The lagoon at Munyaka will feature a landmark 50m-high tower with amenities including a 50-seater restaurant and conference facility with a view of the Johannesburg skyline; as well as zip-lining from the tower into the lagoon and a heated pool, fed by the lagoon,” Engineer News reported.
