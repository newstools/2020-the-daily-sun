A little boy, who was reported missing on Sunday, was found dead on Thursday and some of his body parts were allegedly cut off. Blessing Baloyi (2) from Petanenge village outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, was discovered by a fisherman in the local river on Thursday morning. The depressed family told Daily Sun Blessing's eyes and foot were missing while his forehead had a cut. The family believes someone close to them murdered the child and they tried to give the police all the leads. According to the aunt Nyiko Mdaka, the boy's mum California Moraka left the child with a minor on Saturday evening when she went out. On Sunday, Blessing's minor took him and another child to wash clothes at a nearby river. Mdaka told Daily Sun everything was well; she finished doing her laundry and bathed the children. "The minor told us she first moved the two children out of the river washing area to a dry bank and rushed back to collect the clothes she washed in the river. But coming back to the bank, Blessing was nowhere to be found, she only found her daughter who is also 2," explained Mdaka to Daily Sun. Mdaka said they were not happy with how the police are handling the case because they are not following the right leads. "The murderer is among our family," she said. "We know the minor is innocent, and we are sure Blessing didn't drown in the river, someone who followed them to the river snatched the child. And we are convinced that the body was just dumped in the river after the mutilation to make us believe Blessing drowned. He didn't drown, he was killed and his body parts were cut off," stressed Mdaka. The Limpopo
provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that a
fisherman found the body floating in the river after Blessing went missing on
Sunday. Mojapelo
said the body was inspected and his right leg was amputated, possibly by
crocodiles as the river is crocodile infested. He said
investigations are continuing.
