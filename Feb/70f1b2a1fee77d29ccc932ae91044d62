A 25 year old model from Wroclaw North of Poland is going blind after she dyed her eyeballs black. Daily Mail reported thatÂ Aleksandra Sadowska wanted to imitate a famous rap artist called Popek. The procedure left the 25-year-old model complaining of pains in her eyes which the tattooist is reported to have said was normal and could be treated with painkillers.  The tattoo artist is facing three years in prison for unintentionally severely disabling the woman. During the investigation it was found that the tattooist made serious mistakes in the process, including using body ink for tattooing skin, which should not come into contact with the eye. 'Unfortunately, for now doctors do not give me much optimism for improvement. The damage is too deep and extensive. I'm afraid I will be completely blind.' Aleksandra said.
