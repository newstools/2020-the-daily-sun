SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY...ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer is a bit nervous when he thinks about the Soweto derby. The eagerly awaited sold-out derby is set to take place at the FNB Stadium on 29 February. The fact that the derby was sold-out with three weeks to go, has given Zinnbauer an indication of how big the match is. The German mentor is yet to feature in the Soweto derby, but he will finally make his debut on the side-lines at the host venue of the 2010 Fifa World Cup finals.But when he thinks about the derby, it sends shivers down the spine for the German.Zinnbauer says he has been involved in derbies that attract big crowds in the German Bundesliga, but nothing quite like the 90 000 supporters at the Calabash. He has coached Hamburg against Borussia Dortmund at the 75 000-seater stadium at the Signal Induna Park in Germany.But he was quick to admit that he has no idea as what to expect in one of the biggest games in South African football. “I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” Revealed Zinnbauer. “But I can’t wait to play in front of 90 000 supporters, it will be a first-time experience for me. Maybe it will be a different experience playing against Chiefs, but I can’t wait.
