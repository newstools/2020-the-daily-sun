SA national Under-23 coach David Notoane has announced his provisional squad of 78 players for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. Notoane’s squad is made up of 8 goalkeepers, 27 defenders, 24 midfielders and 19 strikers. He has kept the bulk of his squad which helped South Africa qualify for their third Olympics.Notoane has also widened the pool as he looks to fill the three overage spots in his team. It is for that reason that the 51-year-old has included the likes of Bafana Bafana goalkeepers Ronwen Williams, Ricardo Goss and Darren Keet as three of his overage keepers. In defence, Notroane has picked Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo, Innocent Maela, Mosa Lebusa, and Motjeka Madisha. Thembinkosi Lorch, Vincent Pule, Themba Zwane, Bongani Zungu and Aubrey Modiba are set to battle it out for an overage spot in midfield while Percy Tau, Lebo Mothiba and Gift Motupa are Notoane’s preferred overage forwards. “We have a lot of hard work ahead of us to ensure that we take only the best to represent South Africa at this big stage,” said Notoane. "This is just a preliminary group of players that we think will be considered for the tournament, and as you can see it includes youngsters and seniors. “The next few weeks will be very crucial as we will be running the rule over the players we believe will be best suited for this competition – it is a lovely headache to have because all the players on the list are good quality but unfortunately we can’t take all of them. We are confident that the group we will choose will do the business for the country, but for now we are monitoring all of them to see if they can make the final squad.”
