 A 26-year-old
man has been bust after he raped a 52-year-old woman in Thabazimbi outside Bela
Bela. “It is
alleged that the victim was sleeping alone in her room when the suspect broke
in and raped her,” Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said. Soon after
the act, he fell asleep and the victim managed to run away and called the police. The police
reacted and arrested the suspect while he was still sleeping on the victim's
bed. “The initial
police investigations have revealed that the suspect was once arrested and
sentenced to six months imprisonment for housebreaking and theft,” Ngoepe said. The suspect
will appear before the Thabazimbi Magistrate court soon.
