THE southern technology hub is moving to outlaw the consumption of dogs and cats. This as the country clamps down on the wildlife trade that scientists suspect led to the coronavirus outbreak. The proposed regulations from the city government list nine meats that are permitted for consumption, including pork, chicken, beef and rabbit, as well as fish and seafood. “Banning the consumption of wild animals is a common practice in developed countries and is a universal requirement of modern civilisation,” the notice said. Scientists suspect the virus passed to humans from animals. Some of the earliest infections were found in people exposed to a wildlife market in Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets and other animals were sold. The document recognised dogs and cats’ status as pets and would ban their consumption. Snakes, turtles and frogs were excluded from the approved list, despite being popular dishes. Other permitted meats are lamb, donkey, ducks, geese and pigeon. The proposal noted there are more than 2 000 species of protected wildlife in China. – REUTERS
