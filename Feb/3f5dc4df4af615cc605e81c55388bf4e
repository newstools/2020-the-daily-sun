THE murder case against two sisters and their accomplice was yesterday postponed to 6 March by the Barberton Magistrates Court. Magistrate Maria Mabethwa postponed the case for further investigation. The sisters are accused of killing their mum for a life policy payout. I'M READY TO GO TO JAIL FOR ZUMA! The mum (62) was allegedly raped and strangled in the early hours of 5 January. She was invited by her 30-year-old daughter to her place, who had organised her 41-year-old friend and two men to kill her. When the mum arrived, she was allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and gang- raped by the two men while her daughters and a friend held her down. Her body was wrapped in a blanket and hid in an outside toilet. 'NAKED JESUS' HOSPITALISED The mum’s other daughter (39) allegedly organised transport to get rid of the body. In November, a life insurance policy was taken out in the mum’s name by an unknown person. Mpumalanga police need to speak to Moses Mosemba (36) and Ntombizodwa Ndwandwa (41) to help them with the case.
