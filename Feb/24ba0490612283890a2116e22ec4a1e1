FORMER SAA and Mhlathuze Water Board chairwoman Dudu Myeni allegedly instructed a KZN businessman to pay R1,8m into the Jacob Zuma Foundation’s account. The businessman from Richards Bay told the Zondo Commission yesterday Myeni used his construction company as a conduit to launder money. “Mr X”, as Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo ruled he must be called, said between October 2015 and February 2016, he received R3,25 million from Premier Attraction 1016, a company belonging to Myeni’s son Thalente. He said the money was deposited into his business account on three separate occasions. He said Myeni called him two days after the first deposit was made to ask if he was aware of the recent activities on his account. Mr X said she instructed him to transfer R1 million and later R800 000 to the Jacob Zuma Foundation. He said she also instructed him to withdraw R50 000 in cash on 27 October 2015 and bring it to her. The next day she told him to withdraw R31 000. “I used her offices in her houses to conduct my work, so I’d hide the money in the office to make sure she was the one who got it and not somebody else,” he said. On Monday, Mr X testified his and Myeni’s family were close. He said he first met her in 2007 when they both worked at Richards Bay Minerals. “I’d like to reassure my community, family and friends that I’m not here as a sell-out. I’m here to tell the truth,” he said.
