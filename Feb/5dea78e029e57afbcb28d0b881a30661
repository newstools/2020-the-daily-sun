AS
the old adage goes, be careful of what you wish you in life. Mamelodi
Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane will be careful not to learn this lesson the hard
way after he got his wish in the Nedbank Cup draw. Mosimane
had expressed his wish for a favourable draw. And
he got his wish as Sundowns were paired with SAB League side Vaal University of
Technology in the Last 16 round. But
there are no walkovers in football. “Yes,
we got the draw, VUT. We’ve been asking for a team at a lower level in ABC
Motsepe League,” said Mosimane. “We
got it but you need to be careful what you ask for, because you’re going to get
the shock of your life. I mean if they could eliminate Golden Arrows, the team
in the premier league, then it means they are a good team. “So,
as much as we think we got an easy draw, we have to be careful of teams in the
ABC Motsepe League.”
