 A pregnant woman has died in hospital after she was shot in
her own home in Bonteheuwel, as gang violence continues to ravage the embattled
Cape Town neighbourhood. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the
30-year-old woman was gunned down at 17:30 in Terblanche Street on Wednesday. She later died in hospital. The shooting is believed to be gang related. Rwexana confirmed that no arrests had yet been made. Local ward councillor Angus McKenzie said the woman's murder
"would appear to be an assassination rather than just a random
shooting". "It is believed the individual walked into house, shot
her in the chest and back, and left. It is part of an ongoing gang battle
between two rival gangs in one section of Bonteheuwel," he said. The Hard Livings and Playboys gangs are understood to be
embroiled in a turf war. McKenzie said law enforcement and police had increased their
visibility in the neighbourhood, about 15km outside the city centre. Last year, 44 people were murdered within six months in the
area. A drastic decrease in casualties was seen after the
deployment of the army and 100 law enforcement officers, which increased
visibility in Bonteheuwel. The reorganising of street committees and other
community-based safety networks also contributed to the decline in killings,
local organisations said. According to McKenzie, there had been "non-stop
shooting" in a small area and: "SAPS has not been able to put a lid
on this." This had resulted in, not only gangsters dying, but also
innocent people being affected, he said. SOURCE: NEWS24
