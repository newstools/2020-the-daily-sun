CAPE Town City coach Jan Olde Riekerink faces a nerve wrecking time waiting to find out the extend of his star striker Kermit Erasmus and goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh’s injuries. Erasmus, who had recently recovered from another injury, pulled a hamstring when he was chasing the ball in their 1-1 draw with Maritzburg United in a Absa Premiership clash at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. Leeuwenburgh suffered gash on his upper lip after Maritzburg winger Gabriel Nyoni unintentionally thumped into the Dutch keeper. The Zimbabwean was sent off for that challenge. Erasmus, a former Orlando Pirates striker, who has scored nine league goals and is the go to man for City, was replaced in the 14th minute by Shane Roberts. This completely changed the threat City carried and the Citizens were no longer the same team after the Bafana Bafana striker was taken off. Riekerink is keeping his fingers crossed that the injuries are not as serious as he suspects. “The team is not comfortable when your top scorer goes out,” said Riekerink. “It is a hamstring injury. I expect him to be out for a long period. For Peter it was a bad injury,” Leewenburgh was taken off in the 39th minute and replaced by Sage Stephens. The former AmaZulu goalkeeper fumbled Daylon Claasen’s cross and Jeremy Brockie was on hand to score the home side’s equaliser. These injuries come at the time when City are starting to find their feet under the Dutch coach. They are unbeaten in their last three fixtures under his guidance. Said Riekerink.“We are playing comfortable football now and we have our way of playing, and we have players for that.” City, who are now climbing the log with 24 points from 21 games, will change focus to the Nedbank Cup Last-32 round this weekend. They visit Mbombela United on Sunday. Erasmus and Leewenburgh are doubtful for the cup-tie.
