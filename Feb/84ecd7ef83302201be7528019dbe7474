Multi award-winning guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer Berita is simply unstoppable. Born Gugulethu Khumalo in Zimbabwe, the Afro soul singer will release her fourth studio album before the end of the month. Titled Songs In The Key Of Love, the album will be available in stores from next Friday. Berita told SunBuzz how happy she was with the quality of work she put into the album. She said she couldn’t wait for her fans to enjoy it. “I’m happy with this album because I’ve grown so much in my music career. I’ve done lots of things behind the scenes,” said the 30-year-old. “Out of the 13 songs on the album, two were solely produced by me. This was not the case with my previous albums.” The offering is her first to be released under her own recording label, Assali Music.   “The album was inspired by personal experiences and life in general. Some of the songs have their roots in the sad reality that most marriages don’t last any more. There are so many divorces. Most of the songs I wrote are meant to heal broken hearts and assure people there’s still hope for love out there,” said Berita. The singer said she celebrated the content and the message than the completion of the album. “I started writing some of the songs in 2017. It was only last month that I met some producers to help me select songs for the album,” she said. The album features artists such as Bekezela, Bongani Hadebe, Motive from Micasa and Amanda Black. “I’m excited that I’ve worked with such a talented bunch of artists on a single album.
