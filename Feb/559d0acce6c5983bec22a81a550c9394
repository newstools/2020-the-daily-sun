AJAX Cape Town coach Andries Ulderink tendered his resignation from the club on Friday - and round about the same time, Benni McCarthy arrives in the Mother City. McCarthy could be in the 18-area to land the Ajax Cape Town coaching afterÂ Ulderink's surprise resignation - McCarthy was fired by Cape Town City boss John Comitis in November after a series of poor results. Ajax are top contenders for automatic promotion to the PSL because before their match on Saturday against Free State Stars, they were leading the First Division log. McCarthy was spotted having a chilled time with his former Cape Town City buddies this weekend.
