MANY African students are facing starvation as they struggle to access food in the wake of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. According to reports, foreign students have been denied permission to leave campuses to go and buy necessities, even though their local counterparts have it. About 60 000 African students from African countries study at various Chinese universities. A student from Zimbabwe said: “What worsens matters is that university authorities where I study only release their relatives to buy food on our behalf. But they buy food unknown to us Africans.” A student from Kenya said universities were not providing catering services. – CAJ NEWS
