"A museum is a Western concept and it is not an African concept, so it will take time for African people to understand that they should go to one." â€œBut what is also demotivating the youth to visit museums in Africa is that museums in their origin were used as an instrument to demonise African people," said Freedom Park Museum's Chief Curator Nentshiavha Victor. He was speaking at Savoy Hotel, in Mthatha during the 20-year milestone celebration of Nelson Mandela Museum. He continued to say it will take time for black people to understand the importance of museums. Nelson Mandela Museum CEO Bonke Tyulu said they see themselves as an African museum which has a global influence. "Being an African museum, we use it as a point of identity, but we are catering to all people across the globe." He said they are also working with Google meaning if someone wants to visit the museum you can watch through Visual Tour Google. Nelson Mandela's grandson, Ndaba Mandela said museums need to be at the center of young people, where people come and get resources, computers, and education. He believes there is still a lot of celebrations that need to be done in celebrating the legacy of Madiba.
