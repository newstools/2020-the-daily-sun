ORLANDO Pirates assistant coach Fadlu Davids has labelled his side as underdogs going into the Soweto Derby against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Despite Pirates having gone unbeaten under Josef Zinnbauer since the German mentor arrived at the club, Davids said that if you look at the greater scheme of things, Chiefs are top of the log and still in a commanding position with a six-point lead over their Soweto rivals. "I think you have to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Chiefs are actually the in-form team‚” said Davids. "They lost one game now in the league. Before that their last (league) defeat was against SuperSport. And‚ you know‚ they have been pretty much consistent through the season – hence their position. "The other thing is‚ do you really read into form when it comes to a derby like this? I don’t think so. "Their coach is experienced enough to be calm this week. I think his players will pick up. "I know him quite well – he’ll be calm‚ and he will coach the game as a normal game‚ not heeding too much to what is said outside. "I expect them full strength‚ I expect them firing‚ I expect them to play to their strengths. And it will be a really tough game. "We have to be at our best to get the three points. And that is what it’s about. "We are not for one second going into the game underestimating Kaizer Chiefs because they lost in the cup on penalties. No ways. "We know they are a team on top of the log, and we are a team finding form now late in the season."
