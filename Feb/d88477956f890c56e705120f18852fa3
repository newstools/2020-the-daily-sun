NELSON Mandela Bay councillors often find themselves under attack by angry protesters demanding service delivery. But residents often direct their grievances to wrong councillors. The IEC discovered that one of the major problems was that residents and councillors didn’t know their demarcations. On 16 March, the IEC in The municipality will roll out a programme called Know Your Ward in all new squatter camps. IEC regional assistant manager Crosby Bacela said: “This will help both councillors and residents know their wards. “Some residents assume they fall in the same ward because they are only separated by a street.” Sindiswa Mama (38) of Nkandla kasi said: “This will help us a lot because even when we go to KwaDwesi Police Station, we’re told that we fall under Despatch cop shop. This will also help reduce overcrowding at clinics.”
