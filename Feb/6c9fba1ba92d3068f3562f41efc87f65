ANGRY pupils at Gugulesizwe High School in eMkhonjeni in Jozini, northern KZN, are boycotting classes. This comes after a grade 12 pupil was raped, allegedly by a guard, on the premises on Saturday. According to a source in the school, the incident happened shortly after matrics finished night lessons.

Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of rape was being investigated by the Jozini family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit after a 17-year-old pupil was raped on 15 February. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “If this is true, he has written himself a resignation letter. We can’t have a person tasked with ensuring safety inside the school doing such a thing. “We’re looking forward to seeing the police deal with him harshly.”
