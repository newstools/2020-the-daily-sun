"I will pay everyone from security guards, cleaners and caterers’ royalties. I’m tired of seeing fellow actors dying poor and starving because producers and broadcasters don’t want to pay them. I want the make-up lady to be able to get on set at 4 am – and not to have transport constraints,” he told Daily Sun. He said is trying to be the change he wants to see happen in showbiz because for a long-time actors have been taken for a ride. Explained Kagiso: “I want everyone on my set to drive and not to sleep hungry. I get money for royalties as the executive producer of the film, so then I determine how to pay talent, staff and crew. For example, a lead actor and supporting actor will not get same amount of royalties.  I will get the royalties for the next 25 years, as long as my movie is sold.” Also read: KAGISO MODUPE HAPPY WITH HIS FILMS' SUCCESS!
