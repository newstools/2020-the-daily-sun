Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp admits it's difficult to accept Saturday's defeat to Maritzburg United after so many chances were wasted. Amakhosi's lead at the top of the Absa Premiership has been reduced to seven points as Mamelodi Sundowns beat Chippa United 3-0 while Chiefs lost 2-1 to the Team of Choice. The Glamour Boys had a plethora of opportunities to take the lead at FNB Stadium but they were unable to convert and found themselves 2-0 down after a quick-fire brace from Dylon Classen. Samir Nurkovic pulled one back for the hosts in the 78th minute but they couldn't pull off the comeback and slumped to a narrow defeat. "I don't know, there are other games probably we should have lost but a game like this to lose it's definitely very difficult to process," Middendorp told SuperSportTV. "First-half, from the beginning we were active, we had five or six minutes where two shots, I don't know, normally with this type of [football], you can repeat it, you should play the Premier League in England or whatever but good, we had these opportunities to make it 1-0, 2-0, 3-0. "We had chances but we didn't use them and all of a sudden we're 2-0 down. It's something you really have to swallow." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
