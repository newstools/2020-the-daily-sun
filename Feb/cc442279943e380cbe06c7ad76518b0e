ISIBAYA actress Lerato Mvelase is living in fear. This after receiving death threats, allegedly from her baby daddy. The 37-year-old, who plays lieutenant Samkelo Mkhize in the Mzansi Magic soapie, opened a case of intimidation at Sandton Police Station earlier this month. She accused her ex-boyfriend of threatening her life. According to her police statement, seen by the SunTeam, the incident occurred in Sandton, north of Jozi. The statement reveals that the fracas unfolded next to a school and the ex-boyfriend threatened to kill her and set the school on fire. Lerato declined to comment, citing the matter was under police investigation. The seasoned actress said she had no interest in discussing her personal matters in the media. Explained Lerato: “I’d rather not comment out of respect for the police investigation and considering this is personal.” Her statement also cites the incident happened on 27 January despite the case officially being opened this month. When offered an opportunity to tell his side of the story, the ex-boyfriend hung up the phone. Police spokesperson Granville Meyer confirmed the case and said the matter had been taken to court. “The suspect was given a warning and will appear at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court,” he said.
