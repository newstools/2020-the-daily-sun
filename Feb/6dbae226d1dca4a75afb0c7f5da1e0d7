The steely reserve that Karabo Tau
has shown since her arrest for the alleged kidnapping of a baby melted on
Wednesday when she clung tightly to her family and sobbed deeply outside the
Bellville Magistrate's Court, after being released on bail. Magistrate Charles Scott pronounced
that the State had not shown it was in the interests of justice to keep the
18-year-old matric pupil in custody any longer, and granted bail of R2 000. Inside the court there were barely
suppressed sighs of relief and quiet incantations of "thank you!". Earlier, in a different court room,
kidnap charges were withdrawn against her co-accused Ely Kibunda, and the
family's lawyer Leon Fieties is considering launching a civil claim for his
alleged wrongful arrest. Outside the court, opposing groups
for and against Tau sang out "Voetsek F*kof", and altered lines of
the protest song to: "Myeke Karabo" (Leave our Karabo alone) and
Sinikeni Karabo (Give us Karabo). Her family and supporters believe
she is innocent, while the other group wants to know where the twin baby
Kwahlela Tiwane is. SAPS officials and traffic police
cordoned off the road outside the court and separated the two groups, some of
whom had brought golf putting irons with them. One stone was lobbed down the
blocked-off road outside the court, but after a brief verbal skirmish the
opposing groups were separated and taxis took them home.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/charge-withdrawn-against-one-of-the-accused-in-mystery-cape-town-baby-kidnapping-20200212
