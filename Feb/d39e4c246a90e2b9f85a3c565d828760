It is difficult to take Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, seriously. She is completely out of order for wanting to interfere with the scope of the state capture inquiry. Her criticism of the Zondo commission is a sign she may be involved in political factions. And she has the nerve to question the commission when she couldn’t even do anything about the Vrede Dairy Farm matter. The sooner she leaves that office, the better. Judging by what has been unearthed so far by the commission, whatever cash used for it was money well spent. Mkhwebane must focus on doing a proper job and stop poking her nose where it does not belong. The public protector’s office has not been in good shape since she was appointed. Things are getting out of hand. Parliament must save this office.
