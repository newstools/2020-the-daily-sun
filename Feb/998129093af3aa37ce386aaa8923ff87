Happiness was the order of the day as nine lucky winners walked away with a brand new Mercedes Benz C200. The Gallagher Estate in Midrand played host for the National Lottery Fifth Raffle winner’s event. As the winners were given keys to their cars, they were seen dancing and ululating. Ithuba said it's the winners' choice what to do with the car, meaning those who wanted to sell them could do so. However, most of the winners told Daily Sun they won’t sell their German machines.  “This is a beast. I’m keeping it,” said one of the winners Lynette Shomokelae (32) from Klerksdrop in the North West. She said this was her first car. “It has always been my dream car. Thank you Ithuba,” she said. Ithuba is still on the hunt for the 10th winner, who is said to be from the Eastern Cape. Its corporate relations executive Khensani Mabuza congratulated all the winners. She said the Fifth Raffle saw over 99,78% tickets being sold. “The Raffle has proven to be, yet again, a great success since the game was launched in 2016,” said Khensani.
