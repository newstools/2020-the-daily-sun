Fuming residents of Langeloop in Nkomazi, Mpumalanga have burnt down their local library on Tuesday  during a service delivery protest. Since Monday, residents of this area barricaded all the entrances with burning tyres and trees. They are accusing Nkomazi local municipality of ignoring them when it comes to rendering services. Community members who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that for the many years, their community has been ignored and instead of getting proper services like any other communities within Nkomazi, they don't get them. "It's like they are doing us a favour. We get water when they feel like we need it. We don't have proper roads, everything is a mess here," said the community member. Another resident said they have lost trust in their councillor and the whole municipality. "Our councillor has not been helpful; he hasn't executed his duties because our community is still the same. We have been raising the same issues for many years, but nothing has been fixed. We also demand that he steps down," said the community member. Nkomazi local municipality spokesman, Cyril Repinga said they heard that a library was burnt. He said: "The complaint we received was about water and we have addressed that. We also received a memorandum of demands, but unfortunately some of the demands are beyond municipality.” Meanwhile Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Halthi said there are several people who have been arrested and will face relevant charges. "We are calling on communities that whenever they embark on a service delivery protest, that has to be done within the constitution of the law.”He said everyone who will break the law will be dealt with. “We cannot allow that people go around and burn schools, libraries and other infrastructure, this is unlawful. People must respect much needed infrastructure and public properties," he said.
