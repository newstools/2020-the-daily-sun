'MPS 'WENT TOO FAR' ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT SONA' A neighbour saw a lace curtain blowing in the wind and immediately knew something was wrong. She called Emily, who rushed home. When Emily saw the broken window her heart almost stopped beating. When she finally was brave enough to investigate, she found her bedroom had been ransacked, three boxes of brand-new shoes were empty, and cupboards and fridge door were wide open. The thugs stole groceries and two chicken braai packs. They loaded their loot into a big bag Emily had in her room. “These tsotsis had a lot of time to search for things to steal,” said Emily. The money they took was for transport and school lunch for her daughter. MAKHI DEMANDS SEX!
