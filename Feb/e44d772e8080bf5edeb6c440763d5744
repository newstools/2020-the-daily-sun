Moyane from Naledi in Soweto said the score will be 2-2 and predicted action. “Orlando Pirates will score the first goal in the first half. Kaizer Chiefs will score two goals in the second half. Pirates will equalise before the game ends,” he said. Moyane said the game will be tough. “There will be a lot of chaos. Chiefs will get three yellow cards,” he said. Moyane gave his amathwasa a chance to read the bones and they agreed the tough game and would end in a draw. One saw a clear picture. “I see Thembinkosi Lorch scoring the first goal of the game for Ezimnyama Ngenkani. Manyama will score for Abafana Bokuthula Noxolo,” said the thwasa. He said the game will be filled with drama. The referee should be a very experienced person and must avoid small mistakes. “Police need to be on the lookout for people who become unruly. I see some getting injured,” he said. Sangoma Nzama from Soweto, famous for predicting the win over Egypt at the Afcon in Cairo in Egypt last year, also predicted a draw on this match. Nzama could not see the score but said when he threw his bones, fans for both teams were not celebrating but were not disappointed, either. “That means a draw. But I could not see the game itself. I don’t know why my ancestors are hiding it from me,” he said. He said this was going to be a good game. The Soweto giants last met in the Absa Premiership in November last year. Chiefs beat Pirates 3-2.
