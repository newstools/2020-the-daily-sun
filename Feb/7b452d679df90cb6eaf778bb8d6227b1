THE family of a suspect implicated in a rape and murder were banished by residents on Tuesday. This after residents of Mashesheleng Village in Nquthu, northern KZN, discovered a suspect had been released on Monday, a few hours after his arrest. His arrest came after that of the deceased’s relative on Sunday. The two were accused of raping and killing Nomvula Buthelezi (20) on Saturday. It is suspected that shortly after leaving the homestead where a close relative was getting married, Buthelezi was followed. The suspects allegedly raped and killed her before placing her body in a bed so her family would think she was asleep. On Sunday, everyone looked for her when they realised she was missing. Her body was found in a rondavel within the homestead. She was half-naked and blood came out of her mouth and nose. It is alleged a cap linking the neighbour to the murder was found at the scene. The relative was bust after it was noticed his trousers had blood on them. After the relative appeared in the Nquthu Magistrates Court on Tuesday, residents wanted to know why the neighbour didn’t appear as well. That’s when they discovered he had been released. Nomvula’s aunt Jabu Buthelezi (46) thanked residents for their support. She said: “We understand that banishing his family won’t bring Nomvula back, but we’re happy that we won’t see any of them again.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police bust a suspect for murder. “The suspect appeared in court on Tuesday and was remanded in custody until 4 March for a bail application,”she said. “If residents take the law into their own hands, they will face the full might of the law.”
