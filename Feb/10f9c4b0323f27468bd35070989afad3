On Saturday the mayor and his family from Ladysmith in the KZN midlands were called to the scene where his grandson Mthobisi Madlala (27) was shot and killed. Mthobisi was allegedly shot and killed in a brutal drive-by shooting just less than a kilometer from his home. When Madlala family arrive on the scene they found Mthobisi’s car riddled with bullets holes and it’s suspected that the passanger who was with him manage to escape when the gunmen allegedly open fire.This incident follows of the mayor’s son Siboniso Madlala (28) who was shot and killed in May last year.Unlike Mthobisi who was decleared dead on the scene, Siboniso allegedly managed to move from the scene to his fathers house where he was then rushed to the local cops shop where the paramedics were waiting to treat him but unfortunately it was too late and  he was declare dead.Mayor Madlala said where the incident happened is not far from their home and soon as it happened, they were called to come and witness the gruesome scene.“We rushed to the scene and we found him dead. What I suspect is that the people who killed him were after him because they didn’t take anything from his car. If it was just robbery, they would have stolen the car or his cellphone and money,” he said.He said they don’t know why he was killed as he never told them that he has enemies, or he had fought with anyone.Madlala added that his grandson was coming from a local club where he went there to have fun with friends.“We don’t want to speculate why he was killed but we believe that cops will be able to give us closure,” he said.When the People’s Paper asked him about the similarity of event that claimed his son’s and grandson’s life, he said: “I will leave it to the cops to do their work and we will be able to know why there were killed.” KZN Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirms that a murder case was opened by Ladysmith cops for investigation this is after a deceased was attacked by unknown suspects while travelling with his driver.“The deceased was a taxi owner and he was declared dead at the scene,” said Mbele.
