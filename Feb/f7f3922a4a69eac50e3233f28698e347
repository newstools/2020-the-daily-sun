Eskom has
announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 9 a.m. on Thursday
until 6 a.m. on Saturday morning due to a shortage of capacity. The power
utility said it was making use of emergency diesel and water reserves to
supplement the shortage, and there was a high probability of power cuts over
the weekend. Unplanned
outages increased to 11 938MW on Thursday morning, from 11 302MW on Wednesday
afternoon. The
cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over
the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power
plants. #POWERALERT: Stage 2 rotational #loadshedding will be implemented from 9:00 today until 6:00 on Saturday. https://t.co/nR7KKzt9f8  #Loadshedding Eskom to implement stage 2 rotational load shedding from 9:00 until 06:00 Saturday.Block 7A & 3B 09:00-12:30. see attached for areas affected. keep up on our TL for further updates.^NN pic.twitter.com/LKFSlOYd6f  #Loadshedding just because these politicians don't want to put down their pride, and get capable people to fix loadshedding, now they are telling us about 2 years, a child can be born and learn how to speak that how long pic.twitter.com/I4jSndbmEp   SOURCE: NEWS24
