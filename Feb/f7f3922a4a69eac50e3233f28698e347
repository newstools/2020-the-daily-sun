Eskom has
announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 9 a.m. on Thursday
until 6 a.m. on Saturday morning due to a shortage of capacity. The power
utility said it was making use of emergency diesel and water reserves to
supplement the shortage, and there was a high probability of power cuts over
the weekend. Unplanned
outages increased to 11 938MW on Thursday morning, from 11 302MW on Wednesday
afternoon. The
cash-strapped utility has warned of an increased likelihood of power cuts over
the next 18 months as it conducts maintenance on its fleet of ageing power
plants.     SOURCE: NEWS24
