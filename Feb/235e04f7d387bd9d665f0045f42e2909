THEY say too much confidence breeds arrogance. You need not look further than one Stanford Nkoane for a typical example of this maxim. To say Nkoane, the Vaal University of Technology (VUT) coach, is tjatjarg would be an understatement. The University side have so far caused the biggest upset in the Nedbank Cup after they bundled out Golden Arrows with a fortuitous penalty shootout victory in the Last 32 round. It seems the win, arguably the biggest of his career, has left him overflowing with self-confidence as he prepares to face Mamelodi Sundowns in the next round on Sunday. “We are always prepared. We have faced a quality side before. Arrows play in the PSL. Sundowns play in the PSL. So?” said Nkoane, basking in the media attention of a rare press conference. “Let Sundowns come with their quality. Remember, every team has a weakness. I went to see their match in the week. I saw how they play. “I don’t know if they take us seriously. But Arrows did the same and they paid the price. Anything is possible in football. “We are scared of anyone. Sundowns shouldn’t underestimate us, else they’ll see trouble! “We respect Sundowns. They were the champions of Africa. But every team has quality. It is 11 against 11.”
