Leonardo Castro says he is enjoying his strike partnership with Samir Nurkovic, with whom he has developed a deep understanding at Kaizer Chiefs. The Colombian came close to leaving the Glamour Boys at the start of the current season, following a difficult period at the club, but he played himself into form and is now one of the key players for the Absa Premiership leaders. Chiefs are strong favourites to clinch their first league title in five years as they sit nine points clear of second-placed Orlando Pirates with a game in hand. Castro has revealed that one of the reasons he plays well alongside Nurkovic is due to their shared understanding of the game, which leads to synergistic movement on the pitch. "For me it's easy to play with Samir because we can hold the ball for the team and we can make them play as well‚" the 30-year-old told the media during the club's media open day. "When there's pressure they can find us there at the top. "Either it's Samir or me but we can play together and we know that if one is going wide the other needs to be in the box to finish the action. "So it's been good‚ we understand each other on the field." He added: "The most important thing is making sure‚ no matter who scores‚ we need to win each and every game. "So either it's (Eric) Mathoho who is scoring‚ (Daniel) Cardoso‚ (Lebogang) Manyama... no matter who is scoring‚ the most important thing is to make sure that we get the three points." SOURCE: SPORT24
