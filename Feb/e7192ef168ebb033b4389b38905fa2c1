FEBRUARY is known as the Month of Love. Equally so, pregnant women get extra love. The period from 10 to 16 February is known as national Pregnancy Awareness Week. It’s dedicated to expectant women – to remind them to look after their condition and to encourage them to lead a healthy lifestyle. SunHealth asked pregnant women how they look after themselves. Sibongile Zulu (26) from Elias Motsoaledi squatter camp in Soweto, said she was doing well. “My only worry is that my parents and elder brother are diabetic. I’m not sure about myself and am four months pregnant now. “I haven’t gone to the clinic to book yet,” she said. Poppy Mogomotsi (40) from Emdeni, Soweto, said she kept herself active daily with house chores and taking a walk. “I take my pregnancy in my stride. And I do things that I normally do with no fuss. “I also eat fruit and veggies, and I drink lots of water.” Dr Agnes Tisane, a gynaecologist at Melomed Private Hospital, said while it’s important to look after yourself during pregnancy, those with chronic conditions should get medical advice. She said not all pregnancies were without risks, so taking care of yourself and the baby was of utmost importance. Agnes said if you have conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and psoriasis and others, get medical advice. “This is important as some chronic conditions and symptoms may get worse during this period.”
