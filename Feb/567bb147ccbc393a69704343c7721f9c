SUPPLY chain staff at the Limpopo education department will be subjected to a lifestyle audit. The audit would detect if officials live within their means, said MEC Polly Boshielo on Wednesday in Polokwane. Boshielo said the audit would assist the department to ensure tender processes were fair and in line with regulations. The audit comes after thousands of service providers bid for the school feeding scheme tender advertised last month. The contract ends on 31 March, after which a new contractor is expected to run the operation. “We’ve decided to appoint an audit firm that will deal with the tender process,” Boshielo told the People’s Paper. “None of the department’s officials will be involved. “We’ve also asked the auditor-general and provincial Treasury to assist with compliance issues. “This process will ensure that the awarding of tenders is fair and transparent.” The department had before fought with tenderpreneurs who claimed scholar transport tenders were improperly and irregularly awarded to certain bus companies. In some cases there were claims that the vehicle registration numbers used to bid for tenders were not those of buses but belonged to sedans and bakkies. “Consultations are ongoing and, once done, an announcement will be made regarding all issues raised,” said Boshielo.
