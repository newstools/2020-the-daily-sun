THE name Mabena became famous in Mzansi when a hilarious
video clip of a soldier unable to keep up during SANDF training session went
viral on social media. The video showed soldiers practicing to climb a wall. The
other soldiers did as required, except one recruit named Mabena. In the video, their commander could be heard saying to
Mabena, "Mabena‚ please disappoint me again‚ I knew it‚ Mabena.” Now a video of another SANDF training has surfaced on
social media. In the video, soldiers are seen at training driving an armored
vehicle. The vehicle goes through a steep but the driver seems to
lose control and nearly plunges into the fellow soldiers. The soldiers can be seen running for their lives. The video has attracted mixed reaction on twitter, with
some saying it was just a training while others feel disappointed at what they
call the Mabenas. This is our @_SANDF_ Video as received. pic.twitter.com/5CT38gcenZ But what is wrong? Are they not supposed to have accident?
