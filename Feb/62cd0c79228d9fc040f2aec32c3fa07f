This happened on Thursday morning where Johannesburg Metro cops took sandwiches from an entrepreneur. Itumeleng Lekomamyane is the entrepreneur who sells sandwichesÂ for a living. Yesterday tweeted and stated that he's been requested to pay a storage fee of R160 which was not happy about. Plus the condition of the food was not up to standard anymore. "I have to pay for storage as if I asked for this to happen, I need my containers too," he said. Daily Sun spoke to the JMPD spokesman, Superintendent Wayne Minnaar who said Street vendors may not trade within 5 metres of an intersection or trade next to an ATM. "They cannot trade in front of a place of worship, not in an entrance, not in front of a park, not on a pavement that is too narrow to cause people to walk in the street," he said. Tweeps were touched and they voiced their concerns about the JMPD and what they should be focusing on.
