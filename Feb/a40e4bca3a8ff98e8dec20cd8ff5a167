POLOKWANE City midfielder Walter Musona is appealing to club boss Johnny Mogaladi to stick with their under fire coach Clinton Larsen. Larsen replaced the sacked Serbian-born coach Zlatko Krmpotic after the team’s poor performance in December last year. But since the 48-year-old arrived in Polowkane, the team’s results have turned from bad to worse, currently languishing at the foot of the Absa Premiership table with 17 points, and with nine league games remaining. Larsen has only led City to a single win, drew two and lost five – a mere four points collected from a possible 18. Musona, the Zimbabwean international who has just returned from a long term injury, still believes Larsen is the right man to bring sunshine to Rise and Shine. “Larsen is a good coach,” he reasoned. “I don’t see the reason for the club to fire him now. Larsen is an experienced coach and we need to give him a chance. “To be honest, we have been playing good football under him. The problem is that we are not converting our chances into goals, and at times our confidence is at its lowest.” Larsen’s next step is against Baroka FC in a Nedbank Cup Last-32 Limpopo derby at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday (7.30pm). “Our priority is on the league, but we are also taking the Nedbank Cup seriously and a win will help to lift our confidence,” said the 24-year-old. “We are taking this game seriously. It’s not just another cup match for us, but something we take seriously. There is bragging rights at stake.” The last time the two teams met, Baroka pipped City 1-0 on 9 November last year.
