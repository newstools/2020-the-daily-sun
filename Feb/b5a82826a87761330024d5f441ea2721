ANTI-CRIME activist Yusuf Abramjee says cellphone towers in Mzansi are under increasing attack. He said figures from MTN SA show that organised syndicates are cashing in. Abramjee said investigations show batteries are being stolen and smuggled into neighbouring countries. “We’re calling for improved border control and increased policing at cellphone towers,” he said. He called on people to blow the whistle on criminals. “Tip-offs are effective,” he said. MTN general manager for network operations, Ernest Paul, said the levels of theft were not decreasing. He said between last month and December, more than 2 000 incidents of battery theft were reported at MTN towers alone. He said 703 batteries were stolen last month in a total of 122 incidents. “We also have seen a steep increase in cable theft over December and last month, when 109 incidents of cable theft were reported,” he said. “We’ve invested money in technology which we hope will bring down the incidents and lead to arrests.” He said Gauteng, KZN, and the Eastern Cape were the worst hit provinces. “Germiston, Vereeniging, Soweto, Cape Town, Ruimsig and Klerksdorp are the worst affected.” He said some batteries were recovered and arrests made over recent months. “These criminals continue to cause millions of rands in damage. Generators, aircons, security infrastructure and fencing are also being damaged and stolen, as well as diesel and cables.” Brigadier Vishu Naidoo said: “Unfortunately, we can’t send police to guard towers. Companies have to get their own security too.”
