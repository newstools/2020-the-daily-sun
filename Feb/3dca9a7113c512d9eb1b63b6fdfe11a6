HOSTEL residents living near the municipal offices are gatvol of the smell of kak. Their yards are flooded with sewage, making it difficult for them to access their homes. Residents of Hostel 1 in Mangaung said kak from the municipal offices had been flooding their yards for a week, and the municipality wasn’t doing anything about it. David Bonase (50) said he first realised there was a problem when he picked up a terrible smell and went outside to investigate. “I was met by a pool of sewage covering my yard and vegetable garden. I had to dig up all the crops I’d planted.” Liziwe Sephapho (65) said she couldn’t keep her windows open, especially when it was hot outside. She said it was impossible to leave her yard as there was a huge sewage puddle. “I’m an elderly person. The smell really affects my health,” she said. Frustrated Weziwe Sontshantsha said: “Last week my child almost drowned in a hole full of sewage. Our children could drown in this sewage.” A resident visiting the municipal offices told Daily Sun: “I’m here to apply for an RDP, and since Monday we’ve been struggling to enter. We’re sick and tired of standing in a smelly area full of kak.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said the matter would be attended to.
