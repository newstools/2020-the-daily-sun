President Ramaphosa says the government is working to ensure
that data price is cut to so people can have affordable access to the
internet. He said digital economy in Mzansi is only possible when
people can afford to access internet hence they are working on reducing data
price. "The competition authorities are now working towards a
resolution with the large mobile operators to secure deep cuts to data prices
across pre-paid monthly bundles, additional discounts targeted at low income
households, a free daily allocation of data and free access to educational and
other public interest websites. This is an important step to improve lives,
bring people into the digital economy and stimulate online businesses,"
said Ramaphosa. The President promised also to look into the retail industry
as a way to look into the pricing on products as a way to reduce prices of
basic commodities. "Market inquiries into data services, the grocery
retail market and health care have provided the basis for measures to reduce
costs to consumers and make these sectors more competitive," said
Ramaphosa. On Agriculture, Ramaphosa said huge tracts of land have been
released to allow resettlement and restitution of land claims around the
country. "To date, we have released 44,000 hectares of state
land for the settlement of land restitution claims, and will this year release
round 700,000 hectares of state land for agricultural production," he
said.
