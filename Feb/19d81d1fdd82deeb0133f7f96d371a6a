“THAT man is not my family! He must stop bothering me. Why does he always have to come to me? Please don’t play with my name!” These were the words of Papa Penny after the man who claimed to have been raised by him asked for money to thwasa. Joe Banana (40) from Kagiso in Mogale City wants Papa Penny to give him R3 500 for a sangoma to cleanse him before he undergoes training. But Papa Penny feels as if Joe is just stalking him. “He destroyed his life by going to jail and he’s not my responsibility.” Joe said he wanted to thwasa so he could fix his life. “I believe if I can do as my ancestors tell me, I’ll find peace.” Joe, whose real name is Johannes Mohlala, said he met Papa Penny in his early teens. “He took me in. At the time he was living in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni,” he said. Joe said he lived with Papa Penny for more than seven years. “I never knew my real father. After my mother died “I didn’t have a home and went from one relative to another. Papa Penny took care of me.” Joe said he was still living with Papa Penny when his life took a turn for the worse. “I discovered my girlfriend was cheating on me. During a heated argument, she grabbed my balls. I stabbed her.” Joe spent 11 years in jail for murder and was released last year. But Papa Penny was furious he’d committed a crime and turned his back on Joe. Sangoma Nkanyamba told the SunTeam Joe needed to be cleansed as he killed someone and his mum died.
