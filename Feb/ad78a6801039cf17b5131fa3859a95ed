EFF members’ behaviour needs to be condemned. Such hooliganism can’t be tolerated in a democratic country. Sabotaging a democratically elected parliament is against democratic principles. Freedom of speech is enshrined in our Constitution. However, the right to freedom of expression isn’t paramount and doesn’t supersede other constitutional values. Instead, a balance should be struck between the right to freedom of expression and the right to equality. Citizens who want to listen to their president’s address should be respected and given the opportunity to do so. South Africa faces poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and slow economic growth. More than seven million people go to bed hungry. Kids are not in school and youth are jobless. This situation can’t continue. But the EFF won’t take us out of it. It’s policies and overall behaviour bring nothing meaningful to the table and don’t rectify problems. Looking at the challenges that still lie ahead, ratings agencies have every right to be concerned. For about a decade, SOEs have been in a state of decline. Inefficient boards, tender rigging, project delays and state capture have robbed the country of billions of rands. Development has declined and resources have dwindled. Addressing problems at SOEs is high on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s priority list, but turning them around will be met with resistance.
