NONCEDO Cwecwe has lived up to her name by building her neighbour a house. Her name means “The one who is of great help”. Matshezi Jona (80) from Tyeni Village in Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, said she’s waited many years to get an RDP. “I am grateful to my neighbour for taking care of me,” she said. She told Daily Sun her neighbour, a former PR councillor, saw she was living in a house with cracks and that it was going to fall over any time. “I moved into my new house at the beginning of the year,” said gogo Matshezi. “I was afraid that I was going to die in that room.” She said when Noncedo first said she was going to build her a house she never took her seriously. “But today I sleep without fear.” Noncedo, chairwoman of the Women’s caucus in the OR Tambo Municipality, said when Jona told her she’s given up on getting an RDP, she started making plans to build her a house. “Government can’t build houses for everyone at the same time. If we can help, why not? Even if it is not much it makes a difference,” she said. She challenged those who have means to help in their communities to do so. “If you see someone in need and you can help, go for it!”
