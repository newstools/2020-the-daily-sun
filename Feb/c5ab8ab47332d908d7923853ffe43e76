Rapper Cassper Nyovest was in the firing line this week due to him showing up at Somizi and Mohale's wedding wearing the wrong colour of clothes. Some tweeps were laughing at him, while some were calling him disrespectful for not honouring the theme. Somizi decided to clear the mix up and explain what happened. He posted a video saying it was his fault that Cassper wasn't wearing white. He said he forgot to tell the event planners to tell Cassper what to wear.
