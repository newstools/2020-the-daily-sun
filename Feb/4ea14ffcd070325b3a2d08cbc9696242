Most people literally spit everywhere and anywhere while going about their daily business. Such behaviour is antisocial. It’s disgusting and some do it in front of kids. It says a lot about the person’s background and upbringing. What ever happened to respect for others? It’s important for everyone to practise hygiene for the sake of our health and environment. Adults must act responsibly so kids can follow suit. I’ve seen some people spit out their widows while driving. This is disturbing. Spitting in public, whether driving or walking, poses a health risk to passersby. Your spit can have infections such as TB, one of the leading causes of deaths in the country. If public spitting is not dealt with, the fight against TB will be a futile effort. Apart from TB, there are other a irborne diseases that could result from public spitting, such as whooping cough. Those with flu should use handkerchiefs or cough into their elbows – spitting in public is disgusting. It must stop. - Letter by Slight Ramphaka from Florida
