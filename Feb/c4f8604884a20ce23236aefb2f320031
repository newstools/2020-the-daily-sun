PETER Masinya wanted to be on reality show Mnakwethu to help his two wives accept each other. However, after seeing gobela Faniyakhe Mthembu marrying six women at once, he reconsidered.

Every week, presenter Musa Mseleku visits a couple to help the man get permission from his wife to take a second wife. Peter said he lives in Kathlehong, Ekurhuleni, with his sangoma first wife Cynthia Ntuli (43) and his four kids. His second wife Betty Mashalane (38) lives in Limpopo with her two kids. “Both my wives are working and I support both of them. I have always loved polygamy, but I plan on only keeping the two wives I have,” he said. Peter said his wives didn’t get along. “I have tried to resolve the matter by calling family meetings, but they never get along,” he said. Peter said when he saw that Faniyakhe’s six wives got along, he decided he needed his help. “Mnakwethu is doing a good job, but I fear the drama when my wives fight on TV,” he said.

He said people knew it was him who had made polygamy fashionable. “Me and my four wives have destroyed the myth that polygamy brings endless headaches for the husband at home,” he said.
