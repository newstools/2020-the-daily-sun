IT WAS on the day after Valentine’s Day, when Sizwe Nene (33) and his best friend were crossing the road, when they were knocked down by a car. The car was apparently driven by a drunk driver. Now cops have allegedly told the families they don’t know where the driver is! The Nene family from Molapo, Soweto, said after the friends were knocked down, the driver tried to run away but the community caught him and handed him to the police. Both victims died at the scene. The family of Sizwe’s friend (34) have requested that she shouldn’t be named until after the funeral. Sizwe’s brother Goodman Nene (42) told Daily Sun he wished the community had beaten the man even more.  He said they first went to the Moroka cop shop on Sunday and were told the cop handling the case wasn’t there. “On Monday they told us they didn’t know where the suspect was. I’m angry. “Why don’t they have information about a person they took from the scene? We won’t rest until we know what’s happening,” said Goodman. Sizwe’s mother Thandi Nene (64) said her late son left a four-year-old son. “How am I supposed to explain to him how his dad died? I hope justice will be on our side,” she said. Sizwe’s aunt, Lizy Zakwe (66), said she was disappointed with how the police were handling this case. “Two people died. Police rescued the driver from a mob and they tell us they don’t know where the suspect is. That is highly incompetent,” she said. A family member of Sizwe’s dead friend said: “We’ll deal with this issue after the burial of our daughter.” Police spokesman Kay Makhubele confirmed a case of culpable homicide was opened. “The Gauteng cops will look into the matter and contact the family with answers.”
