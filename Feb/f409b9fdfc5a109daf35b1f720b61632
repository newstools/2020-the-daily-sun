Former president Jacob Zuma's attorneys and his foundation
have cleared the air over his mooted attendance at this year's State of the
Nation Address, stating emphatically that he is overseas and will not be
attending. However, they remained mum on where he was. Parliament and the South African government's official
Twitter accounts on Wednesday tweeted "confirmation" that Zuma will
join former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe as guests at SONA on
Thursday evening. In a bizarre sequence of events, Parliament then backtracked
on the tweet, saying Zuma's attendance was still being verified. An update from
Parliament was expected later on Thursday. However, Zuma's lawyers stated that they have noted the
statement attributed to Parliament, in which it was claimed that Zuma would
attend SONA. "We do not know how and where Parliament obtained this
incorrect information," read the statement from Lugisani Mantsha Attorneys
Inc. "Our instructions remain that president Zuma is
currently receiving medical treatment in a foreign country and will therefore
not be attending the SONA." The statement didn't provide any details on which foreign
country Zuma is receiving medical attention in, and for which condition. Zuma's recent whereabouts and state of health has been a
topic of much public interest in recent days. This after Judge Dhaya Pillay of
the High Court in Pietermaritzburg last week issued a warrant of arrest for
Zuma after he failed to turn up for his court case, citing health concerns. The judge was not convinced by a sick note signed by a military
doctor and presented by his defence attorney. The warrant was stayed until May,
when Zuma was expected to appear in court. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zumas-lawyers-say-he-is-being-treated-abroad-parliament-apologises-for-sona-error-20200212
