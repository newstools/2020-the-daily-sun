WHEN the mall was built, they hoped it would bring money to their kasi. But now the people have shut down the mall. READ: NIGERIAN MAN HIT WITH A BRICK ON THE HEAD AND DIED! Small business owners rented shops at affordable prices but then the rent shot up, forcing them to pack up and leave. Yesterday, the Business Forum in Daveyton supported by Sanco, the Ekurhuleni Jobless Organisation closed down the Daveyton Mall, blocking shops from operating. They want mall management to give 30% share of their income to the community. Lally Skosana, chairwoman of the forum, said no shop would operate until Broll Properties management came to speak to them. “Small business owners end up leaving the mall because they can’t afford the rent. “We allowed them to build the mall so the economy of Daveyton could grow, but they’re killing our businesses,” she said. Protester Jones Phiri claimed the property managers were only taking from the community and not giving back anything. “We have so many poor families who struggle to bury their loved ones and when we go to the management to ask for donations, they turn us down,” he said. “They’re not doing enough to empower the youth in the area, while they get support from the residents.” READ: ‘CHEATING’ PASTOR WON’T GIVE UP ON EX Some shop workers said they were worried their jobs might be affected.
