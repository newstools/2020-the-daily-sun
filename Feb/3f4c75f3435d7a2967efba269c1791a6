An Australian mother has shared this video of her 9 year old son, Quaden, who wants to commit suicide because of bullying and it has gone viral on social media. Quaden was born with Achondroplasia dwarfism and in the video his mother is heard saying he is being bullied at school and taunted for his height. She also critiques anti-bullying campaigns and says most of the time her son feels suicidal and she has had to keep her eye on Quaden to ensure he doesn't hurt himself. With tears in his eyes he says, "I wish I could stab myself in my heart,” and “I want someone to kill me.” Social media users have been expressing their heartbreak and disgust at the bullies for taunting Quaden.
