KZN supporters of former president Jacob Zuma are planning a big bash to welcome him home from Cuba. Supporters initially planned to welcome him yesterday but had to postpone as Zuma was still in Joburg. Nkosentsha Shezi, one of his supporters, said after landing at OR Tambo Airport on Saturday, Zuma decided to go to his home in Forest Town, Joburg, to relax. He was expected back in KZN by the end of the week. Nkosentsha said as KZN forces for radical economic transformation, they wanted to organise a hero’s welcome. “Zuma is our own and will remain ours forever. Msholozi is us and we are him,” he said. Nkosentsha said the welcome bash would take place at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu, north of Durban. He said the rally was important as it was a way for the people of KZN to show Zuma they were still behind him. Zuma left South Africa last month to receive treatment for an undisclosed illness in Cuba. He was supposed to appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court at the beginning of the month for the start of his corruption trial. However, he submitted a sick note, which was dismissed as the dates were changed. Judge Dhaya Pillay issued a warrant of arrest for Zuma, which was stayed until 6 May when Zuma is expected to return to court.
