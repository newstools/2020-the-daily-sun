Her clothes
were found several meters away when she regained consciousness. The woman
reportedly found herself naked when she woke up on the side of the road. Reaction
Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram said the 27-year-old woman
was allegedly drugged and raped by three men at a house in Ndwedwe in KwaZulu
Natal. In a
statement, Balram said on Sunday the victim arrived at the Reaction Unit South
Africa Headquarters in Verulam and she detailed that she returned from Durban
shortly before midnight and was waiting for her transport at the Verulam Bus
Rank on her way to Cottonlands. According
to the statement, this is when three men in a white Toyota Tazz offered her a
lift. “Shortly
after getting into the vehicle she was offered an alcoholic beverage which she
consumed. “The woman
has little recollection of events that occurred after she consumed the drink
but remembers being taken to a home in Ndwedwe where she was raped and robbed
of her valuables,” Balram said. She was
reportedly later dumped on the side of the road. Balram said
the victim was helped by a passerby who drove her to RUSA offices where she was
assessed by paramedics before being transported to the Verulam SAPS to register
a criminal case.
