Former president Jacob Zuma has arrived in the county. He was in Cuba where he was receiving medical attention. He landed at OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni
where he received a warm welcome from the scores of his supporters who came to
the airport to welcome him. Before he arrived, the supporters sang struggle songs and
danced. When he finally arrived, he was met with much jubilation.

Zuma failed to appear in court earlier this month due to ill
health, but the Pietermaritzburg High Court disregarded his sick note and
issued a stayed warrant for his arrest if he fails to pitch for his next court
appearance. The former state’s man is facing charges of fraud,
corruption and money laundering.
