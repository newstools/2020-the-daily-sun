Former president Jacob Zuma has arrived in the county. He was in Cuba where he was receiving medical attention. He landed at OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni
where he received a warm welcome from the scores of his supporters who came to
the airport to welcome him. Before he arrived, the supporters sang struggle songs and
danced. When he finally arrived, he was met with much jubilation.  Singing continues as former president Jacob Zuma's supporters wait to welcome him at OR Tambo.#ZumaReturns#Zumahomecoming@dailysunsa @SundaySunSA pic.twitter.com/NEhVXph63o  He was accompanied by Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina. Msholozi got on stage to greet his supporters. He told them his health was very important and that he
wanted to be in good shape when he appears in court in May. Among those who came to support Zuma were former North West
premier and former ANC provincial chairperson Supra Mahumapelo, former Minister
of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen, Free State
provincial chairperson Sam Mashinini, uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans
(MKMVA) and their leader Kebby Maphatsoe, BLF with its leader Andile Mngxitama,
ANC NEC and former Zuma's cabinet ministers Joe Maswanganyi and Bongani Bongo,
ANC MP Mervyn Dicks and ANC Youth League Free State provincial secretary Reagan
Booysen.  Mahumapelo said whoever touched Zuma touched them. “We will defend Zuma with all we got,” he said. Zuma failed to appear in court earlier this month due to ill
health, but the Pietermaritzburg High Court disregarded his sick note and
issued a stayed warrant for his arrest if he fails to pitch for his next court
appearance. The former state’s man is facing charges of fraud,
corruption and money laundering.
