HEALTH workers are racing against a number of challenges to halt the spread of the world’s worst outbreak of measles afflicting the Democratic Republic of the Congo. More than 6 000 people have died over the past year alone, with three quarters of fatalities being children. Over 310 000 people have been infected. The outbreak has affected all 26 provinces of the volatile country that is experiencing a myriad of illnesses. Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian medical nongovernmental organisation, is battling to control the surge in the province of Kongo Central, one of the main hotspots of the epidemic today. The region is enduring complex health issues. “Some of the main challenges we face are the complications linked with associated diseases such as malaria or malnutrition,” said the organisation. It said these issues increased the risk of mortality. Gaining access to remote hard-to-reach areas is also a risk owing to the insecurity posed by armed groups involved in skirmishes with the national army. At least 424 attacks on healthcare occurred in the DRC between January and November last year, according to Insecurity Insight. The outbreak has turned into the biggest measles outbreak of the past 10 years. It comes at a time the country is also experiencing an outbreak of Ebola, which has killed over 2 000 people since August 2018. – CAJ NEWS
