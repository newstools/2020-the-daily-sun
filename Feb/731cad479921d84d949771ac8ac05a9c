THE boy is only 10 and shouldn’t have stayed out until 10pm. When he got home, he was hacked with a panga by his mum! His life was saved when a neighbour apparently heard his cries and broke down the door, to find the angry mum hacking the boy. Neighbour Gezani Ngoveni (35) told Daily Sun they were still shocked at the anger displayed by the woman. BRA VAN MEI POKES MY MUM! The child has a cut on his forehead and shoulders, and was discharged after four days in the high care section of Nkhensani Hospital in Giyani, Limpopo, on Wednesday morning. He’s now in the care of local social workers as the mum is a single parent and nobody is available to look after the child. Neighbour Hlekani Mathevula (19), who saved the child, said the mum behaved like this when she had been drinking. “I heard the child begging for help. I ran to the house because I knew when she is drunk, the child becomes her punching bag. POOR parents are marrying off their kids to wealthier families who have food “This is not the first time. She previously assaulted him with a hammer and the child had to be rescued. We alerted the police about her behaviour and how she constantly neglects the child.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the 29-year-old mum was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She appeared in the Giyani Magistrates Court on Tuesday. “The mother will appear again in the same court on Monday for a formal bail hearing,” Ngoepe said.
