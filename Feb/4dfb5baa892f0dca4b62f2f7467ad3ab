HE escaped death in a shack fire, but his injuries stopped him from reaching his dream of being a sound engineer. But Good Samaritans have come to Siyabonga Nonkumbi’s rescue. He was two years old when he got burnt. The 28-year-old from Olievenboutbosh in Centurion told Daily Sun his mum was cooking and had left to fetch water when the fire started. “My late gogo said when my mum returned she saw people trying to put out the fire with no success. People looked for me in the house, but no one could find me.” He said his dad rushed from work and risked his life to save him. He was taken to hospital. “My whole body was burnt. My hands were badly damaged and I spent over four years in hospitals.” Siyabonga’s sister Maria (47) said his nightmare started when he had to go to school after the ordeal. “It was difficult for him because kids always made fun of his looks after he was burnt. “He dropped out in grade 9 and it was sad.” Children of Fire, which supports fire victims, helped Siyabonga get surgery for his hand in 2008. Founder Bronwen Jones said he’ll have another operation next Friday.“It’s to be done by Dr Grant Biddulph, a hand surgeon at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. We hope Siya’s agility will improve.
