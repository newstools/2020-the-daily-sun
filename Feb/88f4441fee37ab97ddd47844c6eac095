EVENTS organiser and Gesh Lounge and Entertainment owner Bhekani Ndlovu is hopping mad! Bhekani has accused Mhlo Gumede, singer Kelly Khumalo’s brother-in-law, of using the Khumalo siblings to swindle people.

I never queried this because my understanding was that they were working as a team. I then started making payments into Zandi’s bank account. “I realised something was wrong when Mhlo told me not to post anything about the event. “I then asked someone to check with Kelly if she was aware of this event. To my surprise, Kelly had no knowledge of it,” he said.
