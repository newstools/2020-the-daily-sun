IT all happened in full view of two police officers. In a video that has gone viral, the two cops can be seen trying to separate the two Nigerian men – one wearing a white vest and the other a black T-shirt. As the cops try to do this, the man wearing a black T-shirt gets a chance and runs towards the other man, he then grabs a brick and throws it at the head of the man wearing a white vest. The incident happened on Monday evening. It’s reported that the man died 24 hours later in a Kempton Park hospital. In the video, after the suspect hit the other with a brick, the deceased’s friend can be seen attacking the suspect. The suspect was then reportedly rescued from the crowd and arrested. IOL reported that the suspect is expected to appear in court soon.
