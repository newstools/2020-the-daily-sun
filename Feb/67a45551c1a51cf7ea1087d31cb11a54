What happens in Venda stays in Venda! These are the words of Cavin Johnson as he reflects on his short stint with Limpopo side Black Leopards. Johnson has confirmed he parted ways with Lidoda Duvha and he is not on suspension, as the club claimed. According to Leopards, an investigation is underway to probe the team’s poor performances under Johnson’s guidance. But it would appear the club intentionally misled the football public to deliberately tarnish the image of their former coach. “I’m not on suspension. I was not fired. I quit,” insisted Johnson. “I’m not aware of any investigation. We parted ways amicably. “I may sound cynical. But no don’t harbour resentment towards the club. What happens in Venda stays in Venda.” But he admitted the conditions were not conducive for positive results. Said Johnson: “You cannot measure the amount of pressure the team was under. “I think that is totally unrealistic for anybody to expect anything from a team in that position.” Johnson spent two days in hospital after he suffered a heart attack. “I thank God for the second chance after the slight heart attack, probably because of the last two weeks I’ve been through. At the moment, I’m available, sitting at home, relaxing according to doctor’s orders.”
