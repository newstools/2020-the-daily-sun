KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has given Itumeleng Khune's fans hope that he will consider selecting him for the Soweto derby on Saturday. Last week Middendorp said that Khune will play for Chiefs in the Nedbank Cup‚ as he did on Saturday when they lost to Highlands Park on penalties in the last-16 of the tournament and Daniel Akpeyi will remain in goal in the league. Akpeyi has been key for Chiefs’ league lead. However, he made a mistake which coasted Chiefs a goal in a 2-1 defeat against Maritzburg United. There has been pressure from the fans as they want Khune who recently recovered from a long-term injury back in the posts.With the Soweto derby coming, fans have urged the German tactician to restore the Bafana Bafana international as the first choice. On Thursday in a Soweto derby press conference, Middendorp responded to the calls to select Khune by acknowledging that he understands the fans' passion and that there is a possibility that he could play against Pirates. “I absolutely respect opinions there’s no doubt,” Middendorp said. “I absolutely put into a process of decision making, but it’s always where we have competence in our technical team to see what the solution is. I understand certain emotional attachment into a certain type of players. I understand and really respect that. "Absolutely, we put it always in the process of decision-making, but it's something where we have competence in our technical team really, to see what's the best solution. “But what must I say? I understand and I really respect it, and probably (Khune) will be on the field, why not? He's an option." Quizzed whether he has decided who will play, he added: "No, no, no. Today is Thursday. "It is a very tough decision, and each and everybody should respect the decision [that gets made] in the end, and that's it."
