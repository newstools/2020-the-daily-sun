COPS in Mecklenburg outside Burgersfort have launched a
manhunt for a 52-year-old suspect who allegedly killed his four children in
ga-Pasha village. The bodies of the children were found at two different
spots in the area. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo
said the suspect allegedly informed a neighbor on Tuesday morning about the
murders and also told to him the places where the bodies were. The police were then informed and on arrival, the
lifeless bodies of three children aged 9, 7 and 5 were found in the nearby
bushes while the body of a 3-year-old was found next to the local mountain - about
3 kilometers from the first scene. He said preliminary police investigations indicate that
the suspect stopped the vehicle transporting the kids from school on Monday
afternoon, at about 15h30. The driver, who apparently knows the father, stopped and
let the kids go with their father. Three of the children were found with stab wounds. The
youngest was found with open wounds. The children were identified as follows 9-year old boy Katlego
Pasha, 7-year-old girl Joyce Pasha, 5-year-old girl Tshepo Phasha, and 3-year-old
boy Adel Phasha. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police
Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, who also visited the
scene has condemned this incident in the strongest possible terms, more so as
it was allegedly perpetrated by someone who was supposed to protect these
victims. Mojapelo said the motive for this brutal murder is not
known at this stage. Four counts murder have been opened and Police
investigations are continuing. Anyone with information is requested to contact
Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Mohlala at 0824143070, or the Crime Stop Number 0860010111.
