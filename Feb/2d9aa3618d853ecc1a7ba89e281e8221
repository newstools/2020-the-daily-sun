Dirontsho said: “I met this client in 2018. He took me to a B&B and played with my boobs for about 30 minutes. “Then he gave me R200. He didn’t like poking. He couldn’t get it up.” He told her he tried to drink imbiza and went to sangomas, who told him a girlfriend locked his 4-5. She said he now he comes every day. “He takes me to the guest house and I strip. He looks at my punani and fondles and licks my boobs until he’s happy.” She’s stopped selling her punani. “I focus on my special client.” Dirontsho arranged a meeting with the client (34), who said: “The women I dated in past years complained about my sleeping 4-5, so I decided to visit magoshas.” He said the 30 minutes spent with Dirontsho gave him satisfaction. “I’m a successful businessman and want to feel in control.” Another magosha said: “I make R300 from two special clients.” Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane from Botshabelo said Dirontsho’s special client may have been bewitched.
