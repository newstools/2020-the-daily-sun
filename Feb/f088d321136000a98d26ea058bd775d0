MISSING GRADE 8 pupil LINDOKUHLE Masuku has been found! His father Mthandeni (43) received a call yesterday morning from a security guard at Maponya Mall, informing him his son had been found. Lindokuhle was believed to have been snatched outside Queen’s High School in Bezuidenhout Valley, Joburg, on Monday. The family rushed to the shopping complex, where they found their 14-year-old son. The visibly weak and tired pupil, still in his uniform, was taken to hospital for examination. The family said Lindokuhle was seen on school cameras getting into a cab. Mthandeni told Daily Sun he was with Lindokuhle’s mum Portia Hlatshwayo at their home in Meadowlands, Soweto, when they received the call that he was at the mall, and they rushed there. “I am just happy he was found alive. We are glad cops were hands- on with this case,” he said. “They have helped us to get information. What happened was really hurtful and traumatic. “No parent should go through what we had to go through,” he said. Portia said whatever happened now was in the hands of the cops. “We are grateful to people who were with us and our friends who supported us,” she said. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the details remained sketchy but he confirmed Lindokuhle was found. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed Lindokuhle was found unharmed. “Preliminary investigations are under way. No suspects have been arrested yet,” he said. “It is really concerning that our pupils are targeted at schools,” said Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. “We appeal to community members who can assist with necessary information to share it with the police, so these criminals can be caught.”
