SHE woke up at 3am to pray, but Dorah Mokudubete didn’t know it would save her life. Soon after she finished her prayers on Saturday morning, her bedroom window shattered and her dresser was blasted into pieces! Gogo Dorah from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, thought she was about to die. An ATM nearby had been bombed. “I jumped from the bed to lie on the floor as the second blast shook the house. I thought the wall was going to collapse on us,” she said. The gogo said her daughter Maphefo, who’s living with a disability, tried to get out of the house as she was confused.  “My elder daughter Mapaseka stopped her just in time. The thugs might have shot her as our house isn’t far from the ATM. I now thank God for sparing our lives.” Mapaseka (42) told Daily Sun: “This was the third time, and each time it’s worse. We were happy before the ATM got erected here. “We’re living in fear. For as long as this ATM is here, we’re not going to be free.” Three more houses were damaged by the explosion. The owners said the bank would fix the windows. The SunTeam spoke to a bank official, who said a security team would take care of the damage. Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu of Tsakane police said the blast happened at about 3am and an undisclosed amount of money was taken. No arrests had been made yet.
