NTOMBOMZI Mafaya fears for her life after her shack was destroyed on Tuesday. The 53-year-old street committee chairwoman from Qandu Qandu squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, said it was demolished by people who wanted her to quit. She was at work when she received a call about the incident. “I never thought they’d do this to me. I’m working hard to build my home and they destroyed it. “Where will I get money to buy the material?” Ntombomzi said she had opened a case. “I won’t let this go. I want justice. They must pay every cent I spent building that shack.” She said she spoke to other committee members and they agreed she could build in the space. Committee member Pumela Keya (43) said they were shocked about what happened to Ntombomzi’s shack. “This is confusing. We allowed her to build in that space, but some people decided to destroy her shack. We are confused,” she said. “I think the best way is to let the law take its course.” Constable Siyabulela Malo said a case of malicious damage to property was opened after the complainant, who lives in Qandu Qandu, was called and informed that her informal structure was destroyed. “The circumstances surrounding this matter are being investigated and arrests are yet to be effected. Our detectives are following up all possible leads to find the perpetrators,” Malo said.
