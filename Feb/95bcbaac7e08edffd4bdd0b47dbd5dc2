NATIONAL police commissioner General Khehla Sitole on Wednesday told parliament’s portfolio committee on police that squatter camps posed a risk to citizens. He said they were being built in dangerous areas and obstructing the police. “Most of the informal settlements are now on top of pipelines and you know pipelines carry gas, petrol, diesel and water,” he said. “There was a recent arrest where people were trying to open a valve and gas was about to come out. If they were not arrested before that happened, I’m sure that informal settlement would be in ashes now.” He said the design of these kasis made it difficult for cops to do their jobs freely.  “On the environmental design, I just needed to point out to the committee that it is rapidly deteriorating and it’s going at a fast rate,” he said. “A number of members have been killed through environmental design. I want to give the example of Alexandra. The houses are on the pavement. If a case is reported, a police van will stop behind a taxi as the vehicles can’t pass each other. It means the taxi must finish loading before the vehicle can pass and attend to the complaint.” Sitole said municipalities were responsible for fixing the problem.
