The two children were discovered by an elder brother. He became worried when he could not see them for a while. The children were later found dead in a Kasi swimming. Two girls, Angel Langanani (3), Shandukani Never (4), a 4-year-old
boy Vhutali Ramovha were discovered later in the day outside Makhado, with
their bodies floating in a pool. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the children were playing when
they wandered off and gained entrance to the premises unnoticed and advanced to
a swimming pool. "They were discovered by an elder brother who was concerned
when he could not see them and went to look for them. He made this horrific
discovery of the three children unconsciously floating in the swimming pool,
where he alerted the parents before they could be rushed to a nearby clinic
where they were certified dead," Mojapelo said. One family member said that they are still in pain and seeking
help to bury their dead children. "We need help to bury these kids but talking about it in the
media it will not help us heal the pain. â€œAs families we took a decision not to speak about the matter with
any media house until we have buried the children," she said.
