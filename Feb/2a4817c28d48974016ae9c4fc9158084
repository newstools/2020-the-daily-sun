It's goodbye to toilet comfort breaks as the new employee toilet designs are said to decrease prolonged toilet breaks. The new downward-tilting toilets are designed to become unbearable to sit on after five minutes. They say the main benefit is improved employee productivity. The new toilet seat which was conceived by consulting engineer Mahabir Gill, has been designed to slope at a downwards angle of 13 degrees so that the person who is sitting on it has to use their leg muscles to stay firmly in place.  BTA's website explains that the horizontal seating surface of typical toilet seats “enables a user to sit relatively comfortably on the toilet”, which can result in them spending “longer than necessary sitting on the toilet without short-term discomfort”.
