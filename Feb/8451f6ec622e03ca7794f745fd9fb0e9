I injured my leg, but they kept dragging me.” She said they took her to a storeroom, where she was kept for about two hours. “Everyone was looking at me. Some even took videos. I asked them what I’d done and they said I stole R21 000 from a customer. I told them I had no idea what they were talking about.” She said they later realised they had the wrong person and released her, but didn’t apologise.
