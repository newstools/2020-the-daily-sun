THREE zama zamas were arrested over the weekend! This after the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation, the West Rand Tactical Response Team and Eskom followed up on information about an alleged gold processing refinery in Zuurbekom, west of Joburg. Hawks spokesman Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the team had been observing activities at the plot for a while. “After being certain of what’s going on, the team interrupted the illegal operation and found five well-developed manufacturing operations on the plot.” Mulamu said not only were the suspects operating illegally, they were also stealing electricity from Eskom to sustain their operations. “Two of the suspects who were found processing the gold were arrested. The plot owner was also arrested for giving people who were doing criminal activities space on his premises,” Mulamu said. He said the team seized 30 tonnes of gold-bearing material, four gas cylinders and mercury all worth about R5 million. The three men are expected to appear in the Westonaria Magistrates Court soon.
