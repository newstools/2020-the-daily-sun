Mondli Phungula (38) allegedly received a phone call from his friends inviting him to come to their place. Mondli left his home and drove off to KwaNdayo in KwaZulu-Natal where his friends where. According to police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala his family became concerned when he was not found in his room the following day. The family then contacted his friends who claimed to have not seen him. “They began a search for their son, but he was nowhere to be found and his vehicle was also missing. “The matter was reported to Esikhaleni police and a missing persons docket was opened,” Gwala said. Cops were reportedly suspicious after questioning the three friends and kept an eye on them. On Tuesday morning one of Phungula’s friends was seen driving his car in Gobandlovu and police went to the friend’s house, where the car was found parked in the yard. When the friend was confronted, he allegedly admitted to being involved in Phungula's disappearance. In a statement Gwala said the 23-year-old man told the police that on the day of the incident he and his two friends set a trap for him. “They dragged him into the bushes before they assaulted and stabbed him multiple times in the chest. They drove to Esikhaleni beach where they buried his body. “On Tuesday night the suspect led Esikhaleni police to the beach where Mondli’s body was recovered." The police arrested three suspects at KwaNdaya Reserve and Nseleni for murder. “They were also found in possession of the victim's belongings,” Gwala said.
