TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday told parliament’s portfolio committee on transport Prasa’s administrator was appointed based on experience. He was answering questions from MPs who alleged Mbalula had fired Prasa’s interim board because it had refused to appoint Bongisizwe Mpondo as CEO. Mbalula appointed Mpondo as Prasa’s administrator after axing the interim board. “When I look at Mpondo, I look at experience and somebody who has the capabilities of understanding the rail network,” he said. The minister said he could have just fired the board and replaced it with another. He said appointing an administrator was the only way to deal with challenges at Prasa. Mbalula said infighting among ministers, boards and managers led to Prasa having four boards in one year. “My point as the minister is not to drag things out. I have no malice in the decisions I have taken and history will absolve me,” he said. “I’m informed by the state of the entity. I’m informed by the inaptitude, by rogueness. I’m informed by the place that has totally collapsed, which I characterised as a broken place.” NGO #UnitedBehind recently took Mbalula to court over Mpondo’s appointment, which it wants overturned. The organisation’s Zackie Achmat wants a new board appointed within three months. Mbalula told MPs the situation didn’t allow for another board. “I’ve never said I’ll not appoint a board at Prasa. In fact, I’m going to appoint it. It’s going to be transparent but there has to be stability.”
