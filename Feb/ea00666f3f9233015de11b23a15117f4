ARMED robbers who stole hundreds of toilet rolls were being hunted by police yesterday in a city wracked by severe shortages caused by coronavirus panic-buying. Toilet rolls have become hot property in Hong Kong, despite the government’s assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus. Supermarkets are unable to restock quickly enough, leading to lengthy queues and shelves being stripped bare within moments of opening. There has also been a run on staples like rice and pasta, as well as hand sanitisers and other cleaning items.  Police said a truck driver was held up by three men outside a supermarket in Mong Kok, a working class district with a history of organised crime gangs, early yesterday. “A delivery man was threatened by three knife-wielding men who took toilet paper worth more than $130 (about R2 000),” a police spokesman said. TV footage showed police investigators standing around crates of toilet rolls outside a Wellcome supermarket. The hysteria that has swept through the densely populated business hub since the coronavirus outbreak on mainland China is partly fuelled by the city’s tragic recent history of confronting a deadly disease. In 2003, about 200 Hong Kong residents died following the SARS outbreak. The outbreak, on the mainland, was initially covered up by Beijing, a decision that left a lasting legacy of distrust towards the authorities on public health issues. – REUTERS
