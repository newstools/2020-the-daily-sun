Capitec was ranked the third strongest banking brand in the world in Brand Finance's 2020 Global 500 Banking report. The bank was also ranked as having the strongest banking brand in Mzansi. The brand has undeniably done well in the South African market and it is giving competitors a run for their money in the banking sector in terms of assets and customer numbers. The published report also ranks the top 10 strongest banking brands globally, which for the first time includes two banks from South Africa. Entering the global top 10 is also FNB, which is ranked fourth overall, up from 11th in 2019. South Africa’s big banks fared poorly over the last year, all dropping down the rankings – while WesBank dropped out of the top 500 entirely.
