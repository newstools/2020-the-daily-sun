VETERAN Moses Spandeel wants to finish his career on a high. The former Bloemfontein Celtic speedster is determined to inspire lowly Hungry Lions to do the unthinkable in the Nedbank Cup. Spandeel, who turns 40 this year, has been a key member of the Lions’ team for the past four years. Now his plan is to end of the season with a bang when he finally hangs up his boots. But for now, Spandeel will carry the hopes of the ABC Motsepe League outfit in their last 32 encounter with Jomo Cosmos at Olen Park, in Potchefstroom this afternoon (3pm). Said Spandeel: “I told the guys this is my last season, so I want to make it special. For the team to reach this stage has been a great experience. “Hopefully, we’ll go through to the next round, and that would be marvellous. We haven’t had a team from the Northern Cape reach this stage in a long time. “The boys are eager to showcase their skills at a higher level. We’re not worried about being called underdogs. We’re used to it. “A few years ago, they told us in the ABC Motsepe League play-offs that we would be the whipping boys. We almost went through and I was the top goalscorer there as the oldest player.” Spandeel, who doesn’t have many happy memories in the Ke Yona during his time with Celtic, would like to change that. The speed merchant from the North West hopes to come against his former team Siwelele at some point during the competition. He made 128 appearances for Celtic, scoring 21 goals and providing 14 assists during his time in the Free State. “We were always unlucky with Celtic in this competition. We didn’t progress all the time. The last 16 was probably the furthest we got, but you never know what could happen this time around. “If we win this match against Cosmos, we might get Celtic in Bloemfontein. But we’ll see what happens.”
