Jazz maestro Nduduzo Makhathini channels his healing gift through his music. The singer and pianist mixes his gift as a trained sangoma with his music talent. This has made him realise there’s a kind of discipline that comes with making music which helps awaken people’s spirituality. His single, Beneath the Earth, which was released on Friday, features singer Msaki, who also co-wrote the song. It comes from Nduduzo’s upcoming album, Modes of Communication: Letters from the Underworlds. “This song is a way of vocalising an alternative or more Pan African way of communicating with other notions of God. “With the colonial system, we were only told about Christianity and to look to the sky when we were praising God. “Africans have always referenced the ground as their way of connecting with the spiritual realm.” He told SunBuzz the song spoke about seeking guidance from the ancestors. He said not having a certain language to speak to them created a barrier. “In essence, there’s a particular language that we need to use and understand to be able to speak to God. “I was a Christian for most of my life and only knew of one way to communicate with God until I became curious and started to question things. That’s when I realised I had missed out on a lot of things,” he said. “The song is also based on the musical style amahubo. It’s an art form based on Zulu praise songs, or hymns.” Nduduzo, whose calling is reflected in most of his music, said he wanted everyone who would be listening to the song to learn that other ideas of communicating with the ancestors had to be in their daily conversations. “There’s a lot of unlearning we need to do. “And as someone who started playing jazz very late, I had always been looking for a way of playing that would mirror the way my ancestors danced, sung, and spoke.” He said he achieved that by tuning his piano.
