When men marry women who have children from previous relationships, they often promise to treat those kids as their own. But in most cases it doesn’t happen that way. Many stepfathers only keep their promise until they bear their own kids with the women. They start to sideline their stepkids and redirect their love, care and support to their biological children. I feel for the kids who are abandoned by their biological fathers, only to go on and be raised by abusive stepdads. While I salute those stepfathers who are doing a great job in raising their stepchildren, I’d like to urge abusive dads to stop their evil ways and become good fathers to those innocent kids. Some of these stepfathers have children from previous relationships that they have abandoned. Obviously, they wouldn’t want their kids to be treated badly by their stepfathers. When a man abandons his kid, another comes in to play a fatherly role to that child. So, when you raise a stepchild, do so with a good heart. Biological children and stepchildren must be treated the same. I am, however, disappointed by stepchildren who, when they are grown up and after being raised well by their stepfathers, begin to isolate themselves from the family and start looking for their biological fathers. Stepparents and stepchildren must love and respect one another, just as the biological fathers and children do.
