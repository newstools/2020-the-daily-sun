GATVOL residents of ward 12 in Jozini, northern KZN, took their frustrations to the streets. They closed off several roads in a protest for water, starting on Tuesday. But they stopped the protest on Friday as Umkhanyakude Mayor Solomon Mkhombo promised them the matter would be resolved. One of the protest organisers, George Tembe (52), said they had been living without clean water since 2017. “What angers us is that we live right next to Jozini Dam, which supplies water to faraway areas such as Nongoma and Hlabisa. “We ask ourselves how come such a huge dam fails to supply us with clean water but manages to supply faraway areas.” He said they were forced to drink the same water as livestock. “This is not our first protest. We protested in 2017 and a water pipe was installed. “Our hopes were raised as we thought our water challenge was coming to an end, but little did we know we were fooling ourselves,” he said. George said the municipality was well aware of the problem and officials promised to resolve it. “But that didn’t happen. We were not even supplied with water tankers,” said George. Mayor Mkhombo said the dam should supply all residents with water. “But we still have a challenge of putting in place all the needed infrastructure because it costs millions. “We’re working on it as there are other places where the water supply is up and running. “We ask people in ward 12 to bear with us while we work on their water supply. I promise we will be talking a different story in April.”
