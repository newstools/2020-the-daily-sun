Three
KwaZulu-Natal police officers and two Folweni police station staffers went
above and beyond the call of duty to help deliver a baby on Wednesday. KZN police
spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said that a woman in her 20s arrived at
the police station while she was in labour, desperately seeking help. "The
members could see that the baby was coming but there was no doctor who could
assist her to deliver the baby," Mbhele said. At around
07:00, the station commander tried to arrange a van to take her to a nearby
hospital, but it was too late. Mrs Shezi,
a former midwife who lives close to the station, was called instead. "There
were three officers, Captain Muthwa, Constables Madlala and Ndlovu as well as
two other staff members from the police station gathered to help with the
delivery," said Mbele. The
ambulance arrived after the mother gave birth to a baby boy. "They
were both transported to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital to check if
everything was okay with the baby," Mbhele added. SOURCE:
