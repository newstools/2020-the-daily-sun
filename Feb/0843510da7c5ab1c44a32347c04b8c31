MEMBERS of the PAC commemorated and honoured their founding president Robert Sobukwe, who died on 27 February 1978. The members from the Gerald Kondlo region in Tshwane spent the weekend teaching people in Robert Sobukwe Street in Sunnyside, Tshwane, the history of the man and the party. They told Daily Sun Sobukwe wanted to unite Africans. PAC member Victor Serakalala (48) said they remembered their struggle icon every year. He said this year they decided to remember and honour him on the street which was named after him. “His contribution to the struggle for the liberation of African people is immense,” he said. “We are informing people who walk around the street and residents of Sunnyside about the late struggle icon. “We are also lecturing them about Sobukwe.” The PAC members described the founding leader as humble and a man who valued humanity. They said he always wanted to build a caring society. They also said they were preparing for a PAC provincial event at the Orlando Communal Hall in Soweto, on Saturday, where the party was founded.
