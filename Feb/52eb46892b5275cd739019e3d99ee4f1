MUSA Mseleku’s show Mnakwethu has once again come under fire on social media. This comes after this week’s episode, where Musa accompanied maskandi artist Dulas Magubane when he told his wife he wanted to make his nyatsi his second wife. Facebook group Ladies House was particularly outraged, with members saying Dulas and his nyatsi were very disrespectful to his wife. MY WIFE HATES MY WIFE! Ahead of the meeting, Dulas said the first wife would have to agree to his request to take another wife because he had paid lobola for her and she should give in to his demands. The nyatsi said Dulas was hers as well, whether the wife liked it or not. Members of Ladies House were outraged, and more than 2 100 commented, most of them saying the show should be cancelled. Speaking to Daily Sun, group moderator Nokuthula Mhlongo said: “What I can say is that everyone has their own opinion. “It doesn’t mean all the members are against polygamy. Any member says what she feels at that time.” BRA VAN MEI POKES MY MUM! Musa said cancelling the show wouldn’t make a difference. “The show represents what happens out there. “Shutting it down will not help society. What is needed now is constructive criticism,” he said. “It shocks me that women want to live a lie, holding hands with their husbands while people gossip and say if only they knew the truth.” M-Net’s Philly Kubheka said: “Mnakwethu aims to evoke and not provoke emotions by illustrating societal norms that reflect the dynamics that come with marriages and mistresses. “As Mzansi Magic, we are a platform that provides compelling content that drives conversations that are informative, empowering and raises awareness.”
