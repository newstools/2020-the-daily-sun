President Cyril Ramaphosa said during his State of the Nation
Address that unemployment among young people in South Africa has reached a
crisis level. He told the joint sitting of MPs that his government has
plans to turn around the situation for young people. "We are confronted by the crisis of youth
unemployment. Of the 1.2 million young people who enter the labour market each
year, approximately two thirds remain outside of employment, education or
training.  More than half of all young
people are unemployed. We need to make this country work for young people, so
that they can work for our country," said Ramaphosa. He said the solutions to the problem for everyone to be involved
in creating employment and to have young people create their own jobs. Ramaphosa said they have a Presidential Youth Employment
Intervention which has six priority actions over the next five years to reduce
youth unemployment. "We are building cutting-edge solutions to reach
young people where they are – online, on the phone and in person. This will
allow them to receive active support, information and work readiness training
to increase their employability and match themselves to opportunities,"
said Ramaphosa. He added that there is another interventions includes as
part of this intervention includes providing grant funding and business support
to 1,000 young entrepreneurs in the next 100 days "starting today."
Ramaphosa said there are plans that are set to target and empower women in
business. "Over the next five years, the Industrial
Development Corporation is targeting R10 billion of own and partner funding for
women empowered businesses.  To create a
larger market for small businesses, we plan to designate 1,000 locally produced
products that must be procured from SMMEs," he added.
