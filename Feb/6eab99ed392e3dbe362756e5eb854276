THE big mkhaba will soon be history for Free State cops! Well, it will be if Rampolokeng “Boxer” Mkutshane from the Defence Force’s 44 Parachute Regiment has his way. Free State traffic cops, police, correctional services and other law enforcers attended a training session at Lengau Traffic Department in Mangaung under the leadership of Rampolokeng. Boxer said the #MkhabaMustFall targeted officers who worked with the public. “I started being a gym instructor for government employees in 2013 at the army base in Bloemfontein,” he told Daily Sun. “Top officials joined in and that made it easier for the lower ranks to follow.” He said he started with about 60 members but now there were hundreds coming to the outdoor gym, equipped with Rampolokeng’s equipment. “We use the traffic department because it is central,” said Rampolokeng.  “We’re helping those who want to burn fat and gain muscle.” He thanked principal inspector Masithela Phandliwe and chief Oupa Motshabi. Cops said they each paid him R150 per month for his time to fight the mkhaba, but Rampolokeng said he used the money to buy more equipment. “Together we’re proving that nothing is impossible,” he said. A cop said the project started last month and the mission was to learn to be mentally strong and physically prepared. “The big bellies are not helping us.  She said she used to weigh 103kg but now she was at 96kg, and her husband was happy. Another cop said: “I used to be tired all the time, but now I’m more flexible. I feel like there’s no thug who can outrun me.” The gym starts daily at 5.30pm until 7pm from Monday to Thursday, and the public is welcome to join in. Traffic chief director George Ramotsoto said he approved of the gym. “It’s good for the members to keep fit. It also helps to reduce stress,” he said.
