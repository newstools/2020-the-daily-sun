Season 15 Idols winner Yanga Sobetwa is over the moon after buying her family a brand new home. The 18-year-old singer took to her Instagram account to share with her more than 350 000 followers the good news. In the post, she said she was still in disbelief and thanked her parents for helping her take "wise decisions". At the time of her winning the competition, Yanga hadn't finished her matric, because of her hectic work schedule, but she said she will do so this year. An excited Yanga wrote: "It’s another GOOD MORNING for the Young-lights. I finally purchased a property for my family and I, God is Good man!!! I write this in disbelief thank you to my parents who helped me take wise decisions and for your prayers and support. I’m about to go on in Port Elizabeth, finishing my matric ????, have a car, have an album, ngi julis’ ukubonga kuwe, this is me thanking God for everything he’s done for me and everything I’ve wanted to achieve before the age of 20, not bragging but showing people that God can do it for you too."
