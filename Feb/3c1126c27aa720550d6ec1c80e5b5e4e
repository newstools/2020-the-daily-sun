RESIDENTS of Ladysmith took to the streets on Wednesday, demanding the mayor of Alfred Duma Municipality resign. Residents of the KZN Midlands town earlier this month marched and accused Mayor Vincent Madlala of corruption and blocking development. Residents said they took to the streets again because nothing happened after they handed over the memorandum. They gave the municipality seven days to respond and urged the premier to intervene. Nkosinathi Mthethwa said he was tired of corruption. “Our town is very dirty and there is no development,” Nkosinathi told the People’s Paper. “We are tired. We are rooting out corruption.  The mayor must step down. We don’t need him.” Abantu Batho Congress leader Philani Mavundla said his organisation often complained about poor service delivery. Contacted for comment, Madlala refused to comment and referred the SunTeam to municipal spokesman  Siyabonga Maphalala. Maphalala didn’t answer his phone or respond to text messages Daily Sun sent him. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that residents of Ladysmith embarked on a protest on Wednesday. She said they closed off the Murchison highway with minibus taxis and rocks.
