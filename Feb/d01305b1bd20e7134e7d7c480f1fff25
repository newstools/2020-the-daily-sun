THE PAN South African Language Board launched the campaign for Language Activism Month in Tshwane yesterday. Acting CEO, David Maahlamela, said the campaign would be centred on International Mother Language Day. He said as the country celebrated its multilingualism, it was important to reflect on all the country’s official languages. He said the domination of English posed a great threat to many languages. “We ought to be deliberate in our efforts to effectively decolonise indigenous languages,” he said.  Maahlamela said he hoped through the campaign, South Africans would acknowledge the importance of preserving African languages. He said South Africans could participate in the campaign by speaking their languages, reading books written in their mother tongue and posting their activities on their social media sites using the hashtag #SpeakItLiveIt. He said their language activism campaign would end on 28 February and finish off with handing over indigenous language dictionaries to King Goodwill Zwelithini at KwaNongoma in KZN. “Various activities will be held throughout the month, such as the HHP Jabulani Tsambo memorial lecture on 18 February. A book fair will be held on 20 February in Mahikeng, North West, and the International Mother Language Day celebration, which will be held on 21 February in KZN,” he said.
