Vaal University of Technology coach, Standford Nkoane, has fired the first salvo at his counterpart Steve Komphela. Nkoane, who is hoping to make history with his VUT outfit in the Nedbank Cup, has fired a warning to opponents Golden Arrows ahead of their last 32 clash this weekend. The match will take place at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The minnows, VUT, may be making their debut in the Ke Yona Cup, however, they are not short of confidence. In fact, their mentor Nkoane said even Arrows coach Komphela’s “Big English” won’t help him to overcome them. "Komphela is a good coach, I may not be in his class, but his big English won’t win him the game," said Noane. "I will speak my Tsonga and we will see who will come out top. He is a good coach, but also a beatable coach. “The PSL teams are an open book to us. I watched a couple of Arrows games and identified areas we could hurt them. If they undermine us, they will see a problem."
