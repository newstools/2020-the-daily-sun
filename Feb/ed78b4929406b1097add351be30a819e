MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has given his reaction to the Nedbank Cup quarter final draw. Mosomane's Brazillians were pitted against Highlands Park in the last 8 of the competition. The Downs mentor know how difficult a task it will be to get past the "tough" Lions of the North who eliminated Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the last 16. "It's always going to be a difficult game, you know Highlands are a tough team, hard tackling team," said Mosimane. "You need to be in good physical condition and shape to play agaist them. You don't need to go 120 minutes with Highlands, they are a tough team especially at home. That's not a nice place to go because not too many people come out with a victory there. "But that's the draw, you have to accept.Â If Tembisa is an easy place to go then why are many teams not coming back from that place? They are a strong team, they just won a big game in the Nedbank Cup on penalties." Mosimane is crossing fingers that the schedule is kind to his side heading into the clash as he expects a greulling encounter against a notorously tough opponent. Downs are currently in Egypt ahead of their Caf Champions League quarter final first leg against Al Ahly in Cairo on Saturday. They are also involved in a heated Absa Premerhip title race with Soweto giants Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. "We need to be mentally ready more than anything to win the game, they have very good players like (Peter) Shalulile and (Lindokuhle) Mbatha who are on form," addded Mosimane. "We have to make sure that we are fully rested when we go to that match, i hope we don't have a heavy programme before that match because it will take alot out of our body. But it is the draw, we have to honour it."
