Orlando Pirates head coach Josef Zinnbauer says he will dance with his players if they beat Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto derby on Saturday. The Buccaneers have experienced a resurgence under the German tactician this year and now find themselves only six points adrift of Chiefs, which means a win at FNB Stadium on Saturday would see Zinnbauer's men reduce the deficit to three points. Zinnbauer has revealed that his players are highly motivated for the crucial Absa Premiership tie and are voluntarily putting in extra hours in training. "I say, 'stop now, training is finished.' But they say, 'no, no, coach, we want to play more - give us a free-kick or give us a corner, or whatever," Zinnbauer told the media on Thursday. "They have a special feeling, they are focused on the Soweto derby, but we have to focus on the next game and for us, as coaches, it's only the game thatâ€™s important. "But I know it's a special game for me too, but you don't get more points from the derby than any other game, yeah? You have a chance for three points and not more." Zinnbauer was caught on camera dancing in the Pirates dressing room recently and stated that it was just a taste of what's to come if his team come out on top. "The guys, they dance and have fun and it is good. In the video, you only saw me alone, but on the other side it was a player and I told him when we win we will dance together," he added. "If we win and then we dance and I made a little dance and then there was hype in the press." -TeamTalk Media
