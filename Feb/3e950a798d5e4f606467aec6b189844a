YFM drive-time host DJ Sabby has spoken out against the outbreak of bullies in Mzansi’s schools. The presenter of the Best Drive on week days said bullying even in the workplace has become a culture. “It’s sad to even use the word 'culture' but that’s what bullying has become. A practice done is found in severally spaces, be it school or work. It makes you feel afraid and degraded and often it makes a person feel like they are worthless. Unfortunately, bullying also makes you stop wanting to go out because you are scared you might see the person bullying you. Bullying is an act that can be curbed if people spoke out but at the same time they can’t because they are scared of what might happen if they get caught. It’s a control of emotions and people’s lives that’s totally unfair to those who are bullied,” he said. Watch top DJ's hot skills: New radio week and a new video ??. @sautisol on #TheBestDrive.
