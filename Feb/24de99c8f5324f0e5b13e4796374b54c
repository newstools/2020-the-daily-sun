AFTER so much debate on who must start for Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto derby, Amakhosi mentor Ernst Middendorp has kept to his word that Daniel Akpeyi will play in the Absa Premiership against rivals Orlando Pirates. The fixture of the weekend between the two Soweto Giants is billed at FNB Stadium with a kick-off scheduled for 3.30pm. Middendorp had said Akpeyi will play league games while Bafana Bafanaâ€™s number one, Itumeleng Khune will play Cup games (Nedbank Cup where they were eliminated last week.) At the Soweto derby press conference on Thirsday, Middendorp was quizzed on which goalkeeper he will go with for this clash and he said he was yet made a decision.
