KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has
vowed to fight tooth and nail to regain his number one jersey from Daniel
Akpeyi. Khune made his long-awaited return to action last weekend in a Nedbank Cup
clash against GladAfrica Championship side Royal Eagles and managed to keep a
clean sheet. It was his first appearance for Amakhosi in nearly six months after he was
sidelined through injury. In his absence, Nigerian shot-stopper Akpeyi stood up tall for the Glamour Boys
and made the number one jersey his own. Khune will have to wait a little longer to feature for
Amakhosi in the Absa Premiership after his coach, Ernst Middendorp, confirmed
that Akpeyi will return in goal against Maritzburg United on Saturday. Said Middendorp: “At the moment I made it very clear that Daniel Akpeyi is starting in the
goalkeeper position. Itu (Khune) played his first game in several months and we were happy with him." “I will bounce back,”
said a determined Khune. “I’m going to work very hard to ensure that I reclaim my position at Chiefs and
Bafana Bafana. I have been pushing myself hard, trying to get back into the team as a regular
starter but Daniel (Akpeyi) has not made it easy for me. Akpeyi deserves all my support because at the end of the day we want to achieve as
a team. Whoever gets the nod will have everyone’s support at the club," Khune added.
