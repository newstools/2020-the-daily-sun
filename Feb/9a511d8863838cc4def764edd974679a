Residents of Wesbank, near Delft in Cape Town, are sick and tired of opportunistic izinyoka who live among them. Whenever there’s load shedding ekasi, residents have to wait for more than 24 hours for the electricity to come back. That’s when izinyoka take advantage of the situation and steal Eskom cables. CPF chairwoman Lorna Frieslaar said:  “They plunge the whole kasi into darkness and this has been going on for a long time, but no one is putting a stop to it. “Residents know who these thugs are but aren’t willing to speak out.” The SunTeam visited the kasi on Sunday. Residents said the lights went out at about 10.30pm the day before. Resident Luvuyo Vena (34) told the the People’s Paper: “The people who steal cables are gangsters. “Even if we know who they are, we can’t just speak out. They’ll kill us all. “Poor people live in this area.  If there’s no electricity, they can’t afford alternative power to cook food.” Eskom spokeswoman Trish Da Silva said the cause of the outage was equipment vandalism. “Eskom apologises for any inconvenience caused,” she said.
