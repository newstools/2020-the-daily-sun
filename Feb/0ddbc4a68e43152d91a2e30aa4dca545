Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology Mohlopi Mapulane asked the department to consider naming a student accommodation building after TVET college student Precious Ramabulana. Last November Precious was raped and stabbed in her rental room in Limpopo.  Mapulane said this earlier today in parliament when the department was briefing the committee on the update they made with regards to improving student accommodation around varsities and colleges around the country."A student who was studying at Capricorn TVET College Precious Ramabulana was raped and stabbed t 52 times by an intruder, this student was staying in a rented accommodation," said Mapulane. Currently the department is embarking on a 10 year program that is aimed at producing 300 000 beds at 26 public universities and 50 TVET colleges.The aim is to ensure students have safe places while they pursue their studies. “What happened to Precious Ramabulana not only brought to the fore the scourge of gender based violence in our society but the actually exposed security of students who are staying in rented accommodation while studying in  TVET Colleges. In this programme of providing accommodation for TVET College students, you must consider naming one of the buildings after that student."Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology Blade Nzimande said they will consider the suggestion to name a building after Precious. "Chair I think your suggestion is a very good one which we will have to consider of naming one maybe of our student accommodation after the lady Precious Ramabulana in honour of her memory and someone who passed away having accommodation that was vulnerable but she wanted to learn and improve herself. I think it’s a good idea."
