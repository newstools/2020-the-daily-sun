Women are known as masters of faking orgasms. So much so that most men can’t actually tell when a woman is faking it. But did you know a man can also fake the big “O”? As inconceivable as this may seem, some men have a hard time ejaculating and end up pretending they did just to keep the peace. According to Neo Ramasedi (29) from The Vaal, he’s faked quite a few orgasms in his life. Explained Neo: “I’ve always taken long to reach orgasm, and have no idea why. “I began faking orgasms when former partners would complain about how long I took to cum. An hour or so later, they’d moan about being tired, too hot or they needed a break, which would kill my momentum. “This is when I started pretending I’d ejaculated. I’d make the necessary noises and body movements. “Luckily, no one ever took a peek at the condom afterward. I’d also ensure I discard the evidence quickly.” Neo said his inability to reach orgasm during sex had left him unhappy. Insisted Neo: “I wish I could also be a two-minute man, who has an orgasm at the blink of an eye. “There aren’t many women who can handle me, which leaves me wondering if I’ll ever meet my match.” Sex therapist Godivah said delayed ejaculation was a form of sexual dysfunction. Said Godivah: “Ejaculation becomes classified as delayed if it takes a man more than 30 minutes to reach orgasm. “And the causes vary. They include medical reasons like having previously suffered a stroke or heart attack. “It can also be due to certain medication, including high-blood pressure medication or certain supplements. “Booze can also be a big factor in causing a delayed ejaculation for some men. “But in my experience, the bulk of the reasons why men experience delayed ejaculation is mostly psychological.” According to Godivah, treatment included identifying the source of the problem. “It’ll take a professional sex therapist, psychologist or medical doctor to settle on a remedy.”
