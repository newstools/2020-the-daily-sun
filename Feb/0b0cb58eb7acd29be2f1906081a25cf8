PERHAPS it’s because the young girl lives in Upington in the Northern Cape that she’s waited half her life for justice. Maybe it’s because she has a disability and couldn’t testify verbally that her quest for justice has been ongoing for seven years. But there’s hope for the 14-year-old, who has cerebral palsy. On 17 February, her trial will finally go to court. Her nightmare started in August 2012 when, as a seven-year-old, she allegedly was raped by a family friend. A case was opened, but it took six months before social worker Inge Reichert became involved. “Nothing had happened with the case,” said Reichert. “The assumption was made the victim won’t be a reliable witness because of her severe cerebral palsy, including a speech impediment.” Reichert set up a meeting with the investigating officer, the Human Rights Commission in Upington, a representative of the Minister of People with Disabilities in the Northern Cape, as well as the NPA – but she didn’t receive much support. Reichert took the case to Therina Wentzel-Du Toit, national director of the National Council for Persons with Disabilities, who drove the case to the next level. Their efforts and appeals to the highest authorities in the Department of Justice led to the NPA instructing its Kimberley branch in July 2016 to prosecute. The girl will testify using a tablet designed by the University of Pretoria.
