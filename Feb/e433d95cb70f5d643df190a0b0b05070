The matter between Cricket
South Africa (CSA) and Mr Corrie van Zyl has now been concluded and Mr Van Zyl
will be returning to work at CSA, effective immediately. While the details of the case
remain confidential between the employee and employer, both parties are pleased
that the case has now been concluded.  By mutual agreement, CSA will in
due course announce Mr Van Zyl’s role in the organisation as part of the
current re-alignment processes. As part of the
renewal efforts currently taking place in the organisation, CSA looks forward
to the resolution of all such outstanding matters.
