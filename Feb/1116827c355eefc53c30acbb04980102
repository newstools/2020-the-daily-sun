SOCIAL media was abuzz the whole day since a tweet showed an sms claiming that the National Student Financial Aid Scheme had once again deposited millions into a student's account. But the student aid body has denied the tweet as fuelling fake news.   "The allegation is not true and NSFAS can confirm it did not make a payment amounting to R5-billion to any student. In 2017 NSFAS transferred well over R14 million into Sibongile Mani, who instead of reporting the mistake blew the money. She reportedly spent R820, 000 in 73 days, between 01 June and 13 August. Mani spent an average of R11, 000 a day. The Hawks arrested Mani in May 2018 for theft, after student fund distributor Intellimali, opened a case on 5 September 2017. Her trial is still ongoing.
