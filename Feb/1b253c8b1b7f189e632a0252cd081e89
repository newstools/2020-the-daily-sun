GOD says in 2 Chronicles 7:14: “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven ...” We, as the global community, are facing a new scourge called coronavirus. South Africa has no known case of coronavirus at the moment. But this doesn’t mean we must relax. We can’t stand by and watch as the virus spreads across other parts of the world. I call on mediators to pray for the healing of our land. Let us pray: Father, in the name of Jesus, we stand in the gap and pray against the spread of this monstrous virus. We pray for the affected families and affected people. Heal them, oh Lord. Jesus was pierced and wounded for our healing. I, therefore, pray for the total healing of all infected and affected in Jesus’ name. Amen.
