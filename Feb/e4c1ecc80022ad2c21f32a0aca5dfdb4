SIMON Nanga knows tragedy will strike soon but doesn’t know when. He spends the whole day at work praying he won’t return home to find his shack gone. READ: PAPA PENNY TURNED HIS BACK ON ME! The 44-year-old from Sekerepeng in Laudium, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he woke up on Saturday to find a huge sinkhole near the toilet in his yard. “It looks like a hole in a mine. No ladder would help a person who fell into it,” he said. Simon said he reported the matter to his councillor but nothing was done. He said he knew his shack would be swallowed but he had nowhere else to go. “The ground in my bedroom is soft. “I know one day my shack will sink but where will I go? I just pray that God will save me when the shack sinks.” Simon said his nephew lived in the shack next door but he sent him away for his safety. “I also sent my wife home, but I can’t move because I have a job here.” READ: PICS: JOZI TO GET A MAN-MADE BEACH WORTH R9 BILLION He said he hoped the government would make a plan to move him and his neighbours to a safer area. Tshwane emergency services spokesman Charles Mabaso said his department and utility services worked with the councillor to assess the situation and provide help. He said that included securing the area around the sinkhole. Spokesman for the City of Johannesburg, Lindela Mashigo, said it was aware of the sinkhole. He said a team, which deals with sinkholes is scheduled to visit and conduct an onsite assessment of the cavity today.
