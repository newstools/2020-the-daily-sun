MUSA Nyatama has signed a one-and-half year contract with Highlands Park, with an option to renew. The former Orlando Pirates midfielder completed his move to Highlands on Tuesday, after being released by Bucs on Friday last week. An insider at the club said Nyatama will on Wednesday be registered with the league and offered a jersey number that he will wear with the Tembisa club. In what came as a shock to football followers in the country, Pirates announced their parting of ways with their former Footballer of the Year. The announcement was made on the eve of the transfer window deadline. After being registered with the league tomorrow, Nyatama will be eligible to feature in the club's Nedbank Cup Last-32 clash against Uthongathi FC at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday at 8.15pm. "This is one of the big signings that Highlands have made after Reneilwe Letsholonyane. This is the club's big effort to compete with the big clubs after their recent struggle. And Nyatama comes in handy and will help them win matches. He is good on aerial balls and can also help control the midfield." Nyatama played a mere eight games for Pirates in all competitions this season. In his first season at the Buccaneers, he was crowned with the Player of the Season accolade. Yesterday at the PSL offices, Highlands coach Owen Da Gama spoke fondly of how he is a big fan of Nyatama. Da Gama said: “There are three players currently in the final phase of negotiations with management. When it comes to contracts I stay away from it. The team will make a press briefing. I love Musa Nyatama with all my heart.”
