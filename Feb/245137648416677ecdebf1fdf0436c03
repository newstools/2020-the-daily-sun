STANDING and watching the divers made him feel helpless, so he decided to roll up his sleeves and join in the search for his son. Dumisani Gumede (47) from Glendale in Ndwedwe, north of KZN, said he asked for leave from work so he could help to look for his son, Mbuso (7). Mbuso drowned in Umvoti River on Sunday. Dumisani said when the divers called off the search before sunset, he decided to roll up his sleeves and search for his boy. “Waiting feels like I am failing my son once again. 'NAKED JESUS' HOSPITALISED “Already I blame myself that he’s not with us today,” Dumisani told Daily Sun. Mbuso was swimming with his father when he drowned. Yesterday, the search entered its fourth day and Mbuso’s body had not been found. “We noticed there are places the divers aren’t searching. When they leave, my neighbours and I search in those places. Sometimes I think of coming to the river even at night. The situation is bad at home,” he said. PRECIOUS MURDER ACCUSED PLEADS NOT GUILTY Councillor Sipho Sibisi said they were devastated and were trying by all means to be with the family during this time. “Every morning, I make sure I come here to be with the family and assist where I can,” said Sibisi. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said family members were allowed to assist the search team any time. The search is continuing.
