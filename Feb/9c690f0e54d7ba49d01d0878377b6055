HOMEOWNERS want flats being built near their houses to be demolished. Residents of Kagiso extension 4, Mogale City, said construction on the three blocks of flats started last month. They told Daily Sun the builders were in a hurry and ended up building too close to their yards.

Siphiwe Ndala (45) said he won’t be able to poke without worrying if people are watching him. “Yes, we have curtains. But whoever lives there will be able to see through our windows. “We need to be respected. We’re not living in these houses for free.” Residents said they feared the flats would put their safety at risk. Siyabonga Thwala (51) said: “A person this close to our houses can easily jump over the fence and do whatever they want.” Lydia Sithole (39) said she feared the flats would be overcrowded and cause sewage blockages. “The municipality better destroy these flats. We won’t stand being disrespected like this,” she said. Solly Lebogo (64) said he was concerned about residents’ health. READ: MY MUM DATES MY EXES! “Illegal dumping will be a problem. Imagine the refuse collection problem so many people will cause. This needs to be stopped,” he said. Councillor Paul Molapho said two of the blocks were approved in 2018, but no one knew who gave permission for the third one. He said the municipality stopped building pending the outcome of the investigation. “We understand their concerns and will ensure we get to the bottom of this.”
