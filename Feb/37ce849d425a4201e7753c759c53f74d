FIVE alleged sexual predators were bust for possession of child pornography last week. A specialised child protection and sexual offences unit held an operation called Moonlight in collaboration with the United States Department of Homeland Security. Properties were searched in Rietfontein, Claremont and Daspoort in Tshwane, Roodepoort in Joburg and Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni. The suspects are aged between 30 and 62 and one apparently runs a day care centre. Computers, hard drives, flash drives, tablets and cellphones with child porn were seized. Colonel Brenda Muridili said one suspect (34) had a previous conviction for rape and sexual assault for which he received a five-year suspended sentence. “The team acted on information from the crime intelligence cyber crime unit, and the initial investigation produced information to allow members to get search warrants.” Muridili said a sixth suspect was not bust as no material was found, but electronic equipment was seized for investigation. Lieutenant-General Tebello Mosikili said: “Our job is now to ensure these alleged sexual predators are given the harshest sentences.” The cops urged parents to monitor their kids to ensure they didn’t fall prey to sexual predators online.
