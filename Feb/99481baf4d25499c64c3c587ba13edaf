AFTER watching his team being eliminated from the Nedbank Cup by their arch-rivals Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo has set his sights on Caf Champions League qualification next season. A top-two finish in the Absa Premiership will guarantee the Tshwane based club an automatic Champions League place while the team finishing third play in the Caf Confederation Cup. Matsatsantsa a Pitori lost the Tshwane derby 1-0 to the Brazilians in the Last-32 round at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday. Sibusiso Vilakazi scored the solitary goal in the 24st minute. Tembo, in his final spell of his two-year contract, was disappointed with the result, but not with the performance after they put up a brave fight, forcing Sundowns to close shop in the late stages of the second half. His side visit Premiership rookies Stellenbosch FC in their next league fixture at the Cape Town Stadium on Valentine’s Day, Friday night (8pm). Tembo will be hoping to get some love and return to Tshwane with three points against the newly promoted Mother City based outfit. SuperSport occupy fourth place on the log with 34 points from 21 matches. “There is still a lot to play for in the league. We have a good squad that is fully aware that the season is not finished. We have nine games to go and 27 points still to play for,” Tembo emphasised.
