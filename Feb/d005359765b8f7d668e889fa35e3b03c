Last night thugs broke into Noordwyk Secondary School, in Midrand and stole learning and teaching equipment. The Gauteng education MEC announced this morning on twitter, tagging the SAPS to intervene. Some think it’s an inside job while some are giving the MEC advice on how to deal with this matter. “The Criminal elements are running amok. Instead of slowing down it looks like they are in charge of the whole country. They broke into my offices through the roof  and cleaned us out. We are creating jobs for Law Abiding citizens and then this happens,” Tali Mbamba tweeted. Maqana suggested that police raid Colleges in  Johannesburg and ask for a proof of Purchase for their computers and laptops.“ Then you'll see what I’m talking about. A lot of fake colleges are started on stolen good. I hope you’ll take my idea into consideration,” “I propose the launching of amabharet (red ants), people are abusing freedom and democracy. Our state is becoming worse than before. People robbed at gun point, schools burned or robbed, woman raped and killed, people get killed for what they worked hard for. Can Cele do his work,” Africsiggue tweeted.  Last night thugs came uninvited at Noordwyk Secondary School, Midrand and took our learning and teaching equipments. Dear @SAPoliceService we can only hope! @EducationGP @Steve_Mabona pic.twitter.com/5X0ZfLVr81
