MASECHABA’s dream was to build a house for her family. But Masechaba Namola (29) made a big mistake when she asked her boyfriend Thabang Ranthethe (34) to deposit the money in the bank account of a relative in Lesotho and buy building material. That was in October. Last Friday she received a call from the family asking about the money. When Masechaba asked Thabang about it, he confessed to using the cash to buy magoshas! Thabang said the magoshas charged him R100 to R200 a session.  Now Masechaba, who used to live with Thabang in Kgotsong in Mangaung, wants her R2 600 back. Masechaba started dating and living with Thabang in April 2018. “I’d asked him many times to deposit money into my account and he’d always been reliable. We’re both from Lesotho and he knows I’ve been saving money to buy material to build a house. “In October I got a call for a domestic job in Gauteng and asked Thabang to deposit the money.” She said he’d told her he was sorry but had to get punani while she was away. “The money was meant to buy three window frames and two door frames. “I feel humiliated knowing my hard-earned cash was spent on magoshas.” Thabang told Daily Sun he was sorry and would pay back the money. “I felt lonely when she was away. I poked almost every day and now feel bad. I’m a builder and I’ll repay her. I hope she forgives me and we fall in love again. No one is perfect in this world.” But Masechaba said he can’t be trusted. “I’ll wait till he pays me and forget he ever existed. “There are many good men out there.”
