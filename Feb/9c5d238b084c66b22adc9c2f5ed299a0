FRANCE Mareka and his wife used to have a great sex life. But all that changed after he was assaulted in December. The 58-year-old from Ikageng kasi in Potchefstroom, North West, was in hospital for a week and said he hadn’t had an erection since. France told Daily Sun the man who beat him dated his daughter before she died in 2011. He said on the day of the assault, he and his wife were on their way to the shop when they bumped into the man.  “It was not unusual for him to talk to me in a disrespectful tone, but I became upset because we were in a public space. I told him to stop being rude. “He said I was an old man and won’t do anything. We exchanged harsh words, but when I tried to walk away he picked up a brick and hit me on the back with it. I passed out.” Bystanders took France to the clinic and he was later transferred to hospital. He suffered internal bleeding and had surgery.  “It breaks my heart to see him roaming around and making fun of me. I hope police act quickly and arrest him,” he said. France’s wife Matshidiso (58) said: “This man has destroyed his manhood.” Colonel Adele Myburgh said the case number provided by the family didn’t correspond with the crime committed. She said she’d assist the family, and that they could also visit Ikageng Police Station, where the case was registered, for clarity.
