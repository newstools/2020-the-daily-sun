TV and radio personality Anele Mdoda represented South Africa at the Oscars this past weekend. The controversial Mdoda sister was selected to host M-NET’s red carpet feature and had an opportunity to rub shoulders with big names such as Charlize Theron, Brad Pitt, Janelle Monae and even the legendary Al Pacino. The excited media personality posted a picture of herself ahead of the prestigious ceremony but instead of celebrating with her, some tweeps bashed her for her sense of style. Here are some the tweeps who were not impressed: But that dress is a big NO, are you attending matric dance or the Oscars?  Out of all dresses in her wardrobe, she just chose the curtain...like really ?????? pic.twitter.com/LiS7H0cspU  Yhooo ingekho enye ilokhwe bethuna they really sabotaged uAnele emazweni But Anele was not about to let those sly comments slide, she clapped back.
