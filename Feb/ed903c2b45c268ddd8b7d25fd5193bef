FIRST Division clubs have continued saving former Absa Premiership Stars. On Tuesday, Ajax Cape Town and TS Galaxy confirmed the signings of former PSL and Bafana Bafana defenders Rooi Mahamutsa and Thabo Nthethe respectively. As they are in the final stretch of the season, Ajax roped in the former Orlando Pirates Mahumatsa to strengthen their defence with his vast experience as they are pushing for automatic promotion to the top flight next season. The Urban Warriors are leading the NFD standings with 42 points after 21 matches. They are five points ahead of second placed Uthongathi. The veteran 38-year-old centre-back joined the Urban Warriors for the remainder of the campaign. At this stage of the season his experience will be very crucial at the club. In 2018 Mahamutsa also helped Free State Stars to win the 2018 Nedbank Cup. “At my age you wouldn’t think that I would have the honour of working with the best academy in Africa but here I am," Mahamutsa told Ajax website. “To the Ajax faithful, I am looking forward to wearing your treasured red and white kit and I will fight for this title as if I came through your academy.” “The world works in a strange way; I’ve always admired Ajax as a club and as a brand for many years." On the otherside, former SUndowns Nthethe joined Galaxy on a 16-months deal.
