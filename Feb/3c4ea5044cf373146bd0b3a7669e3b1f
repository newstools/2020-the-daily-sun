A nurse’s attitude is everything!This is the sentiment shared by Operational Manager, Thathakahle Gumede at Philani Clinic in Scottburgh in the KZN south coast. Daily Sun traced down Gumede (57) after a video showing her doing dance moves for her patients trended on Facebook over the weekend. In the video she is heard talking, singing and dancing to her patients who welcome her gesture by laughing.   She told the People’s Paper that there are certain beliefs that she will hold on to until she retires. “I’ve always believed that a pill can heal a sick person but a nurse brings hope to a sick person therefore its important that a nurse’s face and attitude be able to tell a patient that this phase they find themselves in shall pass,” said Gumede. She said each time she leaves her home in the morning she tells herself that when she gets at work, the first things she needs to do is creating a lively environment for her patients and her staff. “A patient should not fear grabbing me by the lace of my skirt and ask for help. Sometimes the tough face that nurses put, makes patients fear speaking openly to them about whatever they are going through both health and psychologically so I’ve always taught myself that I don’t want to be that kind of a nurse because it doesn’t help the sick,” said Gumede. Her colleague, Zama Mazeka said: “This is my mother. Every day is bright with her around. I consider myself blessed and lucky to spend 40 hours every week with her. It’s always nice being at Philani Clinic I'm telling you.” A Facebook user , Glacia Mampane said: “I've always said nursing is a calling not a profession. I'm sure some patients forget their aches for a minute.” KZN health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said: “I appreciate dedicated employees such as yourself Mam Thathakahle Gumede in Ugu District. I am certain that by the time patients are assessed, their nerves are somewhat calm. Keep up the good work Mnguni.”
