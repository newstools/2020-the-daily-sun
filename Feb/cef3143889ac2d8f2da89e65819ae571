MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane reckons pressure is not on them but Al Ahly in their two-legged Africa Champions League quarter-finals, scheduled for early next month. The Brazilians were drawn with the eight times African champions after Wednesday's Champions League draw, which was conducted in Cairo, Egypt. Sundowns, the 2016 African champions, paved their way to the Last-8 of the tournament by being the first South African team to win all their group matches. "Unbelievable draw," Mosimane retorted on Wednesday after the draw. "This means whatever Sundowns do in life we follow the same teams again. This is what happened with WAC (Wydad Casablanca). "We are getting WAC all the time in our group." Sundowns defeated WAC 1-0 in their group matches, which comprised Petro de Luanda and US Alger.  "Now the story of Al Ahly starts again, same as last year," added Mosimane. "Same teams different years, different mentality, different moods. I believe that Al Ahly first did not know (about) us, and did not respect us. "But after the results last year, when we knocked them out in the quarter-finals. I think the mood will be different this time,Â and (they) will prepare well for us. "Now it is going to be more difficult for us because they know us. But they too are under pressure because they are always favourites and they will be under pressure to beat us. We will see how it goes."  The Brazilians last year defeated Al Ahly 5-1 where Themba Zwane, Wayne Arendse, Ricardo Nascimento, Gaston Sirino and Phakamani Mahlambi contributed in the goals. In other fixtures, Raja Casablanca will meet TP Mazembe, WAC will play against Etoile du Sahel and Zamalek will face Esperance, as they race for the semi-final stage.
