IT’S happy days for Orlando Pirates. This can be seen even on social media where videos of their coach Josef Zinnbauer dancing in the dressing room have been circulating.  The German mentor has inspired a remarkable turn in fortunes for the Buccaneers since his arrival in December las year. Zinnbauer has turned Bucs, who were struggling under former interim coach Rulani Mokwena, into title contenders. They sit second on the Absa Premiership standings, nine points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Asked about the videos that are doing the rounds on social media, Zinnbauer said they were a result of a positive atmosphere in the dressing room. “I haven’t seen the videos on social media,” said Zinnbauer. “I told the players, we want fun. It’s a lot of pressure when you play for Orlando Pirates, we know this. But it’s our job. We want fun. We have had a bit of luck and won our games, but the question is do we lose this spirit in the dressing room when we lose games? I don’t know. I hope not. “But for now, we are having fun because we are winning games and losing the pressure. That is why the players are having fun and share happy videos on social media. We have fun in training sessions, before training and after training. We also have fun when we win games.”
