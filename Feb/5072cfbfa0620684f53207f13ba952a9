THE father of a boy who drowned in KZN’s Umvoti River blames himself for his death. Dumisani Gumede (47) from Ndwedwe, north of Durban, said had he not allowed Mbuso (7) to join him for a walk on Sunday, his son would probably still be alive. Dumisani told Daily Sun he wasn’t feeling well on the day his son drowned. He wanted to get some fresh air and decided to take a walk around the valley. “When I left home, I saw him and his brother running after me with their dog. Mbuso was wearing his brother’s shoes, so I told his brother to go back and get Mbuso’s shoes. Mbuso and I continued with the walk,” said Dumisani. He said it was very hot and they decided to go down to the river to cool down.  “Mbuso saw his dog in the water and wanted us to go in as well. We dived in and it was fun. He was showing off his swimming skills. I saw him take a dive but he never came back up. I called his name but he didn’t respond. I went in and tried to pull him out but he was stuck,” he said.  That’s when Dumisani called for help. He said the family were praying for his body to be found. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the search was suspended on Sunday night and resumed yesterday morning. The rescue team was still at the scene yesterday afternoon.
