The chairman of the committee, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, said: “It’s like telling parliament to go jump off the nearest cliff.” READ: CASH GUARD VANISHES WITH R4M! CEO Andre de Ruyter and other executive members attended, but when he was asked why interim board chairman Malegapuru Makgoba was not present, the CEO said Makgoba had said he was not going but gave no reason. MPs asked De Ruyter if there was an arrangement on who should attend the meeting, and he said: “The interim chairman phoned me yesterday, saying he elected not to attend.” Hlengwa said: “I consider the action of the body as one that undermines this committee. There was no apology in writing.” Veronica Mente of the EFF said: “I’m convinced he was aware that he should be here. If he wasn’t, then certainly he got the wrong job.” READ: MAKHI DEMANDS SEX!

ANC MP Bernice Swart said: “These people don’t respect us. They must give us an apology today before we leave here. “He must write an email. It’s just a click away. He must write now.”
