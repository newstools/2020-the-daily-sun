Portia Derby has been appointed as group chief executive of Transnet, it was announced on Friday. Derby is the former wife of Brian Molefe, former Eskom CEO and a former Transnet CEO. According to a statement the Minister of Public Enterprises approved the recommendation for her appointment made by the Transnet board. Cabinet gave its approval on Friday.  Derby is a former director-general of the Department of Public Enterprises, which has Transnet as one of the state-owned entities it oversees.    Transnet had not appointed a permanent CEO six months after it conducted interviews for the position. Also last week, the Zondo Commission heard that Transnet paid millions to sponsor an insert in the Gupta-owned New Age newspaper back in 2012, and the deal cannot be justified. Briefing the commission – which has been investigating allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud at state entities since August 2018 – Transnet's internal communications specialist Joseph Jackson provided evidence on the deal which would see Transnet sponsor the "Big Interview" insert in the newspaper. Then-group CEO Molefe had ultimately approved the deal on February 23, 2012. Deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo's was frank in his view on the deal, saying: "Transnet was just robbed."   https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/brian-molefes-ex-wife-portia-derby-is-new-transnet-ceo-20200131
