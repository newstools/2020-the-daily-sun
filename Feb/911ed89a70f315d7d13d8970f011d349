KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi played a sterling role when his side registered maximum points in an electrifying Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Lebogang Manyama's first half strike proved to be enough to earn Amakhosi maximum points. After being criticized for school boy errors he made when Chiefs suffered a 2-1 defeat against Maritzburg United, Akpeyi came back more stronger for the Derby. The 33-year-old denied the likes of Thembinkosi Lorch, Luvuyo Memela and Ghanadinho Mhango clear cut goal scoring opportunities as Bucs created more than them. The result mean Chiefs will remain at the top of the PSL table with 48 points after 21 matches as they also ended Pirates six-game winning streak in a electrifying atmosphere Soweto derby. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is yet to taste Soweto derby defeat in a competitive fixture. The German mentor is on his second spell with Amakhosi after a previously being in charge from July 2005 to March 2007‚ before returning in December 2018. In that time he has met Pirates on seven occasions‚ and managed to get three victories and four draws. Two of those stalemates ended in penalty shoot-outs that were won by Chiefs‚ in the final of the 2007 Absa Cup and the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals in November. This was Chiefs 40th victory over the Buccaneers.
