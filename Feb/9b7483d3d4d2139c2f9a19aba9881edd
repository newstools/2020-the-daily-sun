Passengers travelling in a taxi
that crashed into a wall in New Germany, Durban on Monday, escaped the accident
with only minor injuries.  "We were called immediately to
treat multiple casualties but nothing critical and all are stable," Rescue
Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson told News24.  In CCTV footage that emerged
online, the taxi collides with the wall, flipping and landing on its roof on
top of another vehicle.  This canâ€™t the way we drive. pic.twitter.com/fXvgPsOgJR    Moments later, a few passengers
slowly try squeeze their way out of the overturned vehicle.  "One patient was trapped in
the taxi and jaws of life had to be used to free him," Jamieson said.  KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson
Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the taxi driver lost control of his vehicle.  She said some of the passengers
were taken to hospital for medical attention and no fatalities were reported.  "No case has been
opened," she added.  https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/watch-taxi-crashes-through-wall-in-durban-flipping-and-landing-on-its-roof-20200212
