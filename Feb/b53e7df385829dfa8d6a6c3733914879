AFTER playing to an entertaining 1-1 draw in their Absa Premiership encounter at a packed Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night, Maritzburg United and Cape Town City will shift focus from the league to the Nedbank Cup. A 10-man Team of Choice came back from a goal down to force a share of the spoils with the Citizens after Gabriel Njoni was shown the red card. Thabo Nodada gave the visitors the lead, nine minutes after the half-time break, but on-loan striker from Mamelodi Sundowns Jeremy Brockie broke his duck when he scored his first goal for the club with 17 minutes remaining on the clock. Both coaches were satisfied with their teams collecting just one point after their league match. Tinkler praised his charges for theirnever-say-die attitude. Said Tinkler: “We didn’t look like we were a man down. We fought until the end. We could have even stolen the three points at the death. “I’m proud of the character that the players showed.” The Citizens’ coach Jan Riekerink said he was happy to take a point away from home as his side maintained their unbeaten run in their past three league matches. Said Riekerink: “We’re heading in the right direction and the team is slowly improving.” The league will take a break to make way for the Ke Yona round of 32 competition this week. The Team of Choice will visit PSL rookies Stellenbosch FC at the Athlone Stadium on Friday night (8pm). Tinkler’s men will be hoping to reach their second domestic cup final after they lost 2-1 to Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout Cup final at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in December. The Citizens visit Mbombela United at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit on Sunday (3pm).
