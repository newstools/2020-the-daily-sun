GOING the business rescue route was the only way SAA could be saved from total collapse. This is what Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan told the parliamentary committee on public enterprises and the standing committee on public accounts yesterday. “We could all have thrown up our arms and let SAA be liquidated, but we did everything to save it,” he said. He said liquidation basically meant that at a particular time everything would cease to work. Gordhan said there were many non-compliance issues plaguing the national airline before it was placed under business rescue. He said the government was committed to avoiding bankruptcy. “That’s where business rescue came in,” he said. The minister said last year’s wage strike had caused serious damage to the airline. “We had two weeks of strike by the seven recognised unions. During the strike a union announced it was not safe to fly SAA. “Bookings fell by 85% and 65% of SAA’s income is from foreign flights,” Gordhan said. In the wake of the strike, two ticket insurance companies also withdrew their insurance. The minister told MPs that the business rescue practitioners had been able to bring the two companies back.
