HE SAID he was from the municipality and promised the old couple free groceries. And Matseliso Hlakola (77) and her husband Solomon Nziweni (80) believed the sweet talker.

The couple from Turflaagte in Mangaung, Free State, said the man had asked to see their IDs and Sassa cards. But he swapped the cards without the elderly noticing. It was only when the madala and gogo tried to withdraw cash on 6 February that they realised their grant money was gone. “My wife and I use our date of births as pins. I suspect the man punched those numbers to withdraw our money,” said madala Solomon. Gogo Matseliso said their sad tears and prayers will lead to the scammer’s downfall. “The man said he wanted to see both our IDs and Sassa cards to confirm if we haven’t received the parcels, and I gave them to him,” she said. The couple sent their daughter Nomvula Nziweni (34) to withdraw their grants every month. Nomvula said: “The ATM said wrong pin was entered and I realised the signatures on the cards were not those of my parents. We went to Sassa offices and were told that R1 780 was withdrawn from each card. My parents were helped to get new cards.” READ: 'WE WON'T BE ABLE TO POKE FREELY' The madala said they wouldn’t open a case as they won’t get their money back. But the couple were not the only victims. Their neighbour, Ida Dumezweni (69), said the man did the same thing to her. “I was lucky my money was not withdrawn, even though he gave me a fake card. I have a new card and learnt my lesson,” she said. Free State Sassa spokeswoman Motshewa Maleka said: “Sassa grants recipients should not give their cards to anyone, even to Sassa officials in full uniform. We also advise them not to allow people to withdraw money on their behalf.”
