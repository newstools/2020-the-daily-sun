THE future of Lehlohonolo Majoro and Michael Morton at AmaZulu is still in limbo. The duo are part of the five players that were stopped from training with the club, which include right-back Thembela Sikhakhane who is on loan from Orlando Pirates, Nhlanhla Vilakazi and Jabulani Ncobeni. They were all informed not to train with the rest of the team two weeks ago. They missed Usuthu’s last league match where they lost 2-1 to provincial rivals Golden Arrows at Jonsson King Spark Stadium on 15 February. Usuthu manager Qedi Dlamini said these players are still part of the team set up: “Let's put this clear, these players are not suspended. "They are still part of AmaZulu, but they are not training with team. “They are still employed by the club and paid by the club. "For now they are not training with the team, they are being trained by our fitness coach using our own facilities.” All of these players refused to talk about their plight and future with Usuthu, but referred all enquiries to the club. They’ll visit Chippa United on Saturday and leaders Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on 7 March.
