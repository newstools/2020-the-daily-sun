BIDVEST Wits will face another daunting outing in the Nedbank Cup after they were paired with another PSL, Chippa United, in the Last 16 draw. The Students had a tough hurdle to overcome in Orlando Pirates in their Cup opener on Sunday, and it certainly not getting any easier for them. It is no different for Kaizer Chiefs, the 2018/19 finalist, who travel to Highlands Park, while Bloemfontein Celtic will welcome Maritzburg United. Mamelodi Sundowns received a favourable draw, being paired with Vaal University of Technology. It was a similarly favourable draw for Black Leopards, who will be home to Amavarara. Mbombela United canâ€™t complain, being home to fellow NFD side Real Kings.
