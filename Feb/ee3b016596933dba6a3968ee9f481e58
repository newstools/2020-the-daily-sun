they were blessed with a child a little more than a year ago and are now blessed again! Singer Brenden Praise said he and his wife Nompumelelo “Mpoomy” Ledwaba were grateful that God had trusted them to raise a second child. The Idols SA season 9 runner-up and his wife posted a photo announcing their pregnancy on their social media pages on Wednesday, which was also the singer’s 26th birthday. They welcomed their first child on 3 December 2018. Brenden said their daughter, Nuri, had brought them joy and they were happy to do it again. “Having the first child was such a great experience. Our lives were changed for the better.” Speaking to the People’s Paper, the singer, who was featured on Black Motion’s hit song Joy Joy, said they couldn’t imagine better news than this. “We found out after our London trip and we’re going to have the best experience again,” he said. “We didn’t plan it but this is all we wanted. We believe a child is a blessing from God. We don’t plan our pregnancies. “My wife and I grew up in homes where both sides of our families were involved. We want to do the same, and that is why we’re so specific about how we’ll raise our children,” he said. “We want our kids to grow up together and not have a huge age difference. When it comes to gender, it doesn’t matter. We’re just happy for this new baby and praying for a healthy child,” said Brenden.
