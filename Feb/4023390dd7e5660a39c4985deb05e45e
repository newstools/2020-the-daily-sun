Sundowns are in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals following a 2-0 win against minnows Vaal University of Technology. The Students failed to frustrate the PSL giants early in the second half when they won a penalty, but the stage fright got the better of Reitumetse Hlungwane, who failed to excite their supporters at Lucas Moripe Stadium who were ferried in 18 busses. He blasted his kick over the crossbar with Kennedy Mweene well beaten. Coach Pitso Mosimane approached this game with calm nerves by resting the majority of his regulars as they prepare for their massive Africa Champions League clash where they have Al Ahly in the quarter-final first leg. Captain of the day Wayne Arendse and Phakamani Mahlambi scored the two important goals for the Brazilians. But it was a collective effort as the Brazilians ensured their passage to the Last-8. They will go into the hat along with Bloemfontein Celtic, Real Kings, TS Sporting, Highlands Park and Black Leopards. Bidvest Wits and Chippa United will fight for the last place at the Bidvest Stadium on Monday night at 7.30pm. Coach Pitso Mosimane believes their passing let them down. Said Mosimane: "It was not easy for the fringe players. The challenge is that we don't have much games to let them play. Maybe the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) matches were supposed to help us, but when you don't allow players over 21 to play then it does not help. "It is a reserve league and it should allow all players to play. When are players going to get a chance to play? It is difficult. But I am happy we went through. There will be too much talk, but it is okay. But we beat the students."
