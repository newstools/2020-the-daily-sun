HOMEGROWN presenter, beauty entrepreneur and producer Minnie Dlamini has been announced at the host of the third annual DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards (DMVCA). She is taking over from businesswoman and reality show star Bonang Matheba who hosted the awards since their inception two three years ago. The much-loved SA media personality first burst onto our screens in 2010 as a presenter of various sport and music shows. She later moved to acting in her debut on M-Net’s soapie The Wild, and later joined Mzansi Magic’s Sunday night drama, Rockville. 2017 saw South Africans get a rare glimpse into her very private life leading up to her glamorous nuptials in a three-part reality series titled Becoming Mrs Jones. Minnie currently co-hosts Mzansi Magic’s lifestyle-meets-sports show Homeground, which features live celebrity interviews, and the hottest sporting highlights from the week. Minnie is more than thrilled to be presenting this exciting event. “Being part of the MultiChoice family has been a great honour for me not only as part of the productions that I work on, but to have the team bestow such a big responsibility is something I do not take for granted. A production of this magnitude has no do overs and my greatest wish is to make all the viewers proud of my work as they are the people we are celebrating on the day” said Minnie Dlamini. The star-studded ceremony, proudly presented by 1Life, will be broadcast live from the Ticketpro Dome on Saturday 14 March 2020. The awards, which are voted for by the public, aim to honour the year’s biggest achievers across 11 different entertainment categories, and to award the nominee who earns the highest overall number of votes as: The Ultimate Viewers’ Choice,  this hotly contested race demands that the winner get over million votes! “MultiChoice prides itself at being at the forefront of storytelling on the continent and appreciates the fact that part of that process in bringing the magic to South African homes is working with the greatest talent the country has to offer”, said Simon Camerer, Chief Customer Officer at MultiChoice South Africa. A fan of the Minnie Dlamini brand, Simon further added, “it is going to be a night to remember with Minnie at the helm of this year’s awards.
