The man who was filmed walking naked with a female companion
in Johannesburg at the weekend, and who claimed to be Jesus, has been admitted
to hospital. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told
News24: "It is reported that the male is receiving treatment at Helen
Joseph [Hospital] and the female was released into the care of her
family." Masondo said no criminal case was opened by police. A video circulated on social media at the weekend, showing a
naked couple casually walking the streets of northern Johannesburg. A woman who
filmed the incident confronts them from her car, asking whether they are
following a religion. The man responds: "I am Jesus. I need a lift to
Northcliff so I can become the king. Are you going to become the first
servant?" The woman responds: "Oh my gosh!" as the man's
naked female companion steps into the view of the camera. The man continues: "They told me the clothes are real
and I'm born here, and I'm wearing this filth. This is my skin, but it's small.
Are we going to Northcliff?" "No, I'm going this way," the woman responds. "Are you saying no to Jesus?," the man says. "Oh my gosh!" the woman exclaims again. "Yes, he's here. And Jesus is black, not white. Are you
taking him to Northcliff? This is your last chance." "Jesus" then counts down from five to one, before
the naked couple walks off. Security company Beagle Watch spokesperson Anne Wood told
News24 on Monday the company received a call from a member of the public on
Sunday, presumably the woman who took the video. Wood said a patrol car was
dispatched, but the couple had already left the area. Masondo said a report will be issued as soon as police
visited the man in hospital.       https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/naked-jesus-admitted-to-hospital-following-nude-walkabout-in-joburg-20200204
