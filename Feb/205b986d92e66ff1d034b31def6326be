FILM director Lineo Sekeleoane is thrilled that her feature film Zulu Wedding won an international award at the 28th annual Pan African Film & Arts Festival. This festival is regarded as the largest black film festival in the United States. It was founded by the late Ja'Net DuBois, who died on 17 February 2020, Danny Glover and Ayuko Babu. She went home with the Director's Choice: Best Narrative award at the popular American film festival that was held  from 12-23 February in LA, California.  Zulu Wedding was the closing night film on 23 February at the festival that featured over 150 new films from hundreds of artists. Some of the cast members such as Makgano Mamabolo, Pallance Dladla, Nondumiso Tembe and American actor Darrin Dewitt Henson were also at the festival. They even got an opportunity to interact with well-known actress and film producer Tasha Smith, known for her role in Jumping the Broom (2011). She starred as Angela Williams in the Tyler Perry films Why Did I Get Married? (2007) and its sequel Why Did I Get Married Too? (2010).  Zulu Wedding follows Lu who left South Africa and her Zulu-Sotho heritage behind to become a dancer in America. When she falls in love with Tex, she knows he’s the man to marry. But when she brings Tex home to meet her family, she discovers she’s been promised since birth to a Zulu king. Caught between two men, two families, and two countries, Lu has to come to terms with who she is, so she can fight for what she wants. The rest of the cast include Carl Payne, Jerry Phele, Lorcia Cooper, Sthandiwe Kgoroge, Kgomotso Christopher, Treasure Tshabalala, Kole Omotoso, DJ Tira and Kelly Khumalo. @tasha4realsmith thank you so much sis for being such a delightful host to all of us.
