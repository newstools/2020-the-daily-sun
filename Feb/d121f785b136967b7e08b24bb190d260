Hey MizzB I’M a happily married 23-year-old woman. My husband and I have a two-year-old son together. A few months ago I went to a party with my girlfriends. Some guys joined us and we all started drinking and dancing together. After a few rounds, I ended up in the back seat of a car having sex with one of the guys. I just found out I’m pregnant and I know it’s not my husband’s child. Help! - Lady XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Hey Lady You say your husband is the love of your life but you took a huge risk and slept with another man without using protection. You didn’t only fall pregnant but increased your chances of being infected and infecting your husband with STIs or HIV. It’s important you visit your clinic to ensure you’re healthy. Talking to your husband will help you both come up with a decision on what to do with this pregnancy, and how to work on your relationship. Secrets have a way of coming out and hurting those we love the most.
