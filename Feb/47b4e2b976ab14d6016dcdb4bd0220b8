THE path to the Caf Champions League semifinal is certainly not looking rosy for Mamelodi Sundowns. Notably, the Tshwane giants became the first South African team to go through the group stages undefeated, sealing their fourth Champions League quarterfinal spot in six years with a Ricardo Nascimento-inspired 1-0 win over rivals Wydad Casablanca at the weekend. Finishing top of Group C should automatically guarantee them a safer passage to the semi-final, shouldn’t it? Yet that doesn’t seem to be the case for the Brazilians as they head to Cairo on Wednesday. Seeded in Group A, they could face any of Al Ahly, Zamalek or Raja Casablanca, who are unseeded in group B at the conclusion of the group stages at the weekend. Not that Pitso Mosimane’s side expect to stroll into the last four than to face the continent’s powerhouses, given the dominance of the North Africans. Al Ahly and Zamalek need no introduction to local Mzansi football fans, but Raja Casanblanca are an equally strong side with three Caf titles. Ahly will be consumed by revenge, following the 5-0 humiliation they suffered at the hands of Masandawana in the same stage last year. Like Ahly, Zamalek will also present a tricky challenge for Sundowns, having accounted for their exit in the group stage two years. But Mosimane is not naive and is well aware of the mountain they will face to get to the semifinals. “Going through the group stages without a loss is good. It’s a bragging right. But it affects us in the league. It’s a problem managing games,” said Mosimane. “Who are the teams winning the champions League? It’s the North Africans,” said Mosimane.
