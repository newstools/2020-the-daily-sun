JOYCE Duma was alone at home on 6 February when the ground started shaking. A few seconds later she started sliding as the floor caved in. Luckily, neighbours heard her screams for help and rushed to save her. The 56-year-old from Khutsong kasi in Carletonville, Merafong City, thanked God for sparing her life. “I’d be dead if neighbours hadn’t come in time to rescue me,” she said. Joyce moved into an RDP last Monday. Community leader Less Tumo said Joyce was in a wheelchair and had to be lifted out through a window. She was one of many Khutsong residents whose houses were swallowed by sinkholes. Rain and old burst pipes make matters worse and 15 houses were at risk. On Friday, a road caved in in front of gogo Agnes Makhutlhe’s house. The 76-year-old feared she’d be swallowed next. “I can’t sleep well. The house next door caved in recently and my house is next,” she said. Some residents were moved to new RDPs in Welverdiend but complained the houses were too small. Emmanuel Seake said: “We’re forced to keep some of our things with relatives and friends.” He said his house in Khutsong, worth over R350 000, was replaced with a small RDP worth R68 000. The SunTeam spoke to Lucky Kanaomang as he was preparing to move to a new RDP. “I have many things that aren’t going to fit into that house,” he said. Municipal spokeswoman Bridget Mkhontwana said officials were aware of the sinkholes and residents were being moved. She said the relevant department would deal with complaints.
