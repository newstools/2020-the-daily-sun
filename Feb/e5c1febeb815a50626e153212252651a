KAIZER Chiefs trio of Lebogang Manyama, Reeve Frosler and Daniel Cardoso are just one booking away from missing the crucial Soweto derby next weekend. They are sitting on three yellow cards each. And should they find their way into the referre's book this weekend, they will be forced to serve a one match suspension when Amakhosi face arch rivals Orlando Pirates in their next league match. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has confirmed that he will not be saving any of them against Highlands Park in the Nedbank Cup last 16 as he needs them. "They will all be on the field,” confirmed Middendorp. “We will not be protecting them or anything like that, this is not the structure with which we operate. “But it is highlighted, and I think every referee will be aware which players are at risk of missing the next match. They should behave and do their normal job. “I am not going to be running around protecting players. Why should I do that? Our next match is the most important one, nothing else. And if I get messages that players want to protect themselves then I think that is not the player who should be here at Kaizer Chiefs.”
