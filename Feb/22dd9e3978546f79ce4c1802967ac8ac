Kaizer Chiefs will have set their sights on a feat they have not achieved in 15 years when they play Orlando Pirates in the Soweto Derby on Saturday. Primary in the minds of both clubs will be three Absa Premiership points as Chiefs seek to extend their advantage at the top of the table and Pirates hope to rein them in. But Chiefs will also look to bank home and away league successes against the Buccaneers for the first time since the 2005/06 season â€¦ when Ernst Middendorp was also in charge of the team. Chiefs ended a 14-game winless run against Pirates, the longest in their history, when they defeated their rivals 3-2 in a thrilling league encounter in November. They will now hope to make it a league double for the first time since recording a 2-0 home win in October 2005 and a 1-0 away victory six weeks later in the 2005/06 campaign. It would be a major boost to their title hopes and, with Mamelodi Sundowns in Caf Champions League action, would extend their lead at the top of the table back to seven points. Defeat would not only see Pirates move to within three points of the AmaKhosi, albeit having played a game more, but also allow Sundowns to close the gap to a single point when they play their catch-up fixture. -SuperSport
