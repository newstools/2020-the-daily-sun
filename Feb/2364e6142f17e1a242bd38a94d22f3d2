Social Media giant Facebook said it wants to make people's news feed more 'informative' by hiding posts from people who spam users' news feed with clickbait, sensationalised and misinformative articles. "Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait, sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or status updates." Facebook said in a statement. Facebook says that  publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to their audiences and that their readers find informative. The new policy will only apply to links for individual articles and domains - pages, videos, photos, check-ins or status updates will not be affected.
