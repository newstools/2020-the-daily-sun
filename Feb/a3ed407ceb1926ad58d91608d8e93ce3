MEETING Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane has left a young fan in tears, while Jackson described the meeting as a heart-warming moment he would never forget. He shared a video of the moment on social media this weekend. In the video, Jackson is seen hugging and comforting the young boy.  Jackson tweeted that the unidentified boy wearing a Celtic shirt convinced his father to follow the Celtic bus from the stadium so he could take a photo with Jackson. And when the goalkeeper got out of the bus, the young man burst into tears of joy. “As soon as he saw me, he ran to me and gave me a hug. We held onto each other for a good two minutes and he was crying profusely.  “It was very emotional for me as well. I realised the impact we have on these youngsters is massive.” Jackson said all he did was spare five minutes of his time to take a picture and have a quick conversation with the boy. He said the moment reminded him of his duty to inspire the next generation. The former Bucs keeper gives back to his community through his foundation, the Jackson Mabokgwane Foundation.  “We visit orphanages around Moletjie in Limpopo where I come from to donate school uniforms and food parcels. I feel it is the least we can do,” he said. Daily Sun wasn’t able to identify the young man in the video. Jackson doesn’t have his contact details.
