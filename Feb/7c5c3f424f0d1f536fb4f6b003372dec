If claims that HIV-positive women are sterilised without their consent are true – or pressured – whoever did this must be punished. It is very cruel for anyone to be subjected to such degrading treatment. It is a gross violation of human rights. Even animals get better treatment! I read a complainant was asked to sign forms, and when she asked what they were for, the nurse replied: “You HIV people don’t ask questions when you make babies.” The medical staff breached their duty of care. It is enshrined in our Constitution that every woman has a right to family planning and can decide how many children she wants to bear, irrespective of their health status. And if you are employed to do a job, do it to your utmost ability and don’t cut corners. Thousands of poor people out there would die to do that job. We cannot tolerate violence against women, especially after the strides our democracy has undergone in a bid to liberate them.
