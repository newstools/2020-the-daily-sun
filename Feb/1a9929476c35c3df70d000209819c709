THE National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications briefed the media in Tshwane yesterday on the investigation that revealed a deficiency in the canning of pilchards tinned fish. The regulator has ordered the removal of certain brands of tinned pilchards from shelves across Mzansi. Consumers who recently bought 400 gram tins of pilchards in tomato sauce made by West Point Processors were told to return them as soon as possible. National Consumer Commission acting commissioner, Tazzy Mabuza, said the brand was not fit for human consumption. Brands that were recalled were Deep Catch, Mammas, OK house brand, Prime Ocean, Spar house brand, Sunny, Shoprite Ritebrand, Checkers house brand, U Brands, Saldanha and West Point. General manager for the Food and Associated Industry, Meisie Katz, said the recall was a precautionary measure. She said the investigation was prompted by leaking cans that were noticed nine months after production. She said no deaths or cases of food poisoning were reported. “Consumers are advised to return affected products to any shop where they were purchased for a refund,” she said. Katz said they hoped to finalise the matter by the end of this week. Daily Sun spoke to readers and shop owners regarding the recalling. Shop owner Nazeem Abdul Ali (29) from KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga said: “We weren’t told about this at the wholesale where we buy our stock. People buy it every day and no one came to complain.” Nurullah Hasan from Sharin Supermarket in the Bloemfontein CBD said none of the products were recalled. Mpumi Sams from Mpumi’s Takeaways said she wouldn’t stock any tinned fish until the matter was resolved. Litaba Senekane (27) said he immediately threw away all the tinned fish when he heard the news. “I will never eat tinned fish again as I don’t want my family to be harmed.”
