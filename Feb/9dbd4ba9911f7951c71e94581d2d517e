THE SANDF soldier’s sentencing was postponed to today after he said he wasn’t well. Thembinkosi Ngcobo (29) was due to be sentenced in the Durban High Court yesterday for murder, attempted murder, robbery and kidnapping. He handed himself over in 2017 after a shooting spree in Ntuzuma. He stole his service rifle from Upington Base before going to the home of the mother of his child. He killed her sister Nokwanda Mbambo and wounded several other people, including cops.  In court yesterday, Ngcobo kept running to the toilet. His lawyer Mbhekiseni Sibiya said he was vomiting and dizzy. “He told me he was taken to Westville Prison Hospital but only given pain killers. He said he wasn’t fit to stand in court and asked to see a doctor.” Prosecutor Krishen Shah said Ngcobo was just trying to avoid being sentenced. “There is no document proving he is sick. He plans to escape. This person is very dangerous.” Judge Shyam Gyanda postponed the case to today to allow Ngcobo to see a doctor.
