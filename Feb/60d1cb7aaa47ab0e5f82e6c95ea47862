THEY honour their calling as sangomas, but also the calling to make music! Sangoma Lesego Nkitseng (39), who’s also a gobela, said she met Thato Matsani (22) while releasing a thwasa in Zeerust in 2005. Thato wanted to thwasa, so Lesego took him in. She said he was suffering from a calling of his ancestors. “It took him four months to heal and one more year to be a sangoma.” Thato finished his training in 2006 and has remained with the gobela until now, because they make music. Lesego spoke to Daily Sun on Wednesday in Pienaarspoort, near Mamelodi East, Tshwane. She said she had adopted Thato as her fourth son and the family welcomed him with open arms. She became a sangoma in 1992 and a musician in 2000. The two share sangoma traditions and music. They said nothing would stand between them and their calling. “We sing together and heal people,” she said. Lesego said when they sing, they see some people’s problems. “Whenever we start singing traditional songs, we become powerful and connect strongly to our ancestors.” The traditional healer and department of health practitioner said most of their songs were in Tswana. She released the album Gosiame Arts and Projects in 2015 and released part 5 of the project last year. She said through music they told people to respect amadlozi and tradition, as that’s where their roots were. Thato said singing united them and he respected Lesego as a mum. He was learning a lot from her. The two sing on the streets, malls and other public places.
