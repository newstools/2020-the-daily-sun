A 61-year-old has been diagnosed with a rare condition, where yeast in her bladder ferments sugar into alcohol despite her not having drunk alcohol. Metro reported the patient is the first person in the world to be diagnosed with "urinary auto-brewery syndrome", caused by yeast in her bladder that ferments sugar in her urine to produce alcohol. The process is almost the same as one used by beer makers, but was happening in her own body! At first, medics suspected she may have been hiding an alcohol addiction when urine tests for the drug were repeatedly positive.Kenichi Tamama at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital said the woman, who has diabetes and liver cirrhosis, was recommended for a liver transplant but taken off the donor waiting list and referred for alcohol abuse treatment instead, despite denying ever drinking alcohol. Further blood tests for metabolites of ethanol were negative, meaning the woman definitely did not have alcohol in her blood. Instead, specialists at the university found high levels of candida glabrata, a yeast naturally produced by the body, accumulating in her bladder when she ate sugar.
