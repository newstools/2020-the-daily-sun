Gauteng Electricity Movement has threatened to shut down Mzansi as their fight with Eskom continues. On Tuesday, the organization held a media briefing at the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) headquarters to outline the state of Eskom. Speaking at the briefing, the organiser of the Soweto Shutdown, Lehlogonolo Makhele said Eskom was using bullying tactics. "Electricity, just like the land, housing, water and sanitation is a basic need and a right for the people to have a decent living," he said. “We will oppose any attempts to make the power pay exorbitant amounts that Eskom and the government impose on communities,” he added. The organisation led the #SowetoShutdown march which was aimed at pressuring the government into lowering electricity fees. Chisale Benjamin said the protest had not failed because of the impact it had. “We made the government aware of our struggles hence they deployed police to intimidate us and we will shut down the country if our demands are not met,” he said. “This was just the symbolic phase to gather all the forces underground and going forward we are going to mobilise more people to join us,” he added.
