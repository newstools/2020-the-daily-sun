Hey MizzB I AM a 23-year-old woman and I’ve been keeping a secret from my six-year-old daughter. On my way back from school years ago I was raped by a guy who used to visit our neighbours. I was too afraid to speak. My family found about the pregnancy when my stomach started showing. It was decided we would raise the kid ourselves. I love my daughter and have told her that her dad was dead, because I didn’t want her to find out she was a product of rape. Am I doing the right thing? - Lady Hey Lady You have survived a traumatic experience and have managed to still find the courage not to let what happened to you define the relationship you have with your daughter. Having a conversation with your daughter about how she was conceived can be challenging. You first have to heal so that when you’re ready to talk, it doesn’t come from a place of pain. You need to highlight the blessing that she is in your life. For more, send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za.
