RED-HOT Orlando Pirates’ impressive run in the Absa Premiership continues. This after a hard-fought 1-0 win over a dogged Black Leopards outfit at the Thohoyandou Stadium yesterday. It took a fortuitous own goal by Thabiso Mokoena in the 90th minute as Pirates broke Lidoda Duvha’s hearts and stole the three points. The result saw Pirates stretch their winning run to seven successive matches in the league. It looked like it would be a frustrating day in Venda for the Soweto giants, however, their never say die attitude saw them over the line. Their elimination in the Nedbank Cup at the hands of Bidvest Wits last week, seems to have done little to disturb their momentum. They are now looking to continue their near improbable charge towards the title. Bucs, who had a slow start to the season, returned to second on the log. They are six points behind arch rivals and log leaders Kaizer Chiefs with one game in hand. This makes for a thrilling Soweto derby between Pirates and Chiefs on the 29th of February, the two side’s next league match. For Lododa Duvha, the heart-breaking loss disturbed their recent resurgence under Interim coach Alan Clarke. They remain in the danger zone, 14th on the log with 20 points from 21 matches, the same as Polokwane City and AmaZulu below them. They held their own for much of the match, giving as good as they got against a free scoring Bucs attack spearheaded by top scorer Gabadinho Mhango. The Malawian, who has banged in an impressive fourteen goals so far this season, was kept rather quiet by the Leopards defence.       In the end, the Limpopo side could not avenge their 2-1 loss to Bucs in the first round, which was Zinnbauer’s first match in charge. Meanwhile, in the other match of the day, Polokwane City edged Cape Town City 3-2 at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium.
