FOR the second week that Prophet Mboro from the Incredible Happenings Church was in the Free State helping to bury people who drowned. Last week he helped bury Musa Mbele, this week he buried Pastor Makgola Motaung (35) and Thato Mokgatla (16). They died last Wednesday when Thato went for a swim with friends. Thato apparently struggled in the water and the other boys screamed for help. Pastor Motaung who was passing ran to help. However, he too didn’t make it out of the water alive. The two were buried together on Saturday in two separate funerals with one service at Tharolo High School with executive mayor of Maluti-a-Phofung, Masechaba Lakaje, present. This after Mboro went with Thato’s family to the Motaung family to pay tributes as the Thato family felt bad that pastor Motaung had died trying to save their son. The Motaung family understood that it was an accident and used the opportunity to tell the prophet of their difficulties to bury him. Mboro and Mayor Lakaje vowed to assist both families and agreed to build them houses. Mboro will build a house for the Mokgatla family while the mayor will build for the Motaungs. Thato’s mother, Sibongle Mokgatla (46) said she hoped her son would grow up to be a big man one day. “I’m grateful for what the prophet and the mayor have promised to do," she said. Motaung’s wife Fikile Motaung (36) said: “We were happy when the prophet and the mayor came to our rescue. I’m sure this will make my husband happy in heaven. It was his wish to build a home for us.” Mayor Lakaje also thanked Mboro for his continued support to the people of Qwaqwa.
