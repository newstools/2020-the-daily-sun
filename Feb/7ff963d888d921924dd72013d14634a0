The people of Tembisa can now finally rest as the township is said to be getting its "h" back after it went missing a couple of years ago. The error which happened years ago will finally be fixed by the City of Ekurhuleni. “The City of Ekurhuleni will change some names of its townships. This is more of a correction of spelling. Tembisa will now be pronounced and written with the letter ‘h’ and be spelled as Thembisa,” City of Ekurhuleni’s spokesperson, Themba Gadebe told Tembisan. The name change has come to effect with immediate effect together with Tokoza and Tsakani. Tokoza will be Thokoza, while Tsakane will now be spelled as Tsakani with the letter ‘i’ instead of the letter ‘e’.
