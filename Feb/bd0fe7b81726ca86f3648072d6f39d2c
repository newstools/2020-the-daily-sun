THE family of two brothers who were stoned to death last Monday have been forced to bury them in another village. Angry villagers refused to have the dead men buried in their village. Lucas Seloma (47) and his brother Willem (45) were supposed to have been buried last Saturday in Letejane Village, outside Groblersdal, Limpopo. But the family was forced to postpone their funeral to tomorrow, and move it to Leeuwfontein Village after allegedly being threatened that their bodies would be dug up. Leeuwfontein is where their mum was from before she got married and moved to Letejane, where they were killed. The brothers were accused of being behind the disappearance of local fisherman Peter Phahlamohlaka (30), who went missing while fishing with them at Lepelle River last July. The crowd forcibly took the brothers 3km away from their home to a local mountain, where they were killed. Daily Sun published their story last Wednesday after the brothers were killed in broad daylight. A villager said: “It’s sad they denied the family to bury them here. “They don’t even have enough money for the funeral. “Their mum participated in community burial societies but she is not going to get financial support from those structures because no one is willing to back her. “In fact, they just want them out of the village. It is no longer safe for the Seloma family to live here.” Eight people were bust and charged with two counts of murder each. All the suspects have been denied bail and are being held in custody at Motetema Police Station. They will appear in court again on Thursday for a formal bail application, while police investigations are continuing.
