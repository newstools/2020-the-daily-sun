FRANS Ngobeni is grateful he is alive and that his 4-5 is still working. The 35-year-old from Soshanguve block A, Tshwane, was allegedly burnt by his girlfriend with boiling water on 28 December. This was after he was accused of taking her money and having an affair. He said when she asked him to boil water for tea, he never thought the water would end up on his body. Frans said the incident happened at their previous rented place in Soshanguve block AA, also in Tshwane. “My girlfriend accused me of having an affair with another woman, which is not true,” he said. “She is an evil woman. This is the worst pain I’ve ever experienced.” Frans claimed after that his girlfriend locked him in the house for two days. “She never cared that I was screaming and that I was in a lot of pain.” Frans said after two painful days, she apparently freed him and threw his clothes outside and told him to leave. “She wants me to drop charges and I will not do it because I want her to rot in jail.” Frans claimed his girlfriend wanted his money and to clean him out. “I’m angry. She never loved me. She was after my money. I don’t want to see her again.” Frans said he was living in a secret place where the woman wouldn’t find him. Daily Sun contacted the girlfriend, who claimed Frans used to beat her with his fists. “Yes, I burnt him because he was beating me with fists and he wanted my money. Please tell that hobo to get a life,” she said, before hanging up. When the SunTeam tried to call her again to find out if she had opened a case against Frans, she hung up. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “An assault case was opened and no arrest has been made.”
