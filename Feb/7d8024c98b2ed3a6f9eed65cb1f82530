IF you’re in the market for a new car, look no further. In a quest to get you the best advice, SunWheels asked the number one local online classified vehicle site, AutoTrader, for tip-top tips. Research Doing your homework first is the most important step. Said AutoTrader CEO George Mienie: “Unlike a property, a car isn’t an investment. So, you need to make an informed decision. “Take your time and do your homework properly before deciding which car to buy.” Buy something you can afford This may seem obvious but it’s not. About 10 million South Africans are falling behind on their repayments. This means they’ve bought items (which may include cars) they can’t afford. Focus on safety “When buying your first car, it’s important to focus on safety features. The three most important ones are airbags, anti-lock brakes (ABS) and electronic stability control (ESP). For parents or guardians, ISOFIX anchor points are another important safety factor,” George said. Consider second-hand “A good, clean, low-mileage second-hand car may well be a better buy than a new car.” Read the Ts&Cs of your finance deal Most people can’t afford to pay cash for their first car, meaning vehicle finance is required. This is an incredibly intricate field, and there are challenges to be aware of. For instance, “balloon or residual payments” – whereby you pay a lump sum at the end of the financing period – can be an unwelcome surprise in years to come.
