She said some of her neighbours didn’t try to stop the fire from spreading. “Only a few people helped. Some just stood there and did nothing,” she said. “What made matters worse was that firefighters took an hour and a half to arrive.” Nompumelelo said they suffered about an R890 000 loss and had no insurance. “We need Sun Readers to please help us.” Her brother Qeto (28) said he was lucky to be alive. He said he was woken up by smoke and loud screams. “I hope SunReaders can help us with anything they can contribute,” said Qeto. Nnete (30) said she was at work when the fire started. “Rebuilding what we lost will cost us a lot, which we can’t afford,” said Nnete.
