Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs will come to blows in arguably the biggest Soweto Derby showdown in recent memory when they clash in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon 3.30pm. The two South African giants head into this weekend's clash occupying the first and third places on the league standings respectively, and while Chiefs hold the advantage, victory for Pirates will see them move within just three points of the league leaders.
