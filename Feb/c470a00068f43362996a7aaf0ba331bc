HE didn’t like it when the rats ate his toenails. But it bothered Tshidiso Mophethe more that his fat cakes and Russians were also gone! The madala (63) from Caleb Motshabi, Mangaung, said he didn’t feel any pain when his toenails were bitten off. Tshidiso said: “I thought it was lies that rats could eat your nails without you feeling anything, but now I agree. “I think the rats were blowing on me when they ate my nails because I felt cold air. I got the shock of my life when I realised I did not have any nails on my feet. They even ate part of my skin towards my heels.” But Tshidiso was angry when he realised his five fat cakes and two Russians were gone. “I will now sleep with a feather duster stick and with gumboots on,” he said.  “But it’s summer and hot. One can’t sleep with gumboots. I am a pensioner who lives alone. I need someone who’ll help me destroy these evil rats before they eat me alive,” said madala. Neighbour Sebolelo Molahlwe (37) said she had a two-year-old baby girl who slept at her father’s place because of the rats. “Last weekend they ate meat from inside my pot. We are dealing with evil rats and I fear for my daughter. I decided to take her to stay with my father until things got better,” she said.
