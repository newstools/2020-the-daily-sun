THEIR rubbish hasn’t been collected for five months. Residents of Ikhwezi section in Madadeni kasi in Newcastle, northern KZN, now pay R10 each a private truck to collect rubbish. Nonkanyiso Mkhize (23) said there was so much rubbish lying around, some people collected it in exchange for cash. “Every Tuesday morning a truck comes to collect rubbish for R10,’’ said Nonkanyiso. “People pay the money because they can’t stand the smell, while those who don’t have money are stuck with the filth.” But Nonkanyiso said she wasn’t sure where the truck dumps the rubbish after collecting it.  Another resident, Nombuso Ngcobo (33), said the councillor sometimes asks the youth to clean up the area. “But nobody knows why the rubbish hasn’t been collected. Even the councillor can’t give us answers,” she said. “This kind of service is free in other areas. But we pay for it. Those who can’t afford to pay end up with smelly yards.” Councillor Sizwe Mngomezulu said: “Rubbish hasn’t been collected because about 200 workers from the Amajuba Municipality were suspended last year after engaging in an illegal strike.” He said the matter would be resolved as soon as they return to work. He was aware of the truck that collects rubbish for money and said he, too, helps residents by collecting the rubbish in his own van.
