Due to the passing of Ladysmith Black Mambazo's founder, Joseph Shabalala earlier this week, the members who were on a tour in the US arrange their return home. They are expected to be in Mzansi on 22 February. There have also been rumours that they had cancelled all their international tours due to their founder's death but the members are rubbishing the the claims.
