Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree involving two different women. He faces time in prison. He was convicted on Monday after the jury deliberated for five days. AP reported that the case was built on three allegations: Claims that he raped an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel in 2013, that he forcibly performed oral sex on another woman in 2006, and that he raped and forcibly performed oral sex on actress Annabella Sciorra in the mid-1990s.Â According to The New York Times, Weinstein was "unmoved as the verdict was read." Weinstein was found not guilty on the most serious charge he faced: predatory sexual assault, which could have resulted in a life sentence. In October 2017, the American film producer sparked the #MeToo movement when dozens of women accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a period which span thirty years. Since the initial reporting in 2017, over 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault or rape.  https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/harvey-weinstein-found-guilty-on-two-counts-20200224
