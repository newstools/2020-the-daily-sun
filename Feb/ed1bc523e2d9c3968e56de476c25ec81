TRADITIONAL leaders must preserve cultural practices and guard against the influence of criminal elements. This was the call from President Cyril Ramaphosa during his address to the National House of Traditional Leaders in Parliament yesterday. He said some people’s human rights were being violated in the name of culture. “Customary initiation is a rite of passage for our young people to manhood. But it has become increasingly infiltrated by unscrupulous people, and many young men are being maimed or losing their lives,” he said. “We can’t sit here year after year and say more must be done. We further call on you to work with the SAPS to ensure that those who are involved in these unscrupulous practices are arrested and charged.” He said the Customary Initiation Bill currently before the National Council of Provinces would regulate the practice of customary initiation. On women empowerment, he said resolutions were taken by the National House at the Tshivhidzo in Mpumalanga last year that all houses were committed to working towards uplifting rural women.
