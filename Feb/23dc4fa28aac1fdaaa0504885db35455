ON Twitter, President Ramaphosa complimented Mmabatho Montsho on winning an international award and she responded. But it was not a simple thank you! Mmabatho, whose film The Award Ceremony won the Best Short Film award at the 2020 Worldwide Women’s Film Festival last week, shared her concerns on Tuesday. Mmabatho urged the president to appoint ministers who understand and are passionate about the arts. “He must appoint ministers with integrity, who can’t be bought, address racial and gender inequality decisively, and deal with corruption,” she said. She said Ramaphosa must prioritise the SABC. “Black practitioners have sat in their homes without getting paid while the country watches the content they created,” said Mmabatho. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “The SABC is committed to ensuring that all the properties aired on its platforms fully comply with standard operating procedures, which guide the payment process of repeat fees, royalties or commercial exploitation fees. “The SABC hosts regular industry sessions for information and has over the years engaged relevant bodies.” Mmabatho also alleged that there is inequality within M-Net, which she said exploits creatives. She alleged that there’s a discrepancy between channels with black content and those with white content. But MultiChoice head of corporate affairs Reggy Moalusi told Daily Sun: “MultiChoice has a proud history of investing in the creation of local content that not only resonates with its customers but also adds to the creation of a value chain.” Moalusi said MultiChoice had created household names both behind and in front of the camera, which included the rise of black production companies.
