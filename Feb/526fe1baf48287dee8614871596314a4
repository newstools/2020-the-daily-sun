ALMOST every morning Clifford Mutamba stands on the streets of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni with a placard begging for a job. For the past year, the 24-year-old BCom graduate has applied for more than 50 jobs with no success. Now he stands on the side of the road with a placard written: “Plz hire me, Bcom in business management degree.” He told Daily Sun he left his home in Limpopo last year and moved into a friend’s backroom in Tembisa, hoping he’d have better chances of finding work. Clifford said he had a tough upbringing but managed to finish matric in 2014 and enrolled at the University of Venda after getting a loan from Nsfas. He will get his degree in May. Clifford said while he was studying, he applied for internships and marketing positions but couldn’t even find a job as a waiter. “I’m stressed and have decided to try a different route to find work. I’m hoping that people driving past this busy road will see me and help me. I want to help my family, especially my mum who is now a pensioner,” he said.
