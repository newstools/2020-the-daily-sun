YESTERDAY, a group of fathers marched to the Department of Justice and Correctional Services offices in Tshwane to demand access to their kids. The dads, who are all leaders of various civil society movements in Tshwane, handed over a memorandum to the office of the deputy minister of Justice and Correctional Services Phathekile Holomisa. It was accepted and signed by Musa Mbongwe, an official in the department. One of the marchers, Tshepo Maponyane (40), said there were injustices in the legal system.  “We need to look at factors contributing to this high number. We’re aware that the plight of fathers has been ignored and their rights are being prejudiced. “It’s evident to us that without action by all relevant segments of our society, nothing will change to eliminate this,” Tshepo said. He said the dads’ right to equal parenting was being infringed upon by the courts on a daily basis. One of the demands in the memorandum is that the Children’s Act be properly applied to both parents. “The department must recognise biological basis as a foundation for automatic 50-50 parental rights and responsibilities. “The state must also recognise that family law is based on historical practices and does not address the modern reality of two households,” he said. Mbongwe said he would hand the memorandum to the relevant officials. “I don’t know when you will get feedback,” he told the marchers.
