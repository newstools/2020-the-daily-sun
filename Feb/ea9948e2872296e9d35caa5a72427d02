MIND games have started ahead of the highly anticipated Soweto derby. Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs resume their rivalry when the two most popular sides in southern Africa face off in the Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Chiefs are going to this encounter sitting at the top of the PSL table with 45 points, and Pirates are third with 39. A win for Pirates will see them closing down the gap between them and Chiefs to only three points with Amakhosi having a game in hand. Pirates captain Happy Jele is avoiding the favorite tag and does not believe that the Buccaneers are in the title race. "We are not in the title race, two months ago we were 19 points behind, now we are in the title race?" Jele quizzed during the Soweto derby press conference at Rand Stadium. "It is not happening, some of the guys (other teams) have games in hand and can pick up points." He added: "For us, it is to finish in a good position at the end of the season. This weekend we just need to get the three points" "We have just got momentum now, for us it is important to finish in a good position. We were not happy about the way we started the season; all we need is to go step by step."
