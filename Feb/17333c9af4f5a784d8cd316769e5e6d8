GladAfrica Championship side Ajax Cape Town were thrown into chaos following the bombshell news that head coach Andries Ulderink had resigned with immediate effect. With the Cape side leading the race for promotion to the Absa Premiership - with 10 games of the season remaining - the news of Ulderink's departure couldn't have come at a worse time. The 50-year-old had threatened to resign if the current suspension of Technical Director, Hans Vonk, "for serious misconduct" wasn't lifted by CEO Ari Efstathiou - who decided instead to accept his resignation after refusing to be "blackmailed". "It is extremely disappointing that the coach made the decision to resign based on Vonk’s suspension," Efstathiou said. "Vonk’s suspension has no bearing on the job of the head coach. More disappointing, however, is the timing of his announcement. This is a critical time for the club as it is fighting to win promotion to the PSL." According to sources, the reason behind Vonk's suspension was due to a bust-up with Ajax Under-16 head coach Rowen Hendricks. Vonk reportedly had an exchange of words with Hendricks that turned into a physical altercation after Vonk struck Hendricks. Hendricks is a former Ajax Cape Town midfielder, who also had spells in Russia with FC Rostov and German Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt. Hendricks has subsequently denied the claim, stating that he "resigned for personal reasons two weeks before Hans Vonk's suspension". Ajax Amsterdam shared their frustration in the latest of a series of controversies at the Urban Warriors that has strained the relationship between the two clubs. "As a major shareholder, we are dissatisfied with the recent developments and what has been communicated by Ajax Cape Town. "In our view, Andries Ulderink and Hans Vonk were doing an excellent job," an Ajax Amsterdam spokesperson said. There has been no decision made yet on whether he will be charged or not and whether he will face a disciplinary enquiry. SOURCE: SPORT24
