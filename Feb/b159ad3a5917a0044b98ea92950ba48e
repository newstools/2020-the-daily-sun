Dairy cows that are bred for the ability to produce large quantities of milk, from which dairy products are made, are more likely to suffer from stress and anxiety and at this Russian farm has found the solution to that. According to BBC, the herd donned VR systems adapted for the "structural features of cow heads" and were shown a "unique summer field simulation program".  The Ministry of Agriculture and Food research showed a link between a cow's emotional experience and its milk yield and the VRÂ tests reportedly boosted "the overall emotional mood of the herd". Product developers designed special virtual reality headsets that are specifically suited for the head of a cow. What do the cows see through the glasses, you might ask? A beautifully flowering meadow under the bright summer sun. Researchers will examine the effects of the programme in a long-term study. The developers reportedly hope to expand the project if positive results continue, BBC reports.
