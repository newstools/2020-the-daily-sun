Lately, a new virus has been making itself felt among Christians, especially holier-than-thou ones. They purportedly can tell apart true Christians from fake ones. They claim to be academically qualified and to know the Bible best. I challenge them to prove it by performing the miracles Jesus performed. If they say it’s out of today’s context, is it perhaps not because it’s impossible? I say this because the same pastors and churches who’ve been condemned as fakes, and who’re mostly black, claim to perform miracles in Jesus’ name. If this is inspired by evil, perhaps Christianity has been one big lie for over 2 000 years and people are being taught every Sunday in churches about the impractical, impossible acts of a dead Jesus and his apostles. Lionel Messi is a well-known Argentinian soccer player. Although few or no players can match his expertise, nobody believes what he’s capable of is impossible for others. Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo has proven many times through sheer dedication and determination that Messi can be outplayed. Science shows us what can be done by those who believe in human ability. Christianity is dead and buried in Europe, and secularism is the norm. Let all those who claim to be best qualified in the Bible revive it with their academic knowledge. Then we may perhaps believe in them and their expertise. Because they can’t perform miracles through their great knowledge of the Bible, let them keep quiet until Jesus comes back.
