THE R500 000 bribe offered by Tony Gupta to Vuyisile Kona was a way of welcoming him to the family. The former SAA CEO and board chairman was allegedly offered the money while they were discussing a turnaround strategy for the airline. Kona told the Zondo Commission yesterday he went to the Gupta house in Saxonwold at the insistence of former public enterprises minister Malusi Gigaba’s adviser, Siyabonga Mahlangu. “I asked Mahlangu why don’t they come to Airways Park offices and he looked at me like he was saying uphambene, do you know who you’re dealing with?” Kona said Mahlangu came back again at the end of October and told him the meeting was urgent and they had to go soon. He said Mahlangu kept the names secret until they got to Saxonwold. “When we got there my cellphone was taken,” he said. He said Tony Gupta, Zuma’s son Duduzane Zuma, and Ace Magashule’s son Tshepiso were there. Tony asked about the turnaround strategy for SAA, but before they continued he wanted to welcome him to the family. He said he offered him R100 000 in cash and said they needed to look after each other. When he refused the offer Tony increased it to R500 000.” “I’m not wealthy but I’m surviving on my meagre means. Tony was livid. He wanted to know who would do the turnaround. I told him Lufthansa and the meeting ended immediately.” Kona said Tony was the only one speaking. He said he confided to Dudu Myeni about the meeting. “She was more concerned about whether I drank or ate anything. She said they’d bewitch me. That’s all she was interested in.”
