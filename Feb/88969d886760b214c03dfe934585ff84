THE batsmen came to the party... But the bowlers seemingly had other ideas as the Proteas went down by five wickets to England in their last T20 match in Centurion on Sunday. When Mark Boucher's team posted a respectable 223/6 on a crisp SuperSport Park surface, it looked as though South Africa would finally win a series against England. The partnership of Temba Bavuma (49) and Quinton de Kock (35) produced 84 for the first wicket. However, it was Heinrich Klaasen who left a mark with impressive 66/35 as the Proteas went about putting themselves in a better position to claim the series... or so they thought. As he has been doing in the series, pace bowler Lungi Ngidi got SA off to a good start as he dismissed Jason Roy for seven, taking the first of his two wickets. But Jos Buttler (57) and Johnny Bairstow (64) steadied the ship and laid the foundation for Eion Morgan to finish off with an unbeaten 57/22. Boucher has several questions to answer ahead of the T20 and ODI series against Australia, who visit later this month.
