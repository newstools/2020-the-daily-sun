MOTORISTS have been urged to report police abuse. This comes after many vehicle owners complained about the way cops treat them when they’re stopped, specially at night. To end such behaviour, people have been advised to open cases against police, should they feel abused. Yesterday, Captain Kay Makhubele said they weren’t taking the complaints lightly. “Police management views these allegations in a serious light and assures people action will be taken against any member found on the wrong side of the law.” Makhubele said cops who refuse to open cases after complainants would be dealt with. Social media users described police behaviour as hostile. Landi Lubbe wrote on Facebook: “I stopped trusting the police a long time ago because they think they’re above the law.” Tshepo Makoko said: “The culture of violence in our country is beyond disturbing, and we can’t have police enforcing brutality on motorists.” Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said they were working hard to bust fake cops who rob innocent citizens. Two alleged blue-light hijackers were bust on Saturday in Mabopane. Following several hijackings, Tshwane police launched a manhunt for the occupants of VW Polo or Corsa sedan. “This type of crime is real. The public is urged to use caution if they suspect they’re being stopped by bogus cops. “They should put on hazards and drive to a nearby police or filling station.”
