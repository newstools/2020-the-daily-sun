THE Masekos are struggling to find the means to bury seven-month-old baby Mpilonhle, who died mysteriously in his sleep. Distraught dad Jabulani Maseko (42) from Chrissiesmeer, near Ermelo in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun Mpilonhle died on Sunday. Since then, they’d been wondering how they’d bury him. Jabulani said the People’s Paper was their last hope. “We’re unemployed and my wife and I come from poor families, so there’s no help,” he said. He said it had been a while since he last did odd jobs. Even if he had one, the money couldn’t buy a coffin. “We just want a simple funeral where our baby can be buried in an affordable coffin. “We appeal to Good Samaritans from SunLand to assist us. I can’t sleep knowing my baby’s body is at the mortuary.” His wife Zodwa Yende (27) didn’t know what could have caused her baby’s death. He’d been crying before he was put to bed. “Next thing when I went to check on him that afternoon, he wasn’t breathing. “I took him to a local clinic. He was certified dead on arrival. We appeal to anyone to help us bury our boy so his soul may rest in peace.”
