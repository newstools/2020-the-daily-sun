  STRUGGLERS Black Leopards and AmaZulu have improved their survival hopes.   The two sides, who find themselves in the bottom three on the Absa Premiership standings, won their respective matches yesterday as they look to escape the danger zone.  Leopards edged a rejuvenated Stellenbosch FC outfit 2-1 at the Thohoyandou Stadium while Usuthu beat fellow strugglers Polokwane City 1-0 at the Kings Park Stadium.  Lidoda Duvha, who were playing their first match without suspended coach Cavin Johnson, were determined to end their seven-match winless run.  The last time they tasted victory was against Golden Arrows in November last year, winning that match 2-1 at the same venue.   The Venda outfit were desperate to turn the corner and buy some breathing room at the bottom of the table.   Goals by Mwape Musonda and Thabo Matlaba were enough to hand Alan Clake’s charges the all-important three points while Stellies' goal was scored by Ryan Moon.   Leopards had their goalkeeper Jonas Mendes to thank for the win having made a number of telling saves to keep his side ahead in the match.   But despite the result, Leopards still still occupy a bottom-three spot, tied on 20 points with Usuthu while Polokwane City prop up the table with 17 points.  For Usuthu, their narrow victory over Rise and Shine, broke a five match winless run.   Bongi Ntuli, who has scored the majority of Usuthu’s goals, was once again on target.   He scored the only goal of the match to earn Jozef Vukusic’s boys three valuable points.   The KwaZulu Natal outfit remain in the bottom three with 20 points in 21 matches.   The Premiership will take a break this weekend as teams shift their focus on the Nedbank Cup which kicks off on Wednesday (7.30) when defending champions TS Galaxy face Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
