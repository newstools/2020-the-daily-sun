It is a decision that someone said 'I can love you from outside the relationship. I can love you in the relationship and I can love you outside of it. I don't have to be with you to love you'. But the ideal situation is when people say 'yes, I am me and you are yourself, but together we don't make a winning team. I think we are better apart, but that doesn’t make us bad people, and I chose to be civil with one another, let’s co-parent properly,” she said.
