A rather unusual visitor strolled onto the premises of an Engen filling station in KZN this past weekend. OK Express at Engen in St Lucia posted a short video of a hippo strolling into the filling station. "Just a casual Sunday night stroll in St.Lucia looking for snacks at OK Express ???? The hippo returned back to the lake after grazing around town. St.Lucia town is surrounded by a large lake and extensive natural habitat for wildlife." According to residents from the area,the four legged big creatures were a common site and some warned that hippos were best left alone as they could be very dangerous.
