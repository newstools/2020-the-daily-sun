I recently received in my change a bright and shiny R2 commemorative coin with the inscription: Right to education-1994-2019. Two issues immediately came to mind. Firstly, our current situation doesn’t reflect the quality of that right. Secondly, there’s very little to commemorate considering the manner in which our education system has deteriorated over the said period. We have education but without proper systems, that education is far worse than the Bantu one. This is another reason that clearly shows that the ANC government is failing to manage the country. The only way our education system will improve is when politicians start sending their kids to public schools in the townships.
