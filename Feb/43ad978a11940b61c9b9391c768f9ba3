PUBLIC Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille wants governments departments and municipalities to pay their electricity bills directly to Eskom. De Lille’s department has for years been paying the power utility on behalf of government departments and municipalities.

She said having to carry the burden of other entities left her department with a huge debt as they did not pay it back. The department was fingered as one of the serial defaulters, reportedly owing Eskom R3 billion. De Lille, however, disputed the amount, saying her department owed much less. She said it was also a victim. “Because of these problems we’ve taken a decision that, with effect from 1 April, all government departments and municipalities must pay their debts directly to Eskom,” she said. But she said her department owed some municipalities for rates and services. She said the problem was that the municipalities had inflated the amounts owed to them.

However, our department confirmed – and the municipality also agreed with us – that the signed off outstanding debt only amounted to R6,9 million,” she said. Another municipality, in Gauteng, claimed R185 million but failed to provide proof. Committee chairman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said he was concerned about the minister’s revelations and wanted to know how long this had been going on.
