Actor and fitness junkie Cedric Fourie had to fight for his sexuality once again. The actor who has been constantly called gay on social media decided to set the record straight after a troll commented on his Instagram picture and said he’s gay. Somebody said to me - If you believe you can do it, then you’re already half way there. ??

"Don’t talk about things you don’t know. I’m an LGBTQI+ Ally I’m not gay. Don’t say “facts” when you can’t prove them. I help gay and lesbians have equal rights like all of us. Pictures don’t mean jack, get your facts straight," he said. The trolls against the Skeem Saam actor, who portrays the role of Lehasa Maphosa, began late last year when he was constantly seen with Youtuber LaSizwe Dambuza. Their friendship caused a stir on social media and led to many homophobic comments, and many calling him a waste of a man. They were never ready bruv????‍?? #BFF A post shared by  Cedric Anthony Fourie (@cedric_a_fourie) on Jun 15, 2019 at 9:37am PDT
