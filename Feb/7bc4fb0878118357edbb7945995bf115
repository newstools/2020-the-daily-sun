IMAGINE opening your drawer at work and being pounced by one
of the most dangerous snakes. This horrific scene happened to an Eastern Cape  earlier this week and is currently fighting
for his life in hospital. According to the Graaff-Reinet Advertiser, Johan 'Gerrie'
Germeshuizen was in his office at AF Van den Berg and Son on Monday when he
opened his desk’s drawer and found the snake lying inside. It bit him on his
finger. The local paper 
quoted his sister Thelina  who
said her brother was rushed to a local hospital then transferred to Port
Elizabeth. He is currently in a critical but stable condition according
to TimesLive.
