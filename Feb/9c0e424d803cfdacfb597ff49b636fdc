A passenger was killed in a collision along the N14 near the R511 Diepsloot off-ramp on Saturday evening. ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring, said paramedics arrived on the scene where they found the passenger with fatal injuries still inside of the vehicle. “The driver, a man believed to be 28 years old, was found outside of the vehicle. He had sustained severe abdominal injuries, along with various other injuries,” Meiring said. Meiring alleged that the driver had lost control of the vehicle on the wet road and crashed with the Armco barrier on the side of the road. “A second vehicle with three occupants was also involved in the collision. The three occupants did not sustain any injuries,” he said. “There was sadly nothing that paramedics could do for the fatally injured passenger in the vehicle. He was declared dead on the scene,” he added. Meiring said the driver was rushed to a hospital for further medical treatment. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
