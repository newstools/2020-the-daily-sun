 IT was all good until she drank the duty-free vodka. The drunk mum tried to seduce a passenger on a plane after drinking
vodka on a holiday flight, while she was travelling with her young daughter who sat
nearby. She was taking the seven-year-old on their
first holiday abroad when she offered sex to the man. According to the Daily Mail, the mum left her daughter crying
in their original seats, she then moved to the man’s row on the plane. She then allegedly pulled down her trousers and underwear
and offered to perform a sex act on him. The victim, who had been travelling with his 11-year-old son
on the TUI flight from Manchester to Dalaman in Turkey, pushed her back into
the seat and alerted staff. She and her daughter were put on the next flight back to
the UK after the plane landed. It emerged she became severely intoxicated after mixing the
vodka with diazepam and codeine tablets which she had been taking for a knee
injury, the court was told. The woman received a suspended sentence for sexually
assaulting a man during a TUI flight. Once onboard, she drank vodka 'unaware' of the effects the
booze would have combined with the medication. It’s reported that the woman began drinking in the airport
terminal ahead of the 8pm flight and befriended the man when she saw him with
his son, the court was told. She pleaded guilty to entering an aircraft when drunk and
sexual assault on a male. She was sentenced to a six-month custodial term, suspended
for 12 months, a six month curfew and 15 rehabilitation activity requirement
days. She was also ordered
to sign the sex offenders’ registers for seven years.
