Sinethemba allegedly asked the driver to help him call his family as he didn’t have money on him. She said the driver notified them that Sinethemba was at the rank with no means to get home. “He didn’t have money or the documents he left home with when he went to the university,” said Gugu. She said he was not in a good state when they fetched him at the rank. Sinethemba told them he was kidnapped by people who mistook him for a hijacker who stole their car. “He has been locking himself in his room. As much as we want to know more, we are not going to push him to speak,” said Gugu. READ: MY MUM DATES MY EXES! The People’s Paper reported on Sinethemba’s disappearance on Friday.
