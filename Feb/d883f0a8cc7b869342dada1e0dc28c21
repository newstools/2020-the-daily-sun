THE case against a man accused of assaulting cashier Nthabiseng Jele has been postponed. He appeared in the Rustenburg Magistrates Court yesterday, and the case was postponed to 20 March. He allegedly beat Nthabiseng at Checkers Hyper in Waterfall Mall in Rustenburg, North West, last month. During his previous appearance, Magistrate Portia Matabane postponed the case for further investigations and for the court to be provided with pictures, video footage and medical reports. But the court yesterday found none of those requirements had been fulfilled. According to the state, the docket did not make it to the police station after the last court sitting. As a result, the investigating officer couldn’t carry out further investigations. The accused also changed lawyers. Nthabiseng Jele (28) said she was experiencing pain. “I went back to work last Monday,” she said. “I still have pain in my stomach because I had internal bleeding and was urinating blood. “The attack has made it challenging for me to do my work well. I had a urine tube inserted in my lower abdomen.” Nthabiseng was allegedly beaten after a dispute over the price of an item. Cosatu members carried placards and sang outside court. The accused is out on R500 bail.
