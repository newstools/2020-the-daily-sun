 A Grade 8 pupil has died and two others have been left
injured when a table collapsed as they were sorting books at Phala Secondary
School in Broekman village, Limpopo on Tuesday. Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo on Wednesday expressed
shock and devastation at the death of the pupil "The department learnt that, [on Tuesday], the three
learners were sorting out books in their LTSM resource classroom.
Unfortunately, during the process, the table broke down and fell on the three
learners, injuring them," Boshielo said. The school called the emergency services which rushed the
three learners to Helen Franz Hospital in Bochum. One learner was checked and discharged while the other two
were transferred to the Polokwane Provincial Hospital, where one pupil lost his
life. The other learner is still under medical supervision. "The department is deeply saddened by this tragic
incident and accordingly sends its deepest heartfelt condolences to the family. "We would like to convey our deepest condolences to the
family and the entire school community during this difficult time of grief. It
is sad to lose such a young life. We must work together to support and comfort
each other," Boshielo said. The department has dispatched a psycho-social team to
provide trauma counselling to learners, educators, support staff and the
bereaved family. SOURCE: NEWS24
