SUSPENDED Black Leopards coach Cavin Johnson is recovering from a heart attack he suffered on Friday. This was confirmed by his assistant Alan Clark on Sunday following Leopards’ 2-1 win over Stellenbosch FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium. After the match, Clark passed on his best wishes to Johnson and wished him a speedy recovery in an Interview with SuperSportTV. Clark was on the bench for Lidoda Duvha. This after Johnson was suspended by the Venda outfit last week following a string of disappointing results. The 61-year-old was in charge of Lidoda Duvha for only five matches – four losses and one draw, one point out of a possible 15.
