THE issue of e-tolls needs to be dealt with once and for all. This was the view of the Gauteng ANC provincial executive committee’s lekgotla. “We have made our proposal to the national government that this issue needs to be resolved,” said the party’s deputy provincial chairman Panyaza Lesufi yesterday. Lesufi was accompanied by the party’s provincial secretary, Jacob Khawe. They were addressing the media on the outcomes of the lekgotla held last week. The briefing was held on the sidelines of the special PEC meeting held yesterday at the Gauteng legislature in Joburg. Lesufi also talked about load shedding and state-owned entities. “Load shedding is harming our economy and inconveniencing everyone. Something has to be done about this,” he said. Lesufi said SAA was now called Cape Town Airways because it had cut so many routes that it only flew there. Khawe said the ANC in Gauteng would hold a special PEC next month that would begin the process of shaping its inputs to prepare and make a meaningful contribution to the organisation’s national general council. The secretary said another priority was the completion housing and urban renewal projects, handing over outstanding title deeds and fast-tracking the land release programme. Khawe said they also planned to make the province safe by reducing crime by an ambitious 50%. Khawe said: “Comrade Harry Gwala taught us that we must always prioritise the needs of the people, listen to their concerns and work with them to resolve their problems. “The ANC in Gauteng will develop a programme to mark the life of this leader of our people.”
