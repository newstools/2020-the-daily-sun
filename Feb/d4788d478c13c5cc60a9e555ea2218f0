Music has shaped the life of Ntombee Mzolo (36), the daughter of maskandi singer Ihhash’elimhlophe and singer Linah “Ebony” Khama. “Music has unlocked my inner soul and released my talent and energy,” she said. “I was inspired by my parents. Their dedication and drive have charged me with a burning desire.” She said being part of the Amaponi group, consisting of her sister Vuyisiwe and brothers Nkosinathi and Jabu, has led her to embrace her culture and tradition. “I describe myself as 50/50. I was born to a Tsonga-speaking mother and Zulu-speaking father,”she said. She said when she performs she doesn’t recognise herself. “I don’t know the girl I become. I give it my all,” said Ntombee. She went solo in 2008 and recorded African Sexy, released in 2010. “The sound was inspired by dancehall, house and a bit of pop. I called the genre, popra. This album had tracks like Iskhathi, Sthandwa Sam and Amakhosikazi, which I co-wrote with Sjava. It was nominated for the Samas. It was an upliftment song for women,” she said. Ntombee is married to filmmaker Sizwe Mzolo. They met in 2001 during the shoot of the song Muntuza by her father, whose real name is Bheki Ngcobo. “I was the dancer in the video. It shows that music isn’t only about vocals, and I take dancing very seriously,” said Ntombee. Ntombee’s also a presenter on Come Again on SABC1, which features places in Mzansi with funny names such as Serope sa benya, Tsola borokgo and Phudli ndlala. “Presenting opened other doors like acting. I played Nthabiseng on Mzansi Magic’s short film Baby Come Duze and acted along Sjava and Rami Chuene.” Ntombee’s been a presenter on Metro FM for the past four years. She was part of the breakfast team, Whose Show Is It Anyway, before she moved to Top 40 on Saturday from 10am to 2pm. She now presents Epic Sunday from 3am to 6am. This is where she touches lives and uses her own personal stories to heal.
