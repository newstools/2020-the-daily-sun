A FAMILY of a grade 10 pupil who died when their special scholar transport collided with a truck on Tuesday afternoon, blames the driver for the deadly accident. Kgothatso Mdaka's family from Tibane outside Polokwane, Limpopo say the driver was reckless and didn't check his blind spots when entered the road. The 16-year-old schoolgirl was with her five school mates who survived with serious injuries when the incident occurred. The pupils were being transported in an open bakkie when the horrible crash happened. The pupils were scattered around after the crash with other pupils gathered on the side of the road shocked by the tragic incident. Kgothatso's aunt Caroline Mdaka (61) said that when they arrived at the scene Kgothatso was already dead with others seriously injured. "The school gate is situated a few meters away from the main road. That accident would have been avoided if the driver had checked from both sides, that road is not even busy. "It appears that Kgothatso suffered internal injuries because there was no blood coming out from her body. It will take us some time to accept that she is gone," Caroline said. Mayor Solly Pheedi of Blouberg Municipality, who visited the bereaved family, said they are saddened by the tragic incident. "We came here to give emotional support to the family through this hard time. I went to the school earlier to meet with the pupils and teachers as well, it's hard for everybody there and they are not coping because the accident happened right in front," the mayor said. Sam Makondo, the spokesman for the Education Department in Limpopo, said they sent words of condolences to the bereaved family and wished a speedy recovery to other pupils who survived. "This is a devastating moment for us and already we have sent our social workers to the school for emotional counseling to pupils, teachers and support staff," he said. Kgothatso will be buried on Saturday at her home village of Tibane.
