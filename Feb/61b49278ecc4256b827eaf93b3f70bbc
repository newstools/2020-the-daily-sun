ORLANDO Pirates have all the credentials to win the Absa Premiership Soweto derby against fierce rivals Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Although current form is always thrown out the window during the derby, Bucs have enough credible depth to overcome Amakhosi this time around. Pirates have speedy players like Luvuyo Memela, Vincent Pule, Thembinkosi Lorch, Linda Mtambo and top goalscorer Gabadinho Mhango who can unlock the tightest of defences with ease. Chiefs, however, have been struggling to reproduce the form that saw them open up a 12 point gap at the top of table in the first round. They seem to be low in confidence following their exit from the Nedbank Cup, and that gives Pirates all the ammunition to rub more salt into their wounds. Pirates are on a high, having not lost in their last six league games on the trot since the arrival of German coach Josep Zinnbauer, who replaced caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena in December. Chiefs rely heavily on set-pieces to score goals, while Pirates can score from open play and dead ball situations, plus combination play. Pirates have the ability to win midfield battle with Ben Motshwari, Fortune Makaringe and recently Siphesihle Ndlovu, who can get the better of Willard Katsande and George Maluleka to swing the match in their favour. Pirates have been consistent in their last line of defence, as Wayne Sandilands has made less mistakes compared to his Chiefs counterpart Daniel Akpeyi, who made a blunder that cost Amakhosi the match against Maritzburg United in their last league game. Zinnbauer seems to have a Plan-B when they’re against the ropes, while Chiefs’ Ernst Middendorp loses patience easily on the sideline.
