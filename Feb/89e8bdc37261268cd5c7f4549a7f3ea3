RESIDENTS are still shocked after the discovery of the body of a two-year-old baby girl in a dry, thick bush near a dam on Friday. The little girl from Mngampondo in Eshowe, KZN, had been missing for about five days when she was found dead. She was last seen on Monday at a relative’s home, where she was being cared for. The home is not far from the dam.  Resident Nathi Mazibuko (32) said when the toddler went missing on Monday, local people immediately suspected she had drowned. She said the residents notified the cops, who began the search for the toddler near the dam. During the search, resident Mathula Mdluli drowned on Tuesday. His body was found the following day, according to Nathi. He said the police and residents decided to widen the search for the baby on Thursday. “The baby’s body was found on Friday. It’s clear the toddler might have been kidnapped. She couldn’t have crawled all the way from the relative’s home to the dam,” said Nathi. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said murder and kidnapping cases were being investigated by Eshowe cops after a two-year-old girl went missing at Mngampondo last Monday. Gwala appealed to anyone who might have information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the suspects to call local police or phone CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
