SHOPPERS could not believe what was happening. Some said it looked like a scene from a movie. Thugs fired shots as they tried to rob a cash in transit vehicle in Marabastad, Tshwane, 29 January. A video of the robbery went viral on social media, where a security guard was seen leaving a store carrying a bag of money. Shoppers ducked for cover when armed men approached the guard and robbed the cash van. The thugs fired shots to clear their path as they fled. Marabastad hawker Kedibone Matjila said she saw people running and she took cover as well. “Honestly, I didn’t see the robbers, but I wasn’t far from the incident. I saw a crowd running towards me and didn’t wait. I ran as well. When all was settled, I went back to check my stalls and nothing was taken. But all of a sudden, police were everywhere and the vehicle carrying money was surrounded. That is when I learnt there was a robbery,” she said. Colonel Brenda Muridili said a G4S security guard was leaving Goolam’s Cash & Carry with a money bag when the robbers struck. Muridili said four men with pistols and rifles overpowered the guard and demanded money. She said the guard handed over the bag before running for cover. “The suspects then fled the scene in a white Ford Ranger. “No injuries were reported,” she said. She said no arrests had been made and police were still investigating.
