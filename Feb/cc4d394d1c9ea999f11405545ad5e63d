THE local motor industry has always had Germany’s support through its international automotive workers union. And now, with Mzansi facing massive job cuts in many sectors, about 250 of the union’s members are visiting South Africa to share ideas on how to keep the motor industry afloat during these tough times. On Wednesday, a conference attended by Mzansi union members and their German counterparts was held in Vereeniging, Vaal. Spokesman Klaus Hampejs told Daily Sun their relationship started in the 1990s when they joined a march by Mercedes-Benz workers in East London. “We represented dozens of demonstrators who were released from work. Since then, our relationship has become stronger,” he said. “We’ve come to SA to host our conference, held in different countries each year. We are a non-political organisation that has represented motor engineering workers in Mzansi since the 1980s.” Conference organiser Thandi Sibeko told the People’s Paperthey decided to bring the conference to Mzansi in the middle of massive job cuts. “The organisation wants to share ideas. Mzansi is not the only country faced with this headache,” she said. Sibeko said a mass demonstration was due to take place in the Vereeniging CBD streets after the conference yesterday. “The conference will end on Sunday,” she said.
