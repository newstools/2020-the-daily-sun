Singer Toya Delazy celebrated her 30th birthday in Barbados. Toya has been there from 31 January and she seems to be enjoying her time on the Caribbean island. Both Toya and her bae, Ally Sdi, have been posting on social media. They have been sipping on cocktails, eating lobster and taking rides on yachts. Read: ZOZI: I MISSED MUM'S COOKING!
