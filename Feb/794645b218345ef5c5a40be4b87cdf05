A VIDEO of a couple poking in an office in a Sandton building did the rounds on social media on Friday. The duo were blissfully unaware they were doing the deed in full view of workers in adjacent buildings as their love nest was brightly lit.  The woman, who wore a yellow dress, lay on the table, while the naked man stood. Many people on social media wanted to know who the man was. Some users soon posted a picture of a man who works in the building. The picture was allegedly of an employee at the Sandton-based investment company, Fieldstone Private Capital. The man in the picture allegedly told other media houses over the weekend he intended to hunt down the person who first posted his picture and sue them. “Fieldstone said it was aware of the video but denied the poking took place in its offices,” said Jason Harlan of Fieldstone. “The people in the video are not employees of Fieldstone. “Fieldstone understands the company in whose offices the incident occurred has taken disciplinary action against the participants. “While prurient interest and gossip is perhaps understandable, it is regrettable. “It’s even more regrettable that the good name of our managing director, Zahed Sibda, is being tarnished through allegations made with absolutely no proof. “We’re deeply sorry that an employee of ours has been baselessly accused and are extending every support to him.”
