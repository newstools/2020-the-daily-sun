MEDIA personality and businesswoman Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa has joined Mzansi Magic’s Isibaya! Enhle made the announcement on social media last week. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she’d play the role of Sizakele Sibiya, a character people will love to hate. READ: 'MPINTSHO STOLE MY MONEY!' “Sizakele is a cool chick. She is spoilt and feels as if she owns the world. “She is one of those people you want to smack, but at the same time you like them for being bold enough to say some things. “But as time goes, people will get to see her differently. “Like everyone, she also has problems and she’s trying to overcome the pain she’s been through.” She said she was called by people from Isibaya and they asked if she was interested in playing the role. “When they told me the kind of person Sizakele would be, I was immediately interested. I’m at a stage where I like performing and when I get an opportunity to perform and go all out, I take it and use it. Just like my character from Mzansi Magic’s The Herd,” said Enhle.

I’m a woman for women. I always say this, even on social media. “I just wish I could’ve worked more on the series, but I was busy last year and couldn’t,” said Enhle.
