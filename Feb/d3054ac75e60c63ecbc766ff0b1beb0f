A FRENCH woman has filed a complaint against a baby formula maker. Her infant daughter allegedly vomited a parasitic worm the length of an adult index finger, police said on Wednesday. The incident came after another family allegedly found a living larva in a container of the same milk powder brand, Gallia, manufactured by French firm Danone. Police in the northern region of Brittany said the mother of a three-month-old child came in on Tuesday to file a complaint. “In November, her three-month-old daughter had a high temperature,” Saint-Malo police said. “She brought her to the emergency room, where she was treated. Several days later she vomited a worm about six to seven centimetres long.” The mother told police the worm had been analysed at the hospital and was confirmed to be of a parasitic type. She said she had decided to take action after she learnt via the media of two similar cases. Danone said without the containers having been returned for analysis, “several hypotheses could explain the presence of an insect”, including substandard transportation or storage conditions. The company’s chief financial officer, Cecile Cabanis, said the formula was not exposed to air at any stage during the production chain. – NEWS24
