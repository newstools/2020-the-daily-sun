MPUMALANGA police are looking for suspects who left a bagful of cellphones and laptops in the ceiling of a mall in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge. The discovery was made on Wednesday after one of the guards heard footsteps on the ceiling. The K9 unit was called to the scene but after a long search, the criminals were nowhere to be found. Shocked TSB Security boss Pretty Sibuyi told Daily Sun one of the guards had just gone to the toilet inside the mall during the morning shift at 5.30am. “When he heard footsteps in the ceiling, he quickly called his colleagues, who arrived and raided the scene,” she said. “We saw a hole in a partly damaged ceiling at one of the public toilets and later found a bag ful of new cellphones and two laptops abandoned in the ceiling.” She said two other with new cellphones were also recovered in a clothing store. “The ceiling inside the store was partly damaged. The criminals were nowhere to be found. We called the police and believe the gang might have found a way to escape,” said Sibuyi. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said early on Wednesday morning, unknown suspects gained entry through the ceiling at Ackermans at Thulamahashe Mall. “They stole cellphones and when they were about to go out, they saw security guards and then went back into the ceiling but disappeared.” He said three bags of cellphones and laptops were found. Anyone with information should call their nearest cop shop.
