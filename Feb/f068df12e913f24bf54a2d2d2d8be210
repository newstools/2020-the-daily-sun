DO you know Max McMillan? The Leeds United Under-18s star, has expressed his dream of playing for South Africa at any level in the near future. He explained how he and his family, his father reportedly being South African, have been trying to reach out to the SA Football Association (Safa) without any success, so far. But things could take a different twist for the 17-year-old. From SunSport's information, the youngster who idolises former Leeds captain Lucas "Rhoo" Radebe, is currently being considered by the powers that be at Safa House. But only Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki can make the decision whether to include him in any of the competitions they are playing. McMillan was in action for Leeds United Under-18s as they played away in Old Trafford, as 10-men Leeds lost 1-0 away. McMillan scored a brace last year when Leeds beat Doncaster Rovers.
