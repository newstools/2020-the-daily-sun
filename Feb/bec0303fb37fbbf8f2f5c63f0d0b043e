WHOEVER took Devil’s “kids” has a day to return them or else! Well-known for breeding snakes and driving around with them, the sangoma, whose real name is Sipho Khumalo from Emdeni, Soweto, recently lost seven sheep and two goats. He said he regarded the animals as his spiritual children. “My kids went missing on Friday after a power outage,” said Devil. He said as soon as he realised this on Saturday morning, he followed the trail of the animal’s faeces and was led to a house in Dobsonville.  “I only found two of my sheep from a woman who claimed to rescue livestock. When I demanded the rest, she said a man related to her took the animals,” he said. Devil said he’d be forced to use muthi on whoever took his children as one of the goats was meant to feed his python “Nomadlozi” during the winter season.  One of Devil’s neighbours said he wasn’t evil, but people liked to provoke him. “Devil won’t be on your case for nothing. He minds his business most of the time. “He retaliates only when he’s tested,” said the neighbour.
