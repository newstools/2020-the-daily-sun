 Don't panic, and get a flu shot. This is the advice of Professor Wolfgang Preiser, head of Stellenbosch University's medical faculty's division for medical virology, after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global emergency. By Friday morning, at least 213 people had died in China and almost 10 000 cases of the virus had been reported. The faculty held an information session on the coronavirus presented by Preiser, Dr Jantjie Taljaard (Adult Infectious Diseases) and Dr Nokwazi Nkosi (Medical Virology). Preiser said there was no need for South Africans to panic. He said South Africa's preparedness measures to recognise the virus, are as good as anywhere else in the world. However, if the outbreak is not contained, South Africa could see cases later, like the rest of the world. Preiser said by May or June, South Africa's influenza season will start. The coronavirus' symptoms present the same as influenza. "My advice is to get a flu shot," he said. While lowering the risk of contracting influenza, this will also avoid possible confusion with the coronavirus. History of the coronavirus According to a fact sheet provided by the faculty, in early December 2019 cases of pneumonia started occurring in the city of Wuhan, China, which were not caused by any known virus. By the end of the month, Chinese authorities confirmed an outbreak and that they had closed down a seafood and wildlife market suspected to be linked to it. A week later, the discovery of a previously unknown virus was announced â€“ a coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that include the common cold, SARS and MERS. The new virus was temporarily named "2019-nCoV" and is often referred to as the novel coronavirus. "Any new virus is a concern as health care providers have very limited knowledge of how it affects people or how best to manage it," read the fact sheet. Initially, many patients in Wuhan reportedly had links to the animal market, suggesting that the virus was transmitted by animals. However, a growing number of patients were not exposed to animals, indicating person-to-person spread was occurring. Healthcare-associated transmission has also been reported.  Since then, the disease has been detected in most parts of China and several countries around the globe, usually affecting travellers from areas with documented cases of 2019-nCoV, or people who came into contact with such travellers.               - Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing;  - Stay at home if you have a fever or cough; and  - If possible, reconsider travel plans to areas that have been affected by the outbreak.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-dont-panic-say-sa-experts-20200201
