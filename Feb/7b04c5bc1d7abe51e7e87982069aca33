Television personality and musician Jub Jub can be seen destroying alcohol in a viral video. But Tweeps have tore into him, with some saying he is the last person to be doing that. His actions have been questioned since he was convicted of killing school kids when he plunged into them while driving under the influence. Even though the accident happened ten years ago, Tweeps haven't forgotten and it seems it will forever haunt the star. This toilet is too desperate with these mini PR stunts. The fact remains, children died and some are paralyzed for life. #JubJub https://t.co/kFsT2zWmoZ From killing kids to killing relationships now he is vandalizing the streets? wow, this guy really doesn't want to see South Africa peaceful.?? #JubJub #Loadshedding #floyd https://t.co/PoozBKfoyS Every time I see #JubJub on the trending topic list I look to see if he killed more people with his car.
