THE ANC has distanced itself from former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo’s comments about Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Yesterday, spokesman Pule Mabe said: “Comrade Mahumapelo spoke in his personal capacity, and his views do not represent those of the organisation.” The party was responding to Mahumapelo’s remarks about the motion tabled by the DA to start proceedings to remove Mkhwebane. Mahumapelo claimed the ANC would never vote with the DA to remove the public protector. Mahumapelo was speaking outside the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Friday, where fellow MP and former state security minister Bongani Bongo was appearing on a corruption charge. It was earlier reported that DA chief whip Natasha Mazzone had put in a request to Speaker Thandi Modise three days after parliament adopted formal rules for the removal of a head of a Chapter 9 institution in December. Modise approved the motion. Mabe said the ANC had not yet discussed its position on the motion. “The ANC caucus in parliament, guided by the national office, is the sole authority mandated to pronounce on positions of the ANC on matters before it – not individual members, unless so delegated.” Mahumapelo also claimed there was mobilisation within the ANC to have certain politicians arrested and he believed this was what happened to Bongo. Mabe said: “We encourage leaders and members to exercise their freedom of speech within the confines of the structures and discipline of the ANC.” – NEWS24
