JERUSALEMA hitmaker Master KG was involved in an accident on Friday, but he’s doing fine. Lionel Jamela, co-owner of KG’s label Open Mic Production, confirmed there was an accident but didn’t have all the details. “I don’t have all the details about what happened because it was a minor accident. “It was just the bumper, nothing more. This happened on Friday before he left for his European tour.” He said no one made a big deal out of it because KG was fine. “This happened during a happy time while we were celebrating Jerusalema going platinum, so we didn’t make it anything major. All that matters is that he’s fine and he was able to get onto a plane. He is healthy and entertaining people abroad right now,” he said. The news was shared by Twitter user Mafhunisa on Friday. He said KG was involved in an accident just a month after buying a car and posted a photo of the damaged bumper. Twitter users felt sorry for Master KG.
