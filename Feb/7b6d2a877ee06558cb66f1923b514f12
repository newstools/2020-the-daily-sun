ELIZABETH Motuang told Daily Sun she slept peacefully on Thursday for the first time since her son’s murder in 2016. This came after the men who killed her cop son Sabelo Ngwenya were sentenced to life in prison. The 65-year-old from Eden Park, Ekurhuleni, said she also had a dream in which Sabelo looked peaceful. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, she said she was not completely satisfied as her son’s killers were still alive. “My son is dead. I wish they got the same judgment they gave to my son when they shot him in cold blood. My son was the breadwinner. Ever since he died, things have been very difficult,” she said. Halisani Gumede (37), Lungisani Madlala (24) and Ntuthuko Mseleku (27) were sentenced to a total of six life terms and 500 years in jail by the South Gauteng High Court. When Judge Cassim Moosa handed down the judgment, the victims’ families ululated. The three were found guilty of crimes including murder, attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances. They killed Sabelo and businessman Ephraim Mdaka in Eden Park during a robbery at a tavern owned by Ephraim. They also tried to kill security guard Teboho Mokoena. Sabelo lived near the tavern and tried to intervene as Ephraim begged for his life. He was shot dead and his service pistol was taken. Ephraim’s wife Evon (43) said her husband was a pillar of strength to her. “Since his death, life has been difficult.” NPA Advocate David Mothibe said he was happy with the sentencing.
