GAVIN Hunt is not one to around singing the praises of his peers. But the Bidvest Wits coach can’t help but notice the incredible work Josef Zinnbauer has been doing since he arrived at Orlando Pirates. Hunt outwitted the German, ending his seven-match unbeaten run when the Students knocked Bucs out of the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round. Yet he has insisted Pirates are on the right track and could may have well won the drama-filled cup game. “All credit to Josef. He has done a good job so far. He is turning the team around. The players are moving, they are entertaining. Mhango (Gabadinho) has been hiding for three years, but now he’s scoring again. You’ve got to give credit to Josef and the players. I’m sure they’ll be a threat in the league with the remaining matches. In football you need the know-how.”
