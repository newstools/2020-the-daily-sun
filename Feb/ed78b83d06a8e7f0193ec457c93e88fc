Parallel parking is not for everyone and by the looks of things traffic cops also fall into this category. A video of
a Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officer trying to parallel
an Isuzu bakkie has gone viral on social media. In the
video, a JMPD officer can be seen instructing the driver of the JMPD bakkie to
reverse into the parking bay, but the driver fails to do it properly the first
time. The driver
tries several times before finally being able to parallel park the bakkie. It is not
clear when and where the video was taken.
