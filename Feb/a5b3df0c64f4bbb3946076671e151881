RESIDENTS of Dawn Park in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, heard gunshots on Sunday night. When they went to investigate, a couple lay in a pool of blood in the street. It was Constable Peter Monyepao (37) from Vooslorus cop shop and his wife Precious (31). WATCH: I MARRIED 6 WIVES, 8 TO GO! It appeared the constable used his service pistol to shoot his wife before turning the gun on himself. When Daily Sun visited the house yesterday, the couple’s families wouldn’t say much. “No one was there so no one knows exactly what happened,” said Peter’s uncle, Jackson (49).  He got a call from Peter’s mum Gladys Baloyi (55) telling him about the incident. “I was shocked. These two never fought. They were in love. “We can’t say much about rumours they fought over a phone. No one heard the argument.” MAKHI DEMANDS SEX! They had been married for over 10 years and had three kids. “In all those years we never heard them arguing.” Gladys said her son was not violent.  “He talked problems through and didn’t solve them using violence,” she said. Precious’ brother Calvin Mampuru (32) said: “I don’t know what could have led to this.” The families said they would work arrange the burial together. Captain Kay Makhubele said police were investigating a murder case and an inquest docket had been opened.
