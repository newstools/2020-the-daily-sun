AMAZULU striker Milos Lacny is adamant they will collect maximum points when they host Polokwane City at the Kings Park Stadium today (3.30pm). The Slovakian has asked everyone associated with the club not to panic. The Durban-based Usuthu and Rise and Shine hold the last two spots on the Absa Premiership table. Usuthu have 17 points from 20 games. They are at the bottom as they have scored the least number of goals, which is 11. On top of that, Usuthu are the only club in the new year that are yet to get off the mark. This has resulted in the club calling the old head of former coach Clive Barker to have a pep talk with the players as he has seen it all previously. The legendary South African coach won the Coca-Cola Cup with Usuthu in 1992, the last trophy the club won. Said Lacny this week: “We train daily and work hard. I’m sure everything will change. We played well against Orlando Pirates (the game Usuthu lost 1-0 last weekend). “And this weekend against Polokwane, I can assure you we’ll do a good job.” For coach Jozef Vukusic, who mentored Polokwane last season, is relieved he won’t be facing stronger oppositions in the next coming weeks. After Polokwane, the next three fixtures are Bloemfontein Celtic, Golden Arrows and Chippa United. They are sides considered in their levels. Usuthu resumed the second round against Mamelodi Sundowns: lost 3-0, drew 2-2 with Cape Town City, lost 2-0 to SuperSport United and then last weekend’s 1-0 loss to Orlando Pirates. These are teams considered to be tougher oppositions in the PSL. “It’s good for us as these teams are different compared to those we played. I was happy with how we performed.” Meanwhile, Usuthu have stripped Thapelo Xoki (formerly known as Nyongo) off the captain armband. It has gone to goalkeeper, Siyabonga Mbatha.
