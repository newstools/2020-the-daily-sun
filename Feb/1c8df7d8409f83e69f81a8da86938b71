They were thrown out of the Tshwane West building in Luttig Street by security guards on Monday. READ: MAKHI DEMANDS SEX! After failing to negotiate with the guards and the fake owner, they allegedly torched the building. A tenant said the people who evicted them should have taken into consideration the fact that they were not aware the building had been hijacked. “We were prepared to work with the rightful owners to get to the bottom of the matter. “The person who hijacked the building is a thug. Once we told him what was going on he switched off his phone. We suspect he destroyed his SIM card,” he said. He said the tenants had already paid rent for the month and asked to move out at month-end. “We’re waiting to get paid and don’t have any money. Where will we go? I suspect we were treated like this because a lot of the tenants are foreigners,” he said. READ: CASH GUARD VANISHES WITH R4M!
