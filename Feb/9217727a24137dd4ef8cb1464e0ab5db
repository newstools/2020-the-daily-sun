AFTER years of struggling, Ebony Park residents finally have a new clinic. The 24-hour clinic was opened in Midrand to service people of Ebony Park and surrounding areas. Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo said residents’ grievances had finally been answered. Speaking at the opening ceremony recently, he urged residents to look after the clinic. “The evidence of service delivery lies within the clinic we are opening today,” he said. The clinic will open seven days a week and will offer primary healthcare, casualty, midwife obstetrics and emergency care. Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku said: “We had to allow the clinic to start running before we officially opened it and so far, we have delivered more than 55 babies without any problems.” Masuku said he was dedicated to making sure patients received quality service. Resident Dineo Maseko said she was happy to see there were enough consultation rooms. “Finally we have a clinic near our homes and we won’t travel to other areas for assistance.” Gogo Nomvula Thamaga (70) said their prayers have been answered at last. “We used to travel long distances to get our monthly check-ups and treatment.” Former Joburg health MMC Mpho Phatlatse accused the ruling party of lying to residents by claiming the ANC built the clinic. “We don’t claim this as a victory for the DA but rather as a victory we share with all Joburg residents who benefitted from a clean government,” she said.
