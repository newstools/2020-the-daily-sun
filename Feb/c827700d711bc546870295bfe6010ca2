The Serious Commercial Crime Investigative is pleading with the public for assistance regarding the whereabouts of Owen Bruce James (41). He is wanted by the police for questioning concerning a fraud case. According to Captain Anelisa Ngcakani, the Eastern Cape Department of Education learned that 14 fraudulent transactions were made on the 30th April of 2010 at the department where payments were made to four schools. “It is alleged that the bank details to which the fraudulent payments were made to did not belong to legitimate beneficiaries of the department. It is further alleged that internal payment procedures were flouted,” Ngcakani said. Ngcakani said investigations revealed that one of the bank accounts that was used for payments belonged to James. “Approximately R600 000 was allegedly deposited into his account and this amount was withdrawn from this account on the 1st of April 2010,” Ngcakani said. Ngcakani further said the Zwelitsha Magistrate court issued a warrant of arrest for James on the 8 of March 2016. It is believed that he currently resides in Johannesburg.Should Sun Readers know the whereabouts of James, they are urged to contact the Investigating Officer Lieutenant Colonel Zane Johnson, on 082 941 8588
