 He may be dismissed as a chatterbox,
desperate to elevate his profile through a wider Nedbank Cup platform. But outspoken VUT coach
Standford Nkoane may have provided some food for thought for his Mamelodi
Sundowns counterpart, Pitso Mosimane. As expected, Sundowns bundled
the Vaal university side out of the Nedbank Cup with a 2-0 win in their Last 16
duel on Sunday. Mosimane has raised
concerns about the ageing calvery-men in his armoury, pointing to Hlompho
Kekana, Wayne Arendse and Kennedy Mweene among others. Nkoane was gracious in
defeat, but insisted they matched their more illustrious opponents and that they
should have done more to exploit Downs’ ageing and slow defence. “I didn’t expect the result.
We knew they were going change the team and the guys that were playing were not
match-fit,” said Nkoane. “In my analysis from the
games I have seen whilst preparing my team, I knew the Sundowns defence,
especially the centre-backs, are slow and ageing. “In terms of pound to
pound I think we matched them because they were superior in certain moments and
we were superior in certain moments “The midfielders, without Kekana they will miss the javelin crosses and passes, which was a plus for
us. I knew Mabunda (Tiyani) can't play long, Sammy Seabie can’t play long. And that
could have worked in our favour. “We did our best, but our
best wasn’t good enough. Football will humble you. But I’m proud of my players and
myself as a coach. This is a lesson and I hope
we will take it with going forward. We will also go back and see where we got
it wrong.”
