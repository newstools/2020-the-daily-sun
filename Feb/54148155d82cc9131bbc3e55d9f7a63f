TV AND radio sports personality Mpho Letsholonyane has announced her return to radio after she left Metro FM just over a year ago, as she'll be joining Power FM's team from 2 March during the 1pm-3pm slot. She said: "Let me try explain this as best I can. I am still a woman in sport. Will always be. BUT #PowerLunch is a lifestyle show. We’ll dabble in sport here and there, but the show is more about me as a mother, wife, sister and citizen of SA talking about topics that matter to us all." Mpho started her broadcasting career with youth radio station, YFM and moved into television when she joined SuperSport a decade ago in 2009. She then joined SABC in 2013, hosted shows like SafaTV, which aired on SABC1 every Saturday at 1.30pm andalso co-hosted Metro FM’s breakfast show, as well as hosting a sports show on Thursdays from 6-7.20pm. In 2018, she made history by becoming the first woman to host a soccer world cup final on television for the public broadcaster. I’m overwhelmed by the love.
