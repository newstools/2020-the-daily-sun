ORLANDO Pirates dribbling wizard Fortune Makaringe says he cannot shy away from expressing himself when he is on the pitch. Last month Makaringe was slammed by Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane for showboating when Pirates defeated Sundowns 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium. The former Maritzburg United skilful player was seen doing some trick and that did not sit well with Mosimane. Mosimane said that his silky skills are not good for football, it is only good for Kasi games. With the highly anticipated Soweto derby on Saturday, there is a lot expected from the 26-year-old player. And Makaringe says only the game will determine  whether he will do tricks or not. He said: “Everything happens due to what you see on the field. We haven’t played the game so I wouldn’t say I’m going to do a skill. “For me, if you can do something with the ball it is a skill, I don't know what is showboating,” Makaringe claimed. “That’s how I grew up, if you see that opposition is putting you under pressure someone needs to do something to inspire my teammates, to say we are still in control. They are coming at us, so we should kill their momentum to calm them a bit.” Makaringe says whoever gets the nod will be ready for the midfield battle that is likely to happen between George Maluleka, Willard Katsande who are likely to start for Chiefs. “We don't know who is going to play on both sides. It is a midfield battle that everyone is looking forward to. But everyone in the team is ready to play.” He continued: “The guys have shown hunger and ready to represent the team with dignity. I am one of those who are want to raise the hand and say coach (Josef Zinnbauer) I can fight for you" “We cannot shy away from the fact that Chiefs are at the top of the log. "But we just need to focus on our game, make sure we play our entertaining football and go forward to score goals  to ensure we win the derby.”
