STRUGGLING Chippa United coach Norman Mapeza believes his side will bounce back from their recent slump. The Chilli Boys suffered their second successive Absa Premiership defeat when they lost 2-1 to high-flying Soweto giants Orlando Pirates at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday. Chippa have now gone four league matches without a win having lost twice and drawn the same number of matches. The last time Chippa won a match was on 8 January when they beat Black Leopards 2-1 at Thohoyandou Stadium. Their poor form has seen the Port Elizabeth-based outfit drop down to 12th on the table with 20 points and they could find themselves fighting relegation if their form doesn’t improve. Mapeza says he will use the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round match against defending champions TS Galaxy at the same venue on Wednesday to lift his players’ confidence. “We lost the game against Pirates in the first half. I think we made errors which cost us. Now we need to bounce back on Wednesday. Despite the defeat, there are lot of positives to take and use against Galaxy. It will be tough as Galaxy are defending champions. But we have to return to winning form which will be a huge confidence boost to our league run.” However, Mapeza has taken solace from the fact that Galaxy, who beat Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in the final to lift the Ke Yona trophy, have also been struggling in the GladAfrica Championship. Ironically, Dan Malesela’s side also occupy 12th spot on the Championship table with 23 points from 20 matches. They have gone five consecutive league matches without a win. The Mpumalanga-based outfit, who made a history last season by becoming the first Championship team to win the Nedbank Cup, have suffered three defeats and two draws. The last time Galaxy secured a win was on 5 January when they beat Jomo Cosmos 1-0 at Kameelrivier Stadium.
