Mpumalanga tycoon Sam Chabalala (24) was granted R500 000 by the Middelburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Magistrate Hlengiwe Mkhabela told the court the applicant is a suitable candidate to be released on bail. "The applicant in this matter is not a flight risk. He was given conditions on his previous corruption case that he abides by up to this day. There is no evidence that he will attempt to invade the trial or interfere with the witnesses. There is no evidence before this court to indicate his past cases," she said. Pertaining his citizenship Mkhabela said he is going to treat Chabalala as a South African until its proven otherwise. "The charges against him are strong, I'm of the view that the applicant is very much aware of the seriousness of the case and he is to attend every court appearance until the matter is finalised," she said. Chabalala was arrested on 13 February facing an additional charge of corruption after he tried to bribe a senior cop to release his impounded Mercedes-Benz X Class. He allegedly paid R50 000 as a down payment and a further R70 000 which totals to R120 000 for the release of his vehicle and the docket to disappear. When he was arrested, he was still out on R200 000 bail facing charges of fraud, corruption and possession of an unlicensed firearm. The owner of Sam Holdings attracted the public's attention after flashing his 72 expensive cars in a convoy that was heading to the Durban July event last year. His case was postponed to 13 March for further investigations.
