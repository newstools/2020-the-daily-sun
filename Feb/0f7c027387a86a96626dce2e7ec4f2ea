A 41-year-old man was arrested in Khayelitsha after he was
allegedly found in possession of stolen Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa
(Prasa) cables worth R300 000. The police found the cables in a container in Site C that
allegedly belonged to the man. "Once charged, the suspect will make a court appearance
in the Khayelitsha [Magistrate's Court] to face the charge against him,"
Western Cape police spokesperson Colonel Andr√® Traut said. "Cable theft has a detrimental effect on the economy of
our country, and we urge the public to report any suspicious behaviour in this
regard to Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or by using our mobile application My

rounds of ammunition. "She will make a court appearance in Blue Downs
[Magistrate's Court] once she has been charged," Traut said. SOURCE: NEWS24
