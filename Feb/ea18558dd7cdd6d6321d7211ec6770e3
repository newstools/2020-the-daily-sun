Iam very disappointed in some protesting students’ behaviour. Students at UKZN apparently torched the campus’ HIV centre, on which many lives depended. No amount of education can mentally liberate people if they lack consciousness. Violent protests can’t be allowed to continue. We’ve seen this before: students getting violent and expecting the law to ignore this. What kind of country are we building if application of its laws is selective? A little more than a month ago one student, who in the past behaved like a hooligan, was given a presidential pardon. We’re setting a bad precedent. Students are not above the law! Yes, it’s okay to protest. But they must also think about the next generation. The future generation must not find itself studying under trees because some pseudo-revolutionaries torched varsity or school infrastructure. There’s nothing revolutionary about burning an HIV centre.
