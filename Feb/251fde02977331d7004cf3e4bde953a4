RESIDENTS of Burundi squatter camp at Mfuleni, in Cape Town wanted the city to clean the canal, saying it made them sick. Noluvo Nduku (30) said they’d been reporting the problem but nothing had happened. “This thing is making us sick. We’re breathing kak and we can’t smell what we are cooking because of this.” She said her kids were getting rashes and couldn’t stay outside for long. “No one cares about us,” she said. Another resident said the city didn’t care about people living in shacks. “We’re only important when they want our votes. “Everyone knows us when they want to gain something, but when we want services they don’t. That’s how we are being treated in this kasi.” Nomxolisi Mongo (40) said kids often played in the canal after school. “We try to look after them but some of us are working, so we can’t keep an eye on them all the time,” she said. Transport MMC Felicity Purchase said the Burundi canal was cleaned twice a year. “Clean-ups occur between October and December after the winter rains and then again between March and May in preparation for the coming winter rains,” she said. The canal was last cleaned between October and November and the next planned clean-up was for between next month and April.
