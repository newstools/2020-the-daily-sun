FROM the beginning of time, women have always found ways to keep themselves spiritually uplifted and strong. Thousands of South African women from all backgrounds and cultures led a protest against the abusive pass laws to the Union Buildings of Pretoria in 1956. Before her untimely death, anti-apartheid activist and politician Winnie Madikizela-Mandela attended her last church service at Meadowlands Methodist Church in Soweto on Easter Friday wearing her church uniform. These celebrities Thandi Matlaila, Kgopedi Lilokoe and Slindile Nodangala are proud of their strong spiritual path and they wear their church uniforms with pride. Also actress, TV director and fine artist Mmabatho Montsho staged a timeless exhibition titled Manyano, which means kopanelo (togetherness), at the Women’s Jail at Constitution Hill two years ago. The artist had said the exhibition was focused on the history of the women of the Methodist Church.
