Angry protestors took to the streets and marched to the offices of the City of Cape Town demanding jobs. "Votsek  Dan Plato and City of CapeTown Votsek!”were some of the chants from the group of workers who are mostly contracted as to Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) workers on six months contracts.  “We are tired of being on contract, if they keep us on contracts it means they need us why cant they just employ us. We are tired,”said Lelethu Mchiza(33) from Mfuleni. Metro secretary for SAMWU Michael Khumalo said the problem has to be fixed because people the services of these contracted people are needed by the municipality. He said the EPWP workers are being underpaid by the municipality and having people employed permanentky would protect them from being exploited. “There are people who employed by the city through labour brokers and these people, a labourer gets R1800 per week but we have EPWP workers doing similar jobs getting R1800 per month. Labour brokers are in a business, they take their money first before paying these people money but they still get that amount. Where is the money going?” said Khumalo. Another protest leader Luvo Nabe said they are not taking lightly that they want to speak to the mayor Dan Plato but he sends some people to attend them. “Patricia De Lille never used to do this to us, she would come and address us, why not Plato?” said Nabe. Michael Webster the director of Water and Waste who attended the grievances of the group said they are still seized with the memorandum submitted by the same group in December. He promised that there grievances will be responded to by 14th of March as he described the demands to be of complex nature as they involve a number of portfolios. “We want jobs now not in March!,” marchers chanted but the leaders called them out to be patient.
