THERE has
been yet another postponement in the Richard Mdluli and Mthembeni Mthunzi case
at the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg. The
sentencing proceedings which resumed on Monday were postponed to next month for
gathering of victim impact statements. Judge Judge
Ratha Mokgoatlheng postponed the case to allow the probation officers to
conduct victim impact statements, which were missing from their pre-sentencing
reports. The
probation officers, indicated to the court that they were told by the state
that they shouldn’t worry about the victim impact statement, as they were handling
that. However, in
the interesting turn of events, it appears that there might have been a
miscommunication or misunderstanding between the prosecutors and probation
officers. The
prosecutors said they never barred the probation officers from interacting with
the victims. Yesterday,
Mdluli was expected to take the stand, but couldn’t do so due to the
postponement. On Tuesday,
probation officer Mulalo Nemutandani, gave her pre-sentencing report, which was
missing the victim impact statement, allegedly because of the instruction by
the state. She then
recommended that Mthunzi get correctional supervision instead of direct
imprisonment due various factors and his personal circumstances. However,
State prosecutor Zaais van Zyl disputed and said that recommendation doesn’t
suit this case. But that
recommendation, could possibly change depending on what Mulalo get from the
consultation she will have with the victims. Mdluli and
Mthunzi are convicted with kidnapping and assault charges. Mthunzi on
Tuesday told the court that he maintains his innocence and had nothing to do with
the crimes.
