THE ANC seems deeply divided on the future of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. On Sunday, 10 ANC MPs visited the embattled Mkhwebane at her Tshwane home to show their support for her ahead of the tabling in parliament of a motion to remove her from office. On 24 January, National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise approved the DA’s motion for Mkhwebane’s removal. Mkhwebane last week approached the courts to stop the process. But Modise announced on Friday political parties had submitted nominees for the panel of three to decide whether there was a case against her to refer to the National Assembly. In her court papers, Mkhwebane claimed some ANC MPs were hostile towards her when she appeared in parliament and would not act impartially. She confirmed to Daily Sun yesterday a number of ANC MPs had visited her but wouldn’t give their names. She was only prepared to confirm Bongiwe Mbingo-Gigaba and Nomsa Kubheka were among them.  She also said they were all women. “Yes, it’s appreciated they can see another woman is under attack. They were worried about what was going on and they thought they should come and hear it from the horse’s mouth,” she said.  Mkhwebane’s application to interdict the process to remove her from office will be heard on 17 March. But it seems Modise is going ahead with establishing a panel to look into the matter. The panel will have 30 days to make findings and recommendations that will be handed over to the National Assembly.
