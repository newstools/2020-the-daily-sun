UP and coming boxing trainer Damien Durandt has produced his first world champion and became youngest trainer to win the World Boxing Council (WBC) crown. His charge Ilunga Makabu Junior outpointed Michael Cieslak over a 12 rounds Friday night in front of his home crowd of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. He dominated the Polish opponent and scored 114-112, 115-111, and 116-111 to capture the vacant WBC cruiser weight belt. Durandt, 29 who is the son of the late legendary boxing trainer Nick “Mthakathi” Durandt stepped on his father’s legacy. His father won the much-sought after WBC belt with Thulani “Sugar Boy” Malinga at the age of 33. Durandt senior was a successful local boxing trainer produced 38 world champions, 27 international titlists and 95 South African title holders. He died on April 2017 after his motorbike was involved in an accident in Free State. Before heading for the central African nation the young trainer said he hoped that a history repeats itself. “I’m proud to have this opportunity and being alongside him to achieve this and I hope history repeat itself, my dad did it with Malinga I hope I do it with Junior. I would love to bring the WBC title to Africa,” he said. The dedicated mentor started working as a licensed corner-man along side his father at the age of 14.
