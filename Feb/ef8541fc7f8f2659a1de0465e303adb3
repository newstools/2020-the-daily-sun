Former president FW de Klerk made what could be the worst comment in his political career when he said apartheid wasn’t a crime against humanity. This reckless statement has the potential to do a lot of harm to his image as a respected statesman. De Klerk’s ignorance – or is it arrogance – and willingness to remain unapologetic for the sins of this unjust and evil system have stirred emotions among previously oppressed masses. The EFF saw red when they saw him at the Sona last week. A little while ago DA leader Helen Zille got herself into a similar situation when she glorified colonialism. She later retracted her statements following criticism and due to pressure. However, it appears Zille’s bitter experience didn’t teach De Klerk anything. We live in a country where racial tension is as common as the common cold. Leaders need to think carefully when debating sensitive issues. Letter by Matt Monama from KwaThema
