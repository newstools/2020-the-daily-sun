Two suspected coronavirus cases have been reported in
KwaZulu-Natal although there was not yet any laboratory confirmation, the
provincial health department said on Thursday.  Spokesperson Noluthando Nkosi said one case was being
handled by a departmental facility, while the other was at a private facility
in Durban.  "The department is monitoring the treatment and
management of these patients quite closely."  Nkosi said the public would be notified should there be any
new developments, urging people to "remain calm and avoid being misled by
false statements which are peddled on social media platforms".  On Wednesday, a patient in Limpopo was cleared after being
held in isolation at Ellisras Hospital in Lephalale.  According to the provincial health department, this had been
a precautionary measure after the man developed a high fever and other symptoms
consistent with a respiratory disease.  According to Al Jazeera, at least 25 countries have
confirmed cases of the virus.  On Wednesday, the death toll from the outbreak in mainland
China rose to 563, it reported.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-two-suspected-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-kzn-health-department-20200206
