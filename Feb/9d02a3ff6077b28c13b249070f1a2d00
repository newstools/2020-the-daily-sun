THE 26-YEAR-OLD mum from Nyanga is worried about the way her daughter is being treated at school. “My daughter has had a problem with her ears since she was hit by a car when she was two,” she said. She told Daily Sun last week her daughter, who’s now 10 and in grade 4, became sick and she took her to the clinic. The next day her daughter was sent home from school. She told her mum the class teacher had told her to go home because she had been absent from school for two days. “I didn’t report it the first day, and on the second day I took her to the clinic,” said the mum. When she went to school she was told her daughter was troublesome and she’d have to find another school. “I’m shocked. I don’t know where they want me to take my daughter at this time of the year. “The principal took the teacher’s side without listening to my story.” She said her daughter was being bullied by other pupils because she also has a problem with her eyes. “I reported that she was being bullied but the teacher didn’t take any action,” she said. “I need the education department to help me because I don’t know what to do.” The department’s Bronagh Hammond said if channels of communication have broken down between the principal and parent, they must contact the district. “The district will follow up with the school on the allegations,” said Hammond.
