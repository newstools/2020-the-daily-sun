SA Under-17 women's national team coach Simphiwe Dludlu is happy with the talent at her disposal as she looks to send Mzansi to another World Cup. Dludlu, who was in charge when Basetsana participated in the 2018 FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup in Uruguay, is eager to return to the biggest stage. Basetsana begin their quest to qulify for their second consecutive World Cup when they face Zambia in the first round of the qualifiers. The first leg will take place at Nkoloma Stadium in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on Friday. Dludlu and her technical team have released a total of ten players from their initial squad of 33 players. Karabo Mohale,Taylor- Ann Berkovic, Tarran January, Snothisiwe Jele, Ronnel Donelly, Christy Noble, Shannon Macomo, Palesa Makaloba, Inathi Makaya Lechia Oliver and Emihle Hallam have all not made the cup. They will, however, remain in the database for future camps. “We felt that these players are a little bit behind of the rest of the group," reveleaded Dludlu. "Some of them are not fit enough just yet, but these are issues we will work on because they are part of the bigger plan." The winner between Bantwana and Zambia over the two legs will advance to the second round, where they will face either Botswana or Morocco.
