ITUMELENG Khune was chosen to start in the Nedbank Cup match against Highlands Park ahead of Daniel Akpeyi. Akpeyi has been the regular starter most of this season with Khune recovering from a lengthy injury. The competition has given the Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp a good headache whenit comes selecting his keepers. Akpeyi committed a serious blunder that resulted in Amakhosi losing 2-1 to Maritzburg United last week Saturday
