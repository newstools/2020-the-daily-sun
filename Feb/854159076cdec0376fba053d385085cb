A THIRD suspect has been bust in the Wanter Dlamini murder case. The 62-year-old was raped and strangled early last month, allegedly by a group that included her two daughters who were after an R80 000 insurance payout. Her body was found in the bush in Barberton, Mpumalanga. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police arrested a 36-year-old man early on Saturday morning. “We got a tip-off from residents that the suspect was in Mbombela. He was found hiding under a bridge.” The suspect is expected in the Barberton Magistrates Court today. Wanter’s 30-year-old daughter allegedly invited her to visit and organised her 41-year-old friend and two men to kill her. “When Wanter arrived, she was allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and gang-raped by the two male friends while her daughter and her friend held her down,” said Hlathi. He said when they were done, they allegedly wrapped the body in a blanket and hid it in an outside toilet. Wanter’s other daughter (39) allegedly organised transport to get rid of the body. The daughters made their first court appearances on Monday and Tuesday. They are due in court on Wednesday for a bail application. In November, a life insurance policy was taken out in Wanter’s name by an unknown person. Wanter’s niece (60) last week told Daily Sun the daughters had tried to poison their mum in the past. Hlathi said two suspects were still at large. He urged residents to assist the police in arresting them.
