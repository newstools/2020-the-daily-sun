FORMER Bloemfontein Celtic striker Moses Spandeel revealed that this is his last season playing football. The 39-year-old, who plays for ABC Motsepe League outfit Hungry Lions, has been playing football for many years. The Klerksdorp-born veteran player made a name for himself when he was still playing for PSL outfit Bloemfontein Celtic. “I am retiring at the end of the season,” said Spandeel after Lions were booted out of the Nedbank Cup last 16 following a 4-2 defeat by Absa Premiership side Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. “But I hope to stay with Lions and help them in another capacity. They have a good project and I would love to be part of it, even when I retire. I would love to continue playing but I think it is time to hang up my boots.” Spandeel said he is proud of the performance his young teammates displayed against Bakgaga. “I am not disappointed with the defeat,” he said. “I think the boys played well and losing on penalties can happen to anyone. This is a good experience for the boys and I hope they will take it to build their future. We will also use the experience gained here in our league run.” Lions coach Henry Basie also shared the same sentiment. “We did well and we will go back to Postmasburg with our heads held high,” said Basie. “I think it was a tough three weeks as we have been playing away. We played Jomo Cosmos and Baroka, which was not easy. But we did good and made a history for this club. I am happy for the boys.” On Spandeel’s plan to retire, Basie said: Moses is a good guy and gives us everything at training and in the match. It’s good for youngsters to have him in the team. They (Boys) are learning a lot from him. We love to have him in a team.”
