SHE needed a place to live with her children and grandchildren. But she fell into the arms of a scammer who fled with her R9 000. Sarah Mailula (59), who is living with a disability, now lives under a transmission tower next to a railway line. She’s waiting for the woman to give her a piece of land in Amanda Park squatter samp in Kameldrift, east of Tshwane. Sarah said the sweet talking woman promised her heaven on earth. She said although she knew the stand would be in an squatter camp, the woman told her the yard would have water, a pit toilet and enough space. “None of those were delivered. Instead she put me under these pylons. Our lives are in danger.”  Sarah said the woman told her she would live under the transmission tower for a month while she prepared a proper stand for her. “It has been over six months and she is now avoiding me. She no longer takes my calls and wants nothing to do with me,” she said. She said the woman took advantage of her and her situation. “I survive on grants and we struggled to eat for months because I was saving money to pay her. My four children are unemployed and I also support my three grandchildren,” she said. “I’m discouraged to go to the police because I’m told our transaction was not legal, but I was desperate and still am. I now want what she promised me or my money back,” she said. Daily Sun contacted the woman, but she hung up when Sarah’s name was mentioned and switched off her phone.
