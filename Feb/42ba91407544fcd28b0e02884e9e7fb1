The South African Police Service (SAPS) hosted an Imbizo to promote partnership between the community and police in Alexandra Township on Sunday. Crime, drugs and lack of lawfulness are major concerns for people residing in the township. Residents shared their grievances with the Deputy Minister of Police, Cassle Mathale who was engaging with the community members. Speaking at the event, Mathale said they were working hard to minimize crime in the area. "We are mandated to listen to you, to work with you to resolve your issues through our crime prevention strategy," he said. "Organize yourselves as the people of Alex and speak in one voice, that when you call us as government you speak in one voice," Mathale added. The Imbizo comes after the tragic shooting of Samantha Radebe who was fatally shot allegedly in a crossfire between police and car hijacking suspects in the township early in January this year. The National Commissioner of the SAPS, General Kehla Sithole said Alexandra police station as the most troubled station in the country. "The journey for a safe South Africa starts here in Alexandra as one of our turnaround strategies," said General Kehla. On the day, mobile stations were brought to the people who had attended the imbizo so they could register their cases. A resident, Nomsa Thela (33) told Daily Sun that they were concerned about the rate of crime in the area. "Criminals are doing as they please because police presence around the community is lacking," she said.
