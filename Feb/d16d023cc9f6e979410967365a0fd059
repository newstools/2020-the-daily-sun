SWEARING in the American state of Virginia is now legal! Until now, letting a swear word fly in public could cost a R3 750 fine. This is according to a law from 1792. On Wednesday, the Virginia Senators said “f**k this nonsense and dropped the law, the National Public Radio reported. In another twist, fornicating, which is poking with anyone other than your legal spouse, is now also allowed. The efforts to withdraw the anti-swearing law appeared to be cursed in previous legislative sessions, failing every year since it was first introduced in 2016. Republican delegate Michael Webert, a cattle farmer, said: “When you’re working with cows and a 1 400-pound animal steps on your foot, every once in a while something colourful comes out of your mouth.” Webert told National Public Radio he and his Democratic colleagues didn’t necessarily see everything eye to eye. “But on certain issues it is easier to get things through.” On Wednesday, state MPs also voted to repeal the law against fornication, defined as “voluntary sexual intercourse by an unmarried person”. But they voted to keep the ban on spitting, with one MP calling it “yucky”. Meanwhile, it’s still illegal to curse in public in Mississippi, where it could cost you R1 500 or 30 days in jail. And according to a Georgia law, using “obscene and vulgar or profane language” is considered disorderly conduct if you’re in the presence of someone under the age of 14.
