Given was among a group of people allegedly attacked by cops in a sedan. He sustained three gunshot wounds to the stomach. His aunt, Janet (47), said the family received a call about what had happened from his friends. “We couldn’t take him to hospital immediately as the community was still protesting.

Jane said the family was in shock. “We want to see the person who killed our son face justice because in South Africa, we have the right to protest.
