ANELE Ngcongca’s agent Mike Makaab says they are working with Mamelodi Sundowns with the hope of renewing his contract within the next 14 days. Ngcongca, whose contract expires in June, joined the Brazilians at the beginning of the 2016-17 season from Belgium side KRC Genk. The 32-year-old from Cape Town has been a success since then, winning won Absa Premiership titles with Downs, Caf Champions League, Caf Super Cup and recently added the Telkom Knockout to his name with Masandawana. “We are in the process of renewing his contract. I’m hoping to do that in the next seven to 14 days,” said Makaab. The former Bafana Bafana right-back, who played for nine seasons across two spells with Genk, has featured in 26 matches for the reigning PSL champions this season – including six in the Champions League. Meanwhile, Makaab, who also represents Orlando Pirates new signing Nkanyiso Zungu, said the player’s move to Bucs came quickly from Stellenbosch FC in what was the last day of the January transfer window. He added that the 24-year-old’s move to the Stellies from Jomo Cosmos in 2018, whom he joined from AmaZulu a year earlier, was a blessing in disguise in changing his career. “It was very quick. Literally 48 hours before we received a call from Pirates, then my office in Cape Town spoke to Stellenbosch,” revealed Makaab. “When we signed with Stellenbosch as a free agent (in 2018), we put in a release clause. Pirates triggered that clause, Stellebosch couldn’t stand in the young man’s way. Now Zungu has realised his dream.”
