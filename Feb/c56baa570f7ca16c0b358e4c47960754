 COULD it be that Ernst
Middendorp is starting to feel the heat? Pressure has started to
mount for the Kaizer Chiefs coach amid a poor run of results, including the shock
Nedbank Cup exit. The German has defended
the referees, refusing to criticise officials for poor officiating. But his latest statement
suggests he may have broken rank as the heat increases. “It is a run of
unfortunate decisions if you start from the game we lost against SuperSport
United in the league,” said Middendorp. “We lost against
Maritzburg United last week and judging by the reviews, we were denied the
penalty that could have changed the game. “However, we will take it
in the spirit of football and move on. We will remain calm, keep our focus and
prepare for the next match.” Smarting from the Nedbank Cup setback, Amakhosi could go out of the frying pan and into the fire as next face sworn rivals Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Defeat would create
serious doubt about their ability to deliver on the last trophy on offer for
them season… the Absa Premiership.
