MUSA Nyatama, who was surprisingly released by Orlando Pirates last Friday, has found a new home at the Ekurhuleni-based Highlands Park. Yesterday, the hard-working player met Highlands bosses where his move was concluded – a one-and-half year contract signed. In what came as a shock to football followers in the country, Pirates announced their parting of ways with their former Footballer of the Year. The announcement was made on the eve of the transfer window deadline. “Me and my team met Sinky (Mnisi) and Highlands officials. We will see the way forward. I just need to be back on the field and playing very soon,” Nyatama said. He added that there was no bad blood between him and new coach Josef Zinnbauer, who kept him on the bench since his arrival in December. In fact, Nyatama has not featured for the German coach. “There was no bad blood at all with Pirates. I just felt that I needed more game time. We discussed it and we reached an agreement,” added the 32-year-old midfielder from Daveyton. His last appearance for Pirates was against Black Leopards on 21 December when he came on in the second half for Vincent Pule in the 79th minute. That game was the first for coach Zinnbauer. Nyatama played a mere eight games for Pirates in all competitions this season. In his first season at the Buccaneers, he was crowned with the Player of the Season accolade. Yesterday at the PSL offices, Highlands coach Owen Da Gama spoke fondly of how he is a big fan of Nyatama. Da Gama said: “There are three players currently in the final phase of negotiations with management. When it comes to contracts, I stay away from it. The team will call a press briefing. I love Musa Nyatama with all my heart.”
