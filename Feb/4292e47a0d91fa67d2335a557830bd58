RHULANI Mokwena has voiced his opinion regarding reports that top North African clubs are chasing after Mamelodi Sundowns' coach Pitso Mosimane's signature... Sunsport tracked down Mokwena and found him at a friendly match at Vosloorus Stadium between his club Black Poison SuperStars and Blue Lions this past week. He is coach and owner of Black Poison, a team that is campaigning in the ABC Motsepe, the third tier of Mzansi football. Said Mokwena: "Pitso is a top coach and he deserves the opportunity to coach those big clubs in the continent. He has done very well and has achieved so much in the game. He lives football and is very passionate about the game.  I cannot talk about working with him in the future because I am still a Pirates coach and am contracted to Pirates - so I and cannot talk much about that." The 33 year-old Mokwena mentioned that he misses the atmosphere of coaching in the PSL. Said Mokwena: “I miss the tension and the pressure of coaching in the PSL. I miss running up and down the coaching in the PSL and I will be back in the near future. I am not sure when I am meeting the chairman, it is up to him, he is a very busy man and I am waiting for him. “But I love what I am doing right now in the ABC Motsepe League. We are second on the log, and we won 10 matches in succession.”
