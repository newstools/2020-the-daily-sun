JOMO Cosmos owner coach Jomo Sono claims that 20% of referees in the GladAfrica Championship are rotten to the core. Sono made this statement on Tuesday during the Nedbank Cup media briefing ahead of their last 32 round clash against ABC Motsepe League side Hungry Lions at Olen Park Stadium on Sunday (3pm). He alleged that referees often make bad decisions in December and January. He went on: “Some of us who have been in the game for too long know when this nonsense starts. It starts before December, that’s (money) for holidays and January that’s for school fees. We know that some of us are going to die (lose) somewhere there (at that time). Some referees get so bad in December and you ask yourself ‘Bewu (you were) right all along, what happened? Maybe ufuna ukuya kwi holiday mara uyashoda (He wants to go to holiday, but he doesn’t have enough money). January, sonke siyafa yi sikulufisi (we all don’t have money due to school fees). It’s only December and January when there is trouble in the league.”
