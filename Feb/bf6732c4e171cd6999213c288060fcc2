NO LOCAL match captures the raw emotion and football passion quite like the Soweto Derby. But for Kaizer Chiefs, the upcoming Absa Premiership duel with old foes Orlando Pirates is more than the sentiment. Forget the bragging rights and electric atmosphere that will be at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3.30pm). This one is all about the points, nothing but the maximum points. Amakhosi stormed out of the starting blocks back in August, but lately they seem to be running out of steam. However, only a reckless gambler can bet against Amakhosi winning the derby. Even as they struggle for consistency, Amakhosi are known for regaining form against tougher opponents. They reserve their best for the games that matters the most. And this time they will have more reasons to go all out for the kill. Ernst Middendorp’s men are under mounting pressure to restore their substantial lead at the top of the log, and inspire confidence among their fans that they are firmly in charge of their destiny in the title race. Star midfielder Khama Billiat needs a big stage to thrive, and this could be the match he needs to return to form. Samir Nurkovic and Leonardo Castro have already had the taste of the derby and they know what the game means to the thousands of fans. In-form Lebogang Manyama hasn’t lost any of his drive, despite the discouraging results, while a lot will be expected from talisman George Maluleka, anchor Willard Katsande and Daniel Cardoso, in the heart of defence. Amakhosi are winless in the derby in the last six matches. There can never be a right time to inflict revenge than the current.
