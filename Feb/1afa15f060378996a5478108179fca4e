A stripper named Genea Sky showed how professional she was after falling off the dancing pole, broke her jaw and continued to dance. In the video, Genea appears to have lost her balance and comes tumbling down and smacked onto the floor but managed to carry on dancing. The extent of her injuries were only discovered after her set which included a broken jaw, broken teeth and a sprained ankle.
