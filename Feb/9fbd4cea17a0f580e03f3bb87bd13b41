COPS in KZN have warned job seekers to be vigilant after a woman who responded to a fake job advert on social media was kidnapped. Lungi Xulu (25) from Marian Ridge, west of Durban, was abducted on Tuesday after meeting a man who had promised her work. Her aunt, Ntombenhle Buthelezi (35), said Lungi was too traumatised to talk about her two-day ordeal at the hands of the kidnappers when the SunTeam visited the family at the weekend. Ntombenhle said after seeing an advert fora nanny and cleaner on Facebook, Lungi arranged to meet a man who called himself Msomi at a bus stop near the Marian Ridge swimming pool. She said Lungi later phoned the family saying she had been kidnapped by five men who were demanding a R20 000 ransom for her release. She said the criminals sent photos of Lungi tied up against a tree and told the family to send the money through a Pep Stores money transfer facility. “We were devastated and didnt know what to do because no one had R20 000. “We managed to raise R2 000 and sent it to the number given to us. Lungi was released on Thursday evening,” said Ntombenhle. She said Lungi was later found by police dumped on the side of the road. Lungi told her the young man she met had promised that he would take her to her new bosses. As they were walking, a car pulled up, four men jumped out, grabbed her and bundled her into the vehicle. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said various police units launched a manhunt after the family reported the matter. Investigations are continuing.
