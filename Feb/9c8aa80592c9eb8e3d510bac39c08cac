We are still waiting for the government to inform us of its final decision on e-tolls. Phrases like “silence is golden” and “no news is good news” have come to mean nothing when it comes to this matter. Gauteng residents can’t be fooled by these delaying tactics. The ANC government can no longer be trusted to handle the e-toll matter as it seems unable to come to an agreement within its own ranks. Various leaders in the ANC and in government have made conflicting statements and promises. That’s why nothing has materialised yet. This government has missed yet another opportunity to scrap e-tolls. It has become clear it’s unable to come up with a tangible solution. Our usually vocal transport minister Fikile Mbalula has been uncharacteristically mum as far as the e-tolls issue is concerned. This matter must be urgently brought to an end as it has been dragging on for a long time.
