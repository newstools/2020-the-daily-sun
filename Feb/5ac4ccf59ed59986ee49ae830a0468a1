DESPITE Siphiwe Tshabalala having not played football since May 2019, he’s not done yet... According to his long time agent, Jazzman Mahlakgane, Shabba is set to get a club abroad in a week or so. Tshabalala surprisingly left his previous club BB Erzurumspor in Turkey at the end of last season in May, whom he joined from Kaizer Chiefs in 2018. The 35-year-old Mzansi legend has not played football since then, which is ten months now, but he has not thrown a towel yet. There was talk that the Soweto-born winger’s camp were working on his next move in January transfer window, but nothing materialised. “There’s something I’m working on now. Unfortunately we had a huge set back in January and I didn’t want to talk about it in the media because he’s huge player,” said Mahlakgane about Shabba. “So, you can’t keep on going to the media on things that are not happening because it creates an anxiety to his fans. So, there’s something that is happening. I think if you can give me another week or so I think we should be done and dusted about where he’s going. I’m working on something internationally, not locally. He’s still wants to play for another season or two," Jazzman added. Shabba is a revered footballer both locally and around the world. He featured in 89 appearances for Bafana, which he’s the third most in the history of South Africa national team, scoring 12 goals. One of those is goals that will forever be remembered was a cracking strike in the opening match of the 2010 Fifa World Cup against Mexico at FNB Stadium. He played in 375 games for Chiefs, scoring 58 goals in the process. On top of that, he won two league titles, three Telkom Knockout, two MTN8 and one Nedbank Cup. Another milestone that will take some years for another player to surpass. He is a recorder holder of 31 Soweto Derbies, scoring four goals.
