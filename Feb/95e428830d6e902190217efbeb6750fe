PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned politicians who use serious issues to score cheap political points. He slammed the actions of his own MP Boy Mamabolo, who during the Sona last Thursday and debate on Tuesday accused EFF leader Julius Malema of beating up his wife. “I felt for your wife as it was uncalled for. It was improper. It was incorrect,” Ramaphosa said in parliament yesterday.  He said his late ex-wife Nomazizi Mtshotshisa couldn’t respond like Malema’s could. He said Malema in 2017 alleged the president used to beat up his ex-wife Hope Ramaphosa, who at the time denied the allegations. To calls of “No, no, no!” from ANC MPs, Malema said: “My wife was insulted in front of the president during the Sona and nothing was said. “She was insulted five days later in front of the president and nothing was said. I want to say to you, Mr President – I say this under oath – I’ve never assaulted any woman and I never will!”
