RESIDENTS of Langa are gatvol of a tavern they claim closes late and is a den of dangerous, murderous thieves. Locals in the Cape Town kasi told Daily Sun patrons got so drunk they sometimes left kak in their yards. They said the tavern stopped operating in November but opened again on 18 December. Sinovuyo Masiza (33) said: “After its closure, our lives became better. There were no more deaths or muggings. Even our yards stayed clean.” Lucky Mtyapa (56) said her cousin’s son killed a cop in 2017 while walking home from the tavern.  But some residents said jealous people were opposing the tavern.  Xola Mkoko (26) said: “They just don’t want to work. They realise someone’s business is flourishing and want to disrupt it.” Langa Residents Association chairman Warren Nojekwa said the tavern was a problem.  “Its patrons mostly come from outside Langa and commit crime here. Many people have been killed outside the tavern.” Over the weekend, residents carrying placards gathered outside the tavern. Some of them wanted it gone while others were in support of it. Cops had to separate the groups. Tavern boss Don Vapi said the allegations weren’t true, and that he obeyed liquor licence rules. “We closed in November because our licence had expired. “We reopened recently, and now suddenly the community doesn’t want us. “I believe someone’s using the mob for their own agenda.”
