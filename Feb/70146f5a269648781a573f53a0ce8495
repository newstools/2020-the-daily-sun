THE 112-year-old Japanese who was named the world’s oldest man said smiling is the key to a long life. Guinness World Records said on Wednesday that Chitetsu Watanabe, born in 1907 in Niigata north of Tokyo, was officially given the title at his old age home in the city. The previous record holder, Masazo Nonaka, also Japanese, died last month at 112 years and 266 days. Watanabe, who’s married with five children, said the secret to a long life is to not get angry and keep a smile on your face. Even though he had a sweet tooth, it seems to have done him no harm. Japan’s life expectancy is of the world’s highest. – NEWS24
