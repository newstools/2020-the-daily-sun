MAMELODI Sundowns will be without as many as four key players when they take on VUT in their Nedbank Cup Last 16 round fixture on Saturday. And no, they are not injured. The quarter of Hlompho Kekana, Sibusiso Vilakazi, Gaston Sirino and Mosa Lebusa have been suspended after they picked up deliberate yellow cards in their league encounter with Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday. Though they were winning 2-1, the four seemed less worried about collecting the cards. But their actions made sense when Pitso Mosimane explained.“We have to understand, we have lots of yellow cards. We have five players sitting of yellow cards. It doesn’t look good nor professional,” the Downs coach said. “But everybody is doing it. You must tell me of one person who hasn’t done it before. It is the way it is. When you want to chase the league. You have to clean the yellow cards. It is not cheating.” Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema echoed Mosimane’s sentiments, adding the move was not against the rules of the game. Mosimane added: “Yes, it’s part of the game. It’s not a delaying tactic... when you have the goalkeeper starting to feign a hamstring injury. “I think you saw Pentjie Zulu (Black Leopards) against Orlando Pirates. He got a yellow because they are playing Amavarara next. So all the guys on yellow cards are suspended.”
