Makeku Mashile’s dream of owning an RDP house was crushed the day she realised someone had occupied it illegally. What hurts her more was that she raised the issue with Thaba Chweu Municipality earlier last year, but nothing happened. The 58-year-old from Sabie in Mpumalanga said her house in Ext 10 was approved and even the papers from human settlements proved she was the rightful owner. But an illegal occupant was preventing her from moving in. “I’m tired of living in a shack. All I want is my RDP. “I can’t confront the person who occupied my house because I heard he’s an ex-convict,” she said. She said many of the houses didn’t have electricity because they were vandalised by nyaope boys and she feared if she forced entry, the illegal occupant might kill her. Another resident, Busie Mgwenya (72), said she was surprised last year when she was told her house, also in Ext 10, was put on hold. “I was called to come and get the keys but suddenly I was told my house was on hold. “There are no toilets where we live. The yards are too small, as you can see.” Municipal spokesman Themba Sibiya said they were aware some houses had been illegally occupied. He said they would ensure houses were eventually be occupied by the rightful owners. Sibiya said the municipality obtained a court order for the eviction of people who had illegally occupied the houses. “The evictions will take place after the Sheriff has made consultations with all key stakeholders,” said Sibiya. “Some of the stakeholders include the departments of human settlements, social services, Home Affairs and health, as well as the police and Red Ants.”
