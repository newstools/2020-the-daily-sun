Residents of Elsies River called for the return of death penalty as they bid farewell for the murdered Tazne Van Wyk at VGK church on Saturday. Tazne was murdered by a 54 year old man Moyhdian Pangarker and her body was found dumped in a drain in Worcester after two weeks of searching. Deputy Minister in the Presidency Dr Hlengiwe Mkhize said as the government they have heard the calls of the community during their visit to the family of Tazne during the week. She said the government should look again at the parole rules and discuss aboutbring back death penalty.  “When we visited the family during theweek, many community members had strong views on when will the government bring back death penalty. It is a subject for discussion amongst us at all levels,” said Dr Mkhize. She said the Constitution is the one that protects life and doesn’t allow death penalty. She said by the time the supreme law of the country was drawn, it was after a history of apartheid where innocent people where executed for crimes which they didn’t commit. “Government is listening, that is why I’m saying that it is something that we have to deal with at the level of the constitution of the country,” said Mkhize. Loraine Franklin(35) said death sentence will deter the brazen killings of children and women. “Killers know very well that if they kill they go to jail where they will get three nutritious meals every day. They know that there is a chance they will be released on parole and live their lives. What about their victims? The solution is that if you kill someone you also get killed. That is justice in my view,” she said. Mkhize said former President Nelson Mandela loved children and he led the country to sign conventions about children’s rights. “He pushed very hard for South Africa to sign the conventions on the rights of children. He must be turning in his grave because he was so committed in the protection of children,” added Mkhize.
