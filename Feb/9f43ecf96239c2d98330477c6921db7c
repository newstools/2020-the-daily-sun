Exfoliate, then rub the area with baby oil before you shave to soften the hair and skin. 2. Shave using a men's razor (one with four blades) and men's moisturising shaving cream. Since they are made for faces, they are extra gentle. 3. Dab some rubbing alcohol on the skin after you shave to kill bacteria and close your pores. 4. Then apply deodorant (an unscented Dove stick works best) liberally. This will keep you dry down there so you won't chafe and prevents razor bumps.
