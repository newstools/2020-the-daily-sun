THE World Boxing Association (WBA) flyweight championship belt that the late Peter “Terror” Mathebula won four decades ago has finally arrived on Mzansi shores. The much-anticipated replica was brought home by the WBA Africa Director and former boxing official Stanley Christodoulou. The International Boxing Hall of Famer arrived yesterday from an overseas trip with the belt. Christodoulou promised to organise the belt for the memory of the late boxing hero after being alerted by SunSport that Mathebula never received his hard earned crown. The respected boxing administrator said he was not aware that former world titlist did not get his historic belt. Christodoulou has fulfilled his promise to bring back the Championship belt for the Mathebula family.  The former boxing referee and judge said: “I have just arrived from Colombia and I have Mathebula’s replica belt. Mathebula dethroned the South Korean title holder Tae-Shik Kim for the WBA flyweight title in Los Angeles, USA in December 1980. He became the first black South African to win a world title. However, the legendary boxing hero died without seeing or touching the belt. The former world and South African champion past away last month after a long illness and his wife Emma Gabaitsiwe collapsed and died three days before his funeral. The couple were buried in a joint funeral.
