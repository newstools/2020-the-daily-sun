AN overnight protest at the Vaal University of Technology on Monday left property damaged. A clash between the institution’s Vanderbijlpark campus guards and students saw a security office being vandalised and several students dragged from their residences. Mzwakhe Khuzwayo (22) said: “Some of us were in our student accommodation when security guards fetched us one by one. They moered a number of innocent students for no reason.” Busi Nkosi (24) said: “After beating students, they forced them into their marked vehicle and took them to Vanderbijlpark cop shop.  “We don’t know what happened to them because they are still not back.” SRC secretary-general Kevin Mawila yesterday condemned the violence. “We continue to pledge solidarity with those who are still outside the system, and those who are denied residence by embarking in a peaceful protest,” he said. “We don’t wish to see our brothers and sisters denied access to education while we are attending lectures.” Mawila called on management to release students who were bust.  Sergeant Gertrude Makhale said: “There was a clash between students and security guards on Monday, where the guard room was damaged. No case was opened and no suspects have been arrested.” The institution’s spokesman Mike Khuboni couldn’t be reached at the time of going to print.
