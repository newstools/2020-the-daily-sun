Hey MizzB I’m 25 and have been dating my 20-year-old girlfriend for three months. I’ve been asking her to have sex with me, but she always comes up with excuses. Last week we got drunk and had sex. She now claims I raped her. Is it possible to rape one’s partner? - Man Hey Man Sleeping with someone when they don’t give consent is rape! Dating someone doesn’t mean you own them. It’s very important that to respect your partner’s wishes when they state they aren’t ready for sex. It has different meanings for everyone and, in a relationship, it’s important to respect each other’s boundaries and bodies. Your partner feels you violated her body and the trust she had in you. This can be very traumatic for a woman to go through. Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za MizzB is a partnership between Daily Sun and lovelife.org.za.
