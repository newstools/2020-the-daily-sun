RESIDENTS of Kokstad are angry because the municipality apparently wants to buy King Goodwill Zwelithini a farm in the area. Dumisani Dlamini, EFF leader in the southern KZN town, said locals were against the municipality buying the farm for a Zulu king they don’t regard as theirs. Locals wanted that money to be used for youth empowerment and service delivery. “We’ve told the mayor it will not happen here in Kokstad,” said Dlamini. He said Griquas had expressed their unhappiness because there was no consultation. ANC councillors were divided on the matter. On Facebook, Dlamini said most people seemed to be against the decision. He said the king presided over initiates’ circumcision recently and didn’t go down well with the people of Kokstad, either. He said culturally the Zulu king had no jurisdiction over Kokstad people because 90% of them are Xhosas and Griquas. Griqua leader Gabriel Marais told Daily Sun yesterday he hadn’t been formally told about the plan but had heard the municipality wanted his input. Griquas had rejected the plan as Zwelithini wasn’t their king. “Why would the king want to build his palace in another king’s territory? “My great-grandfather Adam Kok was king here, so Kokstad belongs to the Griquas.” Kokstad Mayor Bheki Mtolo denied that his municipality would buy a farm for the king. He didn’t know where people got the information from. The king’s spokesman, Prince Thulani Zulu, said Zwelithini, as king of the province, could build a palace anywhere. He said everyone in the province was his subject.
