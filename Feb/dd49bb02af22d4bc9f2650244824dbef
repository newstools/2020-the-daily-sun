RESIDENTS will have to wait a long, long time before their train station is ready. Prasa has announced that Greenview Station in Phomolong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, will only be ready for use in December. The station’s renovation process began in 2014 and is still not finished. There hasn’t been any work done for some time. Acting Prasa technical chief executive Hishaam Emeran told Daily Sun the 20% service remaining work will be completed in December. He said issues such as land ownership needed to be addressed with the City of Tshwane. “The completion of the station is at 80%. The builders have moved off the site,” he said. He said Prasa will start a new process to get service providers to complete the 20% work remaining. Regarding the Hammanskraal Station, Emeran said it was not a priority for Prasa. “We’re aware of rail demands,’’ he said. “We’re focusing on fixing the existing system. We have to prioritise that.” Train commuter Mirriam Pule (32), who travels from Pienaarspoort Station to Atteridgeville, said: “The people of Phomolong must have a station that works.”
