ANFIELD was expectant, fate and destiny rested in their hands. Liverpool would be crowned Premiership champions… or so they believed. The Reds had led for the better part of the 2014-15 season and seemed poised to pip closest rivals Manchester City to the Holy Grail. But as fate would have it, that day never came. City snatched the title from right under their noses. So goes one of the saddest chapter’s in the history of Liverpool... and Steve Gerrard still reels from the infamous slip to this day. I didn’t feel for him. Not after what he did to AC Milan in Istanbul 15 years ago. But for Liverpool die-hards failure was just too much to take. Lately I’ve been reminded of this sad tale, closer to home. A season that started brightly for Kaizer Chiefs appears to be in danger of ending in tears. It doesn’t take a seasoned sangoma or a crystal ball gazer to see Amakhosi are crumbling psychologically. A team that led the pack by a whopping 14 points at some stage are now watching over their shoulders as their nearest rivals close in on them. In fact, the upcoming Soweto derby on Saturday could well define the season for Amakhosi, seeing that they are out of the Nedbank Cup. Pressure is starting to mount for Ernst Middendorp, who interestingly broke rank this week when he bemoaned poor refereeing. Not so long ago the German was chanting “hands off our referees”, as the poor officials came under fire from some quarters. Well, it seems those praises have been fading with each point Amakhosi drops. But why the long face? With 10 matches to go, the title race is far from over. And Amakhosi are still in control of their destiny, perched at the top by four points. All they need to do is to summon the spirit of old and grind out results, without the cup distractions. It will be a sad indictment on the players and the club management should Amakhosi go on and blow this one. It’s in your hands, Amakhosi. Don’t let it slip like Liverpool.
