THE pastor was dumped by his girlfriend of three years for allegedly cheating. But he didn’t give up and continues to fight to keep the woman of his dreams. And for the past three months, Pastor Paballo Leeuw has been trying every trick in the book, including sleeping outside her home in Mangang phase 7, Free State. READ: MY MUM DATES MY EXES! Paballo (41) said he also fasted and prayed non-stop, hoping his girlfriend (36) would take him back.  “We have been living together since 2017 and I asked her to marry me, but she refused. I admit I committed a sin by sleeping with her before we got married, but I want to make things right,” he told Daily Sun. “She found me with a woman I was counselling in November and thought I was cheating on her.” The pastor said he met his ex-girlfriend at his sister’s funeral in 2017. “I was comforted when I was with her and we fell in love. We used to do everything together and were always indoors, enjoying each’s company. What I miss most is her respect and care.” But the woman said there was no way she’d take him back.

Paballo’s mum Mapaballo (72) said her son hasn’t been the same since the break-up. “He sleeps in that woman’s yard and I’m worried about him. But he loves her and doesn’t even listen to me when I tell him to give up.”
