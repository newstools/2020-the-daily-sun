President Cyril Ramaphosa said his government will take
the fight against gender based violence to a next level. He said this in his State of the Nation Address in
Parliament on Thursday night. "We will amend the Domestic Violence Act to better
protect victims in violent domestic relationships and the Sexual Offences Act
to broaden the categories of sex offenders whose names must be included in the
National Register for Sex Offenders, and we will pass a law to tighten bail and
sentencing condition in cases that involve gender-based violence," said
Ramaphosa. He said for the past few months his government is hard at
work to bring various stakeholders together to ensure that gender based
violence comes to an end. "Over the last six months, the nation has been
galvanised – across communities, government, civil society, religious
groupings, the judiciary and parliament – to end the crisis of violence
perpetrated by men against women. It has been a truly united and determined
response from all South Africans," said the President. He added that the fight could only be successful if
everyone comes together and fight the scourge. "Through building social
compacts across society to fight this scourge we will be able to achieve much
more but it is only the beginning of the struggle," he added.
