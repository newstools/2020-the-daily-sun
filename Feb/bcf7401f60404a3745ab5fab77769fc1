Former soapie actor Fezile Mpela has offered a word of advice to rising stars in the film and television industry. The ex Isidingo and 7de Laan veteran said performers should refrain from being instant hits but look at gigs that would add value and prolong the roles in the industry. He was speaking on the backdrop of starring in Holiday in the Wild and his experiences while filming. “The movie premiered on Netflix in November and it was amazing to be part of such a talented crew, I think it is a valuable production,” he said. He added that it would take a lot of investment to produce other films of high quality that are adaptable to a global market.  “We still have a long way to go for productions to match the frequency of international companies, but we need more investments in the industry to continue telling our stories.” Mpela stared alongside Kristen Davis and Rob Lowe in romantic drama about life after divorce. He said he enjoyed his role as it showcases what happens when the Western world meets Africa. “I think the best achievement for me is revealing how dynamic both worlds can be and should probably learn from each other,” he said. The 46-year-old has previously been involved in a messy divorce with his ex-wife Marilyn. FEZILE OFF THE HOOK AFTER ALL!
