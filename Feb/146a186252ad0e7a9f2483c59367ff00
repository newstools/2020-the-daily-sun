Actresses Samkelo Ndlovu and Amo Chidi bowed out of Rhythm City. The channel announced the duos departure from the soapie in a statement. Reads the statement, in part: "Effortlessly bubbly and feisty personality, Rhythm City actress Samkelo Ndlovu, who plays the character of Lerato on the e.tv daily youth drama, will be exiting the show." Samkelo said it was her choice to leave the show. “In my 12 years in the film and television industry, I have played close to 10 roles on South African TV, but where I found a home was on Rhythm City. I found a place to harness and practice my craft while in the space of real thespians who share the same respect and love of this craft as I do, and that has made it the perfect environment for me to flourish. My choice to leave this family has come from an inner artistic urge to let go of Lerato," she said in a statement. “On behalf of the Rhythm City team, we would like to wish Samkelo and Amo all the best for their future. We will value their personification of the roles they played on the show and thank them for their dedication to entertaining the audiences. Thank you for being a part of the eFamily,” said e.tv Head of Local Productions Ziyanda Mngomezulu.
