Jomo Shosha (34) got tired of women making fun of his small 4-5, now they run away from him because it’s too big! Jomo wants to find the tree he planted the seeds under that made his 4-5 grow, but the sangoma is gone and he can’t find the tree. After he saw a poster for penis enlargement on a lamp post, he went to see a sangoma who gave him seeds with muthi to plant and ointment from an inyanga to rub on his 4-5. He paid R300 and the sangoma helped him plant the seeds. Jomo from Bochabela in Mangaung, Free State, said his 4-5 started growing.  It only took six weeks for it to grow more than 10cm! He said at first he was happy, but now no woman wants to poke him. “I lost my girlfriend whom I dated for almost three years and now I’m single. Even magoshas give me my money back as soon as they see my 4-5,” he said.   Jomo’s ex-girlfriend Michelle Vilakazi (29) said: “He promised to stop using the ointment but his 4-5 kept growing until I couldn’t take it anymore. I dumped him.” His friend Tseko Ndlozi (36) said: “If it was me I’d be happy.” Sangoma Ndabazomoyo Sotshononda said: “Jomo will never get help unless the tree is cut down. He needs a strong inyanga who can reverse the muthi.”
