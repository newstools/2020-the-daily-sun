JOBURG Metro police Chief David Tembe’s future is hanging in the balance. There’ve been moves to suspend him following allegations and cases lodged against him. Yesterday, Joburg Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo said although there had been talk of suspending him, no processes were in place yet. “Tembe was hired by the council so there must be a report to the council which must process a suspension, if at all,” he said. “When we as the ANC were on the opposition benches, we heard a lot of complaints about the Metro police chief’s conduct. We took the matter to the public protector to investigate independently.” News of Tembe’s possible suspension surfaced after an audio clip was leaked in which public safety MMC Mally Mokoena orders his immediate suspension. Makhubo was yesterday briefing the media on issues the city had been dealing with since he took office. He said 1 500 Metro cop recruits sent at the end of last year were recalled to the academy as they hadn’t completed training under Mashaba’s administration. Former mayor Herman Mashaba has denied Makhubo’s claims.  Former public safety MMC Michael Sun told Daily Sun it wasn’t a secret the ANC never liked Tembe.
