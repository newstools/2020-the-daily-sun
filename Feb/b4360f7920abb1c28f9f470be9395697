WOMEN from Chief Luthuli kasi near Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, are having a tough time. That’s because their makhi goes around proposing love to them and demanding sex. And when they refuse, he threatens to poke them by force. HUSBAND SEALS WIFE'S PUNANI WITH GLUE AFTER CHEATING Nine women who spoke to Daily Sun said they had nowhere to turn to for help as police allegedly had failed them. Sizakele Mavuso (46) claimed the 56-year-old man had been harassing her for over six years. “He came to my house to demand I have sex with him. When I refused, he told me he was going to rape me or make my life hell.” She said cops didn’t open a case. Instead, they served her with protection orders the man had obtained against her.  “It shows they side with him. I don’t know what to do because he seems to have friends in high places and gets away with everything,” she said. Sizakele said she successfully applied for a harassment protection order against him but still it didn’t help. “This year he told me he’d drag me to court to demand R150 000 for defamation and would take my house if I failed to pay.” Lillian Moloto (45) claimed even though she was married, the man still insisted on wanting to have sex with her.
