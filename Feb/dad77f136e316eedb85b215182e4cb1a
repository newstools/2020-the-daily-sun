A VIDEO of three women fighting over a man has been doing the rounds on social media. In the video, which was recorded in a parking lot of a fast food outlet on Monday, a woman is attacked by two other women. Bystanders can be heard saying “Los daai man” before the man, who’s a DJ in Mangaung, Free State, gets into the bakkie and leaves with the girls who attacked the woman.  A witness said the woman, wearing a black skirt, confronted the DJ after she saw him with another woman in the vehicle. “The fight started after she opened the door of the bakkie and demanded to speak to the man. The woman who was in the bakkie then attacked her. “The women on the other side of the street noticed the commotion and learnt it was their friend who was in the bakkie. They soon join in and assault the woman,” the witness said.  Social media users expressed their feelings about the fight.
