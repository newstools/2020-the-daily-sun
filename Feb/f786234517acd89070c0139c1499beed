WHEN a teacher didn’t come back home, his family became worried and searched for him. They hoped they’d find him alive. But Edward Mthethwa’s family in Vryheid, northern KZN, was shocked to find his body hanging from a tree on a farm in Paulpietersburg on Monday. MINISTER DRAGGED FOR NOT KNOWING WHERE SHE WENT ON OVERSEAS TRIP WITH SPOUSE His brother-in-law, Ntuthuko Buthelezi (36), told Daily Sun Edward went to work on Friday and went to submit some documents at a circuit office. However, he never returned home. Edward (45) was a teacher at Emahloni Primary School. “His wife Nolwazi (46) told me he didn’t come back home,” he said. “We started asking around and were told he left school to submit documents at the circuit office.” Ntuthuko said they reported Edward missing at the cop shop and continued searching for him with no luck. “We were really hurt as we didn’t know what could’ve happened to him. We didn’t think he was dead.” ARMED THUGS NOW STEALING LARGE AMOUNTS OF TOILET PAPER Ntuthuko said they were still confused by what led to his death. “He had an injury on his chest. We hope cops will investigate properly so that we know what really happened.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket was being investigated by Paulpietersburg police. “The body of a 45-year-old man was found hanging from a tree on a farm after he was reported missing. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.
