 FOR the first time in history, the Soweto derby will be a "German Affair." This as both clubs, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, are mentored by German coaches in Ernst Middendorp and compatriot Josef Zinnbauer. There is increasing anticipation among fans to see which German tactician will get the better of the other. That, however, will only be revealed at the iconic FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Zinnbauer, who will be making his debut in the famous Soweto derby, can hardly wait to battle it out with his compatriot. “I’m excited and nervous at the same time.” said Zinnbauer. “But I can’t wait to play in front of 90 000 supporters, it’ll be the first-time experience for me." Middendorp, on the other hand, has a lot of experience in this fixture. And he has swiftly dispelled the "Battle of the Germans" tagline, saying "there will be no German flags in Soweto" come Saturday. "I don't know when last i have been in Germany, 2017 i think," said Middendorp. "I don't have this ohh it's Germany, Zimbabwe or Mozambique thing and i have said it already. We are global people and we should understand that in this coaching business worldwide this happens. "Pep is happy to train in Germany and England, other coaches go to Italy. We need to undestand this. Coaches need to qualify themselves and become global players in this business. I don't think about Germany, Yugoslavia, South Africa or Zimbabwe, this is not relevant for me."
