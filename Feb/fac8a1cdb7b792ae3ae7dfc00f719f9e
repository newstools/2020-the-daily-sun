ONCE a futuristic dream, autonomous vehicles are today a very tangible reality – right before our eyes. Autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars or self-driving vehicles, are basically exactly what they sound like. An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is self-driven, capable of making independent decisions based on certain driving conditions or situations. But the potential benefits of AV technology are manifold. Increased uptake of AVs could reduce accidents, traffic congestion and CO2 emissions. The technology also offers motorists lower fuel consumption rates and reduced travel time. And it lays the foundations for improved public transport systems. “Human factors” have been identified as the primary reason for more than 75% of all fatal road accidents in South Africa. AV technology represents one way in which we can mitigate against the risk of these human factors. AV doesn’t get tired or distracted, nor does it deviate from the rules of the road. It can also detect what as humans, we might not be able to and react more quickly. In addition, AV technology paves the way for more efficient shared transport systems and better functioning public transport systems, which both increase road safety by decreasing traffic volumes.
