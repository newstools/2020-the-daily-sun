Actress and humanitarian Nomzamo Mbatha will be hosting the highly talked about Polo Veuve Clicquot again. Nomzamo told Daily Sun that she is elated to host the glittering affair, which will be held in Cape Town in March at Val De Vie. The Coming to America star says she there is nothing like being surrounded by stylish people who are having fun in the beautiful city of Cape Town. Nomzamo says she is the luckiest girl to host the high-end event again which has been hosted by the likes of Bonang and other stars in the past. “It’s a huge honour to be back with my Veuve Clique family at Val De Vie for the fourth year.” Nomzamo, who has attended most Veuve events around the world, says it has been an amazing experience being part of the Veuve Clicquot Polo Series Invitational. “I am going to bring the international flair that I've got to experience at our sister polo events in New York and Los Angeles. It’s the best way to close out our African summer surrounded by the glaring Cape mountains, under the Cape sun,” says Nomzamo.
