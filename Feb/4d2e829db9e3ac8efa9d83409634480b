ON Monday, police arrested three suspects after the murder of an 84-year-old gogo on Elandsfontein Farm in Fochville. Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun a farm worker raised the alarm. “He knocked at the door looking for his employer. “After getting no response, he became suspicious. “He walked around the house and saw the bedroom window had been forced open. “He immediately informed the next-door tenant and they called family members, who notified the police.” Masondo said police found the body of the gogo in the dining room. A manhunt was launched and the suspects were traced to Klerksdorp and arrested. The suspects, a 64-year-old gogo, her 29-year-old son and his 23-year-old friend, lived on the same farm as the dead gogo. “The suspects who lived in a flat at the same premises as the deceased, were found in possession of the victim’s personal belongings including a cellphone and wallet.” Masondo said the suspects were also found in possession of other stolen property when they were arrested. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela applauded the worker, neighbours and officers for acting quickly to ensure the arrests. “Crime against elderly people remains one of our priorities and police will ensure those who take advantage of defenceless senior citizens are hunted down and brought to justice.” The suspects were expected to appear in the Fochville Magistrates Court facing charges of murder and house robbery.
