THE State of refereeing in South Africa has been under the spotlight for quite some time now. The Premier Soccer League may not be the only one under scrutiny as the referees in the low ever leagues are also watched very closely. A referee who was in charge of a match in Letlhabile in Brits, North West, ran for his life after he was chased by a Grey BMW X5 in the pitch after the game. The driver drove inside the football pitch, allegedly with the intention of knocking the referee. Some players, even those on the bench had to flee the raging driver who nearly knocked them. The details around the incident are still sketchy at the moment. The action was all captured on video.
