ADAM Catzavelos, who pleaded guilty to crimen injuria, told the court he might have felt superior moments before taking the controversial K-word video, when he was on holiday in Greece. “Until that video, perhaps I thought I was superior to a lot of black people,” he said. He then made a U-turn and said that he was not thinking clearly at the time. Adam was back in the Randburg Magistrate's Court for sentencing, after he was found guilty on crimen injuria charges. Adam, who was apologetic for most of the cross examination, told the court that he felt terrible after the video went viral and that he realised that he had offended the nation. However, having done some community work with the Seth Mazibuko Foundation and the experience he has been through over the past year, Adam said he is a better man now than he was when he recorded the video.  The foundation was formed by the June 16 activist, Seth Mazibuko. He said he was accepted and forgiven by the senior citizens he worked with in Orlando, Soweto. He referred to them as “magogos and mkhulus”. The words above, Adam said that he didn’t know what they meant until he started doing community service last year. Adam told the court that he is now an "Orlando Boy". Mazibuko was also called to testify on the progress Adam has made under his foundation. He said Adam has made good progress and he is a different man than he was when he first met him. Mazibuko told the court it wasn’t easy working with Adam, given the derogatory word he used in the video. “When I first met him, I asked myself, how do I work with a man who insulted me?”
