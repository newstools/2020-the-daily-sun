THE Gauteng Department of Community Safety is working towards ending the impact of drugs in schools. Its efforts have seen several schools in Gauteng being raided by various police divisions. Many schools have experienced incidents of bullying, gangsterism, substance abuse and, in some instances, murder.  This intervention plan puts special focus on 30 problem schools identified by the Department of Education. The integrated school safety intervention plan includes school searches, safety talks led by the departmental safety promotions unit, and gender-based violence education led by the Ikhaya Lethemba unit.  So far, the department has visited: During a raid on Reiger Park and Oos Rand schools in Ekurhuleni, cops seized dagga, illegal cigarettes and dangerous weapons such as scissors and knives.  Community safety head Yoliswa Makhasi told Daily Sun: “Improved classroom teaching and pupils’ performance is possible only when discipline is instilled in our pupils and teachers.”
