Among other things since he took charge of the international federation, Infantino has been responsible for expanding the 2026 World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, although plans to implement the expansion ahead of the 2022 tournament in Qatar were recently scrapped. FIFA president Gianni Infantino just released an 11-point "vision" for global soccer through 2023.
