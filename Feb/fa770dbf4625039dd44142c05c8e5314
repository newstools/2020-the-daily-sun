Vincent Pule has urged Orlando Pirates to keep working hard after they claimed their fifth consecutive Absa Premiership victory on Saturday. The winger picked up the Man of the Match award after the Buccaneers edged out Chippa United 2-1 at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium to move up to second position in the standings. However, Pule was reluctant to talk about the team's title chances and wants them to remain focused on each game as they come. "First of all I want to thank God for the talent that he gave me, we played well as a team. We knew that it was going to be difficult, an away game is always difficult," Pule told SuperSport TV. "But we had to pass the ball around, fortunately we got two goals early and I think it's working for us to score early. The spirit is good, we're having fun, he said to us, 'Go to the pitch, enjoy yourself and have fun', but we have to defend well and stay compact. And I think it's working for us. "We know we have to work hard, we have to continue with what we have now. We have to keep going, it's good now, we won six [five] games in a row. It's working for us, we work hard and we keep on going." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
