 JEEP is
popularly known for its brand's rugged and unique styling. But, in
recent years it has been producing cars that are not just meant for tackling
off-road but the track as well. The SRT
brand has adorned the likes of the Chrysler 300 SRT and the Jeep Grand
Cherokee. However,
the chaps at Jeep thought the SRT wasnâ€™t enough and added a monster. The Jeep
Grand Cherokee Trackhawk was built to conquer the drag strip and the open road. It has a
707-horsepower supercharged Hellcat V8, which sounds great.
