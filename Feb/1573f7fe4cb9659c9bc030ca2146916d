FOR a week, residents abandoned their taps after a video of a worm-like creature floating in a glass of water went viral! But the Department of Water and Sanitation on Wednesday called for residents of Kroonstad in the Free State to stay calm. It’s believed what was seen floating in the water could have been eggs of flies and mosquitoes. Resident Mpho Mamogwe said she had to buy litres of purified water for her family.  “My nephew was already complaining about a runny tummy. “This is not the first time that such things are found in our water.” Another resident, single mum of four Dipuo May (38), said: “I boiled the water after I saw the video. I gave the kids water and told them not to drink water at school.” Department spokesman Larry Crisp said: “We found the person who filmed the video and samples were drawn from the tap and taken for testing. Samples were also taken from houses in the area and surrounding areas. “It was found to be a single incident. The laboratory explained that chironomidae larvae are sometimes found when a tap is not used for some time. The recent rainfall makes it easy for flies and mosquitoes to lay their eggs inside a tap.” Head of Drinking Water and Wastewater Management Gerhard Janse van Noordwyk said: “It would be impossible for the larvae to go through the water system because they could not survive the pressure and the chemicals. “It’s advisable to let water run before pouring for consumption when using an outside tap.”
