The South African Communist Party (SACP) second deputy secretary general Solly Mapaila said EFF’s doesn’t have moral authority to disrupt the State of the Nation Address (Sona). This comes after EFF leader Julius Malema threated that they will disrupt SONA if President Cyril Ramaphosa doesn’t fire Minister of Public Enterprise Pravin Gordhan. Mapaila was addressing activists in Cape Town on Wednesday night when he said EFF is implicated in looting of VBS Mutual Bank. JUJU THREATENS CHAOS IN PARLY! “There are people here in Parliament that said they want to disrupt the State of the Nation Address...what moral high ground do they have to stand up there and talk about corruption when they have looted money from VBS in Limpopo? Money of elderly people, poor people in the villages? And some South Africans are elebrating this kind of acts,” said Mapaila to the cheering crowd. On Tuesday presiding officers of Parliament issued a statement stating that they have appropriate mechanisms to maintain decorum and dignity during the State of the Nation Address (Sona) or any programme of Parliament. PARLY DOWNPLAYS EFF THREATS! “Existing joint rules of Parliament sufficiently protect sittings of the Houses and committees from disorder. "Open threats to disrupt the work of Parliament, including the propagation of conspiracy theories, are not in the interests of the public. They serve only as attempts to distract Parliament from its work,” the statement read. This was a second statement after they released another one in January.
