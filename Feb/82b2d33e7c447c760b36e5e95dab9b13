REASON Phiri (49) didn’t expect to be so popular after he helped pupils cross a river. His picture went viral on social media, showing him helping pupils cross the river. Reason, a general worker at Alexandria Primary School in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said he was surprised when Education MEC Bonakele Majuba came to meet him and thanked him for helping the kids at Bejani River. “I didn’t expect anything in return because most of the children live in my area and the school is on the other side of the river. “On rainy days, they struggle to cross the river because it’s dangerous,” said Reason. “I don’t want kids to drown and many villagers can’t swim. That’s why I often help.” He said his wish was to see the village getting a new bridge that will make their lives easier. He said he has been helping children since he started working in 2009. Majuba visited Mathibela Village in Bushbuckridge on Friday. “Reason is a real hero that not only Mpumalanga is proud of, but also Mzansi. We’re grateful for his kindness towards the kids. “We thank him for appreciating that education is a very important part of society, and having such a positive impact on the lives of our community with his gesture of true selfless sacrifice,” said Majuba.
