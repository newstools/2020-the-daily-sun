RESIDENTS of Soshanguve blocks L and H in Tshwane yesterday demanded answers from the Tshwane University of Technology. They told Daily Sun the varsity removed students from their homes after they’d provided accommodation for almost 20 years.  Community leader Nchawe Mutloane (47) said the varsity ended a business agreement without consultation. “In September it started poaching students living at our homes.” He said the varsity was moving students to accredited accommodation, and had promised residents they’d be accredited to house 4 000 students but reduced the number to 1 000. Residents said they were told by students they were only staying in their homes while on a waiting list for student accommodation. Themba Mahlangu (44) said: “They’re taking bread from our mouths.” Lucia Ngwezi (54) said: “We treated students as our own.” Varsity spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter said: “We’ve been engaging with the community. A meeting with affected parties is under way.”
