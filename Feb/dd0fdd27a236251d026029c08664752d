A former senior manager at the Capricorn District
Municipality has been granted R2 000 bail in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court
for allegedly plotting to have her husband killed.  Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said
Salome Ledwaba allegedly conspired to kill her husband after experiencing
marital problems.  The 49-year-old allegedly solicited the help of hitmen to
kill her husband in exchange for a R50 000 payment.  "Through intelligence gathering, the Hawks' Serious
Organised Crime Investigation team uncovered the plot and immediately put into
action a plan to apprehend the suspect.  "Investigations revealed the suspect was married to a
well-known businessman who also resides around Polokwane and the couple were on
the verge of divorce.  "Three alleged hitmen were allegedly hired to follow
through with the killing in exchange for a sizeable payment," Maluleke
said.   The plan was foiled and Ledwaba was arrested at her house on
January 30. She appeared in court on Monday.  "Our investigations into the matter are continuing
[and] will determine if the three alleged hitmen would be arrested or
not," Maluleke said.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ex-senior-municipal-official-in-court-for-allegedly-hiring-hit-men-to-kill-husband-who-is-a-well-known-businessman-20200211
