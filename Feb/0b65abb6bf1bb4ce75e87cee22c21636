KATLEGO Mkhonza may be living with a disability, but she hasn’t allowed that to limit her. The 28-year-old from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, was born with spastic cerebral palsy, which has caused her hands not to function. But she’s determined to succeed in life. Katlego, who is wheelchair-bound, is the founder of Living Able Foundation. It fights for the rights of people living with disabilities. “I do this to show people living with disabilities that it’s possible to live your life to the full and to follow your dreams,” she said. One would expect Katlego to have someone to help her with office administration, but she does most things herself. As her hands don’t function, she uses a mouth stick to type on her laptop and her lips to dial, answer and send smses. Katlego matriculated at Muriel Brand School in Brakpan in 2011. She studied journalism at Unisa to be a voice of the voiceless. She recently hosted a dialogue at KwaThema Old Age Home, which aimed to give people living with disabilities a platform to voice out their daily challenges. “People living with disabilities are still discriminated against when applying for jobs and in workplaces. “Some public buildings still don’t cater for us, and public transport system is still failing us,” she said. Katlego said living with a disability was challenging. She thanked her family for being supportive. “My mother still supports me. It sometimes feels like I’m normal because of my family’s support.”
