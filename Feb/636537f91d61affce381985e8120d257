 The rand is suffering its worst start to the year against the dollar since the global financial crisis of 2008, and it’s not about to get any better in March, if history is any guide.   South Africa’s budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is set to widen to 6.8% in the fiscal year ending March 2021. That’s the highest since 1992-1993, when the gap was 7.2%, and compares with a forecast of 6.5% in October’s medium-term budget policy statement. "All told, the package is unlikely to be sufficient to convince Moody’s," said Elisabeth Andreae, a Frankfurt-based currency and emerging-market analyst at Commerzbank AG, in a note to clients. "We therefore continue to consider a rating downgrade to junk at the review in March to be likely." The rand will remain "under depreciation pressure," she said. The rand declined as much as 1% on Friday before paring the decline to trade 0.5% down at R15.5625 per US dollar by 9:26 in Johannesburg. That’s its weakest on a closing basis since June 2016.   https://www.fin24.com/Markets/Currencies/more-pain-ahead-for-rand-after-worst-start-in-decade-20200228
