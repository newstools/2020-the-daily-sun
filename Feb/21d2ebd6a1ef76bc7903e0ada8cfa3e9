AT LEAST nine people were killed in shootings targeting shisha bars in Germany. This sparked a huge manhunt overnight before the suspected gunman was found dead in his home early yesterday. The attacks occurred at two bars in Hanau, about 20km from Frankfurt, where armed police quickly fanned out and helicopters roamed the sky looking for those responsible. Police in the central state of Hesse said the likely perpetrator had been found at his home in Hanau after they located a getaway vehicle seen by witnesses. Another body was also discovered at the property. The mayor of Hanau, Claus Kaminsky, said: “I’m deeply moved. Just the fact that eight people have lost their lives has shaken me up. But I ask all citizens not to speculate.” – NEWS24
