Every piece of jewellery we purchase and choose to wear reflects our individual style and personality, no matter the cost of the piece. When we choose a piece of jewellery, we look at it as a way to express who we are by “decorating” ourselves; choosing pieces as we would clothes, shoes, tattoos and hairstyles. “Expressing who we are is an important part of what makes us, us, says Kristin Weixelbaumer, designer and owner of jewellery brand Black Betty. “Jewellery gives us the opportunity to show others our personal beliefs, our culture and even our religious beliefs. Wearing a specific bracelet or necklace lets us show others a little bit about ourselves without having to say anything at all. Weixelbaumer outlines 4 ways to create bespoke jewellery without necessarily breaking the bank on the design and stone or metal selection:  When designing and creating your bespoke jewellery, it is important to use someone with the experience and the creativity to bring your vision to fruition.  Black Betty offers a bespoke design service, and through years of experience can guide you through designing and creating the perfect bespoke piece for you.
