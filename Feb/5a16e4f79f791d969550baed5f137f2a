A VIDEO of the bullying of a schoolgirl has been circulating and social media users are angry. In the video a pupil wearing a grey and white uniform from Modiri Secondary School is seen pouring milk over a fellow pupil in a blue school dress. Other pupils can be heard calling the bully to order. “Magagula man, no!” the pupils are heard saying. In another video, the bully is punching and slapping the same pupil. The bully is heard saying: “Eh wena, o sang tlwaela,” which means “don’t disrespect me”. She says: “I am older than you,” while continuing to hit her. A boy can be seen trying to stop the bully. A grade 10 pupil at the school said: “This is not the first time she’s done something like this. Some boys fear her as well. She will beat you up if you talk back to her.” A grade 11 pupil said the bully would threaten them and no one reported her. “If this video didn’t go viral nobody would’ve known about this girl. Now we are free to go back to school.” Daily Sun couldn’t get a hold of the pupil or her family. Boitumelo Olifant wrote on social media: “What’s more painful is that her peers are just standing there watching the child being beaten.” Nols Vee wrote: “This breaks my heart. Being bullied and humiliated’s not nice.” Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said disciplinary processes were underway. “Our district officials are at the school for necessary support. This is unacceptable.” He said they’d announce the outcome of the disciplinary process in due course.
