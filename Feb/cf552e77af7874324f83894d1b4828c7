KAMOHELO Mafojane from White City in Soweto likes to bike around in his 200cc MotoMia. Q: When did you buy your bike? A: It’s been quite some time now since I bought it. To be honest, I use it to teach people how to ride motorbikes from my school, Rider Motorbike School Academy. The one that you will always find me riding is the Honda rr 1 000cc. Q: How far have you ridden it? A: I’ve ridden it in and around Soweto but I’m yet to take it on long distances. Q: How often do you ride? A: I ride daily. Q: What is special about your bike? A: It’s nice and comfortable. It’s also suitable for beginners to learn how to ride. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I’ve never had any fines on my bikes. I’m a law-abiding citizen and am always cautious on the road. Q: Would you lend your bikes to someone else? A: My bike is ridden by different people, who come to learn how to ride a bike at the academy. And this is a bike for those who are eager to be future riders. Q: What is your view of other Mzansi road users? A: South African drivers are different on the road. There are those who allow us space to pass by and those who don’t. So, you have to take it as it comes. Q: Are you a member of any riders’ club? A: No, not yet. And I don’t have anything against clubs. It’s just that I choose to be a solo rider.
