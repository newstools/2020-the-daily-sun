It’s always surprising when people speak about fake pastors and prophets with so much passion as if it was not predicted in the Bible. What’s even worse is that these people claim to be Christians who are highly qualified in Bible studies. Fake pastors and prophets are not new. PASTOR: WHY I POKED VIRGINS! The Bible has many examples of such people. Theologians in Germany supported the slaughter of the Jews before and during the world wars on the basis of Biblical interpretation and racism. Were they not fake pastors and prophets? Apartheid was justified by fake priests and reverends who used the Bible to do so. Protestants once differed with the Catholic church’s insistence that only male priests could teach about the Bible. Today, the Protestants who say everyone can teach himself or herself the Bible insist that a true pastor must have a theology degree to teach. This is absolute hypocrisy. Watch out for fake pastors and prophets. They are wolves in sheep’s skin. Letter by Khotso KD Moleko from Mangaung
