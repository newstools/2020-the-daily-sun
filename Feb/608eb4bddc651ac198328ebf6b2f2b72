One of the most anticipated glamorous white weddings is set to premiere tonight on Showmax. Showmax invites you to get a front row seat to enjoy the love story of Idols SA judge Somizi Mhlongo and partner Mohale Motaung on their journey of love, from their meeting to their two extravagant weddings. Somizi & Mohale: The Union, which will exclusively air on Showmax, is a four-part series that will document their journey on how they planned their wedding up until the day they said I do.  Apart from the glitz and glamour, the wedding special is also the telling of an intimate love story of two queer men living in South Africa. A story that touches on their trials and tribulations, respect for family and culture, and their acknowledgement of the symbolic message the union is sending to the entire African continent - that when all is said and done, love will always win.
