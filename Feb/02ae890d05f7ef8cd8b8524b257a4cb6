PUPILS who tragically died in separate incidents were buried this weekend. Yesterday, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi attended Kelebogile Molopyane’s funeral after the 16-year-old fell to his death from a second-floor balcony at Ferndale High School in Joburg after having an epileptic seizure on Tuesday. He was buried at Hebron Cemetery in Tshwane. Mourners described him as a bubbly and loving boy who was full of jokes. His gogo Thelma Thoane said he loved soccer, art, singing and cooking. “He was a very helpful and energetic young man.” Irvin Thamane said he was Kelebogile’s only friend at school. “He came to me and said he was lonely and wanted to be my friend. He was a hard worker and had big dreams for the future.” Lesufi asked for pastors and communities to pray for schools. On Saturday, Amogelang Phiri was laid to rest. The six-year-old from Temba in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, died two weeks ago when a pole fell on his head at Kudube Primary School. His mum Nkele (43) said his friends told her the pole came out of nowhere. “They said he was just passing when it fell. He had a bright future and wanted to be a teacher.” Speaking on behalf of the education department’s district office, Jonas Mohlala said kids who might have been future leaders were being lost. “We are hurt as a district. We can’t keep burying kids like this.” Amogelang’s fellow pupils formed a guard of honour as his body was taken to Kekana Cemetery.
