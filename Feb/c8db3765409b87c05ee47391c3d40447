TEMPORARY workers are demanding permanent jobs, better salaries and to have the same benefits as civil servants. National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers led a march in Tshwane yesterday. The march was made up of community health workers, early childhood development practitioners, and expanded public works programme workers.

The union’s national organiser, Solly Malema, said the workers couldn’t be treated like foreigners in their own country. Malema said government must stop treating workers like slaves. He said the workers were demanding a salary of R12 500. “We’re tired of the government taking workers on a contractual basis,” he said. “Some people have been working as temps for more than 20 years. We need government to give them permanent jobs and people must be absorbed as civil servants.” READ: NIGERIAN MAN HIT WITH A BRICK ON THE HEAD AND DIED! At the department of infrastructure, deputy director Jaco Viljoen received the memorandum and said they’d respond within seven working days. The union also handed over a memorandum to the departments of health and basic education, as well as National Treasury. Malema said they were planning a night vigil at the Union Buildings yesterday.
