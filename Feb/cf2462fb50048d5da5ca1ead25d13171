FOSA Juniors have expressed their delight at the decision taken by Fifa to ban Kaizer Chiefs over what they described as an “illegal” transfer of former player Andriamirado ‘Dax’ Andrianarimanana. Fifa slapped Chiefs with a transfer ban of two windows while Dax, who joined Black Leopards in 2019, was handed a four-month ban.

And the Malagasy club are delighted that Fifa has taken action against the Soweto giants. “Following the FIFA decision on the transfer that we considered to be forced from DAX, Fosa Juniors FC takes note of this historic decision, and we are delighted that justice has been done,”the club said in a statement. From now on, no illegal transfer of a Madagascan player will go unpunished. This victory of Fosa Juniors is a victory for all clubs in Madagascar, and a victory for Malagasy football.” Malagasy football supporters have also expressed their opinion on the matter, with many of them not pleased. They feel that Fosa Juniors have sabotaged Dax’s progress, which cannot be good for Malagasy football. Ninha Vaviroa Ralamboarivony said: “It's so sad. Are you proud to sabotage our young people? The goal is to attract foreign coaches but not to disgust them.” Fanilo Alison wrote: “The Malagasy's worst enemy is the Malagasy. Are you really glad you ruined the poor guy’s career? Is it impossible for you to have a simple conversation? Or do you want to pretend to be able to handle matters on a regular basis? Or are you really aiming for the money because it's not enough?” Meanwhile, Chiefs have decided to appeal the decision before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
