FIVE ANC members who died in a bus crash last weekend were laid to rest on Saturday. They were buried in two separate mass funerals in the Waterberg District of Limpopo. Salphy Ngoepe (36), Elizabeth Seanego (31) and Seja Hlako (41) were buried in Ga-Hlako Village while Magret Lamola (54) and Angelina Maeteletsa (58) were buried in Ga-Mmerebere Village. Bus driver Rosinah Matlala (38) was laid to rest in Pola Park, Mokopane. The victims were travelling to the ANC’s 108th birthday rally when the bus driver lost control of the vehicle. Allegations that the bus experienced mechanical failure are being investigated.Premier Stanley Mathabatha said the transport department had been ordered to take Great North Transport buses for roadworthiness testing wherever they were spotted. He said the government had also budgeted R297 for new buses. “At the moment, we don’t know what caused the accident and we are still waiting for a report as the bus was taken for mechanical tests,” he said. However, the families of the victims have called for all buses in the province to be checked. Herman Seanego (36) said: “There are many buses. Some are privately owned and not all are in a good condition to transport people.” Tebogo Ngoepe (42) thanked the ANC and the community for supporting affected families. “It’s painful that we will never see them again. The government, including the ANC, should keep on supporting us because the deceased have all left children behind,” she said.Great North Transport, the company that owned the bus that crashed, is part of the Limpopo Economic Development Agency. It operates a fleet of 540 buses across the province.
