inequality, the old age grant, disability, and care dependency grants will
increase by R80 to R1860, R40 increase for the foster care grant to R1 040 and
the child support grant will increase by R20 to R445 a month. “Changing
the way, we provide social grants will generate many savings, in our economy
and budget,” Mboweni said. Mboweni said the savings will be partly used
to raise the daily subsidy per child. The

or another, which is a lifeline for many. “Grant’s
reduce inequality and protect the most vulnerable in our society,” Mboweni
