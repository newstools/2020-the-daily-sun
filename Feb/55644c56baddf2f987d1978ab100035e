 A protest is planned for Wednesday in Cape Town against former president FW de Klerk and his foundation. Convener of the #DeKlerkMustFall protest Songezo Mazizi told News24 that they were expecting a number of citizens and activists who were concerned about the foundation's recent statement about apartheid to take part. The picket is expected to start at 13:00 outside the FW De Klerk Foundation's offices in Plattekloof, Cape Town.    On Monday, the picket organisers would be giving notice to the City of Cape Town about the planned peaceful protest, Mazizi said. He added that, should there be no one to accept the memorandum, the committee would plan a way forward. Foundation spokesperson Dave Stewart confirmed to News24 that it was aware of the planned protest and would issue a "general statement" on Monday about the action. Stewart could not give further details on whether they would be retracting their statement on apartheid. The heat surrounding the former president started on Thursday during President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address, where EFF leader Julius Malema rose on a point of order, asking that De Klerk be removed from the National Assembly chamber's public gallery. Malema was responding to recent comments made by De Klerk in interviews commemorating his speech which unbanned the liberation movements 30 years ago, News24 reported. "He is an unrepentant apologist of apartheid who is not willing to accept that apartheid was [a] crime against humanity," Malema said.
