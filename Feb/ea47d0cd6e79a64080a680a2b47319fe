Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp was full of praise of the performance of Anthony Akumu during the Kenyan international's debut against Royal Eagles in the Nedbank Cup Round of 32. The tall player made an appearance from the substitute bench as Amakhosi secured a 1-0 win, taking over from George Maluleka in centre midfield. Speaking to the Amakhosi website after the match, Middendorp spoke of the brilliant qualities the 27-year-old midfielder has at his disposal. "You could see some qualities in Akumu. Even in training, you can see that he has some brilliant qualities," Middendorp said. "Let's see how it goes. With time, we should be able to see more of his qualities." Meanwhile, Middendorp has played his cards close to his chest with regards to the selection of Itumeleng Khune or Daniel Akpeyi as their regular goalkeeper in future. "We have good goalies. All of them are qualified to do the job for us," Middendorp continued. "Let’s hear what the technical team says. I will be guided by their advice. "Akpeyi has done well for us, saving us in certain situations. Maybe Khune will be back in goals soon." Amakhosi will take on Highlands Park in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 following Monday evenings draw.
