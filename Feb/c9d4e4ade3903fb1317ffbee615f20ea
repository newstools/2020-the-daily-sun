A fourth suspect in the murder case of a Mpumalanga mother, Wanter Dlamini (62) handed herself to the police on Friday afternoon after a warrant of arrest was issued. The 41-year-old who was hiding in Pretoria is expected to appear at the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday (24 Feb). Dlamini from Barberton was allegedly raped and strangled to death early last month by two men who were allegedly  sent by her two daughters who were on a mission to claim a R80 000 insurance payout. Her body was found dumped at a nearby bush in Barberton. On 01 February police bust the third suspect, Stanley Mashikeng. The 36-year-old was found hiding under a bridge in Mbombela by community members. He is alleged to have worked with Dlamini's two daughters in planning her murder. Wanter's 30-year-old daughter allegedly invited her for a visit and organised her 41-year-old friend and two men to kill her. When she arrived, she was allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and gang- raped by the two male friends while her daughters and her friend held her down. When they were done, they allegedly wrapped her body in a blanket and hid it in an outside toilet. Wanter's other daughter (39) allegedly organised transport to get rid of the body. In November, a life insurance policy was taken out in Wanter's name by an unknown person. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that the 41-year-old was arrested. "She handed herself over to the police and she was duly arrested. She will appear in court on Monday," he said.
