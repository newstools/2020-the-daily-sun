The furry shoe trend took last year by storm and it's not about to stop anytime soon. From furry stiletto ankle straps to furry mules, the trend has transformed the fashion world - but this time, consumers aren't impressed. US store chain TK Maxx started selling fluffy high heels in neon colours and customers couldn't hep but wonder if the Muppets puppets had been skinned.  A woman posted a picture of the shoes in awe on Facebook and the comments section went crazy, with the post getting thousands of comments. The shoes are covered in neon fur, which also covers the heel,leading to people asking what in the Muppet world was going on.  This is not the only weird shoe trend we have seen this season,as theÂ Maison Margiela Men's Fusion Chunky Trainers also got a lot of backlash for their strange appearance.
