JUST the idea of having Musa Nyatama in his team seems to really excite Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama. Although it is yet to be officially confirmed, the former Orlando Pirates midfielder looks set to join the Lions of the North. Nyatama, who is a free agent after he asked to be released from his contract with Pirates on the last day of the January window, can join a team of his choice at any given time. And the most likely destination seems to be Tembisa. The 32-year-old, who was named Pirates’Player of the Year in the 2017/18 campaign, will look to rediscover that form under Da Gama. Although he could not officially confirm the signing of Nyatama, Da Gama did reveal how much he admired the Daveyton-born midfield ace. “I love Musa (Nyatama)” said Da Gama during the Nedbank Cup last 32 press conference in Parktown on Tuesday. Highlands host GladAfrica Championship outfit Uthongathi at the Makhulong Stadium on Saturday (8:15pm). “With all my heart, I love him. But I think there will definitely be a press conference or a press release very soon, and unfortunately, it's not my place to confirm anything.” Da Gama added that there are two more players who are on the verge of joining his side, with confirmation exacted soon. "There are three players that are currently in the final phase of negotiations with the team, and unfortunately I put my penny's worth on the table to say, 'I'd like this player and I think he can help us,” added Da Gama. “But when it comes to the contractual stuff, I stay away from that. So, I think the team will definitely have a press conference. I think that's a question you can ask Mr Ngidi, he's very capable and knows his job.”
