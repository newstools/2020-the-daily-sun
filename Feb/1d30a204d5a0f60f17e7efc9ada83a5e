DEFENDER Siyanda Xulu intends to stay at Maritzburg United beyond this season. Xulu, who joined the club as a free agent in 2017 after he was released by Kaizer Chiefs, will see his three-year deal with the Team of Choice come to an end in June. The former Mamelodi Sundowns defender says he wants to remain at the Midlands club and the management knows that - now it is up to them to meet his new demands. The 28-year-old, who has scored four goals for Maritzburg - including one this season, in 88 appearances, has been rumoured to have attracted attention from SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates. “I always said that I want to stay at Maritzburg, but it is something that we have to restructure between me and the chairman (Farook Kadodia),” said Xulu. “He knows where I was before I came here. So, I’ll give all what the club needs. For now, I’m just focusing on renewing my contract.” There’s also a possibility of Xulu going back overseas. The KwaMashu-born player previously plied his trade in Russia, for FK Rostov whom he joined from Sundowns in 2013. He won the domestic cup in 2013-14 season. “Going forward, I always try and look for better options. But, as I said, I want to stay here,” he added.
