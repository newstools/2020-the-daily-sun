ANGRY parents have accused Brooklyn City College of scamming them! Yesterday they marched to the college in Tshwane to demand their money back. This after the college failed to issue their children, who spent at least two years studying at the institution, with certificates. Parent Paulina Tsoanyane (53) said her daughter did a nursing course and was supposed to get her certificate in November. She said the college told her it didn’t have one. “How could a college that claims to be registered fail to give students what they went there for? They keep on telling us they’re waiting for the certificates from the Department of Higher Education,” she said. She said the college should refund them instead.  Another parent Mmapula Gomba (59) said she used all her savings to take her children to the college. “I worked hard so my children could have a brighter future. They must give me back all the money I paid and keep their fake certificate,” she said. Former nursing student Tebogo Mkhuseli (23) said she was finding it hard to apply for a job without a valid certificate. “The college only gave me a copy of my results, which the police refuse to certify.” The college admitted some students hadn’t received their certificates. College spokesman Thabang Makgatho said: “Our certificates come from the Seta. We have to wait for them to bring them to the college because we can’t just print them here; it is illegal.” Meanwhile, would-be Unisa students were urged to register online after Nehawu and the Academic and Professional Staff Association embarked on a wage strike.
