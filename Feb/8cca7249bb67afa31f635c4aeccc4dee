Music superstars Jay-Z and Beyonce have been trashed for not standing up during the singing of the American national anthem at the Superbowl.The event was a football game that determines the champions for the National Football League, where performances from musicians also take place.Videos and photos from the stadium show that while Demi Lovato was singing the national anthem, most people at the stadium were standing up but Beyonce, Jay-Z and their daughter Blue Ivy stayed seated. Read: SHO MADJOZI AND MOONCHILD HEAD TO SUPER BOWL Tweeps said the Carter family was disrespecting America and the people who fight for it.     I don’t give a damn whether Beyonce and Jay Z agree with the current administration. They should stand up for the men and women who are fighting each and every day for their ability to rake in millions from the American people. Absolutely pathetic! https://t.co/EzcMQOhs62 — Kyle Morris (@RealKyleMorris) February 3, 2020    Idc who you are Jay Z and Beyonce, be better and STAND UP!!
