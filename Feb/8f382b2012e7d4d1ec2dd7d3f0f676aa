WHEN he arrived at Kaizer Chiefs in 2013, a lot was expected from him after a lot of rave reviews...but he did not live up to expectations and he did not last long at Amakhosi.  Ivan Bukenya made his debut for Amakhosi in the 2013 Macufe Cup. He was ridiculed because of his age and his large frame by the South African football followers, and as a result he struggled to win the supporters overs. Bukenya, who was born in Kampala, Uganda, was later transfer-listed by Chiefs after making just over 20 starts in three seasons. He then joined East Bengal in India in 2016. At Chiefs, he won the PSL league title, the MT8, the Carling Black Label Cup and also the Macufe Cup.  He played for all the Uganda junior national teams and also for the senior team eight matches. He is now 28 years and he is playing for FC Linkoping in the Swedish Division 1.
