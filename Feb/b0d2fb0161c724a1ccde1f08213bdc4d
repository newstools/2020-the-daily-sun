BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt is fast running out of excuses to explaining the Clever Boys' poor run of form at home. Playing at Milpark Stadium is not bringing any joy to Hunt. Wednesday'S Absa Premiership draw between Bidvest Wits and Highlands Park has frustrated the already fed up Hunt. “I don’t know why are we not winning at home,” reacted Hunt at the Bidvest Stadium in Milpark. “I have no idea why things keep on falling apart here.” The temperamental coach could not believe his swollen eyes when they played to a 2-2 draw against Owen Da Gama's Highlands Park in their catch-up game. Skipper Thulani Hlatshwayo looked like he had completed a remarkable comeback after he put his side ahead on the score sheet, coming from a goal down but the visitors forced a draw. The draw left Hunt fuming and threw tantrums after the game considering they missed out on an opportunity to close down the gab on log leaders Kaizer Chiefs to nine points. They remain fifth on the log with 34 points from 18 matches - trail Chiefs by eleven points, with two games in hand. Hunt's biggest gripe is that they are not turning their games into points. He believes had they used their home advantage, and turned matches in hand into points, they would be way above Chiefs at the top of the log. At home they registered a shocking three losses and three draws this season. Wits will on Monday host Chippa United in the Nedbank Cup last 16 at the same stadium. Hunt is hoping for a change of fortune: “Can we win here for a change? Maybe we should play in the rugby field on Monday.”
