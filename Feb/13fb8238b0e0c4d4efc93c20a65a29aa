SUPERSPORT United have always profited from a good turnover of players in transfer deals with city rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. From Elias Pelembe, Katlego Mphela, Anthony Laffor to Jeremy Brockie, Matsatsantsa have been happy to let go of their prized assets in exchange for a big cheque. But not this time. Bradley Grobler is going nowhere. This is according to United coach Kaitano Tembo, who has been happy to benefit from the in-form marksman. Grobler has reportedly attracted interest of Sundowns, among other local clubs. However, it seems he may not have the blessings of Tembo, should he decide to leave. “If you want to challenge for league honours you need to have players who can come in and score goals and we are happy,” said Tembo. “For me as long as I see him in a SuperSport shirt and he performs the way he is performing, that is what satisfies me. I’m not going to be focusing on whether he goes or not, I do not know what will happen in the future but if it happens then it is football.” Sundowns are in the market for a striker as they look to increase their attacking options, and are keen on Grobler. The Bafana Bafana striker has netted 10 times in 17 league matches so far this season, and bar injuries, he may challenge for the top goal scorer’s award. Tembo, however, is not oblivious to the realities of football and is aware some situations may be beyond his control. He said: “I am happy that he (Grobler) is happy here and our stance is to try and keep our best players “ But I also understand that there are people running businesses and it is about making profit.”
