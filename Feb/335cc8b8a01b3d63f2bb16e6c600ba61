GLADAFRICA Championship side TS Galaxy is set to unveil Mabhuti Khenyeza as their new head coach. Khenyeza is set to hand in his resignation letter to his current employers, AmaZulu, whom he joined this time last year from Maritzburg United. The 37-year-old will replace Dan Malesela, who left the Nedbank Cup champions last week after 15 months in charge. “Khenyeza is on his way to join TS Galaxy," revealed a SunSport source. "He met Tim Sukazi who offered him the job." Meanwhile, Usuthu team manager, Qedi Dlamini, said he has no knowledge that the club's assistant coach - Khenyeza - is leaving the club to join The Rockets. “We don’t know anything about that,” said Dlamini. “If he (Khenyeza) has spoken to TS Galaxy, us as the club we don’t know about it. Remember it is Sunday today and we haven’t received any resignation letter.” Khenyeza’s departure will see current Usuthu coach Jozef Vukusic left alone at the struggling Durban side, who are second from bottom.
