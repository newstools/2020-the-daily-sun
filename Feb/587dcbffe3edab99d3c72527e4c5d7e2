RESIDENTS of Lower Crossroads in Philippi East, Cape Town, are living in fear. This comes after a man’s body was found on the pavement on Ngqwangi Drive on Wednesday. Mandilakhe Sukula (40) told Daily Sun she was on her way to work when she saw the unidentified body.  “I thought he was drunk at first,” she said. “Little did I know the man was dead.” Mandilakhe believed the man must have been robbed first as he had no shoes on. Mlungisi Cibeni (55) doesn’t live far from where the body was found. He said it was not unusual to hear robbery victims screaming for help or asking forgiveness. “It looks as if they stabbed the poor guy before bashing him with a stone on the head, but we heard nothing,” he said. It wasn’t clear what else was taken from the victim besides his shoes. “No one knows if the man had money on him,” said Mlungisi. “Whoever did this will pay. The man they killed was very nice.” Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket was opened for investigation after the body of a man was found at Lower Crossroads, on Wednesday morning.
