Mpumalanga police have launched a manhunt for two armed suspects who robbed a shop and fled with cash. The robbery happened on Wednesday at Dumphries Village outside Thulamahashe. The three men entered the shop, owned by Pakistan nationals, and pointed guns at the staff before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash and airtime vouchers. The suspects apparently fled the scene in a bakkie. But a car chase ensued between the suspects and a group of Pakistan nationals and an angry mob. Two of the suspects managed to jump out of the car and flee into the bushes, while the driver was caught at Merry Pebble Stream Village. He was then taken back to the crime scene where he was allegedly beaten to death with sjamboks. In a video which emerged after the incident, the third suspect is seen bleeding while being moered and can be heard pleading with the mob not to kill him. He also tells them he was only hired to be a driver. Residents told Daily Sun the chase was like a Hollywood movie as bullets were exchanged between the suspects and the shop owners. “The driver lost control of the bakkie. He was caught when he tried to flee on foot,” said a resident. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they were investigating a case of murder and business robbery. Hlathi said the suspects were cornered by an angry mob, but two managed to escape. He said the driver was unfortunately caught and taken back to the scene where he was assaulted to death. “We are calling on the community not to take the law into their own hands, but inform the police if they come across suspects,” said Hlathi. Anyone with information that can help with the investigation can contact Mhala police on 013 773 0331 or 079 396 4587.
