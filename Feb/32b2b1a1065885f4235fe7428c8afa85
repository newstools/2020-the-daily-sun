THE old school will tell you that these boots were the most comfortable and the best ever... The Jomo Sono King and the Adidas Argentina were very strong and designed for tougher conditions like gravel grounds in the townships. Dribbling wizards in the 1980s and the 1990s such Jomo Sono, Joel "Ace"Â  Mnini, Zebulon "Sputla" Nhlapo, Nelson "Teenage" Dladla, Amos "Heel Extension" Mkhari, Doctor "16V" Khumalo played gleefully using these boots. Today's boots are made of fancy, thin designer leather and are mostly designed for grass and artificial turf. They feel so light and come in very bright and odd colours. What do you make of old and present soccer boots?
