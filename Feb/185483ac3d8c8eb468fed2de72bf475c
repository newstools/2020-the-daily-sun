THE pain of losing her only son was too much to bear. She was dealt another blow when she saw her son’s alleged killer roaming the streets. This angered Zodwa Tshabangu (66) and residents, who said the suspect (45) must leave the area for good. Zodwa from Hospital View in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said the woman killed Thabo (41) over a stompie. “We’re told the woman demanded a cigarette from Thabo, who told her he doesn’t share smokes with old women.  Zodwa said her husband Jomo rushed to the scene and found Thabo lying on the ground. “We’re not happy. We were not even called in court. We only see that she’s out,” she said. Jomo said his son was helpful and respectful. He was struggling to deal with Thabo’s death.  After the murder suspect was granted R800 bail on Friday, residents told Daily Sun they had lost hope in the justice system. “If it was a woman killed by a man, the man wouldn’t have been made to pay such a small amount,” said resident Timothy Ledwaba. Lunga Sithole said: “She must not set her foot here. We’re going to teach her a lesson.” Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said being out on bail didn’t mean the case was over. The suspect is due back in court on 27 March.
