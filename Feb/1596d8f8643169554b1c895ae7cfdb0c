South African Tourism has partnered with rapper Cassper Nyovest to explore the country. This is a bid to encourage people of Mzansi to experience various tourist attractions within the country. The Phumakim’ hitmaker visited Mpumalanga on Thursday. His first stop was at Lone Creeks Falls in Sabie where he shot his Move for me music video last year. He later went to the third largest canyon in the world, Blyde River Canyon and his last stop was at the Graskop Gorge Lift. He told Daily Sun that what attracted him to the place before was the unique attractions that are within the province. "What I like on the tour so far is the Lone Creeks Waterfall. When I got to the waterfall, I couldn't believe it. I just lost my mind after seeing that beautiful place which was not created by anyone," he said. "I would encourage people to travel here in Mzansi and discover all the hidden gems," he said. The “Move With Cassper” campaign will see Cassper and his friends traveling and exploring all of the country’s nine provinces experiencing various tourism activities, all in a bid to show South Africans that traveling South Africa is easy, fun, accessible and affordable. The campaign started in 2017, to allow South Africans to enjoy their country. South African tourism, head of domestic tourism, Mashoto Mokgethi said when they started in 2017 compared to now, the campaign has seen an increase of about 150% in domestic trips that have been taken. Mokgethi said they are trying to get more people from Mzansi to travel.
