JOINING Renault’s growing tribe is the all-new Triber, an SUV-inspired seven-seater destined to take Mzansi by storm! Like the popular Renault Kwid, the Triber is aimed at budget buyers and ticking all the right boxes to become a top-seller. Space is also the name of the Triber’s game, with 625 litres of luggage capacity if you remove the rearmost seats., while Renault also claims 100-seating combinations! The interior of the vehicle is equipped with smart storage spaces of up to 31 litres, with an innovative cold storage facility within the centre console and lower glove box, and a handy drawer under the driver’s seat. The Triber’s design is sure to attract attention with its striking projector headlights, stylish roof rails (with a load capacity of 50kg), LED daylight running lights and bold grille design. Ground clearance is impressive too at 182 mm.  Buyers can choose from three models, the Expression, the mid-spec Dynamique and the range-topping Prestige version. On the safety front, all models come with ABS brakes and dual airbags, while the Prestige derivative gets two extra side-airbags. Air-conditioning, power steering and electric front windows are standard. The Expression model has a standard audio system with Bluetooth connectivity, while the other two models boast a state-of-the-art infotainment system with a touchscreen and Apple Carplay/Android Auto compatibility. All derivatives are powered by a new generation 1,0 litre three-cylinder petrol engine, which is good for 52 kW of power and 92 Nm of torque. The Triber is quite efficient too with an average consumption figure of 5,5 litres/100km. To facilitate peace-of-mind driving, the Triber model range comes standard with a two-year/30 000km service plan, plus a five-year/150 000km mechanical warranty.
