Western
Cape police have tracked down and arrested a man who allegedly killed
22-year-old librarian Clodine Nuys outside Groot Brak River before fleeing the
scene. Nuys' body
was found tied up in Jonkersberg on Tuesday evening after she went missing
earlier in the day. She had
left for her job at the Jonkersberg library around 07:00 but never arrived home
in the afternoon. Captain
Malcolm Pojie said search party members found her lifeless body at the back of
the local cr√®che, with her hands and feet tied with tape and a cable tie around
the neck. Her
cellphone and the keys to the library were reported to be missing. On
Wednesday, when investigators were led to a house in the same village where a
possible suspect lived, he fled the area and disappeared, Pojie said. Following a
massive manhunt, the 24-year-old man was "found in dense forest in
Jonkersberg, where he hid". Pojie said
the man would be detained at Groot Brak River police station until his
appearance on a murder charge in the Mossel Bay Magistrate's Court on Monday. Police were
still busy determining how Nuys died, and the motive for the crime. Nuys had
worked at the library for the last three years and was well known in the
community, according to Netwerk24. Condolences
poured in for her on social media, with shocked loved ones describing her as
quiet and someone who had a beautiful smile. SOURCE:
