MADALA Moroka Letuma and his horse, Lucky, recently crossed the river. And Lucky returned home alone 12 days ago. But the 67-year-old madala from Fouriesburg, Free State, is nowhere to be found. His worried family members said they were haunted by dreams of him being taken by a river snake. Moroka’s brother, Modise, said: “In the dream, he is motionless and his eyes are closed. Even though we don’t believe in super natural things, we just want his body to be found so we can give him a proper burial.” He said Moroka and Lucky were very close. “The horse would wait for him whenever he went somewhere. My brother had owned the horse for about five years and would get angry if someone threw a stone at it.” Family friend, Tumelo Litaba, said Moroka often crossed the river on horseback. “Witnesses told me they saw him go into the river and the horse came out alone.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a missing persons docket was opened. “Police divers and a helicopter were sent to Fouriesburg on Thursday, but there was no sign of Moroka. At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing a two-piece denim worksuit, green gumboots and a wool hat. The search is still on. Anyone who has seen him should contact Warrant Officer Ndade Mokone at Fouriesburg Police Station on 058 223 8313, 072 459 8152, 081 511 0175, 064 242 7168 or 073 115 6420,” said Makhele.
