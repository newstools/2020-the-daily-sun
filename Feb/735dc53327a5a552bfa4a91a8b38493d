PARLIAMENT has downplayed EFF threats to disrupt Parliament during the State of the Nation Address, saying it had adequate mechanisms to maintain the dignity of the house. The institution also dared the EFF to produce any evidence of police being “smuggled” in to serve as Sergeant-At-Arms or Parliamentary Protection Officers to deal with the red berets if they disrupt Sona. The Parliament in a statement responding to threats and claims by the EFF assured the public that it has appropriate measures to maintain the decorum and dignity of the house. “Existing joint rules of Parliament sufficiently protect sittings of the Houses and committees from disorder. "Open threats to disrupt the work of Parliament, including the propagation of conspiracy theories, are not in the interests of the public,” Parliament said in a statement. It added these theories and threats served only as attempts to distract Parliament from its work. It further urged parties or MPs with evidence of any alleged plot to unlawfully use police in the Chamber during Sona to submit it to the Presiding Officers. South Africans face a range of socio-economic hardships. “Parliament and public representatives should ensure a conducive environment for the Sona – which outlines interventions to tackle these hardships. “The Sona also allows Parliament for effective oversight over the Executive to ensure quality delivery of services,” it said. Parliament said it was pleased with the state of readiness of Sona on Thursday as it prepares to host most than 2000 of its guests that had been invited. “We encourage members of the public to follow and participate in the Sona through a wide range of public platforms,” it said. The EFF earlier vowed that it would disrupt the proceedings if President Cyril Ramaphosa does not fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. “When (President) Cyril Ramaphosa speaks, we will also speak,” threatened the red berets.
