The accused had a conflict with his Legal Aid lawyer, who advised him to plead guilty. New lawyer Peter Malibe asked the court for time to consult with the accused. “I ask for the case to be moved until tomorrow as I’m planning to draft a plea statement for the accused, and I want to explain everything to him so he doesn’t change his mind again,” Malibe told the court.
