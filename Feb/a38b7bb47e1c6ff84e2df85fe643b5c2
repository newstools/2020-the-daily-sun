Feeling like doing something out of the ordinary? The upside down house in Hartbeespoort might just be the place for you. "A 'world' turned upside down... The birth of the inspirational idea of this ingenious 'house' became real by the reflection of a peculiar presence, which in the existing world might sometimes feel upside down... Come and experience the magnificence and spectacular engineering of a 'house' turned on its roof. Imagine being a part of the expressiveness of unique art by taking a pause from your everyday routine reality and connecting to the difference," the website upsidedownhouse.co.za states. #upsidedownhousesa ??
