METRO cops spend the better part of their working lives in the streets. Sadly, it is these very streets that witness some of them meet their untimely deaths, mostly in the line of duty. The notorious streets claimed yet another victim on Saturday when a 49-year-old Metro cop was hit by a drunken driver in Meadowlands zone 10, Soweto. Jacob Moila had tried to stop a grey Honda Ballade for a roadside check when he was struck, according to JMPD spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. He said the driver was bust on the scene and tested 0.94mg on the breathalyser. He was charged with culpable homicide. JMPD boss David Tembe said Moila would be given a military funeral because he died in the line of duty. JMPD has lost a number of officers in the line of duty in the recent past. Most of them were knocked down by drunk drivers. In October, an officer was killed while directing traffic on the Marlboro Drive M1 offramp. The driver, Albert Pretorius, was charged with culpable homicide and received a suspended sentence. In 2018, two women officers died after they were run over by a car at a roadblock on Witkoppen Road.
