MEET the young entrepreneur and Smile Denti Care owner, Dr Nokukhanya Nyalunga from Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga. She drives a 2017 model VW Polo sedan. Q: Is it your first car? A: It’s my fourth. All my cars were Volkswagen and I’m not disbanding the VW family anytime soon. Q: Why do you love this one so much? A: My car is convenient, fuel-efficient and easy to maintain. I use it as a work car, especially when I do oral health outreach programmes. Q: Tell us what you like about this car? A: The comfort and it’s balanced on the road. Q: Is it your dream car? A: No, it’s a work car. My dream car is Pink G700 Brabus. Q: Would you allow another person to drive it? A: I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t. As long as they’re good drivers they can drive my car. I sometimes need a driver because of the areas I travel in and to minimise the level of fatigue. Q: Have you driven any long distance trips in it? A: Yes, I’ve been to many places in and around Mpumalanga to do my outreach programmes. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour? A: Personally, I love bright colours. But this one I bought strictly for business. It’s also good for branding. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: Rarely. Q: What do you think of other drivers? A: I think we need to be cautious on the road and try to be early to make our trips more comfortable and safe. Most importantly, we should learn to follow the rules of the road and respect other road users, drivers and pedestrians alike.
