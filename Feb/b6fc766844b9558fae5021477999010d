BIDVEST Wits coach
Gavin Hunt is targeting a cup and league double. The Clever Boys coach
predicted twists and turns in the Absa Premiership title race. Wits lifted the
Nedbank Cup title back in 2010 after hammering AmaZulu 3-0 at the opening of
the newly refurbished FNB Stadium. The Clever Boys host Chippa United in the Ke
Yona last 16 match at Milpark Stadium tomorrow night (7.30pm). Hunt is not prioritizing
the cup over the league as he believes that his side is capable of winning both
trophies.  Despite trailing log leaders
Kaizer Chiefs by eleven points, Hunt insists that his charges can still pull
the rabbit out of the hut and unseat Amakhosi at the top of the log. Wits are fifth
with 34 points from 18 matches and have two games in hand. “There is still
everything to play for. We are not giving up on our quest to win the league. We
are targeting the top two positions. Expect more surprises in the remaining ten
games.” Warned Hunt. Wits must play Chiefs twice in the league and
Hunt is banking on those games to turn the table on Amakhosi.  But before the temperamental coach can shift
his focus on the league, he must prepare his charges for the visit of the Chilly
Boys. The Eastern Cape
based outfit have nothing to lose and everything to gain in this cup tie. “We
have to get past this round and take it from there. It’s always good to win a
cup. We want to win both competitions. Every game is important.”
