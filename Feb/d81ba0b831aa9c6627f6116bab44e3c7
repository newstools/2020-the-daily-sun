    KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp insists that he is not overly concerned by the transfer ban imposed by Fifa on the club.Chiefs were recently slapped with a transfer ban of two windows by the world football governing body over the transfer of Madagascan midfielder Andriamirado ‘Dax’ Andrianarimanana.The Soweto giants have decided to appeal the decision before the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Should they not be successful in their attempts, Chiefs will not be able to sign and register new players in the next two transfer window.However, Middendorp believes Amakhosi have enough quality players to compete for silverware even if they are banned. “It’s an office matter,” said Middendorp.“For me it not even something to discuss. I haven’t even had a discussion with administration and management of the club about this issue.“If is the final word (the ban) with everything on the table then we will find solutions. Basically, we have a qualified PSL squad, most of the players have contracts with a view to next season.“We also have a lot of good young players, from Happy Mashiane to Njabulo Blom and Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, we have used them already.  We have more players out on loan doing their job and getting competitive match time.“I’m not even prepared to make a comment about it (ban), for me it’s not final and the club have not made a statement internally that we have todeal with this.”
