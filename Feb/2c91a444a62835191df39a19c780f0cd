NATURALISATION or nurture? The two methods can probably work for Bafana Bafana as they forge a new path under coach Molefi Ntseki… according to Pitso Mosimane. The Mamelodi Sundowns coach is a big Gaston Sirino fan, and he certainly wouldn’t mind seeing the South American in the colours of Bafana. Despite his sparkling form, Sirino has yet to catch the eye in his native Uruguay. And Mosimane does not see the 28-year-old from Montevideo dislodging the likes of Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani from the star-studded La Celeste line-up. “I’d love to see him play for South Africa. Why not? He probably won’t take Suarez out of the Uruguay team,” said Mosimane. He further drew comparisons with France. “Let’s be honest, the whole French national team is full of DRC Congo, Cameroon and Mali players because of the French colonisation. “Lukaku (Romelu) plays for Belgium. His father is from DRC. These players decide to play for European nation teams. But they are born there, remember. So we should perhaps probably look at the nationalities of children who are born here. Maybe we should look at it differently and see what we can get out of that. However, the forthright Mosimane emphasised the importance of nurturing local talent, slamming poor development structures. “But the difference is those Africans who are born in Europe is that they through proper structures. The Mbappes, Pogbas, Dembeles are from Africa, if follow their roots. “So if you fix our youth structures we will benefit.”
