Tokyo, Japan ~ HUNDREDS of passengers began leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship yesterday after the end of a much-criticised two-week quarantine that failed to stop the spread of coronavirus among passengers and crew. Results were still pending for some passengers who’ve been tested for the virus that has infected tens of thousands of people in China and more than 540 on the ship. Some passengers said on social media that they received health check forms asking if they had symptoms such as a headache, fever or coughing. Passengers who tested negative and had no symptoms still had to get their body temperature checked before they left. Japanese soldiers helped escort some passengers, including a madala in a wheelchair who wore a face mask and held a cane. Some passengers apparently called taxis to get home. Others rode on buses while being transported to train stations. Some people, still in their ship cabins, waved farewell from their balconies to those who had already disembarked. The 3 711 people, including 1 100 crew members on the Diamond Princess, went into quarantine off Japan on 5 February, after it emerged that a former passenger had tested positive for coronavirus. – REUTERS
