THE people share their space with rats – and they want the municipality to bring owls to protect them. Residents from Madelakufa squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said owls were brought in to chase the rats away but as soon as they disappeared, the rats returned. “We have rats as big as cats. “Only owls can get rid of them,” said resident Master Nyundu. Another resident Phineas Ndlovu said rubbish wasn’t always collected. “Living in the squatter camp is not healthy. Some people burn their rubbish but others just throw it anywhere, and the rats feed on it,” he said. Last year, a baby died after she was bitten by rats while asleep. The family has since moved. “Rats feed on anything from humans to rubbish.  “We need the owls,” said another resident Vakashile Dotea. “We fear diseases. Rats come into our homes and it’s easy for us to get sick. We would appreciate it if the municipality can fumigate the area. “The rats are out of control.” Velaphi Nkabinde said recyclers were making the problem worse. “Their rubbish is piling up everywhere.”  Tony Khoza sells rat traps and he has many customers. Whenever they hear “ayafa amagundwane”, they know he’s in the area. But some residents don’t want the owls. “Some people use owls for evil things,” said Thomas Langa. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said they will investigate the rat problem.
