The body of
Tazne van Wyk, 8, who went missing two weeks ago, has been found in a
stormwater pipe outside Worcester, Western Cape police confirmed on Thursday
morning. The
suspect, who was arrested in the Eastern Cape on Monday night, and transported
back to Cape Town on a kidnapping charge, led detectives to the gruesome
discovery late on Wednesday evening, said Brigadier Novela Potelwa. She said
the 54-year-old man would be charged with murder and is expected to appear in
the Goodwood Magistrate's Court on Friday "As
the investigation unfolds, the possibility of the suspect facing additional
charges cannot be ruled out," she said. "Meanwhile,
the parents of Tazne have just been informed of the discovery and they are
receiving counselling." Tazne was
last seen walking to a tuck shop near her home in Connaught Estate, Elsies
River, almost two weeks ago. Western
Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata, congratulated
the detectives and search parties for their diligence. "In a
province that is notorious for crimes against women and children, we reiterate
our resolve to ensure the perpetrators of these heinous acts are brought to
book in order to face the full might of the law," said Matakata. SOURCE:
