THIS week in our #SEPARATED-AT-BIRTH write-up, we feature former Orlando Pirates star Mpho Makola and Skeem Sami actor Meneer Magongwa. Makola is a fiery and temperamental midfielder who is known for his dangerous free-kicks that gave goalkeepers a nightmare. He was a Bafana Bafana regular and is now playing for Cape Town City. Meneer Magongwa real name Putla Sehlapelo, plays the character of a very interesting school teacher in the SABC drama Skeem Sami. The two have similar facial features and they could be easily mistaken for siblings. Do you agree with Sunsport that the two famous stars could have been separated at birth, perhaps?
