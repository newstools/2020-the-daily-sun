MOLLY Tladi is living in fear and blames Home Affairs. The 50-year-old from Mabopane block B, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she was struggling to get an ID for her son Tebogo (25). Molly said her nightmare began after Tebogo lost his birth certificate.

Just like that! “He couldn’t write matric because they needed his ID, so he had to drop out.” According to Molly, Tebogo became disillusioned and started being naughty and up to no good as a result. Things became so bad, she said, that she lived in constant fear that he’d fall into temptation and start doing bad things again. “All I want is for him to get an ID book because he can’t get a job without it,” she said. Tebogo admitted to the SunTeam that the ID problem had caused him a lot of stress. “I hope I get help because I’ve been through a lot,” he said. “I feel as if I’m not complete, as if I’m utterly useless and powerless.” READ: READ DELETED WHATSAPP MESSAGES WITH THIS TRICK Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola promised that the department would contact Molly. “I’ve sent his details to the relevant unit for investigation,” said Mokgola. “We’ll contact her to gather more information in order to finalise the matter.”
