FORMER NPA boss Nomgcobo Jiba’s plan to prosecute the Cato Manor case was completely out of the ordinary. The charges related to the alleged police killing of 45 people in KZN. The Durban High Court dropped the charges last year. Former KZN acting director of public prosecutions, Simphiwe Mlotshwa, told the Zondo Commission yesterday Jiba wanted the case to be handled by prosecutors from outside the province. Mlotshwa said Jiba’s plan curiously meant that heads of specific divisions in other provinces would have to leave their jobs to go and prosecute a case in another. He said he had never heard of such a thing before. He said Jiba claimed she was advised not to involve prosecutors and attorneys from KZN, because there was a possibility some of them would be charged in the case. Mlotshwa said he was never even asked for his views. He said he was told he’d be sent an indictment and a prosecutor’s memo to sign for the matter to be enrolled in court. However, when the email from South Gauteng director of public prosecutions Andrew Chauke came, case numbers and evidence were not attached. “As head of the division, I had to be satisfied that evidence existed to justify enrolment of the matter. I had difficulty signing that indictment without a memo detailing charges and evidence to be used. I refused to sign it until I was recalled,” he said.
