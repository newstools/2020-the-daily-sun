IT all started with a
hilarious video of Mabena. Instead of these
moments coming to an end, it seems as though a flood gate has been opened. On Tuesday last week,
Daily Sun published a video of a training session of the South African National
Defence Force (SANDF) that went wrong. Barely a week after
that video was published, another one has surfaced on social media. In the video, a
soldier can be seen offloading an SANDF Gecko light rapid deployment logistic
vehicle from a military truck. It then turns for
worst when the Gecko hits the ground and the soldier tries to reverse, by the
looks of things the soldier couldnâ€™t see another Gecko parked behind him with
soldiers standing next to it. The soldier continues
to reverse into the other Gecko and soldiers crashing into them. It is not clear when
and where the incident occurred.
