THE family that wanted a mashonisa to bury their gogo took her body to the mashonisa’s house on Friday. But the mashonisa wouldn’t open her gate. The fed-up family from Brandfort, Free State, wanted mashonisa Matshepang Ratsella to bury gogo Julia Khaile after she allegedly kept her Sassa card for many years. Gogo’s niece Nelly Mcandi told Daily Sun: “I want gogo Julia to deal with her. Even during her last hours she wanted to speak to Matshepang but words wouldn’t come out of her mouth.  “The undertaker didn’t want to release the body because there was an outstanding amount. “We had to make a plan to get her body. “Although Matshepang didn’t want to open her gate, we spoke to gogo and asked her to deal with her.” Matshepang was surprised when the family stopped at her house with the gogo’s coffin. She told the mourning family to leave her home, but they stood there for about two hours. The family buried the gogo at Brandfort Cemetery on Saturday. Ward committee member Baile Segalo said: “We first learnt that gogo Julia’s card was with Matshepang early last year when we wanted to take her to an old age home.” The committee intervened again after reading the story on Thursday. “We waited for hours at Matshepang’s home on Thursday and she was unavailable. “The family told me Matshepang had for years kept the card because gogo Julia bought from her shop on credit.”
