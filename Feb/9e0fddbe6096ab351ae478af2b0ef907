PITSO Mosimane has weighed
in on the raging apartheid debate. The outspoken Mamelodi
Sundowns coach opened up on his terrible experience during the dark of apartheid, a system which has been declared a crime against
humanity. Like many citizens, who
plied their trade overseas, Mosimane escaped the clutches of the evil system
when he went to play for Greek side Ionikos. But it wasn’t before he had
his own taste of the racially divisive policy. “Apartheid was strong,
guys. We have our own challenges now, but we can't say we were better under apartheid,”
said Mosimane. “No, I know where I come
from and I know what happened to me. To study physical science in Afrikaans, I
did, to study mathematics in Afrikaans.I'm
telling you, it was difficult. “That thing was very evil.
Even at this point it has taught us as black people to hate one another.
It’s huge. Sometimes we accept when another race has to enjoy the benefits of
apartheid. But when it’s your neighbour, your fellow black, you say ‘Geez, this
guy has so much money, why he has to earn so much money’. Yet when it’s the CEO
of Checkers… of Nedbank… CEO of Sanlam and all these big corporates, you know
how much they earn, we accept it, we live with it. “If it's a darkie, yerrr. They
ask, ‘How come this guy earns so much money’. It’s because we come from that
evil spirit of apartheid and I don't blame our people. “Fortunately, I was in
Soweto where I grew up and we eliminated it through the power of students, the
power of education and we fought against that. Look where we are now. We can
even talk about it.” Former deputy-president FW
de Klerk brought the old topic to the fore when he remarked that he wasn’t aware apartheid
was declared a crime against unity by the United Nations.
