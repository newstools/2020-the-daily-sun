ON WEDNESDAY, victims of a killer storm received much-needed help. The storm that hit Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung on 10 January claimed the life of Elsie Nero (38) after a church roof landed on her shack. However, residents were all smiles when they saw a truck arriving with food and clothes for them. Bags of potatoes, maize and cabbage were delivered. The donation was from Pastor Zenzile November of Victorious Faith Ministries, who couldn’t stand by while families suffered. “The storm damaged people’s shacks and many lost their belongings. “Some were rushed to hospital and found their remaining belongings stolen when they returned. “We decided to help 200 families with groceries and clothes. The families will always be in our prayers.” The joyful residents ululated and whistled when the truck arrived. Thabo Sebolai (54) said he lost all his clothes. “I thought I was going to die when the storm hit our kasi,” he said. “I’m glad it didn’t claim many people’s lives, but I was sad after Elsie died. “Pastor November has come to our rescue and we thank him for his good heart.” Esther Hlasela (58) lost all her documents and her groceries were damaged by the storm. “I received food from Pastor November’s church and will be going to Home Affairs to apply for another ID,” she said.
