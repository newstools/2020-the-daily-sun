ALL time PSL top scorer Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe, who scored a record of 123 goals, is set to launch his own deodorant. This was revealed by his long time representative Mike Makaab, of Prosport International whom said Nomvethe become his first player he represents in 1997 when the veteran striker was starting his football career. Already, the 42-year-old, who shocked the football fraternity recently when he came out of retirement to join GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC after he retired at the end of last season when he was at AmaZulu, is also documenting his career. “With Bhele, we are getting him into some really good brand ambassadorial world. He’s going to do that for Prosport, he’s started doing it for AmaZulu, a bit of work with Build It,” said Makaab. “We are also doing a drama document on him, which we hope will be released in the next six to twelve months. “We also going to be launching a deodorant. We have been approached by top, top group of entrepreneurs who said they want to use him as a face of their new deodorant. “Right now we are in the process of finalising that. He deserves everything he gets. He has been a role model to absolutely everybody.” Bhele surprised many to come back to football after 22 years in the professional ranks. Makaab said he was lured by the Cane Cutters, who are hopeful of getting the PSL promotion come end of the season. “He was persuaded to come out of retirement and this happened after I had long chat with him,” revealed Makaab. “As always has been, he’s such a humble human being. He said to me he can still play four to five months of football.”
