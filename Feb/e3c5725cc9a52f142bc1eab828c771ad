Tennis great Roger Federer has announced he has undergone knee surgery and will miss a host of tournaments in the coming weeks - including the French Open in May. "My right knee has been bothering me for a little while. I hoped it would go away, but after an examination, and discussion with my team, I decided to have arthroscopic surgery in Switzerland yesterday," the 20-time Grand Slam champion wrote on his official twitter account on Thursday. Federer added that doctors were confident he would make a full recovery and he is eyeing a return to the ATP Tour during the grass season. "I am grateful for everyone's support. I can't wait to be back playing again soon, see you on the grass!" Federer's likely return to action at the grass event in Halle in June, an event he has won 10 times. - sport24
