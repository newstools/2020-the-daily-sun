TRADITIONAL leaders will know on Thursday whether or not the izibonda election will happen. Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini interdicted the election in the Pietermaritzburg High Court through his Ingonyama Trust Board on Friday. Zwelithini lashed out at the KZN government. He said the election was organised behind his back. Voting for izibonda, chiefs elected for a five-year term, was meant to happen on Saturday but was canned at the last minute. Seven izibonda were meant to be elected in Umzimkhulu and two in Eshowe. Ingonyama chairman Jerome Ngwenya said the government couldn’t organise such an important event involving amakhosi without consulting Zwelithini. “The king felt undermined. Even the voting stations were not announced and the election date wasn’t gazetted,” he said. He said the matter would be back in court on Thursday, where the government was expected to oppose the order being made permanent. Two weeks ago, traditional leaders distanced themselves from Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka’s announcement that his department was ready for the election. House of Traditional Leaders chairman Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza said there’d be no election until the government paid former council members their stipends from 2011. Hlomuka said the department respected the court’s decision.
