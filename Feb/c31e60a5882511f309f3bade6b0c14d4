OSAKA’s Itami Airport is setting up a toilet area for dogs, complete with a pole to cock a leg on. The toilet, outside the terminal, will have a shower and water bowls, operator Kansai Airports said. The “pee pole” will flush. It’s designed to encourage dogs to relieve themselves before boarding domestic flights. – REUTERS
