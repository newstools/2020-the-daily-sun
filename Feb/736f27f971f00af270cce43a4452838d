FOR decades, people have been wearing arm belts to gain power. But Thabo Mokoto says he wears his for protection against evil and to get good luck. The 27-year-old from Fochville, Gauteng, told Daily Sun he started wearing his belt last year. “I’ve seen things going right in my life since I started wearing the belt. I run a small business and the belt brings me customers,” he said. Thabo said he first started wearing the belt after he was advised to do so by a sangoma. “I was told the belt had to be respected or I’d attract bad luck to myself. People often complain the belt is not working, while they forget how to conduct themselves,” he said. “Anything that protects needs to be respected. The belts are made by traditional healers and inyangas on request by their clients. But some people use them for the wrong reasons.” “It works for some but not others. This is why some end up being caught or even killed during robberies,” he said. Thabo said he had to visit the sangoma to top up his belt. “If you don’t do that, bad luck will follow you.” He said he bought the belt and then took it to the sangoma to put muthi on it. Sangoma Mamokete Mofokeng said arm belts needed to be respected for users to get good luck. “It’s unfortunate that some people use them for the wrong reasons. Arm belts have been used for many years,” Mamokele said.
