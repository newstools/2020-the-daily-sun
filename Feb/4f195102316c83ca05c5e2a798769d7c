FAF du Plessis has
announced has stepped down as captain of the Proteas’ Test and T20 teams with
immediate effect. Du Plessis has cited a
need to take a step back from captaincy in order to help facilitate the emergence
of the next generation of leaders within the team under the new stewardship of
Quinton de Kock. With a calendar that is
jam-packed with international tours both home and away, including the T20 World
Cup in Australia later this year, Du Plessis wants to focus on contributing to
the team as a batsman and a senior player, who will offer guidance and advice
to the new leadership group as part of their succession planning. Du Plessis has captained
South Africa in a total of 112 international matches across all three formats
since 2012. He led the Proteas for the
very first time against New Zealand in a T20 series. The has scored 5 101 runs
in all formats as captain amassing 11 centuries and 28 half-centuries as he
went and guided the Proteas in several famous victories, including the team’s
five-nil inbound ODI series and 2-1 outbound Test series victories against
Australia in 2016.
