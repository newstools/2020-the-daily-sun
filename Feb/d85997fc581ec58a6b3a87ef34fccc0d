THE family believed their son was going to fulfil his dream of being a great soccer player. But instead a bogus coach allegedly raped him. The 14-year-old boy reported the incident and a case was opened. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the boy was recruited in December by someone who claimed to be a soccer coach. Mbele said the man (25) promised that the boy would play for a PSL junior team. “The coach went to the boy’s home, where he produced forms for the family to fill out stating the boy was going to join a soccer academy.  Mbele said the case was transferred to the Pinetown family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit for further investigation. “The initial investigation revealed this was not the first time the man did this. Cases of a similar nature were opened at Chatsworth and Mariannhill police stations,” said Mbele. She said investigations led to a so-called clubhouse in KwaMashu M section. “Police found a four-roomed house with no kitchen.  “Four boys, aged 16 and 17, were found on the premises. “It was found they were from various parts of the province and had been lured by the suspect on the prospect of pursuing their soccer ambitions.” The suspect appeared in the Pinetown Magistrates Court yesterday. He was kept in jail until 11 February for a bail application.
