THE only thing residents wanted was to clear bushes used by tsotsis as a hideout. But they now sleep in the open after their plan turned sour on Saturday. Residents of Umlazi V section, south of Durban, told Daily Sun they slept behind Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital after the municipality took away their building materials and demolished shacks. They claimed municipal guards sold their materials at a scrapyard. Nokuthula Bhengu (41) moved out of a rented room so she could build herself a shack. “We didn’t think the municipality would be so heartless and send violent guards to demolish what we built for our children,” she said. Another resident (48) said the guards had been seen selling corrugated iron at a scrapyard. He said they reported the matter to cops. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a complaint was received by Umlazi cops about guards allegedly stealing building materials. “They claimed the guards demolished their shacks, stole building materials, and sold them at a nearby scrapyard. No case was opened,” she said. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said:“The city urged residents to refrain from invading land as it’s unlawful and hampers service delivery. “We understand people require land, but that doesn’t justify illegal invasion.”
