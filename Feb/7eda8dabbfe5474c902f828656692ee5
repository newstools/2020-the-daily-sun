Your nose is home to millions of bacteria, which, for the most part, are harmless. The bacteria may cause problems, however, when they are not expelled from your body with the mucus. This happens when your sinuses are blocked but your glands continue to produce mucus. The bacteria then start to multiply and grow out of control, which can lead to an infection.

Nasal irrigation If you are susceptible to sinusitis, the Harvard Medical School says one of the easiest, most affordable and effective ways to treat your sinus problems is through regular nasal irrigation. You can use a homemade solution to relieve symptom. Follow these steps at least once a day: It's important to thoroughly rinse and dry the neti pot after every use.  6 additional tips There are other things you can do as well to prevent sinusitis.         Although it might be tempting to take an antihistamine to alleviate your symptoms, avoid taking them unless advised by your doctor. Antihistamines can thicken your mucus, which makes it more difficult to drain. If your sinusitis is caused by allergies, however, speak to your doctor about effective treatment options.  Regular cleaning of your home can help prevent sinusitis triggered by allergies by getting rid of dust and pet dander. Clean hard-to-reach areas (curtain rails, blinds and skirting boards) and don't forget to clean your vacuum cleaner filter and replace it regularly.    6. Use a decongestant when flying  Your sinusitis symptoms may worsen due to changes in air pressure if you fly regularly. Nasal drops can help reduce the discomfort experienced when pressure builds up in your sinuses due to chronic sinusitis.
