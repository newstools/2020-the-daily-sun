On Monday, DJ Maphorisa and Prince Kaybee had a heated debate on Twitter about master recordings. For those of you that don’t know what it is, a master recording is the first recording of a song all the later copies are made of. They are usually called just "masters" and can be put on discs, tapes and different computer data storage formats. DJ Maphorisa took to Twitter to say he empowers people, and the rest of the world doesn’t, when he revealed the artists who work under his label own their masters. But artists such as Mafikizolo, Prince Kaybee and Lady Zamar don’t own their masters. The Banomoya hitmaker did not take the comments lying down and hit back, revealing all the assets under his name.   Empty vessels make the most noise... ALL THE TIME??
