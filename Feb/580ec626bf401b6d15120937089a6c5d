KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is starting to feel the pressure of helping the Soweto giants to win a piece of silverware in their 50th anniversary season. What started as a promising season is now starting to worry the Amakhosi faithful. The Soweto giants were sent packing from the Nedbank Cup last 16 game against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium 5-4 on penalties after their game ended 1-1 after extra-time. The conditions were tough for both teams as it rained heavily throughout the game and the wind and lightening did not make matters easier. The German mentor refused to be drawn into his team’s Soweto derby chances against Orlando Pirates at the FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon (3.30pm). A visibly disappointed Middendorp even refused to entertain any thoughts of Amakhosi going all the way in the championship race. The German mentor put on a brave face after the game and said, “We win together and drop out of the Nedbank cup together” When asked to give his thoughts about the derby he said he prefers take things one game at a time as he insisted that he has not yet shifted his focus towards the derby. “We can’t look beyond the next game. We have a game on Saturday, and we will go and prepare for it first and then talk about it. One game at a time.” When asked how the mood in the changeroom is? the German said his boys were disappointed in the dressing room. But With their cup dream over, Amakhosi have the league title to fight for and it present them with their last chance of winning silverware this season. “Highlands Park won, there is nothing we can do. We are out of the cup and we are disappointed. But we can’t think too far ahead. We have a game on Saturday, and we will take it from there okay.” Concluded Middendorp.
