THE state’s first witness in the Pastor Timothy Omotoso trial was calm on the stand yesterday as she gave details of how she was sexually abused. Andisiwe Dike returned to the Port Elizabeth High Court to be cross-examined by defence attorney Peter Daubermann. Omotoso and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing 97 charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. They pleaded not guilty. BRA VAN MEI POKES MY MUM! Daubermann asked Andisiwe (30) how Omotoso inserted his 4-5 into her punani. She said: “Omotoso got on top of me and simulated sex by rubbing his 4-5 against my punani. At one stage, he stopped and said, ‘relax, be yourself and continued until he ejaculated’. “I knew what was going to happen every time I had an appointment with Omotoso.” MY WIFE HATES MY WIFE! Daubermann asked her if she resisted in any way. She responded: “No, except showing him that I’m not comfortable.” It came to light her testimony contradicted her previous statement to the cops in 2018. Asked about this, she acknowledged there were indeed some inaccuracies in the statement but said parts of it were what she said to the investigating officer.
