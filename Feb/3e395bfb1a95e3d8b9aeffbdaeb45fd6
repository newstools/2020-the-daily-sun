Twenty-seven vehicles were impounded in Nyanga on Friday morning for allegedly driving without operating licences or for being in contravention of their licences, the City of Cape Town said. This during a period of volatility in Nyanga which saw several Golden Arrow buses stoned and drivers having to go to safer pick-up points. "The City is maintaining a presence in the Nyanga area. However, all indications are that the situation has been resolved and that Golden Arrow buses are entering the area once more," said the spokesperson for the City's traffic services, Maxine Bezuidenhout. Traffic services held an operation in the area on Thursday morning and impounded the 27 vehicles, which included minibuses and "amaphelas" - a derogatory term for operators who cruise the streets offering short local trips. During the early morning commute, Golden Arrow said five buses were stoned and three drivers injured. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a security company vehicle and private vehicle were also stoned, adding a case of public violence was opened and the police were monitoring the area.
