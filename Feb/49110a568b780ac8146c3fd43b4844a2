Stage 2 rotational load shedding will continue today and tomorrow, with 'a high probability of cuts’ over the weekend. Eskom on Thursday said there is a shortage of capacity and a higher demand for electricity. Eskom said in a statement that “the probability of load shedding remains high for the weekend. It also said it would not be able to suspend cuts for morning or afternoon peak traffic. But would continue to "explore the pilot programme of providing load shedding respite". The power utility said there is an increased possibility of load shedding over the next 18 months, as it is conducting critical maintenance to restore its ageing plants. They said any additional shifts in the system may require a change in the load shedding stage. "We don't take the decision to implement load shedding lightly, but the reality is that our generating infrastructure is constrained and unreliable," said Eskom group CEO André de Ruyter. He requested customers to use electricity sparingly and to reduce demand during this period of load shedding. He continued: “As we continue to replenish the emergency reserves at our pumped storage schemes and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), we will continue to explore the pilot programme of providing load shedding respite during the morning and evening traffic rush hours in the week.“However, this is not possible today owing to the available generating capacity and the need to replenish emergency reserves.” Customers can revisit their load shedding schedules on the Eskom (https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments.
