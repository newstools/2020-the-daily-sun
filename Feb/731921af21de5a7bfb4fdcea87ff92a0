EVENT
organiser and owner of Gesh Lounge and Entertainment Bhekani Ndlovu said Mandla
“Mampintsha” Maphumulo stole his money. Ndlovu
booked him for The Weekend Shutdown on 29 December
but the singer didn’t pitch. “Mampintsha
told me he was booked for another gig here in Empangeni and didn’t mind coming
to Gesh Lounge afterwards. He demanded that I pay R20 000 before the event,” he
told Daily Sun. He said he
initially paid R10 000 on 20 December. “Then he
said I must make a poster with his face on it, which I did.” “A day
before the event he demanded that I pay the remaining balance, otherwise he
wouldn’t come. On the same day, 28 December, I paid another R10 000.” He said
both payments were made to Tshomza Construction, an FNB account. Daily Sun
is in possession of proof of payments amounting to R20 000. On the day
of the event, Bhekani got a call from a man called Phila, claiming to be
Mampintsha’s colleague. “He told me
Mampintsha was lost. Phila said Mampintsha had been performing at an event in
Stanger and disappeared after the performance. “I waited
for him but he never came. When people realised Mampintsha was not coming, they
started attacking me. They felt I had misled them.” Ndlovu said
he was forced to stand at the gate and refund people their money. “I paid
R100 to every one who had a tag.” He could no
longer find Mampintsha. “Initially
he said I must be patient with him. He said he was still waiting for smaller
gigs. But I can’t find him or Phila. “I’m angry
because he disappeared with my money. This is theft and I can see they’re
avoiding me. If they continue like this I’ll be forced to escalate the matter,”
he said. Mampintsha
and Phila could not be reached on their phones and did not respond to WhatsApp
or text messages.
