As a citizen and one of those who’re feeling the pinch of load shedding, I think we’re being hit under the belt here. I don’t see why Eskom always has so many excuses not to serve us. The reason the utility often asks to be rescued and boosted financially is because the top bosses are being paid handsomely every month, while the country faces blackouts daily. It’s frustrating that politically connected individuals influence the utility’s business dealings. Politics and politicians are killing government business in the country. Eskom is a business and every business must make a profit but with the utility, the opposite is true. There’s a lot more happening at these state-owned entities than meets the eye. This has pushed the country to its knees. All the entities must be privatised for the sake of saving the country from misery and humiliation. Taxpayers’ money should be used to develop the country, not to pay bottomless debt.
