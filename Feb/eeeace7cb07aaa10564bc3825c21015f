Amakhosi goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune believes that his side’s two wins over Highlands Park this season will have no bearing on their Nedbank Cup last 16 encounter at the Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday. Khune told the Chiefs website: ”We might have played them already this season, but this is a different ball game,” Khune points out. “They are hosting us, but for us playing home or away is not different because we are fortunate to have fans who travel to all of our games and we must use that to our advantage. We are not expecting an easy match but we ready for the fight and want to ensure we carry on in the competition." Khune was a teenager when he was on the bench amongst the substitutes when Chiefs won the Nedbank Cup in 2006. He watched from the sidelines as Amakhosi defeated Orlando Pirates to lift the Absa Cup as the trophy was known back then. “For me the Nedbank Cup holds many special memories. I remember the 2006 Absa Cup final (now Nedbank Cup) very well. Ernst Middendorp was our coach back then as well and I was on the bench that day. So, this is a very significant cup for me. I can always look back with fond memories on this tournament I won it as part of the team in 2006 and I played in the final in 2013, when we defeated SuperSport in the final,” reminisces Khune. Khune who has won several cup competitions with Chiefs. He will also be looking to draw on his vast experience to help Chiefs navigate through the tournament and go as far as possible. “Cup games are never easy,” he says. “You can play for 90 minutes and then have the game extended for another 30 minutes and penalties. We will aim not to stretch the game and try and get the result inside 90 minutes. We must be mentally, physically and emotionally prepared because in games like this, we cannot afford to switch off at any stage – we need to be alert. We also need to make the most of our chances.”
