NICK Thumbu’s family is looking for him after he mysteriously disappeared on 6 February. The 41-year-old had boarded a taxi at Germiston Taxi Rank in Ekurhuleni, before he stepped out to quickly use the toilet. He was on his way home to Songeni outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. His worried dad Rothmans Thumbu (63) said they were expecting him to arrive early in the morning after he called to say he had not been feeling well. He said Nick works at OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park and didn’t live too far from work. Rothmans said he became worried after he received a call from a taxi driver who said he got his numbers from a form Nick had filled in before boarding the taxi. “The driver said they tried calling Nick after he didn’t come back from the toilet as the taxi was about to leave. He said they also searched for him in the taxi rank’s public toilets but he was nowhere to be found. So the driver said he called to find out if we could come and collect the taxi fare of R240 that he had paid,” Rothmans said. Captain Kay Makhubele said a missing persons case has been opened. Anyone with information should call 08600 10111.
