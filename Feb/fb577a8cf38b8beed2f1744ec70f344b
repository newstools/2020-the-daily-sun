Air Mauritius has announced plans to increase connectivity to Cape Town and Johannesburg, as early as April 2020. The island remains a popular holiday and business destination for locals. The airline announced it's increased capacity plans during its annual Travel Oscar Awards to recognise its partners, and their diligence. “I am very excited to announce that Air Mauritius is working towards injecting new and additional capacity into Cape Town and Johannesburg, effective April 2020. We have established both Leisure and Corporate value propositions, offering more value for money so that travel becomes more accessible,” says Carla da Silva, Air Mauritius Regional General Manager:  Africa and Latin America. The Awards recognised performance across a number of categories, including Marketing, Commitment, Groups, Growth, Corporate Business, and Retail Consortium. "This year was a tough year and we witnessed commitment and partnership at its best,” says Carla da Silva, Air Mauritius Regional General Manager:  Africa and Latin America. "It is this commitment and partnership that have contributed to the successes of both the airline and the Mauritius region – now a billion-rand operation." “Without partnerships, like-minded organisations and peers, businesses do not grow and achieve great things. We are very grateful for the partnerships that help us achieve our value chain goals,” says da Silva.  https://www.traveller24.com/News/Flights/air-mauritius-increases-connectivity-to-south-africa-20200202 This is a modal window.
