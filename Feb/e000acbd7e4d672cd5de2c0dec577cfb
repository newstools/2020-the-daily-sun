BLACK Leopards booked themselves a place in the quarterfinals of the Nedbank when they dumped out a hapless Amavarara FC out of the tournament in a match played at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Friday night. The final score was 2-0. Lesedi Kapinga opened the scoring early in the first half with a blistering shot from close range. Themba Ndlovu doubled the score with another powerful shot also in the opening half. A lot was expected from the lower division side Amavarara but they did not live up to expectations as Lidoda Duvha cruised to an easy victory.
