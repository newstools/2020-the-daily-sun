GATVOL residents on Monday invaded an open land with a dense bush where thugs often hide. They said they believed the only way to fight crime was to invade the land behind Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, south of Durban. Lungile Ntshingila (37) said she and other residents of V section built shacks on the land so thugs would have nowhere to hide. “When we arrived to cut the grass on Monday, we discovered the thugs had already built their little shacks inside the bush, so we demolished their shacks and built our own,” she said. Lungile said they previously invaded the land in 2014 but their councillor sent the municipality to demolish their shacks. “Now we want our councillor to do what is right and allow us to build shacks here. “People are being robbed on a daily basis. He should allow us to stay here so thugs can move out,” she said. Nokuthula Bhengu (41) said if they were allowed to stay on the land, it would help to fight crime. “Just a week ago, a woman I know was walking past the bush and saw some men stripping a car,” she said. Councillor Robert Mzobe said he wasn’t aware the land had been invaded again. He said no one was allowed to build on land that didn’t belong to them. “I don’t think what they’re doing will stop crime,” he told Daily Sun.
