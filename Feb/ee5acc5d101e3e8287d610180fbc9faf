ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer insists that his side will keep their feet firmly on the ground and will not get carried away by their recent impressive run. Pirates have emerged from their struggles earlier this season under former interim coach Rhulani Mokwena and look like a different outfit altogether. They have gone on an impressive seven-match unbeaten run since Zinnbauer took over the reins, winning the last six on the spin. This has catapulted the Soweto giants to second on the Absa Premiership standings, albeit for the time being as they have two games more than third-placed Mamelodi Sundowns. They trail leaders Kaizer Chiefs by nine points. Zinnbauer, who has instilled confidence and a winning mentality back into the Bucs outfit, is adamant that his side are not title contenders as they are still in the “building process” “Yeah we are second at the moment, but it’s only at the moment,” said Zinnbaur. “We know the other teams have games to play still. If they win their games then we go back down again. For me, it is important that we play the next game very well. The next chance for us to get three points, that’s important. “We are second at the moment, it’s the picture at the moment. Nothing more.” Gabadinho Mhango, who scored a brace in Bucs’ 2-1 win over Chippa on Saturday at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, continues to grab the headlines. The Malawian international is currently the top goal scorer in the Premiership with 13 goals, four goals clear of his nearest chasers in pursuit of the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot at the end of the season. Zinnbauer, however, has reserved some special praise for another one of Bucs’ top performers since his arrival, Thembinkosi Lorch. “Lorch is a big player in Africa, he proved that last season,” said Zinnbauer. “He is coming back to that level now, he works for the team. He is a team player. I think it’s clear that he is making those steps in the right direction and that is important for me to see.”
