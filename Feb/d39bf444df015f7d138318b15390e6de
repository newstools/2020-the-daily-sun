The transfer of Madagascan midfielder Andriamirado ‘Dax’ Andrianarimanana has landed Kaizer Chiefs in hot water with Fifa. The world football governing body has issued a two-year transfer ban to Amakhosi for the transfer that took place at the start of the 2018/19 season. The 28-year-old was cleared by Fifa to play for Chiefs following a dispute with his former club Fosa Juniors over his contract. However, FIFA have now revisited the matter and have decided to punish both the player and Amakhosi for the transfer. Chiefs have 21 days to appeal a sentence of two transfer windows before the Court of Arbitration for Sport. “Respondent II, Kaizer Chiefs FC, shall be banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for the two next entire and consecutive registration periods following the notification of the present decision,” read a document from FIFA. For his part, Black Leopards midfielder Dax has been banned for four months. “A restriction of four months on his eligibility to play in official matches is imposed on the Respondent I, Andriamirado Aro Hasina Andrianarimanana,” continued the document. “This sanction applies with immediate effect as of the date of notification of the present decision. The sporting sanction shall remain suspended in the period between the last official match of the season and the first official match of the next season, in both cases including national cups and FIFA international championships for clubs.”
