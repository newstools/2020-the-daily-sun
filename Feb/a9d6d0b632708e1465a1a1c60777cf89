THE South African Football
Association (Safa) have cancelled the National Under-23’s trip to Tokyo to play
against their Japanese counterpart due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus. Safa CEO Gay Mokoena
confirmed that the SA football mother body decided to call off their Olympic
Games preparation match that was scheduled to take place at the end of March against Japan because
of the health and safety of the players. Japan will host the Olympic Games from
24 July until 9 August this year. But they are
growing concerns that this virus will threaten the biggest global sporting
event. “We can’t put the lives of our players at risk. The death toll is
rising each day and we are not prepared to take a big risk.” Explained Mokoena. The Japanese football
association is pleading with Safa to reconsider their cancellation, but Mokoena,
insists that Safa has made up their minds. 
“Japan is asking us to reconsider our decision, but we are sticking to
our guns. We have to act in the best interest of our players.” Concluded Mokoena.
