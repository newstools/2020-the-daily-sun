SOME major roads in Sandton, north of Joburg remained closed and traffic diverted as members of the Economic Freedom Fighters gather to march against Eskom. Addressing 'fighters' before the march could begin, EFF leader Julius Malema told them to be disciplined. He, however, said they were “not going to take any nonsense”. “I have seen some stupid police trying to provoke the fighters…we are not going to take any nonsense from the police…police cannot stop us from protesting…Protest does not have a form …we protest any how we want,” said Malema.  Police presence also remained high to ensure law and order.  Since morning, members have been slowly arriving in busses making their way to Innesfree Park carrying placards and chanting. The march is expected to head to Megawatt Park.  The EFF has called ordinary citizens including trade unions to join as they march against load shedding, privatization and unbundling of Eskom. They are also calling for the Public Enterprise Minister, Pravin Gordhan to be fired. Roads affected include Katherine, Grayston, Rivonia and Witkoppen road - they are expected to reopen after 3pm.  Metro police spokesman Wayne Minnaar said they have deployed a huge number of police to monitor traffic as well as the march. He said: "Motorists are advised to use alternative routes, Sandton Drive and William Nicol Drive."
