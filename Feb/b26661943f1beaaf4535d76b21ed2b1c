LAMONTVILLE Golden Arrows are scenting the blood of Highlands Park. However, coach Steve Komphela has cautioned that they’ll have to shepherd in-form striker Peter Shalulile when the Tembisa-based side visit them in Durban. Arrows will host Highlands, who are high on confidence after dumping Kaizer Chiefs out of the Nedbank Cup second round this past weekend, at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Shalulile has been in supreme form of late. In the last four games, he has claimed three man of the match awards, scoring six goals in the process. In total, he has netted 12 league goals, two behind leading scorer Gabadinho Mhango, who is on top of the pile with 14 goals. “It is only goal difference that separate us with them and they know that when they get to 33 points, they’ll be gaining ground,” said Komphela. “We also want to see how quickly we can get into position five, six and consolidate. But the only thing that will keep us in the top eight is to get a minimum of ten from the rest of games that are left.” Abafana Bes’Thende, who have met Highlands seven times, winning five and losing two of those games, were defeated in the reverse fixture at Makhulong Stadium. Shalulile scored the second goal to see Da Gama’s charges claim a 2-0 victory.
