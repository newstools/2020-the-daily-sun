The R114 Million Powerball winner has come forward to claim her winning. She is a 35-year-old woman from Soweto. The woman told Ithuba that she was renting a back room in Soweto and that sometimes she could not afford rent and her brother would assist heR. She said sh won't be returning to her job and added tha her 'new life' has begun. The occasional Lottery player said she decided to try her luck when she saw other people queuing to buy their tickets. “On my way from work, I saw a long queue of people with bet slips and I knew they must be pursuing something big, even though I had no idea of what the jackpot prize was. I became curious and searched for some coins in my bag to see if I could also play,” she said. The young winner, who manually selected her numbers, spent only R5 on her winning ticket that she bought at Victor and Son’s café in Roodepoort.
