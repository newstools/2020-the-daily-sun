When a fan tweeted that it was her birthday and she needed a R1000 from rapper Cassper Nyovest, he obliged. "Cassper, it's my birthday today. Ngicela unginake tu. Ke shorta ka ewallet from you. Please call me," she tweeted. He then responded, asking her to DM him her number, so he could send the eWallet. Soon after, she posted a screen grab of an eWallet amount of a R1000 from the star.
