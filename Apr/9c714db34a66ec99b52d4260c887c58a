The Department of BasicÂ  Education has riled up South Africans for using celebrities as teachers. The announcement by the department has given birth to #CelebritiesAreNotTeachers. This comes after a number of local celebrities and social media influencers have been hired as "digital teachers" by the department during the lockdown period. Some of the celebrities who have been billed to teacher are choreographer and TV personality Somizi Mhlongo, gospel singer Khaya Mthethwa, TV and radio presenter Penny Lebyane and DJ Sbu just to mention a few. Tweeps, including qualified teachers, took to social media to air their dissatisfaction with the idea of using stars as teachers, saying they are not qualified. A tweep who calls himself Tzozo Mokoena wrote: Doing my Final year in education and this is the most painful thing I've seen in my entire life!!! Like I said I'll frame it put it on the wall try to look for other Avenues... 4 years for this nonsense #CelebritiesAreNotTeachers pic.twitter.com/hR5cgCrG7f
