PETER Chauke is still devastated and now
fears to go out and walk the streets when he needs to get his essentials. This is because the 30-year-old from
Bloodriver outside Polokwane in Limpopo claims he was assaulted by police and
soldiers when they were patrolling the streets to enforce restrictions of the
lockdown. It all happened on Saturday at around 6pm
when he was sleeping with his 5-year-old son at his home. SOLDIERS RULE! He said they came in and knocked on his
door. “After that they hit and broke my window. “They realised my door was not
locked. They gained entry and started assaulting me,” he said. Peter told Daily Sun that while they were
giving him hot klaps, they kept asking him one question over and over. “Where
is he? And they would not answer me when I asked who or what they were talking
about,” he said. He said after they realised he was only
with his son in the room, they left him lying on the floor in pain. “They assaulted me while my son was
watching and crying. He is also traumatised and I have to force him to go out
to play as he no longer wants to,” said Peter. “They must take responsibility and my
window must be replaced. I can’t wait for the lockdown to come to an end so the
soldiers could leave. I can’t wait to live my normal life,” added Peter. IPID national acting spokesman Sontaga
Seisa said the incident happened at an area that does not fall within their
mandate. “The victim is welcome to lodge a complaint
with the police,” he said.
