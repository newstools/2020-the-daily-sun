Why is it that we love oral sex? Is the idea of going down on your partner the kick you need to have great sex, or is the fact that the grass is always greener down south tickle your sexual desires? Well, according to a study done by researchers in Europe, going down on your partner can be good for you. Researchers from Netherlands have linked oral sex to reducing the recurrent incidences of miscarriage in women. The research claims that women who regularly swallow their boyfriend or husband’s sperm may be less likely to suffer miscarriages. Researchers suggested that the end product of oral sex strengthens a pregnant woman’s immune system and may even help a fetus grow healthily. Semen contains hormones and proteins from a man’s body, meaning women may need to build up a tolerance to it. The researchers further highlight that semen found in men has antidepressant properties that allow women to feel good. An article published by Micheal Castleman further attests to these findings: “Compared with women who always or usually used condoms, those who never did (whose vaginas were exposed to semen) showed significantly better mood — fewer depressive symptoms, and fewer bouts of depression.” This is not to promote unprotected sex, but study reveals that those who engage in oral sex are less likely to suffer from stress, depression or any other mental related illnesses. This also evident during an orgasm when your brain releases oxytocin and endorphins, which both essentially act as natural pain killers. So are you going to be going down your partner after this? Whatever you decide, always remember to practice safe sex and remember: "Science is like sex: sometimes something useful comes out, but that is not the reason we are doing it.”
