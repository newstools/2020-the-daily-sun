PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa is widely expected to relax
some of the lockdown regulations this evening when he addresses the nation as
the country’s new cases continues to rise. The country last night hit 3645 cases and recorded seven more
deaths in the last 24 hours to take the toll to 65 cases but Ramaphosa has hinted
at some relaxed regulations when he addressed the nation on Tuesday were as he also
announced the R500 billion stimulus package. He emphasized that lifting the ban completely could
reverse the gains of the lockdown, saying the government will adopt a risk
adjustment approach. Some reports this morning suggest he will take an alert
system that specifies economic sensitivity to the deadly virus. The government, however, said these reports were based on
an outdated document that has been leaked to the media. “On Thursday, I will address the nation on the measures
that will be taken beyond the nation-wide lockdown to re-open the economy. This
crisis will not last forever, and the day will come when these measures are no
longer needed,” Ramaphosa said in his Tuesday address. This has led to speculation that some sections of the
economy will be allowed to open and have workers return to work and others encouraged
to have workers continue to work from home.
