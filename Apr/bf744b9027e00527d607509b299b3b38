THE trend of burning schools seems to be shifting to KwaZulu-Natal. On Wednesday night Bambazi High School in Bergville in KZN was set alight. The burning of this school follows four schools which were also set alight in Soshanguve in Gauteng recently. The KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu was shocked by the incident and has called for an intense investigation surrounding the incident. “We are definitely going to investigate this and as a department we call on anyone who may have information that could assist in the investigation to come forward and present such information to the authorities,” said Mshengu. Mshengu also called on all sectors of the society to work with them in ensuring that schools are safe at all time for the benefit of their children’s future.  According to the school principal who could not give out his name, one classroom was badly destroyed while other classrooms were slightly affected. KZN police spokeswomen Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of arson is being investigated by Bergville cops. “It is alleged that on Wednesday night a classroom with schoolbooks inside caught fire at Emmaus. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated," said Gwala.
