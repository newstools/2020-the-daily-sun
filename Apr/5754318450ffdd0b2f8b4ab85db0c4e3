 THE Armed Forces of Nigeria have arrested eight suspects and seized 447 000kg of parboiled rice allegedly smuggled into the country. It’s alleged the rice was smuggled from neighbouring Cameroon. Other items recovered include outboard engines and pumping machines. The arrests and seizures were made under the ongoing Operations Calm Waters and Swift Response coordinated by the Nigerian Navy. The acting defence spokesman said the suspects and items recovered were handed over to the Department of Marine Police in the southern city of Calabar for further investigations and possible prosecution. – CAJ NEWS Nigeria banned the importation of the staple rice after president Muhammadu Buhari came into power in 2015. The ban is meant to preserve foreign currency and encourage local production in Africa’s biggest, but currently struggling, economy. Buhari’s government aims to transform Nigeria from a net importer to a major exporter of the commodity. The arrest of the suspected rice smugglers is a result of collaboration between maritime and other law enforcement agencies to combat crimes prevalent in Nigeria’s coastline. The collaboration mainly targets piracy.
