As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to skyrocket around Mzansi, efforts are being made to ensure residents are protected. Ward 98 councilor Anele Gabuza in Harare, Khayelitsha handed masks to over 200 people as a measure to fight the spread of the disease. “We have to be pro-active in fighting this virus and it has to be done from all corners and angles. "There are underprivileged people who cannot afford masks, so I had to come up with an initiative to ensure I gave them something. “These are the same people who would spend some time in the queue to buy groceries and get exposed even further,” said Gabuza. Residents said they were happy with what the councilor did for them. They told Sun Team that they are worried about the way the numbers of COVID-19 are increasing in Khayelitsha and they are even scared to go to the shops. “The councilor is trying to protect us from the disease that has been spreading like wildfire in our kasi. We are told that many people are getting it, and it is worrisome,” said Phumeza Jalamba. Khayelitsha Development Forum chairperson Ndithini Tyhido also raised his concern about the increase of COVID-19 in Khayelitsha and called for residents to stick to the rules and regulations of the lockdown set down by the government. Khayelitsha which is the biggest kasi in Cape Town has 67 positive cases and is followed by its neighbouring kasi Mitchells Plain which has 65 cases.
