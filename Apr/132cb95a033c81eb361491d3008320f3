GOSPEL musician and pastor, Reverend Nkomfa Mkabile, must be turning in his grave. Shortly before his death, Mkabile would often complain that heartless fake friends were hitting on his beautiful wife. But it seems even after his death, his wife hasn’t been spared. A year after Mkabile’s death, Unathi Mkabile (31) said life was tough without the Unabantu Bakho hitmaker. Unathi said she’d been getting offers of love while still in mourning. She had decided to stay celibate and vowed to continue doing so. Unathi said no sooner had her husband’s coffin been lowered into the ground that the floodgates opened, with men declaring their undying love for her. “Most of them said they were just checking up on me, only to later reveal their true motives. “I had to block most of them on my WhatsApp,” she said. Unathi also revealed to Daily Sun she couldn’t have kids and was raising Nkomfa’s four children as hers. “My husband and I accepted the fact that our marriage couldn’t produce a child,” she said. Mkabile, who battled with a weight problem, died in a Cape Town hospital from complications resulting from heart disease. Before his death, Mkabile and Unathi were victims of cyber bullying after Unathi wore a dress that was said to be too revealing during last year’s Sona. Despite her period of mourning coming to an end, Unathi has no intention of changing her life and will focus on doing God’s work. She was recently ordained as a pastor and is determined to grow the Bethel Ministries Church, which she co-founded with her late husband. She’s also a resident preacher on Umhlobo Wenene FM’s Lelika Yehova Ihlabathi show.
