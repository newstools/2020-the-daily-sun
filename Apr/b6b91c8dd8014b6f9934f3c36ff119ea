Law enforcement authorities visited Orange Farm in the
south and Evaton in the Vaal, on Thursday. Led by the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner and
Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, the operation (Okae Molao) was to ensure that
kasi people comply with the regulations. Addressing the media during the visit at Orange Farm taxi
rank in extension 1, Mazibuko said they are on the streets to make sure
compliance is taking place. "Orange Farm and Evaton have been picked up as those
places that do not adhere to the regulations of Covid-19. We are here to make
sure that we educate our people and emphasize the importance of helping each
other not to spread the pandemic," she said. "As we are consistently engaging them, we are also
informing them  that starting from tomorrow [May 1]  each one of us
can't leave our places without covering our faces," she added. The MEC urged parents to consistently check the
whereabouts of their children.  "Let's always check where our children are. Let's
make sure we remove our children from the streets and make sure they are in the
yards," She said. Mawela said they are ready for those who will be moving
to other provinces during the activation of stage four. "We have already started with road blocks in the
boarders of province for those who will be going in and out of the province. As
from tomorrow, we are going to make sure that anyone who moves to our province
passes through our road blocks. Meanwhile, later during the operation, the entourage
discovered expired chicken livers, gizzards, necks and margarine at a Butchery
in Eyethu Mall in Orange Farm.
