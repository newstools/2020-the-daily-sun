THE Khayelitsha Magistrates Court has been closed after a person who had been there tested positive for coronavirus. Court manager Velile Yayi said the court was closed on Wednesday and would re-open on Tuesday. “Testing and screening for all staff started on Wednesday and was expected to take a day.” Resident Mongezi Nkwali said it was worrying that many people weren’t taking the virus seriously. “This is a problem. How many people have been in contact with this person? Many people visit the court and many people, from security guards to cleaners, work there,” said Mongezi. Akhona Toni (39) said it was a matter of time before staff members got infected as people around ekasi weren’t taking the virus seriously. Khaya Mbanjwa (37) said he was shocked to hear the court was closed. “I heard they would resume on Tuesday, but is it not too early? Why are they rushing? Staff members have families they go to after work and they could also be infected,” he said. “This virus is very dangerous. Imagine how many people the infected person will meet. How are they going to make sure that all the people who visited the court get tested? We are in trouble.”
