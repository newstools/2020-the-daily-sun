South African hip-hop heads are in for a treat! The legendary Mzansi hip-hop group Skwatta Kamp has released their discography on all streaming platforms. Only two of their albums were available in the past but now all their albums from their 2001 first project Skwatta Cam-Pain to Fair and Skwear are available for their fans' listening pleasure and will keep you company during the 21 days of lockdown. The group has always emphasised that they lived by the phrase: be good to the music and the music will be good to you. Great music uplifts people's spirit, with their catalogue one is guaranteed to have a vibe indoors. Their albums are packed with storytelling, social dialogue that is made to connect with emotions and memories. The collection includes some of their greatest hits and personal favourites for many die-hard Skwatta Kamp music lovers such as Landela, Rau Rau, Umoya, and The Clap Song, just to mention a few.
