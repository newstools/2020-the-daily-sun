Rapper Big Zulu has added his voice to the coronavirus pandemic. The song titled Lockdown is about Covid-19 and its effects. The song is already available on social platforms. "I was actually asked by Brentwood company to write a song about this pandemic. The purpose of the song is to warn the public about the dangers of this disease as well as to give hope to fellow South Africans. I know that many artists have already done some work on Covid-19 but it'll never be enough. We need to educate and remind each other every day until we are in the clear. For that reason I needed to add my voice as well," he said. ALSO READ: FIRST CORONA DEATHS FOR EC AND LIMPOPO He said it only took him half a day to write the song. "The message in this song is very clear, 'wash your hands'." The song was released on Friday last week. He said he worked with maskandi artist, Mfanie 'Ichophasi' Msomi. "The truth is this is the hardest time for the creative industry. I say this because in one way or another we have to participate in the fight against this disease. We have no gigs, no income but we have work to do. We have a responsibility to bring hope to the nation. For example, everyone is sitting at home watching and listening to our work but we don't gain anything from that.  Nevertheless, we shall abide by the rules because it's for a good cause, " he said.
