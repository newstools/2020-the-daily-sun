THEY were scared and thought they were going to die. But they are now going to be reunited with their families and couldn’t hide their excitement. Wearing masks and gloves, the 76 students who were in China were finally released from quarantine at Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday. They even received clearance certificates after they tested negative for the coronavirus. This after they arrived at OR Tambo International Airport on 20 March from China and were immediately quarantined for 14 days. Before landing in Mzansi, the students were quarantined for 51 days in China following the global Covid-19 outbreak that has infected over one million people. Student Tshepang Modisane (25) from Rusternburg, North West, said he thought of his brother (18) when he heard about the outbreak. “There’s only two of us and we are raised by a single parent. I feared I would die in a foreign country and was worried about my brother. I promised to look after him,” he said. Tshepang, who is an architectural engineering student, said he was over the moon when he was selected to go to China. They left in April last year and were placed at various Chinese companies for internships. He said: “My mother was happy. “I’m the first one in my family to travel abroad. I wanted to make them proud. But all that was short lived.” Another student, James Molaba (31), an electrical engineering student from Bethlehem in Free State, said he has been in constant panic since the outbreak. “Upon hearing news of the virus, I knew I didn’t want to die far from home. It was tough, but we’ve made it and are ready to go back home.” Addressing the students before their departure, Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister, Dr Blade Nzimande said coronavirus was not only for whites. He said: “Those who still believe the virus only affects white people are wrong. The virus affects everyone, irrespective of colour.”
