FAMILIES who live in makeshift plastic shelters told Daily Suntheir lives have become worse with the lockdown. About 70 families who live in Plastic View squatter camp in Donkerhoek outside Rustenburg, North West, survive through recycling and piece jobs. Isaac Molope (42) said he moved to Plastic View 15 years ago after he lost his job. “This is all we can afford but now the recycling points are closed. We can’t go anywhere and we don’t have money to buy food.” He said they were waiting to see what would happen, seeing as they have nowhere else to go. Gregory Phetwane said the municipality has supplied them with a water tank and they were waiting for mobile toilets. “It’s sad but we are grateful that due to this virus the government is helping us.” Rustenburg mayor Mpho Khunou visited the area to check on the efforts made by the municipality to provide services to the small community. “The residents will be relocated after the municipality bought land on which a new development will be implemented. It will provide essential service delivery infrastructure such as housing, roads, electricity, water and sanitation,” he said. “The visit was to see if the interventions had reached the community. The community will access clean drinking water from the Jojo tank.” He said they expected the relocation to happen soon, as they have found that the area earmarked for relocation was suitable for human settlement.
