The core that rocks the cradle is ruling the world. In other words, women are taking over the world. They are becoming unapologetic about who and what they want. They are gradually narrowing the gap with their male counterparts financially and physically but are they also narrowing the gap sexually? According to sex experts and recent studies, men's sex drive remains higher than their women counterparts. This is attributed to men being straightforward about sex, where else women are more complex in terms of pinning their exact libidos. Women are said to place more value on emotional connection as a spark of sexual desire. Research further states that women also appear to be heavily influenced by social and cultural factors as well. Stephen Snyder M.D, a popular sex and relationship therapist from New York, has a slightly different take on women and their sexual desires. "Women's sexual behaviour is changing. No doubt about that. Many young women today in the developed West seem to favour hook-ups over dates. They watch online porn in greater numbers than ever before.Â Women have become more active voyeurs in other ways as well." Stephen is highlighting a new era and trend when it comes to women and sexuality. Referring to it as "sexual empowerment", Stephen highlights how women are becoming more liberal when it comes to their sexuality, and the line between them and their male counterparts is narrowing by the day. So what do we take from this? Sex is becoming a level playing field where both parties need to adequately have fun. Now it doesn't matter who gets turned on first because at the end of the day, one lit candle has the ability to share and switch on the other candle, and that is how we should view sex as men and women.
