Speaking about his newly-found fortune,  the superstar said he is not a "numbers guy". "To ask me to somehow translate this to numbers is to ask your grandmother what exactly the recipe of the cake was,"the 42-year-old said. Kanye has been sending receipts of his Yeezy sales to the magazine, so he could be counted on the billionaires list, but according to the magazine, he hadn't made the cut until now. Forbes says the rapper is now worth $1,3 billion (about R24,5 billion). Instead, Kanye has reportedly disputed Forbes’ confirmation that he is now worth $1 billion, instead insisting that his net worth is actually $3.3 billion (about R46 billion)  Source: Forbes Magazine.
