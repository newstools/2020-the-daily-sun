SOME suppliers seem to be taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis to make big bucks. This is despite hygiene products, such as face masks and surgical gloves, being identified as essential goods. In these tough times, where some households are struggling to put food on the table, many have reported the inflation of prices by retailers and suppliers. Angry consumers have taken to social media to post photos of products with highly inflated prices. One picture shows a tray of 30 extra large eggs at a ridiculous price of R76,99.  On Wednesday, the Competition Commission said about half of the 500 complaints they had received were against retailers. Spokesman Sipho Ngwema said: “We’ve had hundreds of complaints from consumers about prices of certain essential goods and other basic food items that have suddenly skyrocketed.” He said the majority of the complaints were about hand sanitisers and face masks, followed by toilet paper and flu medication. The first case before The Competition Tribunal is against Babelegi Workwear, a firm that is believed to have hiked the price of face masks by 500% during the coronavirus epidemic. The case will be heard on 24 April. Ngema said they found that between 31 January and 5 March, Babelegi increased its prices of facial masks from R41 to R500 per box. He said more complaints had been concluded and were to be referred to the tribunal. These cases include a hardware store that allegedly increased the price of surgical gloves from R99,99 to R170, a pharmacy that did a 300% markup on face masks and hand sanitisers, and a wholesaler that increased their markup for chicken pieces by up to 50%. Other cases include excessive pricing on vegetables, meat, bread and eggs. The commission’s Tembinkosi Bonakele said:the commission has gone past the stage of appeals to patriotism to stop the exploitation of consumers.  “The law must take its course. “We will see a wave of prosecution of firms in the next coming days.”
