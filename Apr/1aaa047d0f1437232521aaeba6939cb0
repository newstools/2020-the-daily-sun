A Cape Town
man who was said to have been killed by police brutality while buying beer
during the lockdown, actually died from a heart attack, Police Minister Bheki
Cele said. He said a
post-mortem report revealed that the man did not die from being beaten. The
minister was speaking at a briefing on Thursday night. News24
previously reported on allegations that the man had been tasered and beaten to
death by police. Cele,
meanwhile, said police have arrested 2 289 people since the start of the
lockdown for violating regulations. "Don't
give us a reason to arrest you." He warned
that there are 24 389 law enforcement officers on the streets. Cele
clarified that no cigarettes can be sold, and knocked down the Western Cape
government saying on Thursday that vendors would be allowed to sell cigarettes. "For
now, cigarettes will not be sold... that includes Western Cape," Cele
said. SOURCE:
