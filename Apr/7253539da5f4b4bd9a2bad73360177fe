RAPPER The Real Q is demanding his money back. He claims Charlie Communications owner Ngcebo Mdima took R35 000 from him to have his single, Catch a Fire, playlisted on radio stations and put on high rotation. “I met Ngcebo and told him I needed assistance to get my song on radio stations. I don’t have money as I’m still building my career,” said The Real Q.

I borrowed the money. I sent it in good faith hoping to make it back when the song got on high rotation and I started getting booked for gigs,” he said. The Real Q said when he asked Ngcebo when the song would start playing, he only got emails with no answers. “I asked another artist how he operates and he told me Ngcebo was good at what he did, which was why I trusted him. “I was so hurt when he later said my song didn’t make it to the radio because it was weak,” he said. “If that was the case, I want him to pay me because then he took my money knowing my song wouldn’t make it to the radio. He also promised PR, which never happened.” When the SunTeam approached Ngcebo, he said PR people took songs for sampling and based on that, a radio committee decided whether they met a certain criteria. “The Real Q paid for a service and we delivered. “We can’t promise high rotation, we only sampled the song for him. The response was that the song was weak, which he didn’t want to understand,” he said.
