FORMER Orlando Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic has described the Covid-19 pandemic as “God’s yellow card to humanity”. But he also believes that football will be the right tool to heal the people from torture, post the outbreak that has wrecked havoc across the globe. The Zambia coach finds himself having to cope with the pandemic which has also brought football to a standstill in Lusaka. As it is, Micho doesn’t know when he will take charge of his first match since taking over the reins as Chipolopolo head coach. But like many, he believes African football will bounce back stronger as soon as the world gets past the deadly coronavirus. “I believe the African football will come back stronger after the enforced break, both nationally and at club level,” said Micho. “The Covid-19 is like an invincible yellow card that we got from God and Mother Nature. “As humanity, we need to find ways out of this situation, to reflect deeply and be much better than we have ever been “I strongly believe that all of us being in isolation and in quarantine, we have enough time to think about everything and bounce back stronger and hungry for football.” Micho had been preparing for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Botswana when the virus put breaks on the international schedule. There were also the African Nations Championship (Chan) finals to play this month. “The postponements have been a huge setback for all of us in football. But we do understand that human lives are more important than football,” Micho added. “Yes, our plans have been affected but we need to look forward to beating this virus. It’s a battle we have to fight and win together.”
