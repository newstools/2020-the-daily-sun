IN SOUTH
AFRICA the SRT-8 badge is carried by the Chrysler 300C and Jeep Grand Cherokee
SRT-8. The SRT
began with the Team Viper group that developed and built the performance coupe
Dodge Viper. But as time
went on the SRT which stands for Street Racing Technology transformed into its
own brand under Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). The 8 on
the SRT-8 badge means that the car utilises a monster of a Hemi V8 engine. The SRT
division has four V8s, which were used in five cars namely the Chrysler 300,
Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger, Dodge Magnum and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Their first
V8 was a 6.1-liter naturally aspirated Hemi V8 engine that produced 317 KW but,
the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT-8 only had 313 KW. The second
unit is a 6.4-liter naturally aspirated Apache V8 engine that originally
produced 350 KW but was upgraded to produce 362 kW. SRT's most
powerful variant is the 6.2-liter supercharged V8 with two separate units used
on the Hellcat and Demon models. The
Hellcat's version makes 527 kW and the Demon's makes 603 kW.
