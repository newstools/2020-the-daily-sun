In 2019 we saw a rise in the granny panties trend, from Kim Kardashian's knickers to Rihanna's Fenty underwear brand, granny panties' classical look sure does appeal to a younger market now. Italian fashion house Gucci is flogging a cotton bra and panties set for a whopping R15 200.  Gucci's website reveals: "Crafted from embroidered GG tulle in ivory and completed with a light pink elastic Gucci stripe, this bra and briefs set completes several looks from the Spring Summer 2020 fashion show."  "Diaphanous ready-to-wear pieces with lingerie inspired details embody what the Creative Director described as a 'beautiful cliché of sexiness', a concept explored throughout this collection with hints to the idea of freedom that fashion experienced in the '90s."
