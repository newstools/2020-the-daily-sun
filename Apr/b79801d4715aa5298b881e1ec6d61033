Three soldiers and a cop were hospitalized on Saturday
after a police van they were travelling in overturned on Orinocco Road near
Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. It is reported the vehicle lost control when a cop
stationed at Acornhoek Cop Shop was shasing after a suspicious car that drove
past them. According to shocked bystanders, they spotted a speeding
sedan being chased by a police van and in split seconds they heard a loud bang. "We saw the sedan speeding past us like a bullet and
we realized they were being chased by the cops. ‘Suddenly we heard a loud bang along the road and we saw
the police van lying upside down with wheels still running. Three soldiers and
a cop were seriously injured,” said the witnesses. They further said the suspicious vehicle managed to
vanish into thin air after the accident. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed the
incident. He said a Constable was driving a police vehicle when the
accident happened. “Two vans were pursuing a suspicious vehicle, after they
received a tip off about it. The police then requested neighbouring stations to
assist. One of the police vans lost control on the gravel area and the state
vehicle overturned. The Constable and the two soldiers sustained serious
injuries and were transported to the hospital while the other soldier had no
visible injuries," said Naidoo.
