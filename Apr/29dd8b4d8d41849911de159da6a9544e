CO-OPERATIVE Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has officially extended the lockdown with a few relaxed regulations that will see parents visiting their children and attending funerals made easier. The first lockdown comes to end midnight and as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa will automatically be extended to the end of April but according to amended regulations, there will be some movement starting from tomorrow. Hardware stores will be allowed to open for people to buy essential goods, so too will be stores that sell car parts. Dlamini-Zuma said these stores will have to register all the people who will be buying to confirm the goods they were buying were essential. She said in the past people wanting to attend funerals had to produce an original death certificate to a magistrate, but now such a person can produce a certified copy of a digital copy to a head of court or a station commissioner. These can also be produced to those delegated by them in case they are not available. “Provided that where a death certificate is not yet available and the burial or cremation must take place within a period of 24 hours of death in accordance with cultural or religious practices, the person requesting the permit must make a sworn affidavit, supported by a letter from a cultural or religious leader supporting the cultural or religious practice in relation to the burial or cremation,” she said. With regards to visitation to children by co-parents, Dlamini-Zuma said that parents would need to produce a court order or family advocate papers or birth certificate to show the connection between the child that is being moved or fetched. And in terms of alcohol, she said no alcohol will be moved whatsoever except that which is used to make sanitizers. “Liquor that we drink is not allowed to be transported in the same way that it is not allowed to be sold,” she said.
