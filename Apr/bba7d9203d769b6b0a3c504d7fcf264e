Actor and producer Tyler Perry has proved once more that he has a heart of gold. The Madea creator recently visited his favourite restaurant Houston's in Atlanta on Sunday where he left a tip worth R9 000 for each of the 42 out-of-work servers, which in all amounted to R397 061,7. This tip by the talented producer is a lifesaver for these out-of-work employees who have to wait to for almost 20 weeks for a stimulus check from the federal government. With this kind gesture, Tyler can be considered one of the most charitable person in the entertainment industry. When there's a disaster anywhere in the world, Tyler's the one to fly in supplies, previously TMZ reported that Tyler had a plane flown down to the Bahamas after it was devastated by Hurricane Dorian. It’s my hope that we add to this simple song in every language from every nation as we let it become a prayer for our whole world! God bless you today. And remember it’s all in God’s hands! @chrystalrucker @karenclarksheard @kierrasheard @dorindaclarkcole @yolandaadams @realjohnnygill22 @davidandtamela @tasiasword @iamjhud @travisgreenetv @jencarlosmusic @only1crystalfox @rodney.east #HesGotTheWholeWorldChallenge A post shared by  Tyler Perry (@tylerperry) on Mar 22, 2020 at 6:16am PDT
