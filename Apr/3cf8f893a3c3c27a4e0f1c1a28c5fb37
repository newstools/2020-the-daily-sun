UNITY is the key behind Maritzburg United’s success so far this season, says the club’s inspirational captain Richard Ofori. Ofori, who is also Ghana’s number one goalkeeper, has played a big role in guiding the Team of Choice to fifth place on the Absa Premiership table before the season was suspended last month due to coronavirus. United have collected 39 points from 24 matches. The club also reached the Telkom Knockout final but they lost that encounter to Mamelodi Sundowns in Durban in December. It’s a whole new ball game this season for United who only managed to rescue their Premiership status via the promotion/relegation play-offs at the end of last season. Ofori said they reviewed their last term’s heartaches and agreed they cannot go down that road again. “We suffered a lot last season. But this season, it has been togetherness, team work and hard work. This has massively helped the team. Although we didn’t start well, when the coach (Eric Tinkler) spoke to us, we listened and we tried to do everything possible to win games,” said Ofori, who recently exercised his one year contract option with the club. Maritzburg didn’t win any of their first five league matches this season, but that didn’t dent the team’s spirit. They are now one point short of equalling the club’s 40 points haul they achieved in the 2014-15 season under Steve Komphela.With six matches to go, that tally looks likely to be surpassed. And they are also edging closer to their highest tally of 44 points attained in the 2017-18 season under Fadlu Davids. With the PSL suspended and no indication when football might resume, Ofori has urged the public to continue adhering to the government’s protocols during the lockdown.
