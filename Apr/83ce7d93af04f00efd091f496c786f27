A singer who recently made a 4-5 pie said
she did so because she misses 'action' during lockdown. Mirror.co.uk reports that Jade Thirlwall, a member of the Little Mix, a British pop, R&B, and dance-pop girl group, admitted she's 'missing the 4-5' as she's holed
up alone at home. Speaking to Scott Mills and Chris Stark on BBC Radio 1
about life on lockdown, the 27-year-old said: "I love cooking a pie. It's
because it's dead easy, I just buy the ready to roll." When complimented by Scott on her recent 'penis pie',
Jade said: â€œThanks guys, really appreciate that. I'm here alone in the flat
with two friends and we all decided to put what we were missing on the
pie." It comes as Jade admitted that exercise is not on the
cards for her during lockdown. Speaking to The Face Magazine, Jade revealed that she
hasn't become a fitness fanatic while staying at home.  She said: "Every night before I go to bed I'm like,
'Right, tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and do some exercise'." She added: "But I don't know who I'm kidding, to be
honest, because I can't be arsed." Jade went on to discuss how she is coping without the
fellow Little Mix girls as they all carry on with life in their separate homes. Describing how the novelty has worn off, Jade said that
she has been missing her job and fellow bandmates. "I see them more than my family, you know what I
mean?" she noted. "So, yeah, it's a bit strange." Jade admitted that the Little Mix girls are keeping
themselves sane during the UK lockdown by staying in constant contact with each
other. They say they're getting through the days by constantly
chatting to each other in their WhatsApp group and on FaceTime.
