Joburg MMC for Environment, Infrastructure and Services Mpho Moerane, along with ADreach and the Supplier Development Initiative (SDI) on Thursday donated about 300 food parcels to waste pickers at Innesfree park in Sandton. Moerane told News24 that the City of Johannesburg was taking on the responsibility of ensuring that waste pickers have food. The decision comes after an application by Lawyers for Human Rights to have waste pickers declared an essential service was turned down by the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Tuesday. "The waste pickers have not been declared an essential service. Most of them depend on the money they bring in when collecting waste from our households," Moerane said. "So, SDI Force and the department and other companies like ADreach came and said: 'We have food parcels, we want to deliver to them... so that during the lockdown process they don't go hungry'," he added. One waste picker Ofentse Ndaba, who received a food parcel on Thursday, told News24 in isiZulu that the donation will go a long way and ease the stress of having to provide food in the immediate future. "Now that the country is in lockdown, I really appreciate these people helping us. They helped us a lot to have the essential food we need to last a few days," Ndaba said. "Also they helped me to understand what this coronavirus is and how we can try to keep ourselves safe from catching it." Moerane said the food donation would happen again if the lockdown was extended. "It will continue, it's not once off. We will come back if the lockdown continues. We will go to [the waste pickers] as and when because they are not supposed to be travelling," said Moerane.  https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/watch-some-300-food-parcels-donated-to-joburg-waste-pickers-20200410
