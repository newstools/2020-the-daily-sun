It's day 14 into the national lockdown and commuters are getting more frustrated waiting for taxis to start operating. The Rustenburg taxi rank which is the biggest in the North West Province was filled by commuters who came to buy groceries. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said that public transport should only operate from 5am to 10am and return commuters from 4pm to 8pm. Panyaza Magomoagae (40), from Kroondal, said he came to do his groceries early in the morning around 9am and had to wait until 4pm to get a taxi to return home. "I did my shopping as fast as possible bearing in mind that I have to stay home. However, I had to wait six hours to return home because of a lack of transport." Speaking to Daily Sun Panyaza said there is no social distancing practiced in the taxi rank. â€œWe only see it in the shops. For the six hours, I spend at the taxi rank I might get infected. "The government needs to rethink the regulations of the lockdown especially when it comes to public transport," he said. "It's not that we are complaining, we understand the dangers of this virus, but our health is also put at risk. They have allowed us to do shopping, why then take away transport. "We ask the minister to allow taxis to operate during the day to avoid the large number of people standing for long hours in taxis ranks."
