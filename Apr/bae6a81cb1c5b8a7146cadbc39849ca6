STRUGGLING Black Leopards players don’t care about Lidoda Duvha being relegated or not, all they care about is getting their salary at the end of the month. This is the opinion of former Leopards striker, Coxwell “Magic” Ratshivhadelo. Leopards are at the bottom of the Absa Premiership with 20 points from six matches remaining to end the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. “You can hire the best coach in the world but if the players don’t have fighting spirit, it’s a waste of money and resources,” said Ratshivhadelo, who is retired and now works for the Department of Correctional Services. “Truly speaking, Leopards players don’t care whether the team will be relegated or not. What is important to them (players) is to get their fat cheques at the end of the month. There is no hunger from Leopards players to want to win games.” This season, Leopards chairman David Thidiela has hired five coaches with the hope of getting his club playing better football and fighting for trophies. But that has not worked out for the club. Thidiela first hired Frenchman Lionel Soccoia before this season started. Then Soccoia was sacked and replaced by interim coach Morgan Shivambu. Thidiela wasted no time and brought in former Free State Stars coach Luc Eymael to be in charge of the team on a permanent basis. But Eymael soon resigned and was replaced by Cavin Johnson. However, the former AmaZulu coach did not last long and was replaced by his friend Alan Clark, whom he brought to Leopards as his assistant coach. And Ratshivhadelo believes Clark is a good coach but he needs the commitment from his players if Leopards are to move away from the danger zone and fight for their PSL status.
