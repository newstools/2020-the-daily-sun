THE house stands out in the kasi and can be seen from a distance. It’s near the famous London Road in Alexandra, east of Joburg. And its strange design has captured the attention of many people. It’s a double-storey house with external stairs and is designed for separate families. There are two rooms downstairs and one upstairs with an outside toilet. Thomas Maluleke (31), who lives in the house, said the house belonged to his brother and was designed by a builder. It was built over a year ago and is home to six family members. Thomas said he and his siblings grew up in a shack and their father was later able to build them a two-roomed house. He said the space began getting smaller and smaller as they grew older. After the death of their dad in 2006, they extended their home. But he said money was an obstacle and his brother was able to start extending the house only in 2018. Thomas said: “Alexandra has very small yards and it was a challenge to extend the house. It was then decided to rather have an upstairs,” he said. The house took four months to be build and is still to be completed. “We’re happy because we have enough space. We love the design and it’ll look more beautiful when it’s completed.” City of Joburg’s Nthatisi Modingoane said people needed to get approval from the city before extending their homes. “A building plan needs to be submitted to the city for approval. Buildings must be practical and have basic needs such as access to water and electricity to avoid structures getting demolished. “Where people are building upstairs, they also need consent from neighbours for issues relating to privacy,” he said.
