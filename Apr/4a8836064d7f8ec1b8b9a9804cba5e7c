AMAZULU FC’s Siphelele Magubane has found a relaxing way of beating the lockdown blues and boredom. . . herding cattle. The winger is following in the footsteps of another KZN-based star, former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana defender Siyabonga Sangweni. Siyabonga also herds cattle in his village in KZN in his spare time. With South Africa under lockdown, soccer players – like the rest of the public – have to stay home and get used to being bored. Siphelele figured a unique way to keep busy. The Usuthu winger went to Emacambini, northern KZN, to help his family. WATCH: SPEEDING TAXI FORCES ARMY TRUCK TO CRASH! He said soccer players don’t have enough time to be with their families, and this was an ideal opportunity to go home and herd cattle. Most football leagues worldwide have been suspended due to Covid-19. No date has been stated as to when football leagues will restart. “As a country we’re living in difficult times. This motivated me to be with my family because your family won’t turn their backs on you,” said Magubane. “I decided to go home and be closer to them so that that if anything happens I’m near them. “I then decided to take the cattle that belong to my uncle and herd them. It’s my wish one day to own cattle. This is a good investment.” ZUNGU MUST STAY IN HIS LANE! The suspension of the Absa Premiership came at the wrong time for Siphelele and relegation-haunted AmaZulu. They beat leaders Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 on 7 March at FNB Stadium to register their second league win in 2020 in what was the first game for interim coach Ayanda Dlamini. Siphelele had hoped that beating a team that is on top would have created momentum heading into their remaining matches. He said: “However, the current situation has completely disturbed the mood of the team.”
