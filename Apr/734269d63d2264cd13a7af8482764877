Former Marseille president Pape Diouf has died aged 68 after contracting coronavirus, a family source told AFP on Tuesday. Diouf, who was born in Chad but had French and Senegalese citizenship, led the club between 2005-2009 and helped build the side that lifted the Ligue 1 title in 2010. He was set to leave Dakar for Nice earlier on Tuesday to be treated for COVID-19 in France but the plane never left Senegal. Diouf was also a journalist and a football agent before taking over at the Stade Velodrome.
