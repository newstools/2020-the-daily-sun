If your partner knows there are 66 books in the bible, of which 39 are found in the old testament and 27 are found in the new testament, does it mean they won't cheat on you? Does the fact that you both are regular churchgoers mean you won't be tempted to stick your hands in the cookie jar? Well allow me to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me God. According to recent infidelity stats published in Perspective Counselling magazine, 57% of men overall admit to cheating at some point in their lives, while 54% of women admit to committing infidelity in one or more of their relationships. About 22% of married men admit to having an affair at least once during their marriages, while 14% of married women admit to having an affair at least once during their marriages. What is interesting from the above stats is the infidelity committed by married couples. Now according the bible, marriage is a sacred union created by God. Furthermore when married couples share their wedding vows they are witnessed by God, to whom they promise to remain faithful to one another. If these are the same God-fearing couples, then the answer to the articles question is sadly yes. The moral of the story is that no one is perfect and mistakes are done by everyone, including those who are God-fearing. It is important to highlight that we are all work-in-progress projects. Should you as couple believe in God, you ought to remind yourselves that you are both striving for perfection because no one is perfect.
