IT LOOKS like teachers will not only have to worry about catching up on school work, but also on a shortage of equipment. This is because thugs are taking advantage of schools during the lockdown. On Sunday, thugs broke into eThekwini Primary School in B Section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, and allegedly stole several computers. READ: TWEEPS PAY TRIBUTE TO BENNI MCCARTHY! They apparently broke into the administration block. Thandeka Mkhize (33), who lives close to the school, told Daily Sun she was disappointed to hear about the break-in. “I think thugs are taking advantage since there are a few security guards on the school premises,” she said.  Another resident, Nokwanda Mkhize (33), said she was also disappointed as the school was renovated earlier this year. The break-in follows another one at Rippon Primary School at Sydenham, where doors were stolen last week. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said he wasn’t aware of the KwaMashu break-in, but was aware of the Rippon Primary School incident.  “It’s very disappointing that all provinces are reporting that schools have become targets. Some schools have been burnt.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said KwaMashu cops are probing a case of business burglary after eThekwini Primary was robbed. “Three laptops, LCD screens, desktop, laminating machine and e-readers were taken by unknown suspects. Entry was gained through the office door which was broken,” he said.
