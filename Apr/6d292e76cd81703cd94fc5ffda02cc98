WHILE ordinary residents are trying their best to adhere to the Lockdown regulations, some leaders in Limpopo appear not to be leading by example. In a video making rounds on social media, a leader in the Makhado Municipality, Tebogo Mamorobela, who is also a board member of Brand SA, convener of young women’s desk in the province, and PR EXCO member in that municipality can be seen enjoying alcohol at a certain house with two gentlemen. She is seen joyfully dancing to loud music, holding a bottle of wine in her hand near a table filled with bottles of champagne. It is believed that Mamorobela was celebrating her 39th birthday with her friends at one of the friend's house in Makhado, Limpopo. She can be heard, loudly calling the Minister of Police Bheki Cele saying "Uthini Cele”. Donald Selamolela, spokesman, for the ANC in Limpopo said they are aware of the video that has raised concerns and they are giving their full attention to the matter. "Investigations have been launched in this matter to get all facts correct. We will also be getting a full report from the ANC Vhembe Region before and disciplinary measures will be taken against her if she is found to have breached the Lockdown regulations. The matter has also been referred to the police for investigations." Selamolela further pleaded political leaders to lead by example during this difficult time where the Country is at a fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
