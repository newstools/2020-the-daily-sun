EDUCATION spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were very disappointed following burglaries that took place at many schools during the lockdown period. At least 72 Mpumalanga schools were broken into since the beginning of the lockdown. “Judging from the number of incidents, it seems criminals are roaming around, destroying much-needed community development facilities. A total of 72 schools were broken into throughout the province,” he said. He said seven schools were broken into in Bohlabela district, nine in Ehlanzeni, 28 in Nkangala and another 28 in Gert Sibande district. He said cases of burglaries were opened with the police and investigations were continuing. Zwane said the department urged anyone who might have any information about these criminal acts or perpetrators to contact the nearest police station. Education MEC Bonakele Majuba condemned the burglaries. “We call on the people to expose the criminals behind these selfish deeds. The destruction and breaking into public property is a crime against the community and deserves to be condemned in the strongest terms. “Schools must not be targets for criminal activity because they exist to empower our children and communities. They must be protected,” said Majuba. Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said they didn’t know when exactly the burglaries happened, but some of the schools were clearly broken into during the time of lockdown. “Investigation will reveal exactly when the break-ins happened,” he said.
