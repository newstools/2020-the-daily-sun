About three months according to time, 90 days or 129 600 minutes. Does this time still apply to when you can sleep with a new or potential partner? Does this phenomenon still exist? According to the Singles in America study, millennials are 48% more likely to sleep with someone right away to see if there is a connection. Having sex on the first date can tell you a lot about your sexual connection and chemistry. So in other words, if you meet someone whom you click with, sex can be on the agenda. The world of the millennials is a fast paced inter-connected world. The advancement of technology and rise of social media have changed the way they communicate and see the world. In the olden days, sex was a sacred thing. It was something you intimately shared with someone whom you've built trust with over time. Today, sex is really a casual fun activity that gauges how we connect sexually. Our raging hormones make it easier to share our bodies with those whom we feel comfortable with despite the time-frames. The quote "time is of the essence" simply proves that the then 90-day-rule no longer applies in the modern error. In 2012, a movie based on Steve Harvey's book Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man was released called Think Like A Man. The movie centers around women who lived their lives according to what was written in the book. This later in the movie depicts that human beings are emotionally driven beings, and time is not a factor. You can meet someone whom you immediately share a bond with and decide to sleep with him/her on your first date. This does not make you cheap, but it further highlights the change in human interaction. At times you can meet someone whom you apply the 90-day-rule on, and you eventually break-up or sexually lose each other. So if you are one of those who gives it away on the first date, you are not cheap. You are part of error that vibes and believes in connections.
