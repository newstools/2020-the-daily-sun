Soldiers must stop abusing citizens. Videos of citizens doing push-ups and squats have amused many on social media platforms. However, history has shown us that it starts with push-ups and ends horribly. This is unlawful and not the time to abuse people. There have been other numerous reports of brutality at the hands of the soldiers deployed across South Africa. Abuse is a violation of human rights and if people flout the national lockdown, the officers are supposed to do whatâ€™s right. This abusive behaviour must not be tolerated.
