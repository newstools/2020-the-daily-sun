RESIDENTS of Gugulethu were left shocked after a United National Baptist Church pastor was bust for allegedly having stolen property. Sakhumzi Tokwe, a resident of the Cape Town kasi, said: “We still can’t believe the news as he was a good pastor who changed people’s lives. We never saw this coming.” He said alcohol found in the pastor’s house was believed to have come from a hijacked truck. “We don’t know if he was there or waited for his accomplices to deliver alcohol to his house,” he said. A church member said the news had left her feeling hopeless. “Every time he preached to us, he said he used to do bad things but God found him and he changed his ways,” she said. “He was arrested over the Easter weekend, a time when he was supposed to be praying for the coronavirus and all the bad things that are happening. Another church member said when they asked the wife where their pastor was, she didn’t have proper answers for them. The SunTeam sent messages to the pastor’s wife and she promised to answer questions, but never did. Nandipha Nqavashe said the arrest was God’s way of exposing fake pastors. “God works in mysterious ways. He knew what the pastor was doing and He decided to make everyone see him during Easter,” she said. Nandipha said she hoped the arrest would make other pastors involved in bad things to stop. “These people need to stop using God’s name while doing their dirty work as He will turn them into a laughing stock.” Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the 43-year-old suspect appeared in the Philippi Magistrates Court yesterday and would be back in July.
