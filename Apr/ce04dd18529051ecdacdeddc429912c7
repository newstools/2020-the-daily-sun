MANY Isidingo actors are out of work at the moment but this isn’t the case for Simphiwe Ngema. The 31-year-old has landed a role in SABC 2’s drama series Bone of My Bones. Simphiwe, who played the role of Phindi on the cancelled SABC 3 soapie, said she was not taking this blessing for granted. “Getting another role so quickly is not something I’m taking lightly because there are currently a lot of people without jobs in the industry. It’s also a huge blessing that I’ve always had jobs since I started acting,” she said. The talented actress said she would be playing the role of Ruth, a fiery wife who stands her ground, in the 13-part series. “Ruth is a very sweet girl. She is a typical makoti, but she is very feisty. She is not a pushover. The storyline takes her to different places and you will get to see her vulnerable side,” she said. Simphiwe said the character was totally different from the other roles she’d played before. “Ruth is a music producer. She enjoys life and dressing up, while Phindi was a tomboy geologist who was underground with the miners,” she said. Simphiwe said working on the new series was an amazing experience as she acted with people she looked up to. “I got the chance to work with incredible actors, people who have been in the industry for a long time and people I grew up looking up to such as Warren Masemola,” she said. Season two of Bone of My Bones starts on Thursday at 9.30pm.
