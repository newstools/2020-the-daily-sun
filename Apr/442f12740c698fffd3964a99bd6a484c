The call by President Cyril Ramaphosa for Mzansi people to help the needy people with food during this difficult period of the national lockdown did not fall on deaf ears. The Somali and Ethiopian spaza shop owners came together and donated 1 500 food parcels on Wednesday to various kasis in Nelson Mandela Bay. The residents of Wells Estate, Soweto-on-Sea, Walmer, Korsten, Schauderville, KwaDwesi Extension, Joe Slovo, and Booysen Park benefited from the food parcels. Provincial chairman of Somali Community Service and Consultant Refugee Centre, Mohamed told Daily Sun: "Hunger knows no race, religion or nationality. The president made a call that we all should help one another during this difficult time of the lockdown. "We do business in these communities, we know and see the living conditions of these people. They sometimes come to us and buy food on credit. But since the national lockdown has started, they have been battling to provide for their families. "The Somali spaza shop owners and the Ethiopians came together and bought these food parcels in responding to the president's call. "For the past two weeks, we have been disturbing the food parcels from Monday to Friday," he said. Daniel Makeleni, a community leader in Booysen Park, said: "They are really helping our communities. I hope our communities can learn to live in peace and harmony with the foreign spaza shop owners because they are helpful in our communities in difficult moments like these. "Our people are hungry and Sassa food parcels are not enough."
