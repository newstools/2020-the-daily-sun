THE South African Music Performance Rights Association has decided to bring forward the distribution of fees that was scheduled for August to this month because of the coronavirus. CEO Pfanani Lishivha said with the current pandemic, it was hard for artists to make a living. “After the cancellation of gigs, we have reconsidered,” he said. Pfanani said the Easter holidays were a good time for artists to make money. “They have lost a lot of money and as music goes digital, artists make money out of live performances. During this month we will be distributing to our 21 000 clients and hoping the money will sustain them until they perform again,” said Pfanani. Artists told Daily Sun they thought it was a good gesture by the association and they hoped others would do the same.  Singer and DJ Wanda Baloyi said artists get royalties, airplay, publishing, compilations. “But it’s not very much.  This alleviates the situation for now, but what’s next?” She said there were organisations that collected money but dictated when artists could get the funds.  She said this payment depended on how active an artists was in the music industry. “In times like this, we have to think local. It’s time to bring back everything local.” Metro FM’s DJ Naves said they hadn’t been earning much since the lockdown. “The impact is big. At least artists who are registered to Sampra will benefit from whatever amount they will get.” Rapper Emtee said it was a good thing that the association was distributing the funds. “Everyone is trying to come up with ways to survive because gigs and production meetings have been cancelled,” he said. “On the bright side it gives everyone time to be creative and make good music.”
