International award-winning record producer and DJ Black Coffee has finally released his long-awaited single with chart-topping singer-songwriter Sabrina Claudio. SBCNCSLY has been described as a delicate dance track drenched in warm piano chords, rolling drumlines, and Sabrina Claudio’s ethereal vocals, and it was released today after it was recorded a few months ago. Sabrina Claudio is the half-Cuban, half-Puerto Rican songstress that took the world by storm with her 2019 album Truth Is. The 11-track masterpiece marks the culmination of a three-year journey from DIY bedroom pop singer-songwriter to prolific international headliner. ALSO READ: ZODWA'S HOUSE ROBBED!

SBCNCSLY is the relaxed-yet-poignant dance track that’s much-needed during these trying times.
