The National Video and Film Foundation has announced that their 14th annual awards, SAFTAs, will take place on Twitter instead of a lavish venue as per usual. This is due to the coronavirus restrictions that have been implemented in the country. Many production houses have had to stop shooting their respective shows and social events have also been cancelled. Radio and TV personality Dineo Ranaka was announced as the host for this first ever SAFTAs on Twitter on Wednesday at 5pm.
