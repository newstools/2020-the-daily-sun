SQUATTER camps in the Vaal have been supplied with water tanks to help stop the rapid spread of Covid-19. Emfuleni Municipality, together with Rand Water and the Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation sent tankers to areas affected by water shortages in the municipality. Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu gave orders to prepare a fleet of tankers to help vulnerable communities across Gauteng and the country. Theresa Lesesa from Azania City kasi told Daily Sun she was grateful for the delivery of a water tank in her community. “Water and sanitation department helped us a lot by supplying tanks during coronavirus pandemic. We won’t be getting water from neighbouring kasis,” she said. Nhlanhla Makhubo from Tshepiso said they used one communal tap in the area. “At least we can now share tanks to help the overcrowded tap. We can get water quickly as the water tanks are fast. We can now practise washing hands and keep safe from the coronavirus,” he said. Emfuleni mayor, reverend Gift Moerane, said it was vital that people kept safe from the virus. “We appreciate the intervention by water and sanitation in providing tanks for our squatter camps. “We encourage people to wash their hands frequently. “People can now get water and help flatten the curve,” he said.
