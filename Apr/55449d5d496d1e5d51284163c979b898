IN these times of high unemployment, people are doing all they can to put food on the table for their families. This includes going against some of the lockdown regulations. This was the case when a group of people went fishing in a crocodile-infested river on Monday. One person was allegedly dragged into the river by a crocodile and died. The body of Nephawe Rabelani (31), who was attacked by a crocodile, was recovered on Wednesday – two days after the attack. Rabelani was from Tswinga Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. The crocodile allegedly dragged him into the Levubu River and disappeared while he was fishing with a group of people at about 6pm. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said an inquest case had since been opened. “It’s alleged that the deceased was fishing with a group of people when he was seen being dragged into the water by this reptile,” said Mojapelo. He told Daily Sun the search and rescue unit were then notified, and they immediately started searching on arrival at the river. Mojapelo said the operation continued until Wednesday afternoon when the remains were recovered by the unit. “His body was found floating in the Levubu River on Wednesday,” Mojapelo said. Residents have been urged to stay away from dangerous dams and rivers, but rather stay in their homes during this lockdown. He said they can be charged if found defying the lockdown regulations and could face jail time.
