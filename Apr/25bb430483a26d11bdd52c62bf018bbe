A suspect was shot dead in a crossfire with the police after a group of men robbed a wholesaler. The incident happened in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Thursday afternoon. According to witnesses, there was a rush inside the shop when a gang of five entered the building and held the owner and shoppers at gunpoint. “They came out of the shop running carrying the cash, but luckily the police responded so fast and bullets started flying killing one of the robbers,” said a witness. The witness said it was like a movie when the gang exchanged fire with the cops. Mpumalanga spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that a suspect was shot dead during a business robbery. "A suspect was shot dead after shooting at the cops who were chasing after him with four other suspects, who are still at large after they robbed a wholesaler of an undisclosed amount of cash, and a customer was also robbed an amount of R3 000 at gunpoint,” said Hlathi. He said the police recovered a revolver and some of the cash on the scene. He urged anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the four suspects to contact the nearest police station. A case of business robbery and murder has been opened.
