YOUNG Andile Mpisane has the mentality of a millionaire. He made jaws drop across Mzansi when he shocked his mum on her reality show KwaMaKhize by asking her for R1 million. The money was to fund the music video for his single, Umcimbi. He told Daily Sun he spent a lot of money on the video but not exactly R1 million. “I asked for a million because that’s what I’m aiming for. “We just released it last week and it already has a million views on YouTube. “I have a million ideas and a million ways to make an impact in our community.” Andile said he was happy to have support from his mum Shawn Mkhize, who taught him to change people’s lives with whatever he has available to him. “I didn’t need R1 million for the music video but I wanted to create a vibe for a good party. “To have a good party, you have to be willing to spend millions to ensure people have a good time.” The video was released last Friday and Somizi choreographed it. Andile said this was because he wanted traditional dance. “I shot the video in Cape Town and Durban and used people from those provinces to empower them. “I was fortunate to work with people like Somizi, who saw my vision and helped me achieve what I wanted, especially with the dance moves I was hoping for.” Andile said it was unfortunate the song was released during the lockdown, but he was hoping people would view it so he could hit his target views. Director at Pilot Films, Bruce Patterson, said production costs went to the production house. He said there were costs artists handled themselves. “I can’t tell you how much the music video cost, but they spent a fortune as they booked a yacht which cost R20 000 an hour, and we spent two hours. I can only imagine how much they spent for everyone excluding our production costs.” He said Shawn paid for Somizi, the dancers and fireworks, to travelling costs, Hammers and catering. “We had glamour in our minds and Andile had that million mentality. I’ve never seen anything like that,” said Bruce.
