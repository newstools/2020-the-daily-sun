  THE HIGH level of ignorance around coronavirus in Soweto is worrying authorities. Early on Thursday the police and the members of the South African Defense Force descended to the streets of Soweto to enforce lockdown regulations. Gauteng Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela said: “There is a high level of non-compliance. We have observed that there is also a high level of ignorance. “People are still believing in the nonexistence of the virus and that it will never catch them. “They just gather, and do as they wish, as if nothing will happen to them.” Mawela said as police they have the responsibility to educate the communities and enforcing the countries laws at the same time. Apart from arresting people, they also distributed pamphlets with information on the coronavirus pandemic. “This area we have chosen based on the complaints we have received from the law-abiding citizens of this township. “There are people who are conducting themselves as if nothing is happening and disregarding the regulations. “We are here to assert and reassert the authority of the state,” he said. Since the start of the lockdown, over 15 000 people have been arrested in Gauteng. He said they are not happy by arresting a lot of people. He said they want people to observe the regulations, which are in their best interest and the nation’s best interest. After Bara Taxi rank, police proceeded to Dobsonville were the streets were left clean and few people were arrested after flouting lockdown regulations.
