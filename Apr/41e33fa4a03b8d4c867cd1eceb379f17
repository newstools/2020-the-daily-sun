 RUSTENBURG
Taxi Operators are disappointed with the donation made by the North West
government. Premier Job
Mokgoro distributed protective personal equipment, sanitisers, gloves and
disinfectants to taxi operators in the Rustenburg taxi rank this week The premier
reminded all those involved in the taxi industry to adhere to the regulations
of the national lockdown. Bleskop
platform Taxi Master Gibson Ndou told the SunTeam that they were not happy with
the donation they received. "Since
we couldn't afford to buy gloves and masks for everyone to ensure that we
follow the safety guidelines. We were looking forward to getting help," he
said. "However,
none of the gloves we received are the right size. All involved in the taxi
rank returned the gloves because they are small size." We advised
our taxi drivers to go buy for themselves, but most shops are closed, and other
shops are out of stock, said Gibson. "We
have a total of 480 drives. We received 200 gloves and 150 masks." "We
appreciate what the government is doing to ensure the safety of our people. But
they should also take people seriously by donating things that will be
useful." "What
is the use of having boxes of gloves we can't use, and we have to go buy for
ourselves when we are not even making a profit during this period." One of the
taxi operators Elizabeth Sekwena she said: "We do try by all means to
adhere to the laws of the lockdown. Passengers get sanitised before they get in
the taxi. Taxis also get sanitised before they start operating." "What
we needed were gloves and masks. To also give passengers who need them. We are
only a few people wearing masks day in and day out." "We
are frustrated. The lockdown does not seem to favour the poor. Seeing people
wait for hours to get transport to return home is heartbreaking." "We
can't break the transport regulation because we also want to help avoid the
spread of COVID-19," she added.
