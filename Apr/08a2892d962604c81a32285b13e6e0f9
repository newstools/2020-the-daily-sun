PEOPLE are suffering, and Somali and Ethiopian spaza shop owners have extended a helping hand ekasi. They donated food parcels to residents of Harare in Khayelitsha on Tuesday. Ward 98 Councillor Anele Gabuza acknowledged them for their kind gesture. “Covid-19 is real. I’m delighted Somali and Ethiopian spaza shop owners have provided food for suffering families. We appreciate your support,” said Gabuza. Residents of Harare in the past few months have stood together against spaza shop robberies. Gabuza said it was important that Somalis trade freely, and the community would ensure this by protecting them. Somali business leader in Harare, Mohamed Ali, said they were willing to share the community’s burden. “We appreciate the people of Harare for working with us,” said Mohamed. Sanco branch secretary Yanga Mjingwana said: “We’re grateful to the Somali and Ethopian business community for helping us during this time.” Gogo Nobam Nkosana (91) stood up and ululated when it was her turn to collect a food parcel. She thanked spaza shop owners for their good hearts. “We don’t have food in our houses, and receiving food when you least expect it is a blessing,” said gogo. “May God continue to protect them and their businesses. Now I know my grandchildren and I have something to eat.”
