Actress and reality TV star Bahumi Mhlongo has recently revealed that she is living with a condition called lymphedema. The youngster, who is also part of her dad’s reality TV show Living The Dream With Somizi, recently posted a picture on her Instagram account which revealed her two legs are not the same size. The 24-year-old who recently starred on Lebo Mathosa’s biopic captioned the photo and said: “Being herself was her truest form of worship.” Shortly after posting the photo many fans started questioning why her legs are not the same size. “Why does one leg look smaller than the other?” one fan asked. Then another fan came to the rescue and mentioned that she has a condition called lymphedema. According to Medial News Today, it is a long-term condition where excess fluid collects in tissues causing swelling (edema). The youngster's courage to finally show her legs, also made other people speak out about their condition and facing their fears. “I'm happy that you could show your true self... took me years to accept my condition,” a fan wrote.
