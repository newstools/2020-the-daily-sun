WITH most countries on lockdown, in efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic, sport around the world has been brought to a standstill. And there is no doubt this will hit clubs very hard financially, as Bidvest Wits COO Jono Schloss admits. The Absa Premiership clubs have not been in action for a month now after the League resolved to postpone matches indefinitely. But Schloss has also thanked the club owners, in particular Bidvest chairman Alan Fainman, for his "insight, leadership and understanding during this time'. He continued: “In saying that, a lockdown like this does impact a club financially. “There are no games, therefore there is no additional revenue generated from gate takings, prize money, merchandise sales, hospitality sales (your bars and or tuck-shops)." South Africa will be in lockdown until the end of April and due to this, the 2019/2020 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season will most likely be extended to either July or August, resulting in serious ramifications for next season. Talking to the club website Schloss added that at this stage, life is more important than the need to complete the league on time. “The safety of people’s lives is more important than anything else," he said. "I think that once the world and in particular South Africa gets this pandemic under control and we are allowed to resume the season and complete it, the League in conjunction with the clubs will agree on how best we can finish the season. Even if that means that the season gets extended. “What I mean by that is that instead of the season coming to an end on the 30th of June it may finish for example on the 31st of July or 31st of August or whatever date is agreed too.”
