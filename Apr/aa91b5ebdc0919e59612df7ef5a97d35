BOOZERS and smokers who don’t follow lockdown regulations say taverns, operating against the law, are charging them huge amounts. The SunTeam recently saw dozens of men and women carrying backpacks full of booze in the Govan Mbeki and Missionvale kasis in Port Elizabeth. Siyabulela Stungu (27) told Daily Sun: “Lockdown without booze is like a prison sentence.

I’m bored from watching TV, and from sleeping and eating. There’s no way I can carry on like this.” He said legal taverns were closed, but there were people in the community selling alcohol at high prices. “A 750ml beer used to be R18 but now it’s R22. For a litre of beer, I used to pay R22 but now I’m paying R35. I have no choice but to pay. I’m thirsty,” he said. Another boozer said legal taverns had gone underground. “They only sell alcohol to us, their loyal customers. We call them and they deliver to our homes. “Some of us go to them with backpacks and others hide alcohol under their pyjamas. “At the legal tavern I used to pay R150 for a bottle of brandy, but now it’s between R200 and R250. “For a cigarette, I used to pay between R1 and R2. but now a loose cigarette is R3 or R3,50,” he said.
