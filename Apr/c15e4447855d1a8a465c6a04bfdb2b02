THE ban of the sale of cigarettes during the lockdown has been hard on a lot of smokers. Some have even turned to unusual ways to satisfy their cravings. Peter George (31) from Philippi Browns Farm said he has now turned to smoking tea leaves just to release smoke out his nose. He said he could not even get dagga, which he used to smoke every day. “I haven’t smoked zol since 1 April and it feels like I’m going crazy. I’m upset all the time. I can’t go on like this. I can’t buy cigarettes or weed anywhere. I was able to get some from friends just after the lockdown, but they have also run out,” he said. The cigarette ban has been criticised, with organisations calling for it to be lifted. In a recent statement, Sinenhlanhla Mnguni, chairman of Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association said they would approach the courts to have the ban removed. “This decision was not taken lightly and we had hoped that a logical solution in the best interests of all concerned would be arrived at without the need for litigation,” said Mnguni. On Saturday, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said they discouraged smoking as it could increase the risk of compromising the body in fighting Covid-19. “Once you have Covid-19, we believe those who smoke are vulnerable because Covid-19 affects the capacity of the lung to be able to process the normal day-to-day exchange of gasses in the lungs,” said Mkhize.
