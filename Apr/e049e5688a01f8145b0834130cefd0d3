RESIDENTS have accused Metro cops of dumping homeless people in their neighbourhood. A resident from Nazareth kasi outside Pinetown, west of Durban, said they were shocked to wake up to find homeless people loitering around their kasi on Tuesday. He said they saw a Metro cop van driving around and some people climbing on the back as if they wanted to leave in the vehicle. “We didn’t see the police dropping them off, but we don’t believe it was by chance that we saw the van driving next to them. “We suspect police or Metro officials took them from the Durban CBD and dumped the amaphara in our area,” said a resident. “We fear the crime rate will increase because these are drug addicts who will steal our clothes from the washing lines.” In a video clip, two people are seen jumping off the back of the Metro police van. The homeless people, known as amaphara, have been a problem for the eThekwini Municipality since the start of the lockdown. A few weeks ago eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda announced that the municipality had prepared a marquee at Albert Park where they were housed but they tore the tent apart and went back to the streets. Some of them are always seen standing next to the traffic lights begging for food. Municipality spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said he has seen the clip, but there was no evidence the people were dropped off by Metro police. He said there was also no evidence that those people were the homeless from the city.
