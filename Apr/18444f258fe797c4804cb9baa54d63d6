KAIZER Chiefs boss Kaizer Motaung has paid a glowing tribute to the mother of Amakhosi legend Doctor Khumalo on the club's website. The Amakhosi family is reeling with shock after receiving the sad news of the passing of Mme Mabel Khumalo. Mme Mabel Khumalo is the wife of the late Kaizer Chiefs stalwart and founding member, Eliakim ‘Pro’ Khumalo and the mother of the living legend Doctor Khumalo. It is regrettable news to receive especially in this time when we are in distress due to the Coronavirus pandemic that is currently creeping the world. Words cannot describe our sympathy as Amakhosi to Doctor Khumalo and the entire bereaved family during this difficult time. The Chairman Kaizer Motaung said: “She was a wonderful person who played her supportive role in the background I knew her in the late 60s when ‘Pro’ was playing for Moroka Swallows before joining us to form Kaizer Chiefs in 1970. And, it is known that her son Doctor Khumalo grew up at Kaizer Chiefs and developed to be a household name in International Football. We can only be grateful of the contribution that Mme Mabel made to Kaizer Chiefs and football in general.” "Our deepest heartfelt condolences go to Doctor, bereaved family and friends. We pray for her departed soul through Philippians 3:20-21, “But our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power which enables him even to subject all things to himself.” May her soul rest in eternal peace...with Love and Peace - Kaizer Motaung
