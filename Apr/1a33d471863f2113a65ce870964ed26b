Two men were arrested on Thursday at Marite Village in Mpumalanga after they were found  transporting dagga. The suspects who were transporting dagga in a bakkie tried to escape from a roadblock but were later arrested. It is reported the two men who were in a bakkie tried to change direction at a roadblock on the Hazyview Road and drove towards the Sabie Road with the aim of fleeing from the police. The police tried to stop the driver, but he sped off the bakkie and stopped at Marite Village whereby he jumped out of the bakkie and ran his heels off, leaving his accomplice behind. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun that the suspect that was left in the bakkie later called his boss to inform him about the arrest. "Then his boss arrived at the scene and tried to bribe the police with R15 560 in order to release the suspect and the bakkie full of dagga," he said. "They were in possession of affidavits stating that they were going to attend a funeral in Giyani, Limpopo from Nelspruit. The driver is still at large after he ran away from the police leaving behind the bakkie,” he said. Hlathi said 29 refuse bags full of dagga were recovered. He said the dagga is estimated to the street value of R500 000. The two men aged 26 and 33 are expected to appear at Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court on Friday facing charges of possession of dagga, dealing in dagga, bribery and failing to confine to one’s place of residence.
