THE future of Tokelo Rantie is as uncertain as that of global sport in the time Covid-19 crisis. But Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki believes Rantie could still have a future in football and can be helped to resuscitate his career. No one can quite predict when athletes will be back on various fields as the world is on standstill, battling with the deadly virus. It is no different for Rantie, who has messed up countless chances to get his career back on track. The former Bafana and Bournemouth FC striker has resurfaced at Bloemfontein Celtic where he had been on trials, before the coronavirus outbreak. It is unclear whether or not he will ever play professionally again, given his habit of spitting in the face of those looking to help him. He had his last contract terminated at Mamelodi Sundowns for misconduct, earlier this season. This was after he blew another chance of reviving his career at Cape Town City, having being jettisoned at Turkish side Genclerbirligi. Ntseki, however, reckons Rantie is not a lost cause and can still return to the pitch. And he would be willing to meet and talk to him if ever that were to be arranged. “You first need to know why all this is happening with him (Rantie). You need to do more like a case study into his life,” said Ntseki. “You’ve got to help somebody if that person is not aware of his challenges but is prepared to help himself. “The mistake we are making normally is that we always say ‘look Tokelo, you’ve got talent, you can play football. You must do this and that’. “But this is done not knowing exactly what is happening in that man’s life. People will always say I tried this and that with him. But it’s because you don’t know the root cause of the problem. “I don’t have a problem talking to him, to help him... if ever that can be made possible.”
