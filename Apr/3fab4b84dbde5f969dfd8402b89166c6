A GROUP of pastors calling themselves Concerned Spiritual Leaders of South Africa want churches to be classified as essential service providers. The group has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa asking him to relax the regulations to allow churches to open under the same rules applying to taxis. Group chairman Bishop Menzi Buthelezi of the Restoration and Worship International Centre in KwaDukuza, north of Durban in KZN, yesterday told Daily Sun they wrote to the president on Thursday and his office acknowledged receiving the letter. Buthelezi said the group had more than 250 pastors across the country. He said it was wrong to close churches as they were spiritual hospitals. “Human beings need spiritual health in the same way they need physical health,” he said. Buthelezi claimed churches had never been closed before and even during the outbreak of leprosy in the Bible, temples remained open. Bishop Ephraim Nkosi of Heroes of Faith Church Ministries International in Tshwane said the group was not happy the government allowed taxis and vendors to operate, but not churches. He said as pastors, they supported the government and would obey the rule of staying two metres apart while providing people with sanitisers and masks. “The way churches are treated under this lockdown makes it look like the virus was found in church buildings, which is not true. We have seen long queues in shops and people loitering around in groups without observing social distancing,” he said. Michael Louw from the Office of the Presidency said the matter was getting attention and the president would respond soon.
