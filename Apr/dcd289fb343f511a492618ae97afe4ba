SHE will turn 106 on Friday and is grateful to have lived this long. But gogo Jester Nyathi from Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, would love to get a wheelchair as she can’t walk anymore. She told Daily Sun a wheelchair would be a lovely present on her birthday. “I thank God who has blessed me with extra years, but it would be nice to be moved around in a wheelchair since I can’t walk anymore,” she said.  “It’s a struggle to be carried everywhere, including the toilet, so a wheelchair would make life easier, especially for my relative who’s taking care of me.” Gogo Jester said she never had children of her own and her siblings died a long time ago. She lives with her relative Nelly Manzini. Nelly said she was surprised gogo’s memory was still good. “We’re blessed to have someone like gogo in our family. God has blessed her and we just want her to enjoy her last days on earth.” Gogo said she’s always been strong and fit because of healthy living. She said nothing beat healthy eating. “My family uses a wheelbarrow as a wheelchair and I can see it strains them. That’s why I wish a Good Samaritan could help me,” said gogo. Gogo Jester said another wish was to meet President Cyril Ramaphosa before she meets her ancestors. Her nephew, Thulani Mathebula (50), said he was blessed to still have an aunt who’s lived this long.
