The University of South Africa (Unisa) students will write non-venue based examination in June as COVID-19 has disrupted the planned exams. In a communique sent to students today, the university said they are preparing for non-venue examinations. Students will not be sitting for examinations the way they normally does as the university is working on alternative ways they can use to ensure the institution proceeds with their final assessments for the semester. In a communique that was sent to students today, the university said the lock-down declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa has derailed the normal exam set up. “The extension of the national lockdown declared by President Cyril Ramaphosa has meant that Unisa has had to make some far-reaching decisions regarding the May/June 2020 examination period. The May/June 2020 examination period will continue, but no venue-based examinations will be written during this time. The university will, instead, make use of alternative assessment formats for this examination period,”said the communique. Each and every faculty is expected to determine the type of alternative assessment to be used for each module during the upcoming exams. President Ramaphosa declared that no groups of people are allowed to gather except for funerals with only a limited number of less than 50 people. Unisa is one of the biggest universities in the country boasting a number of over 300 000 students. “All students who obtain examination admission will be permitted to write the May/June 2020 examinations. Students who are unable to complete the non-venue-based assessment will automatically be deferred to the October/November 2020 examination period without penalty or additional cost. All students, however, must be encouraged to make use of the non-venue-based assessment, rather than to defer to the October/November 2020 examination period,” Unisa said.
