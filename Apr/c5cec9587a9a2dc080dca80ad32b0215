Gauteng EFF
leader Mandisa Mashego has resigned as the party's caucus leader in the
provincial legislature. EFF
spokesperson Delisile Ngwenya confirmed she had resigned. "It
was effective yesterday, she had put in a month's notice," Ngwenya told
News24. When asked
if Mashego would remain on as chairperson of the EFF in Gauteng, she said this
was up to the red berets' secretariat to comment on. Attempts to
reach EFF secretary-general Marshal Dlamini have been unsuccessful. Last month,
News24 reported the EFF was adamant it had not received a resignation letter
from Mashego, despite rumours circulating she had indeed resigned. At the
time, Ngwenya told News24 it was possible the party's leaders might not have
seen Mashego's resignation letter if she had sent it via email. She said
the letter could be in Dlamini's inbox, adding there was no communication from
his office about the matter. Ngwenya
added the only communication from Mashego to the secretary-general's office,
which she could confirm, was a medical certificate dating back to the week of 9
February. She was responding
to claims on social media at the time that Mashego had resigned as a member of
the party, which she described as speculation. Another
party spokesperson, Vuyani Pambo, went so far as to say Mashego was very much a
member of the EFF and still held her position as provincial chairperson, caucus
leader in the provincial legislature and MPL. "Mandisa
Mashego is still a member of the EFF. What you see on social media is just
gossip because we have not received her resignation letter," he said at
the time. News24's
attempts to reach Mashego went unanswered. Her comment will be added once
received. SOURCE:
