THE SOIL’s Buhlebendalo Mda has dedicated her first album to women. The singer said Chosi was inspired by the killing of women. She has already released the single Iwotshi from the album and is releasing the second, Ntab’ Ezimnyama, tomorrow. Buhle told SunBuzz Ntab’ Ezimnyama was about issues women face. “It is about a girl being sent to the woods at night by her parents. But she’s afraid of the dark,” she said. “We used the dark as a metaphor for men. Most women are afraid to go out because they think a man will grab them. When we go out, we have to ask ourselves if we aren’t dressed in a way that’ll make men rape or kill us. We’re afraid of being in the presence of men. So, the single tells stories that women are afraid to tell. I wrote it with Sipho Sithole.” Buhle said people will get healed through this project. “Recording this album was healing for me, and I hope it will be the same for others. As the black community, we need to heal from a lot of things.” She said people should expect more solo projects from her because she enjoyed making Chosi. “I got to explore myself and saw qualities I never thought I had. I worked with Sipho, Sithembiso Thwala, Madala Kunene, Sjava, my uncle Mthetheli Gongotha and other artists on the album.”
