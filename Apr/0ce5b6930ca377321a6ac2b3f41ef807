Highlands Park defender Hassan Banda was suspected of having the COVID-19 virus long before the lockdown and missed his club’s last two match in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal before the pandemic forced the suspension of the league. It turned out to just be a bad case of the flu and a false alarm as far as the virus was concerned after Banda was sent to be tested. “It wasn't a big problem, only the flu that was bothering me. We had been travelling a lot for the two weeks before I got flu,” he recalls to SuperSport.com “Thankfully the test was negative and two weeks later I started training with the team again.” However, his return coincided with the shutdown, another source of frustration for the 25-year-old Tanzania international, who has been looking to put a tough 2019 behind him and set a new course with Highlands after joining them at the start of the season from Baroka FC. He was hoping this year would turn out to be a lot better than last, where he missed out on playing at the Africa Cup of Nations finals as Tanzania made their first appearance at the final in some four decades. “I suffered a hip injury in the Nedbank Cup match between Baroka and Jomo Cosmos on January 29. “To make matters worse, they didn't treat me claiming I didn't want to play because I wanted to leave the team and go to (Mamelodi) Sundowns. “I spent three months without treatment as the team struggled in a bad place. Then suddenly they wanted me to do an operation and I refused and went back to Tanzania.” By this time it was too late to be healed in time for the tournament in Egypt, meaning Banda, a regular in the side, missed out on a opportunity of a potential career highlight. “Highlands begged me to come and play and treated me. Thank God for their help because I stayed seven months without treatment. “I would like to say that Highlands helped me a lot and my hope now is to return the favour by playing for them for a long time,” he added. -SuperSport.com
