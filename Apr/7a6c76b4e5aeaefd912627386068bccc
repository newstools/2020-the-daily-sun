PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will this evening address the nation to
announce additional economic and social relief measures in the fight against
coronavirus pandemic. The Presidency in a statement said these measures follow Ramaphosa's
meetings he held with Cabinet, National Command Council, NEDLAC and his
coordinating team among other structures. No time was given by The Presidency promising this will be communicated
during the day.  Ramaphosa could perhaps announce the adjustments of social grants which
were tabled by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni last week. Basic Education
Minister Angie Motshekga also tabled her plan in the same virtual Cabinet
meeting.
