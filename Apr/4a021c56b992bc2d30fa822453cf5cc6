ALTHOUGH it’s been a week since shops were told not to sell cigarettes, it appears that smokers are not quitting. The SunTeam found smokers roaming the streets looking for cigarettes in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, and Soweto. According to Tax Justice SA, the ban on sales will lead to a number of South Africa’s 11 million smokers looking for illegal cigarettes. The organisation said before the lockdown, one in every three cigarettes sold was illegal, costing R100 million in lost taxes every day. Organisation founder Yusuf Abramjee said: “The lockdown ban will see more previously law-abiding citizens driven to the illicit market where no tax is paid, and these tax-paying customers may be lost forever. When we emerge out of this crisis, the country will need every cent of tax it can raise.” Abramjee pointed out that the lockdown was meant to prevent people from moving around, which smokers were now doing to find illegal cigarettes. A 40-year-old man from Winnie Mandela told the SunTeam he was told by a friend that a place down the road from him secretly sold cigarettes. “I don’t understand why the government stopped the trade of cigarettes in fighting the spread of the Coronavirus. Selling cigarettes cannot cause overcrowding, unlike alcohol,” he said. Another smoker said: “I can only afford to buy loose, and I leave the house at least three times a day.” Abramjee said smokers would not visit the shops more than other customers as they bought groceries along with their cigarettes. “Citizens will go to the shops only to buy basic supplies. When they are there, they will be able to buy cigarettes instead of moving further afield,” he said. “Cigarette smoking doesn’t fuel public disorder and banning cigarettes only makes it harder for the SAPS to do their job.” The Western Cape government recently lifted the ban on the selling of cigarettes as long they were sold along with essential goods.
