THE hand of the law is very long and doesn't not give up on its mission. That is what a 35-year-old man learned after he was finally caught by the police. It’s alleged he had several rape and house robbery cases against him in Bothaville,  Thabong,  Virginia and Bronville area. The man has been running from the police since November of 2019 after he and his friends allegedly raped a woman and robbed her BMW. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the man was arrested on Friday morning in Thabong near Welkom, Free State. Makhele told Daily Sun:"In November 2019 a woman was in her home with her two children when three unknown men entered  and overpowered her.  She was allegedly raped and robbed of a BMW sedan. Her plasma television set and sound system were stolen." Makhele said a manhunt for the three suspects was launched but only two were caught. " A week later, the two suspects were arrested in Thabong and the BMW was found and seized by our members. The sound system and plasma TV haven't been found yet and the police were still on the manhunt for the third and last suspect," he said. But on Friday morning, the third and the last suspect was caught and arrested after a tip off. Makhele said: "On Friday at about 11am, Odendaalsrus detective unit received a tip-off regarding the whereabouts of the third and last suspect. Information was followed to Thabong  and a 35-year-old suspect was arrested. It emerged during the arrest that there are several cases of house robbery and rape pending against the suspect, which were committed at Bothaville,  Thabong,  Virginia and Bronville.  The suspect will appear before the Odendaalsrus Magistrate court on Monday on charges of house robbery,  rape and theft of a vehicle. Investigation continues."
