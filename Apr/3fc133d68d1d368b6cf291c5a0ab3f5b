LIFE is certainly not the same for Siyabonga Nhlapo. Like his teammates, the SuperSport United defender finds himself having to adjust to life without the usual daily routine as the county remains in lockdown to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Nhlapo, who won the MTN8 trophy earlier this season, has been adhering to the government’s regulation, making sure he does his bit to flatten the curve, training on his own at home. At 31, he is no spring-chicken and so he understands the importance of maintaining his fitness. “During the lockdown period, I have been training twice, in the morning and afternoon,” Nhlapo explained. “I kick off the morning session at 9am and the second session is at 4pm with some rest in between these hours obviously. “I don’t cook much, but I’m very handy at cleaning and fixing anything in the house that needs to be fixed.” Nhlapo has made 26 appearances in all competitions so far this season, including 20 in the league. He could still achieve a top three finish, since he is still chasing his dream of winning the league with the Tshwane side. He was loaned out to Highlands Park when Bidvest Wits, his parent club then, lifted the Absa Premiership trophy three years ago. His switch to Matsatsantsa allowed him to re-establish himself and demonstrate his ambition. “I watch a lot of sports documentaries on TV, I read different books, I also check on the updates about COVID-19,” he added. “My advice on the virus is for people to try and remain optimistic and positive about the curve getting flattened. And hopefully we will live our normal lives again.” Nhlapo was part of the Bafana Bafana’s 2015 Africa Cup of Nations finals squad.
