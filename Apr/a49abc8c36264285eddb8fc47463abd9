FORGOTTEN former Kaizer Chiefs and Platinum Stars midfielder Abia Nale is optimistic he will resurrect his career with an Absa Premiership or GladAfrica Championship side next season. The 33-year-old has been struggling to find a team for the past two seasons. The last time Nale kicked a ball was when he featured for Platinum Stars two seasons ago. But the Royal Bafokeng Holdings, which owned Stars, sold the North West-based club to Rawat Petroleum for R22.5 million at the end of the 2017-18 season. Nale was among the players who were released by the new owners. Dikwena changed their name to Cape Umoya United and are now campaigning in the Championship in Cape Town. “I have been working hard and I am confident that people will see me playing football again next season,” said Nale. “I know people have been wondering where is Abia Nale? I am alive and kicking. I have not yet retired as some have been thinking. “I love this game and I believe I still have age on my side. I also believe that I still have a lot to offer in the game.” In his five years with the Soweto giants Chiefs, Nale won one Premiership title and the Telkom Knockout. The Sebokeng-born player has been playing professional football for more than a decade. He started his career with former and now defunct PSL champions Manning Rangers in 2005-6 season. The well travelled player has also featured for the likes of Golden Arrows, Maritzburg United, Ajax Cape Town and Mpumalanga Black Aces.
