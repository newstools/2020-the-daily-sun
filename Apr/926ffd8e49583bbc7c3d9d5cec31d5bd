 The Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has dismissed an application by a
group of Muslim leaders and entities to declare certain parts of the lockdown
regulations unconstitutional because it prohibits prayers, specifically the
Muslim daily prayers, in places of worship. The application was brought by Muhammed Bin Hassim Mohomed, Anas
Mohammed Chotia and the As-Saadiqeen Islamic Centre. Judge Brenda Neukircher said in her judgment that every citizen had been
called upon to make sacrifices to their fundamental rights entrenched in the
Constitution. She said this was done for the "the greater good", in
light of the Covid-19 pandemic. She added that the government had put together a task team to consult
extensively on the safety of citizens in order to flatten the curve and prevent
the country's health system from collapsing. "I cannot find that the restrictions imposed are either
unreasonable or unjustifiable and thus the application must fail," she
said. SOURCE: NEWS24
