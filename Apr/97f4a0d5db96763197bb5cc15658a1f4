A RADIO DJ sparked rumours that Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng flirted with a church member. But the church member spoke out in defence of the leader of Incredible Happenings Ministry. “It’s a lie and fake news. He was not flirting with me. He’s my spiritual father,” said an angry Zanele Ndlazi (37). A video of Mboro commenting on her body was circulated on social media. In the video shared on YouTube, the DJ referred to Mboro as a fake prophet. “This weekend false Prophet Mboro had a live stream on Facebook and the live stream took a dark turn when Mboro commented on a woman’s body,” he wrote. “Mboro tells the lady her back looks nice.” In the video, Mboro is heard telling viewers: “I’m just watching you. Look at the dress you’re wearing. You’re able to see the shape.” Mboro demonstrates the woman’s shape with his hand. Zanele, a member of the church since 2011, said: “I’m angry and feel undermined by how the video was used to spread lies.” She said she suffered from depression as she struggled to get a job even though she had a qualification in agriculture. In January, Mboro appointed her to help on one of his farming projects. “I was sharing my testimony on how my life has improved and the prophet was attesting to my words. “I used to be skinny. I was suffering. None of my clothes fitted. This DJ has no respect for women. “He went as far as putting a fake picture of a woman’s breasts, claiming they’re mine. I won’t take this kind of abuse.” Zanele opened cases of crimen injuria, spreading fake news, and defamation of character against the DJ. Mboro said he’ll take legal steps against the DJ. “I was emphasising the point that her life’s improved and, as a result, she’s gained weight. “Her weight used to be one of her frustrations. To say I was flirting with her is wrong and a lie.” Attempts to get hold of the DJ have been unsuccessful.
