SOME kasi people are angry because they’re running out of food. They said they had hoped to get food parcels from government, but nothing happened. And as nothing is coming, they have allegedly threatened to loot foreign-owned shops to get “food parcels”. Shop owners are now living in fear and have appealed to cops to protect them. “We’re always soft targets and once people get frustrated, they vent their anger on us,” said a shop owner. Another shop owner said: “We feel helpless and appeal to police to protect us. “Just last week a man walked into a shop in Daggafontein in Springs and took a bag of mealie meal and tin fish. “When the shop owner demanded payment, he told him he was hungry and pointed him with a gun.” Cops confirmed that a case of robbery was opened and they were looking for the suspect. Residents said the looting of shops would be a disadvantage for them. Community leader Albert Nkuna (50) said: “We buy from these shops because we can’t go to malls freely since it’s lockdown. “Where will we go if they attack these shops? “Some community leaders have even vowed to protect foreign shops owners.” Another community, leader Frans Mothapo (46), said some shop owners gave people food on credit. “We appeal to the police to work with us because people who want to do this are just thugs and are hiding behind the lockdown,” he said. Shop owner Mohammed Isaac from Sebokeng, Vaal, said he used to allow walk-ins but after the threats, he was now selling from a small opening in the burglar window and has tightened security by hiring three guards. “It’s expensive but I don’t have a choice.” Captain Mavela Masondo advised shop owners to open cases of intimidation with the police.
