Singer Rihanna has received an award for her vegan fashion line. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) honoured her with an award for Compassion in Fashion because the leather that makes her clothes is vegan. This means that no animals were killed to make it. The faux leather wear falls under her clothing line, Fenty. PETA is an organisation that exposes animals suffering in laboratories as well as the food and the clothing industries. The organisation posted the news on their Twitter with a photo of a cow thanking Rihanna for her leather-free collection.
