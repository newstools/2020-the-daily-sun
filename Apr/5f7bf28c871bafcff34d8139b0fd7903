Unilever
South Africa has confirmed that 30 of its employees and 12 contractors tested
positive for Covid-19 at its factory in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. "An
employee at the plant first reported a positive test for Covid-19 the weekend
before Easter, a week after the employee was last on site," corporate
affairs and sustainable business director South Africa Shobna Persadh told
News24 on Tuesday. "The
people are not going to die from the virus - they are going to die from
hunger!" This cry by a Cape Town mother on Wednesday was heard by News24
barely 50m from where at least two food trucks were stoned and looted on Robert
Sobukwe Road. "In
line with the established NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases]
protocols, Unilever South Africa immediately traced all the direct contacts and
advised them to self-isolate," she added. As a
result, operations at the Boksburg plant were paused to undertake a deep clean. "This
was a company decision as the well-being of employees remains a top priority
and every precaution is being taken to keep them safe. "We
also recognise that our products are needed to combat the coronavirus and we
are committed to maintain supplies of essential goods under safe
conditions," she further explained. A full
testing and tracing programme launched by Unilever together with the Department
of Health for approximately 680 employees and contractors found that 30
employees and 12 contractors tested positive for the virus. "They
will remain in quarantine until cleared to return to work. Our thoughts are
with them for a speedy recovery," Persadh said. SOURCE:
