TRAPSOUL artist KLY has teamed up with rapper Focalistic to talk about what artists need the most – money. According to KLY, everyone needs money and to have it, one needs to work hard on their hustle. His single, Cash Flow, is a song that everyone needs to hear to get motivated and focus on things that bring them money, Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “The song is about wanting financial success. Everybody needs money or cash flow to get what they want and need.” Talking about how the song came about, he said he was in the studio with producer, Hercules, as he was making the beat. They were having a conversation about how they need to make money, and get their cash flow up. “I decided I wanted to make a song about that because I’m pretty sure we are not the only ones thinking like that. I featured Focalistic because the bounce and feel of the song were perfect for him. I couldn’t hear anyone else on the song, but Focalistic,” said the singer from Klaarwater, KZN. KLY, whose real name’s Siyabonga Mkhize, describes his music as airy, sexy and bouncy. It’s a mix of different elements from different genres, which he calls KLYMAX music. He said he always tries to do something different, and his music receives love not only in Mzansi, but around the world. “I’m always exploring different sounds and try to finesse them my own way, and whoever I can hear on that particular.” The Umbuzo singer’s finishing up his next project called KLYMAX3, which will be released later in the year.
