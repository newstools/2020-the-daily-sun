ALL the lockdown regulations during the funeral proceedings of popular Skeem Saam actor and Thobela FM's Mahlakung radio drama, Charles Maja were observed. The funeral is current taking place at his home in Kopermyn village, Ga-Maja outside Polokwane in Limpopo this morning. Police vans including a security company were outside to make sure that not more than 50 people attended. Villagers were also sanitised as they come in.  Maja was described as a man of many talents and a legend in the media industry.  Limpopo Artist Movement chairman Mphoza Mashabela said they lost Maja on 9 April, the day they were celebrating the fourth anniversary of the movement. “Our celebration quickly turned into sorrow.  We are very heart broken because he was our pillar of strength. We call upon the Limpopo government to name either a street or building under him to honour him,” said Mashabela. Everyone was touched by his funeral and they were all sad. They said he put their village on the map and that they will never forget him.
