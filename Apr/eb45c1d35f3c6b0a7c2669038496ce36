SOUTH Africa’s 400m hurdles star Sokwakhana “Socks” Zazini has urged everyone to stay at home and adhere to the lockdown regulations. Zazini, who is based at the University of Pretoria at the High-Performance Centre, is optimistic that the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be over, and that life will eventually return to normal. “Stay at home, wash your hands regularly, but most importantly stay positive and hope for the best,” said the talented athlete from the Eastern Cape. Zazini, who won a gold medal at his specialized event at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) world championships in Kenya in 2017, is keeping fit under the lockdown. The winner of the silver medal at the youth world championships in Finland last year, is encouraging athletes not to stop training by their own. Like every other athlete, Zazini’s dream is to one day represent South Africa at the Olympic Games. He has been troubled by a knee injury, but he has fully recovered and can’t wait to get back on the track. The Olympic Games have been moved from July this year to 23 July until 5 September 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Athletics South Africa (ASA) will design a new athletics season after the lockdown. Zazini was also looking forward to the SA Senior Track and Field Championships that was supposed to take place at the Pildich Stadium in Tshwane from today until Saturday. But the biggest track and field event in Mzansi has been postponed due to Covid-19. Retired hurdler LJ Van Zyl, who was based at Tuks, dominated the hurdlers events for many years, but in Zazini, Mzansi might have discovered another big star that has the potential to take on the continent and the rest of the world. A fully fit Zazini can take on anyone on the world stage.
