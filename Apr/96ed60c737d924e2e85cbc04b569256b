COMMUNITIES are urged to report any suspicious behaviour in and around their schools! This is the request from the Western Cape Department of Education after seven schools were vandalised during the lockdown. At Chuma Primary School in Khayelitsha over the weekend, thugs vandalised the school and stole two computers and trophies. Resident Mlandeli Goqwana (54) told Daily Sun since lockdown started, criminals have been stealing and vandalising our schools. “As residents we can’t do anything about it,” said Mlandeli. Nomalungisa Klaas (43) said: “We are always indoors and can’t check on schools,” she said. “We can’t expect the government to build us a school then also protect it from criminals. We must help them to protect our schools.” Nolitha Mpande (39) said the solution was for cops to be visible. “Otherwise more schools will be vandalised,” said Mpande.  Education spokeswoman Bronagh Hammond said the damages at Chuma had yet to be established. “Additional security has been provided to the school,” he said.  Hammond said during the lockdown, there was no reason for anyone to be at the schools unless they’re a caretaker. He said incidents happened during the day. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of business burglary and theft were opened for investigation after two computers were stolen. “No one has been arrested yet.”
