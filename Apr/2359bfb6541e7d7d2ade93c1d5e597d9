COSATU has expressed concern over the number of health care
workers who are testing positive for the Coronavirus as the country grapples to
stop the spread of the deadly virus. The union federation said the concern is further fuelled by
revelations by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize that 48 health care workers
tested positive for the virus at St Augustine Hospital where 16 others also
tested positive. This comes as its affiliate union, NEHAWU was lodging a
legal challenge to force Mkhize to provide health care workers personal
protective equipment. Federation spokesman Sizwe Pamla said the revelations by
Mkhize vindicates its and affiliates concerns that the health workers were
being let down by careless officials and indifferent political leadership both
in public and private health care sectors “Their lies and excuses are proof that they are not serious
about providing these workers with adequate Personal Protective Equipment. Both
private and public healthcare facilities are failing to comply with the
Occupational Health and Safety standards. We are also worried by the quality of
these PPE’s that are being provided by the health facilities to these
employees. Pamla urged the health department to move swiftly and
removes the matter other than downplaying it as this was a life and death
issue. “We are unrelenting in our demand for the department of
health and private healthcare facilities to ensure that all workers in the
health sector are provided with the necessary Personal Protective Equipment. By
doing this they are not doing these workers a favour, but they are complying
with the law, especially the Occupational Health and Safety Act; 1993 [as
amended]. “We also reiterate our call for these workers to be paid the
necessary danger allowances and also be provided with full wellness and counselling
services because many of them are mentally fatigued,” he said.
