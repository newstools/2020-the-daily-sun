LAST WEDNESDAY, the City of Cape Town ordered the destruction of houses illegally erected in Empolweni squatter camp in Khayelitsha. But the court later ordered that 49 families whose shacks were demolished must return to the land and their building material must be also returned. Instead of only those families returning to the area, hundreds of other families also moved in and municipal law enforcement officers stopped the residents from erecting the shacks. Human Settlements MMC Malusi Booi said the people allowed to erect their shacks were those who were given permission by the court. “The city is allowed to remove any new illegally erected structures with immediate effect. Land invasions are illegal. The judge denounced land grabs. The Legal Resources Centre wanted 300 people to be allowed on the land but the judge made it clear that 49 may return until the case is heard.” Xola Mbanjwa (34) was erecting his shack when the Law Enforcement arrived. He told the SunTeam he has been renting as a backyarder in Makhaza for the past 10 years. “I pay R600 for that shack every month but I don’t have a job. I make money from selling braai meat. But people are not buying at the moment but I still need a space to stay,” he said. He said the court order must apply to all the people not only the 49 families. Minister of Human Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu visited the area on Sunday and promised to support the families who were allowed to return by the court.
