Nigerian dramatist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Wole Soyinka has been quoted as saying his country’s fundamental problem is corruption. He borrowed Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi’s words: that the world has enough food for man’s needs but not enough for our greed. The greatest threat to our hard-earned freedom is the absence of criticism. South Africa is in the state it is today because we keep quiet when we should be vocal about things that affect us on a daily basis. I sometimes ask myself: if Julius Malema and company had not started a movement that woke us from slumberland, where would this country be as looters plunder it with abandon? It’s only in Africa that plunderers and thieves regroup with the sole purpose of stealing over and over again. Our president went on national televisionrecently, telling the masses of this country that wealthy businessmen Johann Rupert, Nicky Oppenheimer and Patrice Motsepe had donated billions of rands towards the fight against Covid-19. What we ask of our president is transparency when it comes to how the money will be used. We’ve had enough of pot-bellied thieves taking money that’s not meant for them. Since the ruling party can afford to give each and every household food parcels during election time, why can’t they do that now? Surely this is possible? We’re now being told that only poor families will be considered when this project gets under way. In China, where this virus emanated, each section of that country’s population was supplied with food during the four-month long lockdown, and that’s how they defeated this monster.
