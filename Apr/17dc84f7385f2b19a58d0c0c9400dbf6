THAKI Maake is taking the national lockdown seriously and wants to ensure others do the same. He came up with a way to encourage people to stay home and to educate them about the coronavirus. The 38-year-old from Phalaborwa in Limpopo is using his Beemer to spread the message. “Stay home, lockdown 21 days. Please keep safe distance and Covid-19,” are some of the messages Thaki painted on his car, which he exhibits in shopping centres when he goes to buy essential goods for himself. But he said he mostly parks it outside his gate where people can see it and get the message. When asked what inspired the idea, Thaki said: “I saw that our people are not safe. They are not taking this thing seriously. Some are complying, but others are just walking around the streets.” He said that the spread of coronavirus might be reduced if people stayed in their houses as the number of infections was rising. Thaki claimed he has seen some change since he started spreading the message as people were now staying home. He said this could also be because law enforcement officials were hard in various areas. He said he also shared some of the messages on Facebook and other social media platforms. Car spinner Frank Komane (30) said: “I think it’s a great thing as it makes people see the seriousness of the virus. “When I saw the car, I thought he was playing. But he did well as this corona thing is serious. When the lockdown is finished, we’ll provide masks and gloves at spinning events.”
