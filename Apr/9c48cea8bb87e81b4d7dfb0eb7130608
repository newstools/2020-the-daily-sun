HIGH-flying Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama deserves to win the Absa Premiership Footballer of the Season award. This is the opinion of Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns legend Matthew Booth, looking at the player’s form this season before the league was suspended last month because of coronavirus pandemic. But it won’t be easy for the 29-year-old to lift this award for the second time in his football career as he faces tough competition from the likes of his teammates Eric Mathoho and Samir Nurkovic. Other PSL players who have done well to be in the running comprise Themba Zwane, Andile Jali (Mamelodi Sundowns), Richard Ofori (Maritzburg United), Bradley Grobler (SuperSport United), Peter Shalulile (Highlands Park), Bongi Ntuli (AmaZulu) and Knox Mutizwa (Golden Arrows). “I will go with Manyama to win the PSL Footballer of the Season,” said the 43-year-old Fish Hoek-born Booth. The last time the Tembisa-born star won this award was in 2016-17 season while still playing for Cape Town City under the then coach and Bafana legend, Benni McCarthy. After his impressive season with the Citizens, the Bafana star signed for Turkish outfit Konyaspor in 2017-18 season where one of his teammates was Cameroon and Barcelona legend, Samuel Eto’o. But Manyama’s stay in Turkey did not last long and in 2018, he came back to PSL and signed for Amakhosi. Manyama’s first season with Chiefs was not good as he suffered a long term injury. But this term, he is back to his best form and has netted six league goals, so far. The former Ajax Cape Town star’s fine form this season has helped Chiefs to challenge for the Premiership title. The last time Amakhosi won the PSL title was in 2014-15 season. Chiefs are currently leading the log with 48 points from eight league matches remaining – four points ahead of second placed Downs.
