Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and his Deputy Raymond Zondo have
called on their fellow judicial officers and the broader South African public
to show compassion and generosity to those in need during the country’s
nationwide lockdown. The Chief Justice and the Deputy's call follows the President clarion call to all who can afford to, to
donate a part of their salary in bid to alleviate the financial strain on
millions of households and families. While Judges and Magistrates do not owe
their positions to any central command structure that could take decisions
relating to their salaries on their behalf and instruct them on what sacrifices
to make in relation thereto, the Office of the Chief Justice called for
solidarity. “It is absolutely necessary for all
South Africans who are able to do so to make whatever contribution they can to
the alleviation of these hardships in any way they consider most
effective. “One way of doing so would be to
identify and assist families in dire need of basic necessities or financial
assistance without contravening the lockdown regulations,” the Office of
the Chief Justice said. Other practical steps suggested by the
Office of the Chief Justice include sending money to identified families
through electronic transfer such as eWallet, CashSend etc or, once again in
strict compliance with the lockdown regulations, arranging to meet at a store
with a representative of an identified family and buying basic necessities for
them. “Another way would be to pay money into
the Solidarity Fund from one’s reserves or to commit a percentage of one’s
salary to that fund or a combination of the above, as one’s personal
circumstances may permit,” read the statement.
