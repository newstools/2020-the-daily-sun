The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged beneficiaries to practice social distancing. In the last few days, high volumes of elderly and young people queued at various paying points across the country. Very few had masks and gloves. They told Daily Sun they couldn’t afford protective equipment and pleaded with the government to roll them out for free. In some pay points, trolleys were used to keep a distance between beneficiaries, while others were provided with chairs to remain seated while in the queue, and the chairs were kept apart from each other. But for many others, they lined up very close to each other, with their hands touching one another. Following the coronavirus outbreak and to curb the spread of the virus, Sassa grants were made available for collection earlier than usual. On Monday and Tuesday, the elderly and people living with disabilities received their grants. On Wednesday it was the rest of beneficiaries including social grants. Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said several steps were taken such as queue management to ensure social distancing and reduce congestion. He said: “We decided to use trolleys to ensure social distancing as many indicated that they didn’t know how to keep a 1-metre distance. “We encourage beneficiaries to avoid going to pay points all at the same time as this will lead to overcrowding,” said Letsatsi. On Thursday, few more people were spotted in various paying points collecting their grants. However, the long queues had reduced.
