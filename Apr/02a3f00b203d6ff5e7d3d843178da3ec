The Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation has called on municipalities to refrain from cutting water supply during the lockdown. On Sunday, Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Lindiwe Sisulu said the practice would hamper the government’s effort of fighting the spread of Coronavirus. In a statement, the minister said they had received various complaints about municipalities who had cut off the water supply to residents for no apparent reason. “I appeal to municipalities who are guilty of this practice to switch on the water supply immediately. This is not the time to be punishing our people for failing to pay their water bills. We must all rally around the government’s call to wash our hands frequently in order for us to defeat the scourge of COVID-19,” the minister said.
