JUDITH Mudau is making Mzansi proud in China. The singer of Maria le Maria fame has resumed her show in Sichuan after a two-month lockdown. On the day the lockdown was lifted in China a few weeks ago, Judith sang three new ballads in Chinese at the Music House Wuhou High Tech Zone, as well as a number of covers. Judith told Daily Sun she was happy to be back on stage doing what she loved most. “My ability has been boosted by my soul and gospel background singing at a family church,” she said. When asked about incidents of black people being denied access to malls in China, she said these happened at the city which is a two-hour flight away from where she lived. “My work was not affected by the lockdown since my company Music House took care of everything. They made sure I had food and vitamins and kept me informed,” she said. Born 35 years ago in Kutama Village in Limpopo, Judith has always been a singer. Her father Elias Mudau was a pastor and she and her twin sister Edith sang gospel jazz songs. Judith has been in China since 2017 and only comes home for holidays. She said she was in China because she loved travelling and exploring the world. “I was musically well received. They like me and I like them too. Where I am liked, I stay,” said Judith, who also works as a music teacher at different schools. Judith was a member of Chicco Twala’s concept group Maria le Maria, which had a number of hits in Mzansi. She was also one of the lead singers in Duma Ka Ndlovu’s play The Journey, and travelled to Switzerland with the show in 2004.
