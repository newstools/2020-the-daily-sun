Alcohol and
cigarette addicts are finding it difficult to cope during the lockdown. They said
even local spaza shops don’t have cigarettes as they want to comply with the
lockdown regulations. Speaking to
the Sun Team, Mandla Ndubane (38) and his friend Selby Mathebula (30) from
Thulamahashe said it’s getting difficult every day. “A few days
ago, we relied on the local taverns who were still operating despite the rules,
but now that the police have closed down those shebeens and spaza shops, we are
in trouble,” they said. "We
are suffering because of the lockdown. All shops are dry, and taverns are also
closed. If only the President can allow us to smoke, that would be better.” On Thursday
law enforcement authorities were still patrolling in the villages to inspect if
businesses are complying with the rules. Daily Sun
also visited some of the spaza shops and big supermarkets and many shelves were
empty, only notices to show that no cigarettes and alcohol will be sold. MEC for
finance, economic development, and tourism, Pat Ngomane said it should be noted
that all businesses permitted and licensed to sell essential goods and services
during the lockdown period are prohibited from selling any other goods. "The
sale of liquor as well as gambling, betting activities are strictly prohibited
during this period. To this end, the police continue to monitor and ensure
compliance with the regulations. I must stress that hawkers and spaza shops
without valid business operating permits, operating in our townships and rural
areas are already and will unfortunately not be allowed to operate during this
period. "They
must further ensure there's enough space in their premises to allow for at
least one square metre for each customer in order to facilitate social
distancing. This is done to curb the spread of Covid- 19,” Ngomane said.
