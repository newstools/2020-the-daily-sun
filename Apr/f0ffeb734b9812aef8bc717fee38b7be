Under new rules announced on Thursday South Africans will be able to call out for emergency repair workers such as electricians and plumbers, for the remainder of the extended lockdown period. The amended regulations govern the 14-day extended lockdown period announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa last week to curb the spread of the coronavirus. This lockdown period will end on April 30. Government has said the economy will then be "incrementally" opened up, meaning that some trades and services would remain prohibited for longer than others.
