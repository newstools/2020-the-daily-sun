THEY sneak out of their houses to beg for water across the street. Residents of Palm Ridge in Ekurhuleni have been begging the municipality for water since 2011. The affected residents told Daily Sun they reported the matter countless times. Getting water from neighbours during the lockdown, however, is a crime. Community leader Jerry Kgodu (43) said: “We’ve engaged the municipality countless times and they keep promising they’ll fix the problem.” Jerry said toilets had become disaster zones. “Some people have to beg neighbours to use a toilet,” he said. Emmanuel Mangole (50) said his neighbours were tired of him always asking for water. “We’ve pleaded with the municipality countless times, but nothing is happening,” he said. Nelisiwe Ngobese (54) said she was tired of pleading for help. “I don’t know what their excuse is for not giving us water,” she said. Lucy Mokhudu (49) said asking for water from her neighbours was a big problem. She said: “These people pay for water, and I ask them to give it to me for free. “It’s really hard and I’d understand if they said no. We all have the right to water.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe promised to talk to the relevant department and to the community leader.
