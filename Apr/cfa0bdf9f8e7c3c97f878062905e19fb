WHEN their mastandi and other tenants didn’t see the family for days, everyone assumed it was because of the lockdown. However, no one could prepare themselves for the horror they found when someone finally went to the family’s home.  A two-year-old was found sitting next to the decomposing bodies of her parents and six-year-old sister in their home in Winnie Mandela, Ekurhuleni, on Friday. The gruesome discovery was made by a friend of the father who was fetching him for a tiling job. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha of Tembisa Police Station said the bodies of the little girl, her 43-year-old father and 33-year-old mum were found lying near food they had been eating. Cops are running tests to see whether they had been poisoned. Spaza trip ends in death for teen! The father’s twin brother said the last time he spoke to him was on Monday. “He told me on WhatsApp that they were okay. I think the incident must have occurred the same night,” he said. The man who found the bodies said he saw them after he peeped through the window because no one was answering the door. The mastandi told Daily Sun she last saw the couple on 25 March. “We thought they were indoors because of the lockdown. We were shocked when we were called to see the bodies,” she said. “A tenant next door said he heard the toddler crying and the television playing but he didn’t think anything was wrong.” Ralidzivha said inquest dockets were opened and cops were investigating.
