First it was Nigerian charismatic pastor, televangelist and philanthropist TB
Joshua who prophesised that Coronavirus will go away on 27 March. He then said that he was ‘misled by the holy spirit’ after his prophesy
turned out not to be the truth. HOLY SPIRIT MISLED ME - TB JOSHUA! Now local prophet Sibusiso Makamu from Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga says if the
nation prays for seven minutes tonight (Thursday 9 April) at 9pm, God will heal
the land and the virus will go away. The founder of Burning Fire Ministries told Daily Sun that he saw a vision in the
early hours of Wednesday morning where God revealed Himself to tell the people
of Mzansi to pray so that the virus can go away. Narrating his vision to the Sun Team, Makamu said as he began to pray in the
early hours of the morning asking God for mercy to protect Mzansi, he fell down
after feeling dizzy. “I saw myself out of my body. I saw a big animal coming and God said this is a
beast that wants to take over and destroy Mzansi. As I opened my eyes, I saw a
light shining, an angel holding a long sword and fighting the beast and God
said to me I must tell people of Mzansi to pray on Thursday 9 April at 9pm for
only seven minutes and that He will hear their prayers and heal their land,” he
said. He said the message was clear that people should not doubt that their prayers
will be a solution to end the virus that is killing people. Makamu, who said he started fasting and praying two days before Presidents
Cyril Ramaphosa could announce the lockdown, said the vision was clearly
talking about the virus and what is going on around the country. “People are fighting, schools are being destroyed and some people are losing
their jobs but if we pray tonight at the exact time, God will answer our
prayers,” he said. A voice recording has been circulating on social media where Makamu can be
heard explaining his vision and urging people to pray.
