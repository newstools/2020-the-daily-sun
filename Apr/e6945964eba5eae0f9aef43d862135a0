MORE than 2000 food parcels worth R1. 1 million were
donated to the Department of Social Development by Sibanye Stillwater on
Tuesday in Rustenburg in the North West. The donations are
part of the mine's social relief program that is aimed at tackling the novel
COVID-19 virus pandemic. Food parcels
included staple items such as maize meal, rice, samp, sugar and other necessary
items. Sibanye
Stillwater Senior Vice President Thabisile Phumo said the donations are a
response to a national call. She said the
donations are part of a rollout program from the mine worth millions. "As Sibanye
Stillwater this is just the first of the roll our R4 million program we are rolling
out across all our operations. But for this area we are bringing a donation of
about R1.1 million worth of food parcels. "In addition
to that, we have been working with our local municipalities and have donated
mattresses, blanketsâ€¦and will be donating water tanks for people to be able to
respond to the needs that are immediate," said Thabisile. As part of
creating hygiene awareness Sibanye has donated close to 10 000 leaflets and
soaps to various communities with the view that people can understand what the
disease is about and the measures they are supposed to take. Thabisile said going forward there will be further
engagements on how schools and learners can be assisted. Accepting the
donations, MEC for Social Development Boitumelo Moiloa said the department
already has areas ready to receive the food parcels. She said the
department does not store food parcels for fun. Moiloa said the
areas were profiled and verified by a team of social workers within the
department.
