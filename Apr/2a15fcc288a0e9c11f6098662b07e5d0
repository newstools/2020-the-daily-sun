THE decision to hire celebrities to champion digital teaching has left teachers and graduates angry. The Basic Education Department hired celebrities starting from the Easter weekend and intended to continue until the end of lockdown. Masibumbane Secondary School teacher Wandile Dlamini (30) from Umbumbulu, south of Durban, was fuming. “We have many qualified teachers in the country that would have made the learning online more exciting and beneficial to the kids,” he said. “Watching unqualified celebrities making mistakes and teaching kids wrong things makes me angrier.” He said in one of the lessons he watched in shock when Mohale Motoung, Somizi’s partner, told kids the word quickly was an adjective instead of an adverb. Graduate Mbali Mkhwanazi (25) from Newcastle, KZN, said she graduated in 2018 but no posts have been advertised. “Celebs will get paid for what they never trained for, yet we have the qualifications but they don’t consider us,” said Mbali. Makhosi Mhlongo (34) from Durban graduated in 2018. He said: “The department has totally demotivated us because they don’t trust us.” Education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the initiative was created by the NPO, Africa Teen Geeks. “The lockdown digital classroom is an out-school project that was put in place to urge learners to continue learning at home. It’s optional and participation is voluntary. Out of the 56 teachers, 54 are qualified.”
