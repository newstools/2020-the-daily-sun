HIGHLANDS Park midfielder Musa Nyatama says it’s difficult to get used to Zoom technology training under lockdown. Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba coach Owen Da Gama introduced the video conferencing sessions in a bid to keep his players physically and mentally fit while the fight against the coronavirus pandemic is on. “We are doing our best to adapt to video sessions,” said Nyatama. “It’s not similar like when you are training on the pitch with teammates. “But as professionals, we should get used to any scenario. “It will benefit us because we will be fit when we resume normal training and the coach won’t do much prior to our first match.” But the 32-year-old former Orlando Pirates player said he misses playing football. “It’s difficult to train at home because some sessions demand of us to kick the ball around the yard, or do the basics of football,” he said. “We are slowly getting used to it, obviously I miss playing at the stadium in front of our fans. But the lockdown has given me the chance to read books and spend more time with my family.” Nyatama said the forced lockdown came at a wrong time when they have been slowly picking up points in the PSL league. Highlands have drawn three times away and lost twice prior to the break. “We have always done well at home and we will pick ourselves up to win our remaining games. We are not happy with our away record and we know what to do. We know the direction we need to take, but this (losing away) has always held us back,” added Nyatama.
