A TERRIBLE
stench caused a butchery at Bara Taxi rank to be shut down on Thursday. The
terrible smell invited law enforcement and health inspectors in one of the busy
butcheries around the taxi rank. Upon
raiding the store authorities discovered that some of the meat products in the
store had long reached their sell-by dates. Hygiene was
not properly practiced and some of the fridges were not working well. At the
back, the meat was carelessly placed on the dirty floor of one of the freezers.
As if that was not enough, the health inspectors also found that the shop
didn’t have the proper paperwork. Meat and
other expired products were removed from the store, and the owner was arrested. The police
and the army were in the area, enforcing the lockdown regulation at one of the
busiest places in Soweto. MEC of
community safety MEC Mazibuko who also was invited by the smell inside the
butchery said. “We were
drawn by smell, and we decided to investigate where the smell was coming from.  We
discovered this Red Bull butchery, it has got all types of meat that had
expired, and some expired on the 6th of April. The
business owner has been arrested, he will go and say hi to the magistrate and
tell his or her side on why he is continuously doing the wrong things. COJ’s John
Nyambi said: “They found that there was an invalid certificate of the
acceptability.  “The guy
has been told in the previous inspection to apply for a proper document, he
didn’t come to our offices.” “We are
closing the business; he cannot trade without a certificate of acceptability.” After Bara
Taxi rank, police proceeded to Dobsonville were the streets were left clean and
few people were arrested after flouting lockdown regulations. One was
arrested for selling items that were not fruit and veg, while another was
nabbed for cutting out slabs of lawn in the field.
