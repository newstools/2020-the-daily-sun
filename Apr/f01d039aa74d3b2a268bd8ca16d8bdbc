THE death of Vinolia 'V-mash' Mashego has sent shockwaves across Mzansi. Daily Sun understands that the 56 year-old was found dead in her home in Mamelodi  this morning by her father. Mashego rose to fame in the early 1990s  as an actress playing Hilda Letlalo on Generations. But it was her iconic presenting skills on Jam Alley that cemented her place in the hearts of millions across Mzansi. Her star dimmed in the 2000s as she disappeared from the limelight,battling personal issues such as depression. She made a brief appearance on Isibaya some years ago and was a host on a Mzansi Magic music show. Her latest venture back in front of her camera was on Moja Love's prank show Bheka Sikubambile. Singer Busiswa praised V-mash for being herself proudly. "The original IT-girl! First black girl I saw on my TV screen being loud & proud & fierce & sassy.
