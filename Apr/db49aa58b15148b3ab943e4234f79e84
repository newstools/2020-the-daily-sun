Doctors posted naked selfies to draw attention to
healthcare workers fighting on the coronavirus frontline without protective
equipment and clothing. The German doctors aim to tell Germany's health ministers
that their calls over several months for more protective gear weren't heard. They said 'when we run out of what little we have, we
look like this', suggesting that going to work without PPE in the current
crisis is like being naked. One GP in the group told Ã„rzteZeitung: 'The nudity is a
symbol of how vulnerable we are without protection.' Members of the group said they felt at risk from
coronavirus and many doctors have repeatedly asked for more kit since the first
cases of the bug in Germany in January. Firms producing the equipment increased the amount they
were producing but still didn't meet demands. Filter masks, goggles, gloves and aprons were frequently
requested by medical practices, clinics and care homes but they say their needs
have barely been met, The Mirror reported. The petition has been signed by more than 1,000 people so
far. At the beginning of April protective face masks destined
for Berlin were allegedly intercepted at Bangkok Airport. They were reportedly diverted to the US, prompting angry
German officials to blast Donald Trump for the move. Berlin's interior minister Andreas Geisel said: 'we
consider that an act of modern piracy.' Yesterday Germany recorded 1,018 new coronavirus cases
which is the smallest jump in the country for more than six weeks. The new infections are the fewest since March 14, when
the figure was last in the hundreds. The mortality rate is 3.7 per cent, which is lower than
Italy, Spain and Britain which have rates of 13.5, 11.2 and 13.6 per cent
respectively. This has allowed Germany to start edging out of lockdown
but experts warned against complacency. Masks on all of Germany's public transport were made
compulsory yesterday, with some states imposing stricter rules and demand them
in shops too.
