MYSTERY surrounds the shooting which took place at an eThekwini railway station on Sunday. Heavily armed suspects stormed the station, opened fire and then escaped. A 23-year-old security guard was injured and has been admitted to hospital, where he is in critical condition after he and his partner were attacked by unknown suspects.But his 35-year-old partner tragically died, after sustaining a gunshot wound to his shoulder. The two guards allegedly were on duty at Thornwood Railway Station when armed men suddenly stormed the station, and shot at them before fleeing. Apparently, the suspects didn’t take anything from the station, so it’s still not clear why the two were attacked. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said charges of murder and attempted murder were being investigated. “A 35-year-old sustained a gunshot wound to the shoulder and was declared dead at the scene. The other victim sustained a gunshot wound to the thigh and was taken to hospital, where he’s receiving medical help. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.” Gwala said the security guard’s identity hasn’t been revealed yet. “Nothing has been reported to be stolen by the suspects.”
