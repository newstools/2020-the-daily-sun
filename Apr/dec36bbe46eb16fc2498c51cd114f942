FORMER Bafana Bafana defender Bongani Khumalo says he donated his full salary "from the bottom of my heart" to buy food parcels for the needy during the coronavirus outbreak. The 33-year-old centre-back has enjoyed an illustrious career, playing for the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Doncaster Rovers as well as Bafana Bafana before heading back to former side SuperSport. Khumalo enjoyed a short spell with Wits before returning to Matsatsantsa, for the third time. In a bid to help those most in need, Khumalo told City Press the reason behind his generosity. He said: "I have decided to donate my full salary to buy food parcels (for the needy) and I am doing this from the bottom of my heart. "I am in a fortunate position to do this and I hope to reach out to 300 families during this difficult time, while also paying homage to Eswatini, where my father was born. "I am doing this in my personal capacity; this is not for personal glory." Khumalo handed out 200 food parcels in Pretoria West last Thursday. -TeamTalk Media
