One of the comedy houses in Mzansi wants to put a smile of your face and make you laugh until your tummy hurts. The V&A Waterfront is lifting somber spirits as people are required to stay home due to the Covid-19 pandemic by live streaming comedy nights on Fridays, featuring heavyweights in the stand-up scene. The show is free, however, you are encouraged to donate â€“ all funds raised will go towards The Justice Desk, a non-profit human rights organisation fighting to equip the vulnerable in their fight for justice and advocacy. On the night, a QR code that appears on the screen will allow you to make donations and your social media comments will appear on the screen.  Take it and Break it.
