The Emirates stadium, home to Premier League side Arsenal is rated among the best footballing stadiums in the world. With beautifully cut grass, which is always watered to perfection, players are always inspired and itching to have a run on this beautiful pitch. Much like the Emirates stadium, a punani needs to be in an immaculate condition for someone to play in it. This means its grass (hair) needs to beautifully cut and must be wet enough for match day. We take a look at what makes a great punani for you to play in:  According to Thought Catalog, a great punani is like the "perfect handshake".
