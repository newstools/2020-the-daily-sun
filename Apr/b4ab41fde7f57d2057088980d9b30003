There was a hive of activity along Dubula Drive in Sharpeville, Vaal on Day 13 of the lockdown. This was the result of a sign at the corner of the street, which read: “Free bread”. Next to the sign was a group of kids waiting patiently for Ramatsomane Tlhophane (35). Ramatsomane has made it his mission to deliver free bread to poor families in Hlalas squatter camp. He has been doing it since the lockdown started. Self-employed Ramatsomane told Daily Sun he had a burning desire to help needy people. “I have always wanted to give my first salary to people who are suffering. But that plan failed because I have a family I am looking after.” Ramatsomane, popularly known as Tsumi, said he used his last R100 to buy bread at the local store and also took a few on credit. “All I could manage was about 20 loaves. I then erected a pallet for delivery. I shared the loaves in two squatter camps,” he said. “I now donate about 200 loaves in these areas and I am proud to do so. “I hope this idea extends to other kasis,” he said. The idea was welcomed by many people, who pledged money, while some donated bread. When the SunTeam arrived in the area, madala Oupa Mokoena was sitting with bread he received the previous day. “I don’t know the man who leaves bread here. But this is a good initiative. We would have had a problem surviving, but we can now spend our days with full stomachs,” he said.
