EMILY Makhubela’s uncle told mourners at her funeral that she was blinded by love, which led to her death. The 27-year-old domestic worker from Arthurstone, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was stabbed to death on Tuesday, allegedly by her ex-lover. She was on her way to work in Dwarsloop when she was attacked at about 6am. Speaking at the funeral over the weekend, Emily’s uncle Paulos Khoza (62) said: “This is the naked truth. We shouldn’t hide that our Emily was blinded by love. That’s why she was killed by her abusive ex-lover who pretended to have an undying love for her.”  Paulos said the alleged killer, who was from Mozambique, had killed their souls.  “We ran from our home country of Mozambique to this country to avoid being killed by Renamo. We were not aware we brought a killer with us. This is a lesson and wake-up call to all, as well as the leadership, to make sure we are safe and protected from the heartless criminals who are given power to kill the innocent and use lawyers to twist judicial systems,” he said. Assistant induna Ernest Ubisi (78) called on the government to review the rules on murder. AYABONGA DIED FOR LOVE! “Where is ubuntu, Mzansi? This is too much. Killers must be jailed forever. They even kill our police with guns in their hands but the government says they must not act,” he said. Mpumalanga ANC Women’s League co-ordinator, Lydia Moroane, said Emily’s death had left a void in the community. “Emily was a brave, humble and loving woman. She died working for her two kids. Men must learn that when the relationship is not working, they should walk away and not kill women.” A man (30) was arrested and will appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court soon.
