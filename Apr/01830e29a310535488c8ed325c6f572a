THE Free State education says their digital learning initiative is getting positive responses from pupils. They also say their seriousness in maintaining their top matric achievement is another goal. Pupils can now be up to date with their studies, thanks to Free State digital learning which was initiated during the lockdown. Education spokesman Howard Ndaba said they have received positive response because the initiative was keeping the pupils up to speed with their lessons during the lockdown. Ndaba said they have partnered with several local radio stations across the province. Ndaba told Daily Sun: "Following the national lockdown, we had to look on how to respond on the challenge and we partnered with seven local radio stations, namely Motheo FM, Mosupatsela, Setsoto, The Rock, CUT, Dihlabeng and QwaQwa FM. We have highly qualified teachers and the lessons are broadcast simultaneously with about three subjects per day. We also use social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The pupils can also interact with our teachers via WhatsApp number 079 024 6768." Ndaba said he was aware that not all the pupils had smartphones to access the Free State Digital Learning.  "We encourage the pupils to listen to the radio stations and those who have access should help those who don't have while maintaining a social distancing. We know that this is not an ideal and it will never replace face to face teaching. We also urge the parents to encourage their children to tune in on the radios to get more learning," said Ndaba.
