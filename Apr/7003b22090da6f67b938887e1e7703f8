Lechwiti General Dealar Owner in Ledig,outside Rustenburg in the North West Geletu Beyene says he and his worker were harassed by the alleged ward councilor. The 32-year-old  told the SunTeam that he was threatened that his shop will be closed, accusing him of using wrong sanitisers. Geletu said a the ward councilor came to his shop accompanied by his team. What they said to them was that they are raiding all the shops and was asked to provide his permit. "I showed them the permit. They demanded that I pay an amount of R200 to keep the shop open because they found one item that was expired." "The following day, a lady, whom was with the councilor the previous day came to my shop again. Surprise, I asked her what was wrong because I showed them all the necessary documents the previous day." "She started yelling at me, apparently I was using a wrong hand sanitiser. I explained that I bought the sanitiser from a pharmacy and it can't be a wrong one. What was off about the whole inspection was that we were been shouted at instead of being addressed like human beings." According to the shop owner what was  shocking was the price at which the sanitisers were selling at. I denied buying because I had already bought sanitisers, and there was no prove of where they bought the sanitiser, he added. "It is sad to me, even though I was smart enough to not fall for this kind of corruption but other shop owners were robbed."
