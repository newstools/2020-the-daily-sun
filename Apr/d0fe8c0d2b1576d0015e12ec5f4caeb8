Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said he was satisfied with the court verdict on Tuesday over the land battle with Abahlali baseMjondolo. The movement had taken the City of eThekwini to the Durban High Court over the recent demolitions in squatter camps around Durban. The movement wanted the court to declare the demolitions unconstitutional, but the court dismissed its application. Kaunda said the city had often urged the movement to stop encouraging and condoning land invasions. He said it was unfortunate that some social groupings were capitalising on the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will unwaveringly clamp down on any unlawful conduct including land invasion,” he said. Kaunda said they had provided shelter to more than 4 000 homeless people around the city. “We have made sure that we meet the needs of all our residents living in informal settlements, hostels and transit camps.” He said shacks that were demolished recently were unoccupied and some were only partially built. “I’m satisfied the court agreed with us. We will eventually restore the dignity of all our residents in informal settlements, whether affiliated to Abahlali or not,” said Kaunda Abahlali president Sbu Zikode said the city had a long history of carrying out violent evictions without court orders. “We’re disappointed by the outcome in the court and worried about what will happen as the lockdown continues,” said Zikode. “Security guards are parading in Ekuphumeleleni squatter camp, celebrating the findings of the court. “People are really scared. They don’t know what will happen. We fear that there will be more violence.”
