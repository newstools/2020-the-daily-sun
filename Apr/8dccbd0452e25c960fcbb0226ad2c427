What comes to mind when you hear the word Jaguar? Do you think a British car maker that was established in 1922 by William Lyons, which in 2008 was brought by an Indian builder called Cans Tata Motors? Or do think of the third biggest wild cat after the tiger and lion? You wouldn't be wrong to think of such, but recently there has been a new phenomenon that has been making a noise in the streets and that is "jaguar". Jaguar is a woman over the age of 50, who seeks to sleep or fall in love with younger men. This is also taken from the cougar concept, which is a woman over the age of 40, who also seeks to sleep or fall in love with younger men. This phenomenon has grown over the years and the reason can be heard in Aliyah's smash hit Age Ain't Nothing But A Number. Older women have now taken the driving seat and also pursued the hunt like jaguars, excuse the pun. Celebrities and politicians have been at the front-line of all of this, and this trend has began to spread globally. Pop singer Madonna(51 then) and her ex boyfriend Jesus Luz had a 28 year gap between them.  Kris Jenner(64), mother of the famous Kardashians, is currently dating 39-year-oldÂ  Corey Gamble. This further proves that indeed the younger they are, the more drive is given to the jaguar woman.  Our infamous politicians are not to be left behind on the action. The president of France, who is one of the youngest presidents in the world, Emmanuel Macron (42) is currently married to 64-year-old Brigitte Macron. This goes to show that jaguars are driven enough enough to land into the presidential suite.  So as this concept begins to grow globally, it begins to address key issues around ageism. With many women becoming more economically emancipated, don't be surprised when a jaguar pulls over and asks you for a spin.
