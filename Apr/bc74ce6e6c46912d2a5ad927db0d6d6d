A family has accused the cops of beating them up in their shack on Saturday night. Senzo Mhlaka (36), Ziyanda Sigweshe (34) and Lindisipho Mhlaka (41) were eating meat at their home in Ramaphosa squatter camp in Philippi, Cape Town, at about 8pm when Ziyanda stepped out to buy bread from a spaza shop.

When Lindisipho and Senzo stepped outside to see what was happening, the cops allegedly barged into the shack and hit them. They accused Lindisipho of carrying a knife, the one he was using to cut meat, and said a cop cut himself while trying to disarm him. They allegedly fired rubber bullets at the three and bust Lindisipho. Ziyanda showed the SunTeam her back, which was covered in sjambok marks. “We were moered for nothing. We apologised but they kept hitting us. They searched our house and didn’t find booze but beat us anyway,” she said.  Senzo said: “When they came in,’ I said, ‘This can’t be happening’. I don’t know if that annoyed them. I don’t know why they beat us.” Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut advised the victims to report the matter to the nearest cop shop or to Ipid. Senzo said they went to the Nyanga cop shop but were told to return today. “We want to make sure those cops pay for what they did,” he said.
