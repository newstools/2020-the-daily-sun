For  the first time ever in the history of Zion Christian Church, there is a zero movement of people on Easter weekend. The Africa's biggest church which was first formed by Engenas Barnabas Lekganyane in 1924, has not host its annual Easter Pilgrimage amid the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in South Africa last month. The crucial decision comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that gatherings of more than 100 people are prohibited as a measure to curb the spread of the virus. As usual the R37 road from Polokwane to Zion City Moria in Boyne should a high visibility of traffic cops deployed to assist in directing the movement of traffic flow, as thousands of vehicles and buses would be struggling to gain entry transportation millions of Masione  into the church.  Throughout the Easter weekend where the church conference will be underway groups of Masione should be seen in the church's, wearing their uniform (Dikhakhi) dancing Mukhukhu. Tents should be erected everywhere in the church's yard for shelter with thousands of cars parked inside and outside affecting a traffic flow throughout the Easter weekend.  A street vendor who has a market stall not far from the church says the postponement of the church's pilgrimage has really affected her business. President Cyril Ramaphosa also came to ZCC Naledi and ZCC Leba last week on Sunday to thank both management of the churches for agreeing to postpone their Easter conferences. Linkie Mothapo (55) said since she started trading at her stall a decade ago it feels like a dream that there is no Moria this Easter to her. "On this day I mostly sell fruits and snack, by the end of the day my stock would have been sold out and went home." She said.
