THE coronavirus has hit the Soul Brothers hard in the pockets. Members of the popular mbaqanga group say they have lost more than R300 000 due to the cancellation of shows. The group had to cancel all shows between the end of last month and the end of next month. Founder Moses Ngwenya told Daily Sun he didn’t know whether they’d recover the lost money. He said they had planned o released their 46th album, Iqiniso, earlier this month but now he didn’t know when it would come out. “This is a hard situation and we don’t blame anyone. We don’t get salaries every month. We rely on our music,” he said. “When the music stops, it means no income. Our members are worried and they always ask me to give them money to buy food. I give them something, although there is no income. We’re at home during this lockdown as we don’t want to lose any member to the coronavirus.” Moses said he told all members to follow precautions and not to take any risks. He said they were planning to do a live DVD recording for the new album after the storm had passed. Moses said the group will tour Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Lesotho this year.
