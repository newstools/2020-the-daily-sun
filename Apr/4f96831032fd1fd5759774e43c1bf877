MANY villages will finally receive water from mobile tankers. This will relieve the panic among residents from the deep rural areas of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga who were worried about their families with the spread of the coronavirus during the lockdown. Bushbuckridge Municipality said the mobile tankers will supply villages such as Dingleydale, Edinburgh, New Forest, Islington, Thulamahashe, Buffelshoek and others. Mayor Sylvia Nxumalo said the tankers will bring relief to residents and will calm the situation after villagers previously protested, demanding water. “We really appreciate the relief funds from national government. This will ensure residents in our 295 villages will be able to practice hygiene measures by washing their hands regularly with soap and water.” Resident Refilwe Seerane said they were happy to get water as this will help them support hygiene. Shelia Sithole said she was grateful the water shortage in the village would be a thing of the past. “We used to spend a week or two without water. We thank national and provincial governments for thinking about the people who live in the rural villages.” Mpumalanga Traditional Affairs MEC Mandla Msibi urged people to guard against vandalism of tankers.
