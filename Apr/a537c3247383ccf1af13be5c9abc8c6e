THREE men were allegedly set alight by angry residents and burnt beyond recognition on Thursday afternoon. According to cops, after the incident near Phomolong squatter camp in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, the bodies were found still smouldering with tyres burning. Captain Kay Makhubele said they were investigating and would look into unconfirmed allegations that the dead men might have been torched over the shooting of another man. Residents said the three men were believed to be involved in the shooting of a man earlier that morning. Some claimed the men were caught red-handed with many stolen goods. A resident said the act was revenge by residents after being terrorised by thugs for a long time. “We’re tired of people taking our stuff we bought with our hard-earned money. “Innocent people are being robbed and killed and it looks like cops are struggling to arrest criminals.” Another resident said they were frustrated with everything in the country and with criminals who wanted to take the little they have. “This will set an example to other criminals who were planning to rob others. People are not afraid to act and protect themselves.” Makhubele asked people who witnessed the incident or have information to come forward. He also urged residents not to take the law into their own hands.
