THE R30 million tender was approved overnight and Cosatu and the DA want to know how it happened. The tender was allegedly awarded to In2IT Technologies, one of the sponsors of Moroka Swallows Football Club, which is owned by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. The tender was advertised a day before lockdown and awarded a day later. Cosatu Gauteng chairman Amos Monyela said the union federation will wait for eGovernment MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko to initiate an investigation. TB JOSHUA: HOLY SPIRIT MISLED ME! But Monyela warned that the investigation shouldn’t be used to drag out the matter and also warned against using lowly officials as scapegoats for looters. He said it was worrying that the MEC was not aware of the tender. “It’s alleged that permission for the deviation was granted by Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams,” he said. The minister was placed on two months’ special leave yesterday after violating lockdown regulations. Monyela welcomed the swift action by Premier David Makhura requesting the Special Investigating Unit to probe and called on the premier and the MEC to suspend the appointment of In2IT Technologies. SIU spokesman Kaizer Kganyago told Daily Sun the unit had sent people to the premier’s office to get the right documents. “A team is working on a proclamation that we’ll send to the president,” he said. TAVERNS HIKE BOOZE PRICES! Kganyago said they’ll then fully investigate. The chairman of the standing committee on public accounts, Sochayile Khanyile, welcomed Makhura’s announcement. Last year, Scopa said it was concerned about the month-to-month contract of the Security Operation Centre, which continued to incur irregular expenditure. The DA’s shadow MEC for finance and eGovernment in Gauteng, Adrian Randall, said the department had spent R104 million on outsourcing cyber security. Randall called on Makhura to investigate whether proper procedures had been followed.
