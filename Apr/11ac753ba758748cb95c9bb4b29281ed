 A
homeless man who allegedly broke into the Hawks' offices in Bellville over the
weekend will remain behind bars as the police probe whether he could be linked
to other burglaries in the same building over the last two years. Brandon
Okkers, 34, appeared in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on Thursday, Hawks
spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase said. "Three
offices were broken into [over the weekend] and an attempt was made to break
open the door of another office. Okkers was arrested on Tuesday and he was
found in possession of some personal items belonging to [Hawks] members,"
Nkwalase said. Other
break-ins "The
investigation is currently focused on linking the suspect to other break-ins in
the same building during the last two years. In all these break-ins, a number
of items ranging from flash drives, hard drives and private personal items of
individual members were taken." No
"major items" were lost during these burglaries, Nkwalase said. "It
is worth noting that no investigations [were] compromised and that there is no
indication that specific information was targeted. The suspect is a homeless
person living nearby." The
case has since been referred to detectives for further investigation, although
the Hawks were also assisting. The
case against Okkers was postponed to 23 April. SOURCE:
