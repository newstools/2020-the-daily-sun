AWARD-WINNING gospel musician Betusile Mcinga has come to the aid of sex workers by assisting in keeping the wolf from the door during the lockdown. The singer, who turned 35 last Sunday, used his birthday to encourage friends and fans on social media to help those suffering as a result of the coronavirus. He managed to get groceries for 20 poor families across the country and shared photos of the donations on his social media pages. Among those who benefited from the outpouring of goodwill were sex workers. One of them was Nonkoliseko Mabaso (37), who has been selling sex for five years. She said her family had been suffering since the start of the lockdown. “My clients are locked down with their partners and wives. Life is tough as selling my body is my only source of income,” she said. “The food parcels came when I was scratching my head, not knowing where the next meal for my family would be coming from.” Betusile said he was touched to hear that sex workers like Nonkoliseko were helped. He said it was not his place to judge people based on the work they do. “There is a verse in the Bible that talks about a woman caught in an adulterous act. Jesus didn’t judge that woman. Instead, he said ‘let he who is not a sinner cast the first stone’. Some of the stories of these people are heartbreaking,” he said.
