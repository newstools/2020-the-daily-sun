NIGERIAN Prophet TB Joshua is once again the talk of the town, with new tactics of ending the coronavirus pandemic. The prophet allegedly went on a 40-day fast at a secret mountain to present the nations to God in prayer to end the virus. HOLY SPIRIT MISLED ME - TB JOSHUA! This is not the first time the Synagogue Church leader has trended on the news regarding the coronavirus. Last month, he predicted the virus would disappear on 27 March, but nothing happened. Many called him out on his claim, but he refused to address their reactions.  Just a month after that, he posted his pictures praying on the mountain against the virus, saying he wouldn’t stop until the virus ended.  A video clip of the prophet crying to God near a large rock and trees was shown on social media.  The prophet can be heard praying: “In the name of Jesus, we present the nations, the world at large to You, Lord. Forgive them their iniquities. Forgive them their wrongs. Forgive them their sins.” He was praying with his face pressed against the rock. But many people called this another theatrical performance. They said he was doing it for publicity after his false claims that the virus would be gone by March.
