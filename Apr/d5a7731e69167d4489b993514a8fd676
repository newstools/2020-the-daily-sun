Since then Tira has spoken up for himself and said he doesn’t have anything against TNS. “I love that boy. He's talented, is one of the best producers in Durban, and is doing well for himself.” “I supported him when he started his record label. He wanted some advice here and there and I helped him. I gave him a slot on Fact Durban Rocks, where he performed on live TV. I’ve got nothing but love for that boy,” he said.

Guys, it must end.” “This thing that is currently happening to TNS is not good at all, and I also don’t like it, but I think TNS should come out and explain what the problem is and name people that are responsible so that the issue can be resolved. Please don't involve my name in things I'm not involved in,” he said. The star ends the video by thanking everyone who defended him on social media when he was being accused of bullying TNS.
