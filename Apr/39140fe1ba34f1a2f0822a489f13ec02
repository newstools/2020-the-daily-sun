THERE is more bad news for smokers and drinkers as level 4 lockdown starts this Friday.  It seems Mzansi;s government is still cracking the whip as it fights the spread of the corona virus.  Dlamini-Zuma said more than 2000 people opposed the sale of cigarettes.  It will be more of a wait until hairdressers and barbershops will be opened too.  "One of the things that came out strongly in the public comments was for hairdressers to open. "We heard you but we can't allow it at this point",she added.  "Last week the president announced that SA would be moving to Level 4 lockdown. The lockdown will not be lifted. SA is following a risk adjusted approach to ease the lockdown.Â We are still encouraging people who can work from home to do so", she added.  Dlamini-Zuma says there were over 70 000 submissions to the proposals put forth by the government. "It was a good response".
