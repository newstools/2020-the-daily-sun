SAFTU general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi has tested
positive for the Coronavirus. Vavi broke the news of his results through a WhatsApp
group but did not reveal when he got tested or why he did the test in the first
place. “Gosh comrades, on the day I feel much better, the lab
called to say I have tested positive for the coronavirus. It’s mild but need self-isolation
at home. It will run it out, steam it out and just relax and observe all the
rules,” said Vavi. This is a developing story.
