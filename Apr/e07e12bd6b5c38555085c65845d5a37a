The Mpumalanga ANC councillor who was arrested for selling fake permits in Hendrina, has been suspended. The 35-year-old was suspended with immediate effect by the speaker of the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, Andries Mabena. Daily Sun has learnt that it was not the first time the councillor was arrested in connection with the same charges. It is reported that on the 9 April, officials from the municipality went to Hendrina to do a daily patrol with law enforcement authorities and one shop owner produced a fraudulent operational permit that was allegedly issued by the councillor in question. The shop owner alleged that he paid an amount of R300 to obtain his permit while some paid R2000. The councillor was arrested by the police on the same day and was released on verbal warning but after his release he went back to issuing fraudulent permits again and he was rearrested on Friday (10 April). ANC Nkangala regional chairperson, Sello Matshoga said the ANC welcomes the decision of the speaker to suspend the said councillor with immediate effect and the matter should be referred to the Rules and Ethics Committee for investigation and processing. "The ANC has declared fraud and corruption as an enemy to our national democratic revolution and must be dealt with decisively. The councillor concerned has breached the lockdown regulations and as such we appreciate the action taken by the police,” said Matshoga. He said going forward, the municipality will apply necessary consequence management to the councillor.“The ANC once again appeals to everyone in the region to abide by the lockdown regulations in order to save lives," he said. The Councillor is expected to make his first court appearance at the Hendrina Magistrates Court on Tuesday (14 April).
