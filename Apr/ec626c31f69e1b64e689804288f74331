THE North Gauteng High Court has overturned the decision to place the City of Tshwane under administration. The application challenging Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s decision was brought forward by the DA last month. This after Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile singled out several challenges, which led to the government placing the city under administration. MBORO WILL HELP BURY ACTOR! The court yesterday found that the decision was unlawful and ruled in the DA’s favour. Costs were awarded in the DA’s favour. “Interference from one sphere of government in another sphere, as we have here, is seen as most intrusive and can only be resorted to in exceptional circumstances,” said the court. The court ordered Tshwane’s ANC and EFF councillors, who kept breaking quorum effectively making council ungovernable, to attend council meetings when the lockdown ended. Referring to Maile, the DA’s Cilliers Brink said:  it showed that Maile didn’t even pretend to understand his statutory duties as Cogta MEC.“Not for the first time he has abused his powers, gambled with taxpayers’ money and lost. Time to let him go.” SINGER LOSES TRIPLETS! The Gauteng Executive Council said in a statement it respected the judgment. Together with its legal team, it would study the judgment and decide on the next move. “We reiterate our full confidence in the judiciary of the Republic of South Africa,” read the statement.
