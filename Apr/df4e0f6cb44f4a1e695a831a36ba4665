Police Minister Bheki Cele has banned alcohol sales in the country. Alcohol and tobacco sales have been temporarily banned in South Africa during the 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country. In an interview with Daily Sun's sister publication City Press, Cele suggested that alcohol sales be shut down even after the lockdown. “My first prize would be that we shut down alcohol, but I know we cannot do that. Nothing tells me that taking alcohol will make life easier," he said during the interview.  “For South Africa, alcohol has not been the only issue when it comes to regulations relating to the COVID-19 coronavirus. Murder has gone down in South Africa. Even in the butcher of the republic, the Western Cape, murder numbers have really gone down. The impact of the reduction of alcohol has had an impact on ordinary crime, especially violent crime.” said the cop boss.
