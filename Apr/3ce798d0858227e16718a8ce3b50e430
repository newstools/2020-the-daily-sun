BOXING South Africa has promised to give fighters who missed the 31 March final licence renewal deadline another opportunity to apply. The local boxing governing body’s deadline for early licence was 28 February, with the final licensing being the last day of March. However, the last lap of their licensing season was interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, which saw the boxing authority close shop after the call from President Cyril Ramaphosa for a national lockdown to stop the spread of the epidemic. Chief operations officer Cindy Nkomo said all the fighters who did not meet Boxing SA’s deadline would be given exemption to do so once everything returns to normal. “They wanted to renew their licences, but because of the travelling restrictions they couldn’t, which is not their fault,” said Nkomo. Mzansi’s boxing regulatory body, which had 700 boxers on their books in the previous calendar year, has noticed that most of their licensees were not able to renew their licences in the last week of March. “We do not have the statistics of who renewed and who did not, because the licensing period had not lapsed when the coronavirus broke out,” she said. “However, we noted the majority of our licensees don’t seem to have renewed their licences in that last week of March. “And for that reason, as soon as we resume with the normal run of the business post the coronavirus outbreak situation. We will issue a statement to outline a window of opportunity to either apply or renew licences,” she said. Among those who failed to meet the final renewal deadline due to Covid-19 was seasoned campaigner Prince “Demon” Dlomo. Boxing SA has employed a remote work plan due to Covid-19, to ensure all the boxing stakeholders continue to be serviced while the national office is closed. Boxing, just many other sporting codes, is also suffering due to the deadly virus.
