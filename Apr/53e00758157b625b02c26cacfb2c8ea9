MEALIE meal, cooking oil and tinned food bags are items that usually make up food parcels. But a Facebook post recently suggested a cooler box filled with beer would accompany food parcels. The photo of the cooler box was posted by a municipal official from the Collins Chabane Municipality in Limpopo. ALSO READ:FAKE SOLDIERS AND FAKE COPS BUST! The photo, posted to the municipality’s Facebook page, was accompanied by an announcement that the mayor will distribute food parcels in Kurhuleni Village on Saturday. The post was later removed, but people asked why a cooler box filled with beers was being referred to as a food parcel. The official, reportedly in the municipality’s communications department, is in hot water. Msengi Mnisi of Sanco in the Collins Chabane sub-region was shocked. He said: “We condemn the disturbing behaviour showed by the municipal communications unit. To show more disregard for the people, the individual administering the page claimed the account was ‘hacked’. If indeed the account was hacked, why did the second post have the same caption as the first one?” He called on the municipality to investigate, and whoever was responsible to be suspended. Municipal spokesman Isaac Nukeri said: “The post created the wrong impression that beers will be distributed as food parcels. “Such low calibre doesn’t accord with the high standard of professional ethics expected to be promoted by municipal employees. “We promise that firm, decisive action is being taken against the employee. It’s not the first time that particular employee mistakenly posted wrong things to the municipality page. “It really embarrassed management and he was confronted. He’ll be called to a disciplinary hearing today.” Mayor Moses Maluleke had met with a local businessman on Saturday to receive parcels. “Procedure is that the mayor first receives food parcels and gives them to a committee which will work with a councillor to distribute the food to identified disadvantaged families.”
