We’ve read that bandits doing time at Mdantsane Prison in the Eastern Cape drink and party and have cellphones. WATCH: AMABANTINT LIVING LARGE!I I don’t understand why Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola only blames the jailbirds for this. It’s the prison warders who must carry the blame. Smuggling cellphones into jail can’t happen unless a warder allows it. Instead of punishing prisoners, it’s the warders that must be investigated. The cellphones didn’t fall from the sky but came through the gates where everybody is searched. Fire the warders or transfer them, Lamola! Ordinarily, visitors are instructed to leave cellphones and guns at the gate. Is Mdantsane Prison exempt from such rules? And how did the cellphones get in? Lamola, don’t only punish the bandits but your own warders as well. It’s time for corrupt warders to take their work seriously and stop messing around with bandits. Who knows? Maybe they were offered bribes. Letter by Edward Phofa, from Katlehong
