Founder of the People's Dialogue Herman Mashaba says Gauteng metros remain silent on their strategies to deal with the financial, economic and health impact of the pandemic. Mashaba said it was clear that Gauteng is going to be the epicentre of COVID-19 infections as it is the most populated province and has the most informal settlements. “The task of funding the infrastructure to quarantine infected people currently lies with municipalities. Experts are advising that the costs per metro could run into the billions of rands if said facilities will be built at the specification required. "Without these facilities, our ability to save the lives of those to be infected will be seriously hindered as will be the ability to contain the spread of the virus, and yet there is no communication about these plans,” he said in a statement.

Despite this, Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni remain silent on their plans to capitalise on their primary healthcare infrastructure to combat the spread of COVID-19,” he said. The self-acclaimed businessman said it was not a secret that Gauteng metros are facing a financial disaster. “Residents of these metros remain in the dark as to what tariffs are proposed for the next financial year, and whether the rumours of steep increases in the face of limited national funding for the response to COVID-19 are true,” he added. Mashaba said he will be engaging Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni demanding a clear public communication with regards to their plans to roll out and fund quarantine facilities for the anticipated rise in COVID-19 infections.
