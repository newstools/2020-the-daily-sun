JUST hours after illegal connections were disconnected, izinyoka were back. Some say the root cause is poverty while others say it’s because of greed or the lockdown. But cattle herders in Makau, North West, are gatvol as the situation is putting their livestock at risk. Herder Sediadia Lebao said he was walking with his employer’s cows on Tuesday when they suddenly dropped to the ground. “They were shocked. I saved most of them but one died on the spot,” he said. Sediadia said he had to pull the cows to safety with a rope so he wouldn’t get electrocuted. Cattle owner Charles Senokwane (70) said he was devastated as the dead cow was pregnant. “This is dangerous and can kill anyone. Kids are in danger because they might be killed while playing around here.” Charles said action needed to be taken against izinyoka as there were cables everywhere. “These people need to get electricity so this stops.” Charles said he wanted either the izinyoka or the government to compensate him for his loss. He said other animals had also been killed in the area. “This is my first incident, but there are other owners who have also lost animals.” SPCA inspector Mishack Matlou said he was very concerned about the community. “These things need to be reported to Eskom so they can remove the cables,” he said. Matlou said the SPCA would take action against izinyoka. “We’re going to contact Eskom so they can remove the cables because more animals could be killed. Last year, we lost five animals in Klipgat to the same situation. We called Eskom and they took care of the situation,” he said.
