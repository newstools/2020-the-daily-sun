 THE number of coronavirus infections in Mzansi prisons continues to rise! On Monday, the Department of Correctional Services announced it had recorded 11 new positive cases. This comes after 10 prison officials and one inmate tested positive at Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Tshwane. Correctional services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said the prison was being monitored closely as positive cases involving remanded detainees were now at two. “Mass screening and testing has assisted to this effect as the spread can now be contained and prevented from spreading to other sections,” said Nxumalo. He said positive cases for officials in Eastern Cape were now at 35, while inmates were 56 with one recovery. “In the Western Cape, we have 31 officials who tested positive and one inmate,” he said. Nxumalo said containment and treating were under way in the Western Cape as positive cases continued to increase. The increase of the positive cases took the total number up to 129. Nxumalo also dismissed media claims that prisoners were released due to the virus. This came after several prisoners embarked on a protest to demand early release from prison. Nxumalo called on inmates not to cause chaos as it would not help anyone. “The state will not simply open the gates for inmates to walk out. Such will be catastrophic for the country. “Offenders have been removed from society for a reason. Thus, releasing them back into society has to be done properly, having been convinced they’re ready to reintegrate,” he said.
