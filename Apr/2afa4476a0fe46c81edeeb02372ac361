ZAMA Gebula has never set foot in a classroom. This is because the 13-year-old from Block 8 in Philippi, Browns Farm in Cape Town spent most of his time in hospital. His father Mbulelo Ngalimani (50) said Zama’s he has been raising his son alone since he was only a month old. He said his son had a medical condition and he was scared to have him go to school, where he would not receive care. However, Zama has had several operations and no longer has problems. Mbulelo said although he wanted his child to go to school, he felt it was too late for him to start grade R, so he should learn some practical skills. “I want him to be a builder, but he can choose what he wants. I know it will not be hard for him to get any skills because he is a clever boy,” he said. Zama said he wanted to go to school and would like to be a driver one day. Western Cape Education spokeswoman Kerry Mauchline said Zama could be helped. “The child would need to be assessed to determine what grade he should attend. Many factors would need to be taken into account, including available resources in schools that are nearby. “Once we have the details of the child, we can ask our special needs directorate to assist the parent with determining these needs,” said Mauchline.
