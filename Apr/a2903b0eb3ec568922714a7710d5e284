A funeral service of Hosi Muhlava II of the Nkuna tribe
was held at the Palace in Muhlava village outside Tzaneen on Saturday. About 50 people were allowed to attend the funeral in
line with Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Amongst the dignitaries who attendance,  were Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha, Minister
of Finance Tito Mboweni, MEC for Coghsta Baiskop Makamu and the chairman of the
Limpopo Traditional House Kgoshi Dikgale. The Nkuna's acting chief, Charles Muhlava, announced for
the first time at the service that Hosi Muhlava II was already buried.  Hosi Muhlava was buried secretly by family members during
the night, a few days ago, at Ezekhaya Royal Cemetery where his grandfather Hosi
Muhlava I and his father Oubaas Muhlava were buried many years ago. Premier Stan Mathabatha said Hosi Muhlava II played a
role in developing his tribe for years and fought for the rights of his people
and to make sure land is returned to its rightful owners. Kgoshi Dikgale told mourners, "We, together, formed
the House of Traditional leaders in Limpopo in 1997 which was against
tribalism.  This hero promoted
togetherness amongst tribes and clans.”  One of the people who were asked to pay tribute during
the week, Freddy Rikhotso, explained how fearless Hosi Muhlava II when he was
still the Minister of Health and Speaker of Parliament during Gazankulu
Homeland and how he exposed disturbing corruption at the time. Hosi Muhlava II died while Rikhotso was about to publish
his life story book which Hosi Muhlava himself partly edited.
