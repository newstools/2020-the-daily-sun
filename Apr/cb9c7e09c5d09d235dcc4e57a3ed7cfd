Renowned musos Danny K and Kabelo Mabalane have taken the bull by the horns in the fight against the coronavirus in Mzansi. The duo are in a campaign to raise funds to secure protective material for health workers on the front-line against the pandemic. “There is a crying need for those who are protecting us - our frontline heroes. Battling valiantly against Covid-19 our healthcare sector needs our support right now as the supply of masks dwindles. It is getting desperate. Here at Shout SA we have a voice, why not use it to shout out to our fellow countrymen to help secure more masks?” he said. They launched a website which people can pledge, www.shout4maks.co.za that started operating on Friday, the duo hopes to collect as much as possible. Aside from being incredibly generous with this donation SMD (at a time where inflating mask prices and profiteering is the norm) decided to supply @shoutsa with masks at ZERO mark up! An incredible gesture. ~ As our main partner on SHOUT 4 MASKS we are indebted to them and their generosity. Remember their name - a GIANT among us. ~ Donate now.

For both patients and our vulnerable communities, I am relieved that we are able to spread a protective front for both,” said Kabelo.
