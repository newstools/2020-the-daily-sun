Waya Waya Movement leader Lucas Mtsweni has joined other Good Samaritans who are handing out bread to locals who are in need. Mtsweni said he saw a need and came up with a plan to provide bread to various communities of Phola near Ogies in Mpumalanga. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mtsweni said it is difficult during this period as many families are unemployed and depend on odd jobs to put bread on table. “We don’t want people to be locked up while on the other hand they are starving. We hope businesspeople will come in support of this project that I just started today so that we are able to reach a larger number,” he said. He said so far, they have distributed bread to almost 100 people in one section.“What I am doing is not easy because I have to approach as many people as I can including ordinary individuals to come on board and assist.”He said the country is faced with a huge challenge of ensuring that people don’t starve during this time. “Last week some food parcels were also organised and we were able to feed families especially those who are vulnerable and those who only depend on social grants,” said Mtsweni. One of the recipients Thandeka Nkosi said this was a good initiative as children can have tea with bread in the morning.“We are happy about receiving bread as many shops that we normally buy from are closed and we cannot afford to travel to town just to buy bread,” she said.
