PUBLIC transport has been declared the biggest and fastest spreader of Covid-19. According to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, public transport isn’t supposed to operate at all, but essential services workers needed to be at work. He said he was trying to avoid a war at all costs this wasn’t about making money, but saving people’s lives. “We understand and know that the taxi industry is not subsidised by government like other businesses, but we are looking into that,” he said. Mbalula explained that operating times will go back to lockdown regulations after Friday. “As stipulated before, in the morning, taxis will start at 5am to 9am and resume at 4pm to 8pm. Drivers should not be confused by the extra hour given to them in the evening, it’s just for them to wrap up and go home. No taxi should be in the street after 9pm and we are not joking,” said Mbalula. He stressed the importance of sanitising passengers.“Each passenger should be sanitised by the driver or queue marshall. If a taxi is a full load, all passengers should be wearing masks and we will see how we can help in getting these essentials. Otherwise the driver and his passengers will be in trouble,” said Mbalula.  He said all law enforcers were briefed with the changes taking place to make sure everyone worked in harmony. Meanwhile, Uber said in accordance with the updated measures announced by Mbalula yesterday, transport services have been granted an additional hour of operation. “Uber will now operate daily across South Africa between 5am to 10am (extended) and 4pm to 8pm during the lockdown for permitted travel only. We remain in close contact with local public health authorities and will continue to follow their guidance to help prevent the spread of the Covid-19. The health and safety of our community comes first and we will do our best to support drivers, our community and essential staff during these unprecedented times,” said Uber spokeswoman Monique Thompson.
