  Ten of the
22 people who had contracted the Coronavirus in the North West have fully
recovered from the virus. Health MEC
in the province Madoda Sambatha said even though there was no cure yet, the
province was happy that those who tested positive were no longer showing
symptoms. “We are
treating symptoms. If you are screened positive and you are symptomatic, you
are quarantined in a government facility and if you are tested positive then
you go for isolation in a hospital,” he said. Sambatha
said the province has ten recoveries and most of the cases were not hospital
cases. “Most of
them were mild cases and practically two of the cases were not in the
province,” he said. Sambatha
said on the list there was a repatriated German who tested in Potchefstroom and
had went back to Germany. He said the other one was tested in Mahikeng but
stays in Pretoria. Congratulating
the Covid-19 command team premier Job Mokgoro said he was happy about the progress. “I am
encouraged by the approach, the culture, the attitude that our leaders are
displaying. “It shows
the seriousness of this matter is something that is well understood,” he said. He said the
government was engaging better and was more visible. “Because of
the pressures brought about by the pandemic we are more active, visible, and
communities have expressed this,” Mokgoro said.
