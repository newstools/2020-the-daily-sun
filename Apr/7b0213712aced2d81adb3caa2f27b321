Dear MizzB I’m 28, openly gay, very beautiful, independent and ambitious – and I’m studying business management. While I’ve been single for four years, struggling to meet my soul mate, all my friends are in serious relationships or engaged. Every day I meet hunks and charmers, but the next day they disappear or I get irritated by their lies. Am I the problem, or am I looking in the wrong places? )   Worried Dear Worried It’s natural to want certain elements in your partner, but it’s not easy to find someone set on making things work. Know exactly what you want and make sure you take your time before committing. Be open and ask potential partners about their expectations. Identifying this at the beginning will prevent misunderstanding. To be single is not a bad thing. Find out what makes you tick.
