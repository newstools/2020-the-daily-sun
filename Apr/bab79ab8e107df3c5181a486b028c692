Make-up sets are getting a much-needed rest and our skin is finally getting to breathe because of the lockdown. Being home 24/7 means you now have time to start that skin care routine and give your skin that glow you have always wanted. But some ladies are still wearing make-up, maybe because they might need to make a social media post for lockdown challenges or want to look good while going out to get essentials. Celebrities have also been coming out and posting their bare faces and we must say, we love their glowing skin. Here are some celebrities who are going bare-faced during lockdown: Hey babes! While we’re all trying to stay safe at home, let’s #DoTheLifebuoy challenge. Get The Lifebuoy, Do The Lifebuoy and show off your dance moves by posting and challenging one of your friends to keep the momentum going while raising awareness. I’m challenging @Olwe2Lesh to pass it on, show me your moves! #DoTheLifebuoy #LifebuoyZA #Handwashing A post shared by  ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Mar 26, 2020 at 3:56am PDT  Smile. Everything is going to be alright. ?????? #LockdownSelfies #OwnYourThrone??

Hope you have a friend or family member to reach out to when you feel alone while social distancing. ?? ?? I’m appreciative of our online communities keeping us sane, entertained and up to date with the latest news and updates from the globe! Excited to be working on a new project and to have work opportunities that allow me to work from home ????? ?? ?? I’m also taking this time to relax, to reconnect with self, to read, to take long baths and to just do nothing as well! ?? ?? Hope you’re ok, safe and at home ?? Please take extra care when stepping outside for necessities. A post shared by  P E A R L ??
