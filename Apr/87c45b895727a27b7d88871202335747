KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango is calling for people to stand together during this dark time facing the country. On Monday, he urged people to unite in fighting the coronavirus in order for the lockdown to be lifted soon. Mncwango said residents needed to listen and obey all regulations announced by the government. He also urged people to understand that cops and soldiers were not being sent to abuse them but to protect them by making sure they adhered to safety regulations. “It’s exciting to see that the majority of people are following the regulations accordingly and putting their safety and that of their families first. “But it concerns us to to see there are some who’re not following the regulations,” he said. Mncwango said the pandemic is very serious, so when government was trying to save this country, the least people could do was to meet it halfway. He said dealing with this needed everyone to work together, regardless of which political parties they belong to. “The regulations were placed to help curb the spread of this virus. People should stop trying to dodge the soldiers and cops, because all the government is doing is to save their lives. If we don’t follow the measures, the lockdown will be extended.” Resident Philile Gwala (37) said she wished people would just listen and stay home so everything would go back to normal soon. “I’m worried that people think they’re doing this for government. It’s not for government but for their own health,” she said. Another resident, Sandile Khumalo (42), said he was worried that if people continued to behave in this way, more people would lose their jobs as many companies would shut down. “If this lockdown continues for months, companies will close because they won’t be making any money to pay their staff. Let’s listen to government. They’re trying to save us,” said Sandile.
