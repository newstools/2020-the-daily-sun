MOST elderly people in rural areas don’t have access to the news as they don’t have electricity or smart phones and often are the last to learn anything. This was the case with the coronavirus pandemic, so Ulundi Municipality used the Sassa payout days to inform the elderly about it. Mayor Wilson Ntshangase was accompanied by IFP Women’s Brigade leader Phumzile Buthelezi during the awareness campaign. When Daily Sun asked her about the virus, gogo Mavis Sibiya (67) said she didn’t know what it was and had heard people talk about it in the taxi. “I came to get my money and buy food. This was the first time I heard about this virus. I’ll practise what they told us, but am worried where I’ll get money to buy sanitisers and where we will get water to wash our hands.” Madala Zeblon Mthembu (70) said all he wanted was his pension to buy food and go back home as the virus could get him. “I didn’t know what it was before they told us about the virus. I now know and need to lock myself in my house. I won’t attend any gatherings. I don’t want to die as they say we are at risk of getting it because of our age and immune system,” he said. Ntshangase said the aim was to reach out to those with little knowledge about the virus. “We taught them about it and the importance of going for check-ups when they see symptoms. We also taught them how they can protect themselves and what they should be practising at home,” he said.
