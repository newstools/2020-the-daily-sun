IT powers many AUDI cars, and the TFSI engine is available in a 4-cylinder, 6-cylinder and a beast of a V8. The TFSI badge stands for Turbo Fuel Stratified Injection (TFSI) which is the world's first turbocharged direct-injection engine. The system produces higher power output and optimum engine response while providing greater fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The TFSI technology allows for a 15% better fuel efficiency, while another advantage is the ability of the cylinder walls to be cooled down by the gas evaporation when introduced directly in the cylinder chambers. The result is a higher compression ratio, which induces a higher power output, with the addition of a turbo or a supercharger, the power gain will be even better.
