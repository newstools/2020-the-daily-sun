The South African Football Association (SAFA) has made the National Technical Centre available as a quarantine site in the help to curb the spread of Covid-19. This news comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a two-week extension to the 21-day lockdown. As of Friday morning the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country stands at 1 934 with 18 deaths. A statement from SAFA spokesperson Dominic Chimhavi read: "As SAFA we have written to both provincial and national governments to offer the SAFA National Technical Centre as quarantine site. "The facility is currently closed to the public because of this coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown that was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. We have over 100 rooms and beds that could be used as a site for quarantine. "Obviously there is not much of a need for more beds now but in the event that numbers start increasing and there is an urgent need for beds the National Technical Centre is available for government. "This is our way to play our role and support our government during this difficult time. As SAFA we also want to send out a message to people out there to stay at home because we have to contain this virus."
