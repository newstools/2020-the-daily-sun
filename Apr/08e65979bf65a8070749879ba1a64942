The South
African Police Service has noted with concern a photograph of two females, in
SAPS uniform, each holding what appears to be a bottle of beer and posing next
to packs of liquor.  National cops
spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said they are currently investigating the
authenticity and origin of the picture to determine the identity of the persons
in photograph as well as when and where the picture was taken.  “Such behaviour
by any South African Police Service member is unacceptable and it is condemned
in strongest terms by police management,” said Naidoo.  He said that as
soon as the investigation is concluded and the picture authenticated, the
members will be subjected to internal disciplinary procedures.  We are
appealing anyone who has any information about this picture to contact the SAPS
Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. Tip-offs may also be made via the SAPS MySAPS
App. All information received will be treated with confidentiality.
