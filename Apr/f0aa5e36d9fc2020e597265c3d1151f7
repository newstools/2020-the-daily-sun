THEY are supposed to be inside their homes, but their shacks have been demolished. Yesterday, many of the thousands of people who live in Lawley 2 squatter camp near Lenasia were left with nothing. Namhla Solomon (29), a mum of four told Daily Sun she watched in pain as the Red Ants demolished her home and carried it away. “I was selling at my spaza on the corner when they asked me who was staying in the shack. I told them it was my shack and showed them the key. They asked me to open and I did so to prove that I lived there.” Namhla said they told her they were only demolishing shacks that didn’t have occupants, but they lied. “I cried and asked them to stop but they didn’t listen. Now I’m forced to sleep in my tiny spaza with my kids. I don’t even think I’ll find my shack wherever they are taking it.” Steven Ndebele (58) said they were watching the Red Ants when they were dispersed with rubber bullets. “I don’t know why I was shot. Even the military was there. We stood helplessly and watched as our homes fell to the ground. Community leader Mncedisi Buthelezi said: “Not only are we hungry, we are homeless as well.” The City of Joburg said it has taken a decision to clamp down on the illegal invasion of land after people were spotted in the Lawley area erecting structures illegally. It said the operation aimed to prevent that activity.
