DUMPING rubbish with a wheelbarrow or trolley may cost you R1 500 . . . Dumping it with a car or bakkie may cost you R10 000! This warning comes from the Mangaung Metro Municipality. Environmental management member of the mayoral committee, Xolo Pongolo, told Daily Sun: “We have a by-law that indicates there’s a fine for those who’re caught dumping and creating illegal dumping sites. “If the area is clean there’s less disease and illness. “Some people even dump baby nappies, which could be a health hazard.” He urged residents to put their rubbish out for collectors to take to legal dumping sites. “We need a clean environment,” said Pongolo. Gardener Kutlwano Leeba (27) from Caleb Motshabi kasi said he normally dumps plants. “I make a living from cleaning people’s yards, and I’m responsible for getting rid of the garden rubbish,” he said. “I’ve been using a trolley all along to dump the dirt, but I’ll now have to respect the law. “I guess I’ll have to buy garbage plastic bags so that workers can collect them. “A fine of R1 500 is too huge an amount for me to pay.” He said that’s about as much as he makes a month.
