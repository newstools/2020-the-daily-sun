THE cops were doing their last patrol in Joburg on Monday when they saw a group of people standing around. When Joburg Metro cops checked, they noticed a woman. She told them she was about to give birth, and was bleeding heavily. Officer Nompumelelo Salley (35) told Daily Sun they called their radio room to connect them with the Emergency Medical Services. She said they fortunately always had gloves, sanitisers and masks with them.  Nompumelelo has been a cop since 2014. Some people might remember her as the heroic cop who tried to stop a taxi driver in Krugersdorp in 2018, and the driver dragged her for a couple of kilometres. Another officer, Thokozile Magubane (30), who’s been a cop for nine years, said there was no room for them to be scared. She said the mother of the child wasn’t expecting the baby yet as she was seven months pregnant. “We had to put fear aside and help her,” she said. Daily Sun couldn’t get hold of the mother, who was taken to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. Joburg Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the department was proud of what the cops did and hoped they’d continue to help people.
