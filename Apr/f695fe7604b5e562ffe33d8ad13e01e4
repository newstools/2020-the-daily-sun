HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini have been going to different districts to check on their readiness programmes and encouraging health teams to stay focused on their work. Yesterday, Mkhize was in Wesselton in Ermelo where he warned Mpumalanga to remain vigilant. “Although the numbers have not grown very high in Mpumalanga, we know there may be no warning of these infections,” he said. Mkhize said about 94 000 people have been tested. “But we need to keep pushing the numbers up,” he said. Mkhize said the training for health care workers and the screening in communities was still continuing. Resident Thobile Mkhaliphi, who was screened at her home, said: “I’m happy we are getting this service on our doorstep.” Zikalala said they were targeting to screen 139 000 houses a day across KZN and 620 teams have been deployed to do the screening.
