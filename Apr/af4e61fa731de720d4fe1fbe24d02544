JOSEPH Mofubetsoane says his 18-year-old son Moeketsi was murdered for nothing. The 54-year-old father from Kutlwanong, near Odendaalsrus in the Free State, told Daily Sun Moeketsi was stabbed on Saturday, allegedly by his girlfriend. She apparently thought he wanted to dump her. “In the morning I was with him watching TV. “He left but later came back, looking like a wild animal. He was restless and left again. “I was shocked to hear he’d been stabbed 600m from home, and I rushed to see what was happening. “I found my son and he said ‘goodbye dad’ before taking his last breath in my arms. He was stabbed in the upper body and had internal bleeding.” The sad father said he heard the girl had heard rumours she was going to get dumped. “My son was not going to dump her, but she believed the rumours. I’m deeply hurt and I want to ask her why she did it. I want to ask her questions when she appears in court.” Free State Education MEC Tate Makgoe sent his condolences to the family. Makgoe said Moeketsi was a disciplined, quiet pupil. “It’s sad that this tragic accident happened when the country was in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic. I call on pupils to obey lockdown regulations, stay home and study under their parents’ supervision. May his soul rest in peace,” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed the incident. “A 17-year-old apparently accused the victim of cheating on her,” he said. “At about 5pm she allegedly stabbed him in the upper left side and he fell. “The victim was certified dead and the suspect was arrested. She’ll be charged with murder.”
