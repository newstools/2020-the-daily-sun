According to the member of the Premier Soccer League’s  executive committee (EXCO) and SuperSport United CEO Stan Matthews, declaring the league null and void is not an option. Come hell or high water the PSL season will be completed. The Belgian Premier League cancelled their season due to Coronavirus and declared log leaders Club Brugge champions on Thursday. Brugge had a 15-point lead with one round of matches still to play before the end of the season. But Matthews said it’s unthinkable in South Africa and such a thing will be allowed to happen. Kaizer Chiefs have a four-point lead over Mamelodi Sundowns with eight games to go before the end of the campaign. Black Leopards are rooted to the bottom of the log table with 20 points from 24 games.  But Matthews insists that it won’t work in Mzansi to end the season just like that. “We won’t go into the new season without completing this one, no way,” said Matthews. He said the PSL has appointed a task team to look deeper into ways that can help them to complete the current season. Which means that completing this season is a must. Matthews said they will either complete it behind closed door or in another way as long as it’s completed in the field of play and via the boardroom. “We would rather not have a new season altogether rather than leaving this one incomplete. Whatever happens the current season will be completed even if it means that we will play until December,” added Matthews.
