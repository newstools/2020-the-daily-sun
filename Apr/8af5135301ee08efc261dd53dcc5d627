RESIDENTS of Nyanga in Cape Town came out in large numbers to test and screen for the coronavirus. Councillor Khaya Yozi told Daily Sun: “Our people came because they can see how serious this virus is and want to know their status. “No one can look at you and say you have the virus. “This is why we are grateful to our people who took this seriously. We urge those who are afraid to get tested to come because it’s for their safety and those around them.”  Monique Johnstone, Western Cape Health spokeswoman under the Klipfontein and Mitchells Plain Sub-structure office, said the screening and testing started on Tuesday. She said that they focussed mainly on vulnerable people and communities. “The support of the community is essential during screening and testing. Our health teams are identified by their badge and clothing or uniform, allow them to screen you,” she said. Those who were tested were asked to quarantine at home in separate rooms if possible while they waited for their results. Resident Kholeka Ginya (45) went for screening as she wanted to know if she had the virus or not. “I don’t feel sick, but I have heard you can have it without showing symptoms,” said Kholeka.  Another resident, Mlungisi Mayekiso (50), told the People’s Paper that the quarantine issue was a problem. “Some of us won’t be able to do that because our houses are small. The department must help us because we don’t want to die,” he said.
