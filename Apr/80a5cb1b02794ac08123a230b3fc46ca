THE EFF has labeled DA’s proposal to open bottle stores
on weekend as murderous and called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to dismiss the
proposal. “It is clear the DA is a quintessential mouthpiece of the
alcohol industry which demands its profit interests to trump the fight against
Covid-19, “ the red beret said in a statement. The party claimed that all evidence pointed to alcohol
being the greatest contributor to social instability. It said medical
scientists have shown that the majority of trauma case in hospital were alcohol
related. Also, said the party, it has been shown beyond reasonable doubt that
alcohol deteriorated the immune system. “To campaign for the sale of alcohol during the Covid-19
lockdown is therefore unscientific. Most of all, it is a conspiracy for a mass
murder and social instability. It can only be the DA’s racist disregard of
black communities that leads it to campaign on such a murderous agenda,” said
the EFF. The red berets said this call by the DA shows how the
party wanted to see the complete collapse of the black communities and was
confirmation that the real alcohol lobbyists were cooperations that benefitted
from the disruption of society.
