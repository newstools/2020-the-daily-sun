THE Presidency has cleared the air concerning South Africans being used for testing Covid-19 vaccines. This comes after a statement made by the Minister of International Relations, Naledi Pandor allegedly stating that there are already three trials in South Africa. This created confusion and Mzansi was not happy, saying they're not lab rats. The EFF commissioner, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi questioned Pandor's statement.  The president's spokesperson, Khusela Diko, made it clear that no vaccine will be tested on any South African citizens. She also condemned the act of people sharing misleading and fake news. https://twitter.com/MbuyiseniNdlozi/status/1247192613079441409?s=19 "It's so sad that the whole country misquoted a 20 seconds video clip. A drug is for treatment while a vaccine is for preventing disease. These are different medical interventions. Your argument here is invalid," Science GOD tweeted. â€œPeople still need more information about these trials. Can we please be updated on when these trials started, where are they exactly and what's the progress. This little information at our disposal is going to create panic. Start telling us what we need to know," Noni_N tweeted.
