THE Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship clubs have seen a number of managers come and go. Some have tasted success, while others have struggled to cope with unruly fans, expectations and ever evolving complexities of top-flight football. And now, former Golden Arrows, Royal Eagles, Tembisa Classic and Bloemfontein Celtic coach Khabo Zondo believes that his return to the PSL or Championship could be fruitful compared to the past stints he had when he was coaching in Mzansi’s leagues. Zondo is currently without a job. The 58-year-old was employed to scout raw talent for the Nedbank Ke Yona Team Search , but the campaign has been terminated by the sponsors. The sponsors announced last month they will not be continuing with the talent search campaign. And Zondo has now revealed that he is ready to take any offer from PSL or Championship clubs as he is itching to be back in action. “There’s nothing else I know more than football, ” he said. “All my life I have been in football with teams that did not have the financial muscle. I have paid my dues from development to first team level. “I’m hoping if the opportunity comes it will be from clubs that have all the materials and I can showcase what I am capable of.” Currently, Zondo has been assisting a private schools with coaching. In the 1999-00 season, he promoted Arrows to the PSL and won the Telkom Charity Cup in 2007 when he was coaching Bloemfontein Celtic. He also had a stint as assistant coach of Bafana Bafana.
