     "I apologize for snapping at you, especially because I'm a hustler myself. I should have been more understanding. It was in no way a personal attack or anything of the sort," he tweeted, tagging the EFF commissioner, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Dj Ceega. "Shimza is not sorry. He only pretends to be sorry because of the backslash. We need to remind these celebrities that they are who they are because of their fans. We no longer tolerate such nonsense from celebrities. Respect or nothing," Truth Thato tweeted."Shimza just reminded me of how guys with Playstations used to treat us when we were young. Sad!" said Langelihle.Â "It's funny how he's a Dj himself who came from humble beginnings but he treats someone who wants to better their lives like this. That was really mean and that fact that you blocked him shows that this apology is for your own gain, trying not to lose fans. I hope you'll learn to treat people better," said Malinga S.
