HUNDREDS of employees at Impala Platinum mine were ready to return to work yesterday but were stopped. All entrances leading to the mine in Rustenburg, North West, were blocked. The return of the miners came after they received a message to come back to work. While many were turned away, those living on the mine’s premises and in surrounding areas managed to gain entry. A miner said she was confused as she feared either getting infected with the coronavirus or losing her job. “I received a message saying we must come to work. We’re scared but we have to take this risk for our jobs. “We also stand a chance of being arrested for not following the lockdown rules,” she said. “I was called by management and told if I didn’t report to work by Friday, I wouldn’t be paid at the end of the month. “These are pure threats. What will happen to people from Lesotho and the Eastern Cape?” Mine spokesman Johan Theron previously confirmed messages were sent to employees instructing them to return to work. When asked about workers being blocked yesterday, Theron said the mine was talking to the government departments to find common ground. “We have undertaken to pay all our employees in full at least until the end of this week, so people turned away today will not be impacted from this perspective. “Payment beyond this week will be determined as part of the engagement processes currently taking place,” he said.
