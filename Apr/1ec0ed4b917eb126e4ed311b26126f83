IPID is investigating a case of assault which was opened against cops after a shooting incident. Noluthando Jack (26) was on her way to the shop in the Nyanga policing area in Cape Town when she was allegedly shot with rubber bullets by officers. “I saw a white H1 vehicle with police officers coming towards me. “I didn’t run because I was going to buy bread,” she said. “I was hoping they would ask me where I was going. That was my mistake.” She claimed when the vehicle got to her, police got out and started shooting at her. “I told them where I was going but they continued shooting. Even after I fell they didn’t stop,” she said. Noluthando said she couldn’t understand why she was shot at while she was going to buy something to eat. “The lockdown regulations said you must only go out when you are going to get food, but these officers are shooting people anyway. Are we now supposed to die of hunger?” Noluthando wanted the cops to pay for what they did to her. “They need to stop being trigger happy because they are going to kill us. They know the regulations, but they are doing this because they know nothing will happen to them,” she said. Noluthando believes if the officers don’t pay for what they did, they will continue injuring more people. Acting national spokesman for Ipid, Seisa Sontaga, said no arrests have been made but they will continue with the investigations.
