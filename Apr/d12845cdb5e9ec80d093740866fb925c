President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 21-day national lockdown last week and it had a limitation for how many people could travel in a taxi. The limitation was that taxi operators could only load their taxis with half the carrying capacity. This was done in order to provide space between the passengers in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus, however, the regulations have been relaxed. Taxi operators are now allowed to carry more passengers provided that the passengers are wearing masks.  Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said: “During the lockdown period, all minibus taxi vehicles are permitted to load their maximum 100% passenger loading capacity as provided in the operating license on condition that all passengers are wearing masks.” The required masks are the N95 respirator and surgical masks, which must be used in order for a taxi that carries 15 to load 10 people and a taxi that loads 10 to carry seven people.
