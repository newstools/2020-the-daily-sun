ZAMEKA McKenzie lives in fear and can’t even go out to buy essential items during the lockdown. The 29-year-old lesbian from Ixopo, southern KZN, was almost killed by a relative at her home last Monday.  She opened a case on Tuesday but was scared because the suspect hadn’t been bust. “I was cleaning with other relatives when he suddenly stormed in and started beating me. He dragged me into the yard. When I asked what I’d done, he looked into my eyes and continued beating me,” she said. Zameka said he told her an inyanga told him he needed her arm, eyes and ears to get rich. “Neighbours heard me screaming and came out. They told him to stop beating me, but it was like he didn’t hear them . He just carried on. He told me he wanted the powers I have because I’m a lesbian,” she said.  Traditional Healers Association chairman Thandonjani Hlongwane said: “A lot of fake izinyanga have told people gays and lesbians have supernatural powers, but that’s not true.” Zameka’s relative, Bongeka Khumalo (30), said she was in the house when the incident happened but couldn’t stop him as she was afraid. Sbo Khumalo of the LGBT Community Organisation Project in Durban said: “We need to make people understand we’re human.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case of assault was opened.
