Paris Saint-Germain seem to have beaten Manchester United to Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly after reportedly agreeing to a €75m transfer fee. Koulibaly's future in Italy has been unclear for 12 months or more with Manchester United and Barcelona both reportedly keen on the 28-year-old centre-back. Only last month Calciomercato claimed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted Diego Godin to be joined by Koulibaly this summer. According to Area Napoli, the Serie A giants have made the decision that there is no room for the likes of Koulibaly, Allan and Hirving Lozano on their books and one or more will be sold in the next window. Now Mundo Deportivo claim PSG have moved ahead of United and Barca for the Senegal international after agreeing a price in principle with Napoli chief Aurelio De Laurentiis. Gennaro Gattuso's side want €80m for the centre-back, while PSG initially offered €70m, but a compromise offer of €75m is on the table ahead of the window opening in the summer. Per the source, Koulibaly will receive €10m per season with a five-year contract on offer to move to Paris. The report states that PSG have acted swiftly to replace Thiago Silva, 35, who is out of contract in June, and will leave after eight years at the Parc de Princes. SOURCE: SPORT24
