An intelligence-driven operation by Prasa officials led to the arrest of 13 men, who were caught red-handed stealing electrical cables last night. The men are allegedly members of the infamous gang called BaSotho, who've been allegedly stealing electrical cables for a while now. According to a Prasa official they have been eyeing the suspects for several months. "These people have cost the country millions because every time they steal a cable it has to be replaced. The one they were found with today has an estimate of R600 000," he said. He explained that they mostly targeted the cable from Midway to New Canada train stations. "We found them busy at Kliptown station, some managed to run into the nearby squatter camps but were apprehended. One of the suspects even shot at our security guys but no one is injured," said the official.  He added that the hunt for the remaining suspects will continue because there is a lot of them. He said the 13 suspects were detained at Kliptown police station and an unlicensed pistol was recovered from one of them. "The suspects were arrested for malicious damage to essential infrastructure and tampering with essential infrastructure," he said.
