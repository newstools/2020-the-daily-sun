Twins Viggy and Virginia set tongues wagging on social media after they were seen kissing and hugging in a video. The twins have a strong bond as sisters. Tweeps noticed the chemistry and intimacy on the video that the twins, who shot to fame when they were contestants on Idols SA, posted on their Twitter account. It seems like the twins posted the video to promote their single track Amagifs. While tweeps were asking questions, the Qwabe twins took their time to respond. They made it clear that what they are seen doing in the video, has nothing to do with sex but it is just pure love between two sisters. One Twitter user Muscle Ventriloquist said: “But you guys are lesbians or bisexual… I have nothing against that. One question though, would you marry the same guy?” And the twins replied: “No, we're none of that. We're just siblings who care for each other. It's something others wouldn’t understand. Our bond, chemistry is unexplainable.” Another Twitter user who sounded concerned by the video asked: “Am I the only one bothered by this incest?” In which the twins responded: “Why must you be bothered though?” SEE VIDEO BELOW:
