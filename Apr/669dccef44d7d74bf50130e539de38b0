MALEBOGO Modise has had an illustrious football career. At 21, the versatile Mamelodi Sundowns defender has represented Mzansi with distinction at all levels. From Under-17 to the senior national team Bafana Bafana. And this includes being at two Fifa Under-20 World Cups in 2017 (South Korea) and Poland last year. The Olympics were scheduled to take place from July to August this year, but the tournament has been postponed for next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Tokyo Olympic Games will now be played from 23 July 2021 and run until 8 August after being postponed for a year. That has given SA Under-23 coach David Notoane another chance to have a look at his squad. Notoane also revealed there would be changes in his squad as he will only select deserving players, not select them based on who they are and what they have done. The “changes” mentioned by Notoane have excited some players who believe they have what it takes to improve and represent the country against the top teams in the world. Modise is one of them and he said this is a rare opportunity and he hopes to do enough to impress Notoane and make the final squad. “Playing at the Olympics will be a dream come true,” said Modise. “What makes it more special is that I will be one of the few players to play for the national team at all junior levels.” The lad from the North West believes the international experience he has gained will come in handy, but he is aware he will need to be consistent and not blow hot and cold. He said: “I think I need to improve and be more consistent in my games. “Play all games at the same level, not shine today and drop tomorrow.” Some players who have had the opportunity of donning national team colours at all levels and will be also hoping to make Olympic squad include the likes of Sibongakonke Mbatha, Reeve Frosler, Thendo Mukumela, Khulekani Kubheka and Kobamelo Kodisang.
