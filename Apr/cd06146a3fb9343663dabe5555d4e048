THE enforced coronavirus break in the PSL has come at the most inopportune time for Bloemfontein Celtic youngster Sipho Chaine. The 23-year-old, who is a product of Phunya Sele Sele’s youth Academy, was beginning to impose himself and make a mark in the first team. He had waited for this chance since the beginning of the season as Celtic’s third-choice keeper behind Jackson Mabokgwane and Mondli Mpoto. And when his opportunity finally came in his side’s last match before the break, he grabbed it with both hands. He played arguably the best game of his young career, helping Celtic squeeze past TS Sporting on penalties in the Nedbank Cup. But would not have the opportunity to ride that wave of momentum with the deadly virus putting a halt to the season. Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema, however, believes Chaine has a bright future at the club and will get more opportunities. “He is a very good keeper, he has the right mentality as well which works in his favour,” said Seema. “He’s one of our best youngsters in the team, he knows that his time will come, and he will get his chance. “And he has shown that he is ready, I mean he played a brilliant match against TS Sporting and was the hero in the penalties. “For a young keeper who hadn’t played a lot this season to come up with a performance like that was really impressive. “It’s good when there is competition in the team. We are confident in every single one of our players that they can deliver anytime they are called upon. “Sipho is a bright boy who is always willing to learn and improve, there is no doubt the future is bright for him.” Chaine is one of the players who cut their teeth in the Multichoice Diski Challenge, helping Celtic win the competition last season. His heroics during that MDC run saw him earn promotion to the first team where he would make a handful of appearances.
