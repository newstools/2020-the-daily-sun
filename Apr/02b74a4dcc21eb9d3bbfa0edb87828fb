Former Chippa United coach Dan Malesela says that he has had no contact with Mamelodi Sundowns about potentially joining the club. Reports in the media suggest that current coach Pitso Mosimane will depart the Brazilians at the end of the season when his contract expires. It is unlikely that the former Bafana boss will step away from his post though, especially with the current season on hold as a result of the coronavirus. Malesela, who has previously coached at Chippa, Cape Town All Stars and most recently TS Galaxy, admitted that while it is an unlikely scenario, he wouldn't turn down the prestigious club if they came calling. The 54-year-old said: "It's no secret that I am a big Sundowns fan, but they still have a coach employed at this stage. "I wouldn't want to be seen to be gunning for Pitso's job." He added: "Look, I am open to offers from any club. Even if Sundowns would make an offer, I would take it if they don't have a coach. "I have heard a lot of rumours about clubs that are in need of my services, but I have not received any offer. "I must say, there have been approaches from other big clubs in the PSL and lower divisions, but nothing has been formalised."
