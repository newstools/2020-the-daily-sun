Cape Town High Court has ruled in favour of backyarders whose shacks were demolished by the City of Cape Town last week. In a judgement by judge Bryan Hack in Western Cape High Court today, 130 residents whose shacks were demolished are ordered to go back to the land and the municipality must give their building material back. Social Justice Coalition (SJC) who were instrumental in assisting the backyarders says they are happy with the ruling and they will assist the group in the implementation of the ruling. “This is a great victory for the people of Epholweni and we welcome the judgement by the court but it is very sad that we have to go all the way to court for the City of Cape Town to find that what they were doing was not only illegal and unlawful against the lockdown regulations but also inhuman,”said Notyala. Last week City of Cape Town destroyed several structures in Epholweni area in Khayelitsha and left several people homeless. Some of the people have been sleeping at the piece of land where their shacks were demolished. Mayco member for Human Settlement Malusi Booi visited the area last week after the demolition but had to speed off in his vehicle after residents pelted his vehicle with stones. On today’s judgement, Booi said as the municipality they noted the ruling but started that the court has not touched on the merits of the matter. “He has made an interim ruling on humanitarian grounds and without considering the merits of the application and has allowed 49 occupiers to re-erect structures. The merits of the application will be decided after the lockdown ends. The City is allowed to remove any new illegally erected structures with immediate effect. Land invasions are illegal. The Judge acknowledged this aspect and emphatically denounced land grabs,” said Booi.
