PEOPLE are supposed to keep apart during the lockdown, but some people say it’s improved their sex lives. Thapelo Mokoena (32) from Turflaagte in Mangaung told Daily Sun he and his partner live together, and following the lockdown they had been doing it at all times of the day. “We don’t have kids and all we do during the lockdown is poke, day in and day out. We heard the virus doesn’t survive in heat and poking gives us more body heat,” he said. Thabelo’s girlfriend Nthabiseng Lepota (28) said she had noticed a change in him. “He acts like a hungry lion. He wants it during the night and day. I don’t know if he’s drinking imbiza to boost his 4-5. His sex drive has changed,” she said. Lerato Matla and his wife Nthabiseng from Khayelitsha in Mangaung said the lockdown had made their relationship stronger. “My husband was always saying he was tired, but now he’s very flexible. I thank this lockdown.” Motlagomang Seleso (31) and her husband John (36) said the lockdown had united them. John said: “We used to argue a lot. I think it was caused by a lack of poking. Since the lockdown we poke a lot and our silly arguments are over.”
