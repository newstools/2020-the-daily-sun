KASI kids were given masks on Tuesday to protect them against the coronavirus. Zokufa Media Production and Colourplus Textile donated masks to kids in Philippi block 8, Cape Town. Pam Zokufa said she was disturbed to notice kids were not being properly taken care of and not wearing masks. “I visited a local clinic last week and saw children were not catered for and this scared me,” she said. “When they get affected they take the infection home, leading to them spreading the disease.” Parents said they wanted to protect their kids but didn’t have money to buy masks and had to buy food with the little they had. Cumisa Mcinga (36) told Daily Sun: “We can’t control these kids and keep them inside the house all day. “At the same time I didn’t feel comfortable to have my two kids out on the streets, where they could catch the virus and bring it home. “It feels better, now that they have masks. We thank Pam for coming to our rescue.” Kids who received masks were over the moon and promised to wear them when out on the streets. Sihle Vuthula (12) said: “I’m happy we got the masks at last. We washed our hands but didn’t have masks. “Now we need gloves so that we can play safely.” The kids said they didn’t mind being indoors, except that their shacks are small and they don’t want to be around their parents all the time.
