THREE men thought filling their car with booze to smuggle would be a walk in the park. However, the cops outwitted them and stopped their white BMW with GP registration number on the N8 just outside Bloemfontein, Free State, on Sunday afternoon. Bottles of vodka, whiskey, gin and beer were found in the men’s possession. Photos of the bust soon started making the rounds on social media and users had lots to say. John Matlala said: “I wish the cops would give us, the people who obey the stay at home rule, that booze. My eyes are on those Skyy bottles.” A cop said the men told officers they had bought the booze in Bloemfontein.  “They said they were heading to Thaba Nchu with the booze. We will be investigating to find out where in Bloemfontein they found the booze,” he said. “They had a case of beer and bottles of Tanqueray, Johnnie Walker, Jameson and Skyy. They might have had a party planned but it has been ruined for their own safety and good health. “People should know we will not be fooled and we will search every car on the road,” said the cop. Free State Emergency Medical Services manager Sipho Towa warned people they would not be fooled and would search cars. He said there were also paramedics at the roadblock where the men were bust. “We are regularly involved because we do screening if needed at roadblocks,” he said. National police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed the incident. “Three men, aged between 40 and 50, were arrested about 30km outside Bloemfontein. They were driving a white BMW with liquor inside,” he said. “The arrest was made at a roadblock at about 3.30pm. They will be charged for transporting alcohol under the Disaster Management Regulations Act.”
