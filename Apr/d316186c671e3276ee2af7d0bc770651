THE dad of a 10-month-old baby girl who was kidnapped and held hostage on Monday is still in shock. The baby from phase 5 in Waterloo, north of Durban, was allegedly kidnapped by her 32-year-old father’s brother-in-law. According to the father, when he tried to get his baby back, the suspect threatened to stab her with a knife he was holding. The father said when the incident happened, he was relaxing at his home, not far from the suspect’s place. “The gate was not locked because we didn’t expect someone would come and do something like this. Before we knew it, he had entered our home and snatched our daughter.” The father said he tried following the suspect to get his child back. “But he threatened to stab my daughter or me if I dared came close to him. That’s when I decided to involve the police,” he said. The father said the suspect was trying to find out where his sister was. “My sister has a child with him who is about a year old. He has been violent towards her, so she moved last year. He has been trying to get me to tell him where my sister and the child are,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of kidnapping was opened at Verulam Police Station. She said the police were called to the scene and found the suspect in a house with the child. “He then fled the scene and left the child inside and unharmed. The suspect is being sought by the police,” she said.
