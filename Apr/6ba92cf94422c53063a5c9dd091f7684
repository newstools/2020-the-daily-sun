"I'M glad the Sassa payment week is over because people were loitering around, so from next week the roads and streets must be clean." These were the words of Police Minister Bheki Cele while addressing more than 300 police and traffic cops in Polokwane, Limpopo on Friday. He said this year’s Good Friday will be a different time of life as they are dealing with an upside-down world. Cele warned police to defend citizens who don’t want to defend themselves from now on leading to Easter weekend. “Be kind when you are dealing with people, be kind but don’t allow them to go astray. When they are told to go to their homes, they must do so. “Please defend the people of South Africa against this catastrophe because we are dealing with an enemy. Don’t forget that you have been given the marching orders by President Cyril Ramaphosa,” said Cele. He acknowledged that they are dealing with something they have not been trained for. “Please be careful at all times and make sure you don’t catch this virus on or off duty,” he added. Limpopo Transport and Community Safety MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya also urged them to go and implement the orders that were given by Minister Cele in enforcing the lockdown regulations.
