ACTOR Cebolenkosi Mthembu is a man of many talents and skills. He is known as Nyawo on Uzalo but the actor is much more than that. He has proven to be not just an entertainer, but also a genius in Maths. As Uzalo actors are in quarantine with their families during this national lockdown, Nyawo is taking this time to help pupils catch up in Maths. He is using his social media accounts to teach Maths to grade 10, 11 and 12 pupils. Speaking to Daily Sun, Cebolenkosi who is known as a cop who uses strong English words on Uzalo, said that before he became an actor, he used to teach Maths in high school and FET College. He said that he understands the frustration that pupils are going through during the lockdown. “People are asked to stay at home, and pupils are the one that are suffering the most. I know that those who are rich have donated money. But we can all do our part to help one another whether you are rich or not. "I do not have money to donate in the fight against the coronavirus but I have knowledge and skills, and have decided to use them in giving a helping hand. I hope that pupils will enjoy my classes,” said Cebolenkosi. Pupils can get Cebolenkosi’s classes on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Youtube. WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
