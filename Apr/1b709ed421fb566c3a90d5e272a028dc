FORMER Kaizer Chiefs dribbling wizards Jabu “Shuffle” Mahlangu and Emmanuel “Scara” Ngobese entertained Amakhosi supporters with their skills and some beautiful goals. Who do you think was the best between “Shuffle” and “Scara” “Scara” and “Shuffle” had a lot in common – they were both from the East Rand (Jabu Daveyton and Ngobese Katlehong) - they both wore the famous Number 11 jersey which was used by one Chiefs’ greatest players Teenage Dladla. Even though the two stars never played in one team, they both had the Amakhosi supporters eating out of their hands, putting in some Man-of-the-Match performances and winning some major accolades for Chiefs. Shuffle shined under Muhsin Ertugral, played for AmaGlug-Glug at the 2000 Olympic Games and represented Bafana Bafana at the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan. Ngobese was a darling of the fans with his 360-turn-arounds that left defenders dizzy -  and his knack for changing and winning games with a stroke of genius, in a matter of seconds. Who was the best between the two talented players and why?
