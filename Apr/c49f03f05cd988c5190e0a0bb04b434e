Iconic street-style culture brand, Converse collaborated with designer brand, Comme des Garcons to brighten up your wardrobe. In 2015 the two brands collaborated to bring the CdG PLAY x Converse Chuck Taylor, a low-key sneaker staple deserving of just as much kudos as its younger cousin and this time they are back at it again with bright colours. The Comme des Garcons brand is known for the red heart with eyes that fits perfectly on the converse brand.  The sneakers will be available in  neon green, pink, and blue colorways with the CDG heart placed on the side. The placements of the branding are very similar to that of the white and black models except for this time we are getting a much-needed injection of color.
