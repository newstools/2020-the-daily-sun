DURING the lockdown people keep themselves busy with fun things, some do challenges on social media while others bake and cook. On the other hand, socialite Zodwa Wabantu has turned to working out. But she is doing it differently as expected, she posted a video of her running with only a panty and a bra. The controversial popular entertainer said she never liked gym but now she has all the time in the world. She told Daily Sun that she started working out seven days ago. “I used to be lazy and would sleep drunk from going out so I would be tired to work out the morning after. “Now I don’t have any alcohol in my system, and I can exercise,” she said. She said she works out with her boyfriend. “We do home workouts, I concentrate on my tummy, thighs and bums. I want thunder thighs, so I do exercises for that,” she said. “I work out wearing my underwear because it is comfortable,” she said.
