ANGRY Vuyiswa Dlamini wants her money back. She claimed the daughter-in-law of a famous soccer club owner allegedly robbed her by falsifying proof of payments from the bank! Vuyiswa told Daily Sun she had asked the woman to help her pay for her car. “When my car was about to be repossessed, I asked her. I knew she could help me,” she said. “I asked her on 26 February and she said she would pay. She paid the money on the same day and sent me proof of payment.” She said the agreement was that she would pay her back in monthly instalments of R5 000, and the next day she gave her R5 000. “But a few days later the bank informed me they didn’t receive the payment, and I told her. She said she made a mistake, but she’ll send it again.” Vuyiswa said the woman told her she paid the bank three times but after a while she realised she had been sending fake proof of payments. “I told a friend about my problem. The friend showed me an article where people were scammed,” said Vuyiswa. “I asked her about it but she still told me stories.” She opened a case of fraud against the woman at Norwood cop shop on 26 March. Vuyiswa said: “She took advantage of my problem and that makes me angry.” When called for comment, the woman told Daily Sun she didn’t want to say much but said her payments weren’t fake. “I think this has become an issue because I’ve been in the papers for scamming people before,” she said. “Without saying much, I paid for Vuyiswa’s car. The money just took a long time to reflect on the bank’s system.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that a case of fraud had been opened against the woman. “The case is still being investigated. No arrests have been made, yet,” he said.
