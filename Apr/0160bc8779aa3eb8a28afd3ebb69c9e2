South African star athlete Caster Semenya has smashed Cristiano Ronaldo's 'core crusher challenge' record in the Nike Living Room Cup challenge. The Portugal and Juventus superstar Ronaldo urged his followers to take part in the challenge, which involves touching your toes as many times as possible while lying flat on your back, in a video posted on Instagram. It’s part of an initiative aiming to promote exercise during the ongoing coronavirus lockdown. The Juventus forward's tally of 142 reps in the allotted 45-second period proved no match for Semenya, who stopped the clock after 176 reps. Semenya took to Instagram to share her attempt, writing: “Hola fellas thanks to @cristiano for his challenge, the beast himself did his best, I also manage to scoop 176 in that space of 45 seconds. Not bad for a Sunday ke ya baba mfo.” Other soccer stars to have attempted the challenge include Manchester United’s Portuguese duo Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, but neither could come close to Semenya's total, managing 117 and 105 reps, respectively. RONALDO Hey guys, I have a new challenge for you to stay active: the Living Room Cup ??. Can you step up and beat my core crusher record? Show me what you got and use #livingroomcup #playinside @nike @cristiano so I can ?? you!
