Speaking to Daily Sun, the gospel star from Durban, said that he takes the national lockdown serious and it is his wish to see his fans do the same. “This is time of prayer and worship. If we could use this time wisely, we can overcome this situation. People must stop being ignorant. It is sad to learn that they flock to shopping malls and ignore the fact that they could get infected. Some think that this virus is only for the rich, which is not true,” said Thinah. He was referring to the incident where a person from uMlazi in the south of Durban died after she tested positive for the coronavirus. He further says that he sings his hit songs that are loved by many gospel fans. Read:PHUZEKEMISI LASHES OUT AT ENEMIES
