 THERE might
be very rare but good news for Mzansi motorists coming. According
to the Automobile Association (AA), unaudited mid-month fuel price data
released by the Central Energy Fund fuel prices might be dropping significantly
again. "Coming
in the wake of March's record fuel price reductions, South Africa is probably
set for the second month of record fuel price drops for some fuel types,"
said the AA. "The
irony is that this has come at a time where motorists and businesses are
severely limited as to how they can use their vehicles." The
mid-month data showed petrol down by a massive R1.89 a litre, with illuminating
paraffin dropping by R1.88 and diesel by R1.17. The AA says
that the factors which initially touched off the plunge in oil prices before
the Covid-19 pandemic placed much of the world in lockdown had now been
resolved. The
Association says that even the Rand's massive crash against the US dollar since
March has not been enough to offset the steep decline in oil prices. "The
Rand has gone from an average exchange rate against the dollar of R15.65 on 2
March to its current level of around R18.25. In any other circumstances, a
crash of 17% in six weeks would see South Africans facing a massive fuel price
hike. Instead, we are set for another large drop," added the AA. The AA says
the market remains highly volatile and cautions these figures could be very
different by month-end.
