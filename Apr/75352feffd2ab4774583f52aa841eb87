NASREC Expo Centre is expected to be ready as an isolation and quarantine site from next Friday. For the first phase, the site is expected to have 500 beds, with the option of having up to 2 250 beds when the need arises. Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said: “This facility will only deal with isolation and quarantining, but with the need and demand, we will be able to put up an almost 300-bed ICU.” Masuku was speaking during his inspection of the site in the south of Joburg yesterday. With Gauteng being the epicentre of Covid-19 in Mzansi, Masuku said the province needed to be prepared, even if it meant overpreparing for the outbreak, especially after the lockdown eases down. He said work was also being done to increase capacity at existing hospitals. “We want to have structures that we can use after the pandemic, not structures that we’re going to destroy.” He said Tshwane District Hospital was Covid-19 ready in terms of beds. “We’ve earmarked Steve Biko as one of our hospitals in terms of capacity. We’ve had to create more beds so that we’ll have one hospital that will be able to handle the load for Tswhane. “The plan is to turn the hospital to admit only Covid-19 patients.” Capacity at George Mukhari, Jubilee, Chris Hani Baragwanath and Kopanong hospitals would be increased. A lot of businesses have been badly affected since the start of the lockdown, but there may be light at the end of the tunnel for kasi-based B&Bs. Masuku said: “We’re also going to be in discussion with B&B owners around Soweto and Joburg to see how we can assist them for their facilities to also be used for quarantining and isolation purposes.” The MEC said discussions had already started and the only thing left was to facilitate the rates. He said it was part of their plan for the Department of Health to contribute to economic development and job creation.
