The sale of cigarettes and alcohol are currently prohibited due to the lockdown, making it difficult for addicts in Mzansi. As a result, the South African National Council on Drug and Alcohol Dependence (SANCA) has come out to voice its concerns about how the government’s strict procedures regarding no alcohol and tobacco purchases will affect addicts. SANCA spokesperson, Thembi Msane said the rising number of new COVID-19 cases daily is increasing the risk of stress and panic attacks for many people. “A person with Substance Use Disorder may be triggered by the added stress and use alcohol, nicotine and other substances to relieve some of the tension, which can lead to increased consumption and addiction during this period,” she said.

Msane said people who have always regarded themselves as social drinkers or smokers may start to drink more during the lockdown due to boredom and stress. “We are aware of the negative impact that the lockdown will have on addicts. If signs and symptoms of SUD withdrawal arise, please consult a doctor or go to the nearest hospital. We should all focus on staying healthy and protecting our respiratory organs during this time,” she added. Msane further said that to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it was important for people to stop sharing cigarettes and hookah pipes.
