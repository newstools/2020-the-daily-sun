A family in the North West has been stigmised as people who were Coronavirus infected and that, has left them fuming and calling for their name to be cleared of the virus. Meisie Segalo from Motswedi village lost a brother three weeks ago. After the funeral, her aunt who came from Botswana to attend the funeral happened to die due to coronavirus. Meisie said after the news of her aunt passing, people saw them as the virus itself, distancing themselves to everyone that they knew had attended that funeral. “This is heartbreaking. The whole village calls us Corona. Its very painful. We need our name to be cleared because we do not have corona,” she said. She said the post mortem of her aunt in Botswama stated that she died due to Asthma and does not understand how Coronavirus was linked to her death. The woman expressed her devastation during a launch of provincial  roll out of mass screening, testing and tracing  of the virus at the village. Health MEC Madoda Sambatha and premier Job Mokgoro visited her family as part of the screening process at the village. Comforting the woman , health  Sambatha explained that they were only tracing the people who were in contact with the deceased not to say that the family had the virus. He explained that his department received the report about the woman from the Botswana government. “Its not the issue of the family it’s the issue of the contacts. Family must not be accused that they have corona. We were making sure that Motswedi people must not hesitate and say people here has corona,” Sambatha said. A resident Aaron Gaedume 41 has happy to be coronavirus free after he was screened. He said coughing was no longer a normal thing as people now associated it with the virus. “I was used to people coughing and it was normal.  I am happy that I am cleared of the virus,” he said.
