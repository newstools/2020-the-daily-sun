Players plying their trade in South Africa's leagues cannot afford cuts to their salary, according to SuperSport United CEO Stan Matthews. With numerous players and clubs abroad accepting wage cuts in the wake of their inactivity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, discussions about a similar approach in South Africa has been rife. Earlier, PSL chairperson Irvin Khoza admitted that he cannot guarantee clubs will receive their monthly grants indefinitely, suggesting that clubs will have to tighten their proverbial belts in one way or another. Meanwhile, the league's chief executive Mato Madlala said it will continue to support clubs despite the suspension of football activities currently. With the above in mind, Matthews has now had his say on the topic. "A salary cut in the PSL is a big no. Our players cannot afford that like Lionel Messi of Barcelona, or other big-name players in Europe," Matthews said. "Our players’ budget is based on their salaries. There are players who earn big salaries, while others get a much lesser pay. They pay rates and taxes, school fees and buy groceries as most of them are breadwinners. "If we cut their salaries, it will lead to a tremendous cash flow problem and increase the high level of borrowing cash from loan sharks and banks and this will bring huge stress to many households in the country. "We have not discussed salary cuts. It’s the bridge that we don't want to cross. We will tackle the situation if it deteriorates. "Many players in those big European leagues earn big salaries while PSL players don’t earn that kind of money, which is enough for them to afford salary cuts."
