HEARTLESS scammers are targeting NGOs and non-profit organisations out of funds that should be used to help the most vulnerable! A number of organisations registered in terms of the NPO Act have been cheated by scammers who try to get access to their finances. The scammers charge the organisations R 1 999 for conversion of their certificates to NGO certificates. They do this by recreating a fake NGO certificate in which they ask registered NPOs to submit a number of documents including ID copies of their members, bank account details and a photo of the director. “The Department of Social Development has not contracted any person or agency to convert NPO certificates for international funding and doesn’t intend to do so,” said deputy minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu. “There’s no such thing as an NGO certificate as all organisations are registered as NPOs in terms of the NPO Act. The department registers NPOs free of charge,” she said. Therina du Toit, director of the National Council for People with Disabilities, said a number of NPOs had already been scammed. “Once the department advises us that there is money available for projects, you send them your details, which end up with the scammers who use your invoices to collect the money,” she said.
