SOWETO giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs have put their rivalry aside and have joined forces to aid the country's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. With football suspended until further notice, the clubs have now turned their attention away from the pitch and to the country's hospitals. The press conference was attended by SuperSport boss Imtiaz Patel, PSL and Pirates chairman Dr Irvin Khoza and Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung. The two clubs partnered with Multichoice and made a big donation to help flatten the curve of the pandemic Coronavirus. They donated numerous items of personal protective equipment to the National Health Laboratory Service in an attempt to aid their progress against COVID-19. This was announced in a press conference which was held at SuperSport offices in Randburg on Wednesday afternoon. Minister of Health Dr Zweli Mkhize and the Deputy of Sport, Arts and Culture Ms Nocawe Mafu were also in attendance. “As government embarks of accelerating the nationwide screening and testing campaign, we humbly asked our ministry of health to accept the contribution of 100 000 N95 masks, 100 000 surgical masks, 100 000 gloves and shoe covers,” Patel said. “This is our small contribution for front-line workers who are unsung heroes and heroines, the first and last line of defense in curving the spread of the virus. We are letting them know that we support them, and we salute them.” Mkhize announced seven people have died in KwaZulu-Natal and one in Gauteng.
