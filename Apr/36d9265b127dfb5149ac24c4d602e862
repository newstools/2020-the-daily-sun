LIFE was hard already for people living in squatter camps before the lockdown. Things have become worse for residents, who told Daily Sun social distancing was impossible and they had no money for gloves, sanitisers or masks. Residents of Makausi in Ekurhuleni told the SunTeam the lockdown was for the middle and upper classes, as here they shared mobile toilets and only had one tap for each street. Wendy Xiri (45) said she didn’t understand the logic behind locking down people with no electricity as it was impossible to keep kids in the house all day. “Can we at least get food parcels? I’ve been selling fruit and vegetables for seven years. What am I supposed to eat? I have two children I need to feed,” she said. Thabisa Majeke (46) said not every yard had a toilet, and when one was full they went to the next one. “No one has visited us since the lockdown started to check if we’re even following the rules. We’re suffering and no one cares,” she said. Dan Gwambe (51) said the spread of the virus was the least of his worries as he was more concerned about what he would eat. “I ‘ve been making furniture since 2006 and it’s my only source of income,” he said. Manthati Makoshane (37) said she knew the lockdown wouldn’t work for local residents. She said politicians only visited the area when they wanted votes. “How can they tell us about social distancing when they know very well that there are more than five people in one mkhuku?” said Manthati . Yolo Nene (47) said he wasn’t even bothering to follow the lockdown rules. “These are things we can’t control. I need water and I need to go to the toilet,” he said.
