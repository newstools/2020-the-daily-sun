FOR THREE months, residents have been living in the dark and are terrorised by their neighbours who allegedly stole their electricity. About seven houses in Mxenge in Philippi, Cape Town, have been without electricity for the past three months after residents of Ramaphosa squatter camp illegally connected to their electricity distribution boxes. Mxenge residents said all they got when they confronted them were death threats. Gogo Nokwanda Daka (62) has been cooking on a wood fire. “These people vandalised our distribution boxes and connected themselves. As soon as technicians leave after fixing it, the people from Ramaphosa come and disconnect us again. They do it in broad daylight. They threaten that someone will die if we stop them.” Zolile Daka (68) said: “The municipality should provide electricity for them so they can leave us alone.” Mxenge community leader Zukiswa Mutholengwe said they bought the land and built their houses in the early 1990s. “We placed our own cables underground. We don’t know how they even know where the cables are.” Energy MMC Phindile Maxiti said: “The informal settlement’s on private land, and the city doesn’t have approval from the land owner to provide services. We are looking into this matter.”
