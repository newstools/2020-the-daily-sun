JOBURG Metro cops took to the streets of Soweto today, leading to the arrest of eight suspects who broke Covid-19 regulations. Residents watched from their yards, saying they were tired of being harassed by officers. One madala from Zola asked why they took stock from people who were trying to feed families. “I’m sure they bought their stock with their last money to ensure their kids don’t go to bed on empty stomachs. They are not all over the place. They sit in their stalls and try to make a living.” Nomzamo Sibeko  said it was not that people didn’t want to comply, but they were frustrated as  they were hungry. “I’m broke. I can’t do piece jobs because we are not allowed to move around,” she said. Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the aim of the operation was to make sure people complied with lockdown regulations.   “The president was very clear on what should be done during this time, but people are doing as they please. They are walking the streets without masks and some don’t even know where they are going.” Minnaar said people were bust for trading without permits. “Six street vendors who sold fruit and vegetables outside Jabulani Mall were arrested. They couldn’t explain why they didn’t have permits. So we took them and their stock.” Minnaar said another suspect was a drunk driver, who tried to dodge officers. “He tried to drive past a roadblock when he was stopped. He smelled of alcohol and was stubborn and rude.” He said they would continue with unannounced operations to make sure people followed the law.
