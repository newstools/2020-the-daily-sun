WHILE South Africans' thirst for booze sees no end as the lockdown continues,two friends from London have been locked down in a pub!  Britain has been on its own lockdown since March 23 and like in Mzansi,booze spots have been closed. But Steve Pond and Dom Townsend from North London are very lucky chaps.  According to The Sun UK, Dom and Steve share a flat aboveÂ The Prince pub in Stoke Newington, which has been completely deserted for over a month since the lockdown that side. With no customers, the two flatmates have been spending their time playing games of crazy golf and having braais on the roof in the sunny weather. Dom (29) moved in just two months before the lockdown began and became the pub's assistant manager after starting there as a barman. He said: "We've ended up as friends . It's been nice. We can't complain. We've got fresh beer on tap." Steve (39) had been quite worried about the spread of the virus as he has a lung condition.  He told the paper: "So I kind of started to self-isolate a couple of weeks before, but after confirmation from my doctor I found I could go out so that kind of eased it a bit for me."  Dom and Steve both said they are looking forward to "a big party" once the lockdown ends, with the pub expecting a full house.
