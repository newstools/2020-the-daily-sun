MINISTER of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams' visit to a member of Parliament, Mduduzi Manana, was not for purposes of rendering essential services. This was announced by the National Prosecuting Authority after she was summoned to appear in the Tshwane District Court on Wednesday. The minister landed in hot water when a picture of her circulated on social media, showing her having lunch with Manana during the lockdown. She paid an admission of guilt fine of R1 000 on Tuesday. Spokesperson of the NPA in Gauteng, Phindi Mjonondwane, said Ndabeni-Abrahams was charged with Contravention of Regulation 11 B of the Disaster Management Act. She said the admission of guilt fine was as per determination by the Senior Magistrate for the Magisterial District of Tshwane where the amount of R1 000 has been set for the offence of failure to confine oneself to his/her place of residence. The State alleged that on 5 April 2020, Ndabeni-Abrahams unlawfully and intentionally failed to remain confined in her place of residence as a result visiting Mduduzi Manana's place of residence. "The investigations revealed that collecting a grant or seeking medical attention as per requirements of the Covid-19 regulations. "The NPA remains committed to delivering justice without fear, favour, or prejudice. This penalty should send a message that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law," said Mjonondwane. After the picture circulated President Cyril Ramaphosa summoned the minister to explain her actions and placed her on two months special leave and one month will be unpaid.
