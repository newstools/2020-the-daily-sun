SINCE the lockdown started, piece jobs have dried up. And after seeing people’s suffering, Pastor Ntombekhaya Nyama-Plati of the Genesis Faith Mission in Cape Town decided to feed her community. The pastor told Daily Sun she couldn’t just sit back and watch people struggle. “Most are single parents depending on piece jobs but with the lockdown, people are staying at home and don’t have food.” Ntombekhaya said she woke up every morning and prepared meals for more than 500 people. “I’m doing this because I know the pain of not having anything to eat,” she said. The pastor said she had been helping people in Marikana squatter camp and some areas in Gugulethu. “The numbers are going up every day and that’s why I am asking anyone who can donate anything that will help me feed more people to come forward,” she said. Resident Nyameka Henisi (43) said she was very grateful for what the pastor was doing. “We are not members of her church but that didn’t stop her from thinking about us. Preparing food for more than 500 people is not child’s play,” she said. Nyameka said the pastor didn’t just cook soup for them. “She mixes samp with soup and some bones, so it’s a good meal for us. We will always be grateful for what she’s doing,” she said. Fikile Papu (39) said if it wasn’t for the soup kitchen, people would have nothing to eat and urged businesses to help the pastor. “She’s taking care of us and I’ve heard she isn’t asking for financial donations, only food. “Some of us would be dead if it wasn’t for pastor Ntombekhaya,” said Fikile. The pastor cooks and feeds people on Wednesdays and Fridays.
