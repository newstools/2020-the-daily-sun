KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala delivered sanitisers and food parcels to the disadvantaged people in Umlazi, south of Durban. Zikalala was accompanied by Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu, and Economic Development MEC Nomusa Dube. The premier visited wards 86, 88 and 82 where he handed over sanitisers and food parcels to five families in each ward. He was also accompanied by various business company representatives who donated food and sanitisers. He said the 15 families who benefited today were chosen by local leaders as the people that needed it most. On top of the parcels, each family received an R1 000 food voucher to buy more groceries. Among the recipients was Khumbuzile Blose (27), who lost her aunt Lungisile Blose (37) who died on Monday from natural causes. The MECs made the offering which totalled R3 200 after hearing her story. Khumbuzile thanked the government and MEC who made offerings. She said the money will go a long way in assisting with funeral arrangements as no one works at home. Zikalala thanked the businesses who donated and urged people to continue obeying lockdown rules and regulations. He said the government was concerned that the province is leading with coronavirus deaths and said major steps are being taken to ensure that the St. Augustine hospital situation is well managed. The hospital has registered more deaths than any other facility.
