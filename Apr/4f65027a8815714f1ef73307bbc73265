A case against a 32-year-old man accused of raping a disabled woman was postponed to 19 May. The accused was arrested on Wednesday morning at Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. According to police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi the report indicates that on that day, the woman (52) was asleep in her house in Cottondale Trust when she was woken up by a man who had forcefully entered her bedroom. “The man then threatened to harm her, ordered her to undress, raped her, thereafter, fell asleep next to the victim,” he said. “The victim then managed to escape, screamed for help, and was rescued by her brother whom she relayed the ordeal too. “Her brother then immediately rushed to her bedroom, where he found the suspect indeed sleeping and woke him up but upon realising that he was cornered, he managed to escape the scene,” Hlathi said. He said the police were then notified about the incident and they responded to the scene where a case of rape was opened for investigation. Hlathi said the police managed to make a breakthrough at which the suspect was arrested on Wednesday and he appearred at the Acornhoek Magistrates Court facing a charge of rape. Hlathi said the police management in Mpumalanga welcomed the arrest and applauded the sterling work done by the astute members, who ensured that the man is put behind bars and be protracted to a lengthy sentence.
