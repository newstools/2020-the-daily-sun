EVERY time it rains, the trench near their homes gets flooded and water ends up in their houses and causes havoc. On Monday night, the rain destroyed 69-year-old Edith Mokanyane’s fence at her RDP in Bergman Grasland 2 in Mangaung, Free State. “I put a fence around my yard just after the RDP was built in 2010. The rains have been eating away the poles and after 10 years, my fence gave in,” she said. “Now my yard will be used by people going to the next street.” Her neighbour, Rooi Erasmus (58), lost his outside toilet due to flooding. “I want to move and I want the councillor to help us before it’s too late,” he said. “I can go to the bushes to relieve myself but I’m worried about my children.” Nomvula Baokudi (45) said her sofas and two wardrobes were damaged by water. “There is a furrow across the street which floods during heavy rains,” she said. “Our ward councillors have always known about this problem.” She said she has asked her neighbour Dirk Santho to build a low wall in front of her door to try and stop the water from coming in. They said they planned to sell their RDPs they got in 2010. “I will even swap my RDP with anybody who wants it,” said Nomvula. Moitheri Mokhethi (47) said he built back rooms for tenants and they were not happy. “This problem is hitting me in the pocket because the situation is chasing my tenants away,” said Moitheri. Ward 8 councillor Masabata Qwema said she was not a councillor 10 years ago. “I have checked the problem. The water was from the road and passing cars splashing water into the people’s yards and houses. We will have to come up with a plan to build stormwater drains but in the meantime, I ask residents to be patient because of the lockdown,” said Qwema.
