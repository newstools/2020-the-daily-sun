LEBOGANG Manyama has raised concerns Kaizer Chiefs could struggle to pick up their form from where they left off when the 2019-20 Absa Premiership resumes, following the nationwide lockdown caused by the coronavirus. The striker from Alexandra in Joburg, says the break will have a negative impact on them rekindling their engine that was well oiled. He reckons it will take a lot of mental work to get back to the groove of things, but has assured their fans they will fight to bring the PSL trophy to Naturena, “not after leading the pack for the better part of the season”. “We will not let our fans down,” he said. Before the league was suspended last month, the 50-year-old Soweto giants were at the summit of Absa Premiership log with 48 points from 22 games. They are four points clear of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns, who have a game in hand. “This break affects a lot and will take a toll on us,” admitted Manyama. “I don’t know when we will be back, but it is difficult. “We have been at the top the entire season and now this. “But there’s nothing we can do. We just have to wait until it is safe for everyone.”
