Mpumalanga community safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala has urged parents to stop using children as an excuse to cross from provinces. Shabalala who was joined by Gauteng Community safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko were conducting roadblocks on the N17 road between Leandra and Springs on Friday (24 April). She said they have noticed a trend whereby parents use their children to lie in order for them to travel from one province to another. "This is not the right time for visits, parents must stop forcing visitations during this time. The president was very clear that exception will be given to children who are under co-parenting, and that would be because their parents are divorced or separated,” she said. “People must stop using children for pity, they make them cry during our roadblocks. We are not going to feel pity for them hence we are asking them to continue complying," she said.  Shabalala said it’s only the court interdict that is going to be allowed as a document to allow people to cross with children. Several parents who were travelling with children without proper documentation were turned away meanwhile another man with a photo copied license disk was also arrested. Shabalala said since their conjointly operations are doing well, they want to emphasis that people must not make unnecessary movements. Gauteng community safety MEC Faith Mazinuko said they were concerned about the number of people who still take chances of travelling without proper permits."Some are carrying work permits that do not allow them to cross to another province. We wish to urge people that if you are working in Mpumalanga and every Friday you travel to Gauteng, you must be given a correct permit that allows you to cross inter-provincial so that when you are stopped on roadblocks you don't find yourself in trouble," she said.
