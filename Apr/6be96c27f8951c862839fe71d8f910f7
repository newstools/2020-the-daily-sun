A new date for the Olympic Games has finally been set after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that the Games will now be held between 26 August and 5 September in 2021. The IOC and the Japan Local Organizing Committee (LOC) bowed down to the international pressure from various sporting organizations to postpone the Games due to COVID-19 outbreak. The World  Health Organization declared Coronavirus a world pandemic and that also left IOC with no choice but to postpone the Games. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) had written a letter to Thomas Back the president of IOC to request for a postponement and their wish was granted. Athletics South Africa (ASA) president Aleck Skhosana has welcomed the due date for the biggest sporting event in the world. ASA will now be able to align its events in line with the new date. “This is good news. It will now allow coaches and athletes to re-align their preparation programmes towards the bigger picture,” said Aleck Skhosana, the President of ASA. “The early announcement is obviously on assumption that the virus will be defeated soon or reduced to a manageable point that will allow for the resumption of full training by athletes around the world.” “We are aware that our world governing body is in talks with the Commonwealth Games Federation to align dates in the light of the Olympic Games and is also working to find new dates for the World Athletics Championships in Oregon in 2022. The outcome of these discussions will assist all federations, athletes, coaches and sponsors to put our ducks in a row.” Added Skhosana.
