TIGER Brands confirmed it has temporarily closed its Durban bakery on Wednesday. Twelve Albany employees have tested positive for Covid-19. The company said none of the 12 are involved in the production line or the delivery of the bread. It said they all work in the administration division. The company said an employee who wasn’t feeling well was tested and the positive results were received last Thursday. It said all employees who had come into close contact with the employee were identified and sent for testing and self-isolation. “The testing was subsequently extended to all staff in the admin building,” said the company.  “Twelve employees tested positive for coronavirus and are in self-isolation.” It said that, according to the World Health Organisation and other authorities, there’s currently no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus. “As a result of the bakery’s closure, the bread produced in this facility on Wednesday has not been dispatched. “As a company, we have followed a pre-emptive preparatory approach to quickly, safely and responsibly respond to both suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 among employees,” it said.
