 THE Nasrec Expo Centre is expected to be ready as an isolation and quarantine site from next Friday. The site is expected to have 500 beds for the first phase, with the option of having up to 2 250 beds when the need arises. Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku, said: “This facility will only deal with isolation and quarantining, but with the need and demand we will be able to put up an almost 300 bedded ICU.” Masuku was speaking during his inspection of the site in the south Joburg yesterday. With Gauteng being the epicentre of Covid-19 in Mzansi, Masuku said the province needed to be prepared, even if it meant over preparing for the outbreak, especially after the lockdown eases down. He said some work was also being done to increase the capacity at existing hospitals. “We want to have structures that we can use after the pandemic, not structures that we going to destroy,” he said. He added that Tshwane District Hospital was Covid-19 ready in terms of beds. “We have earmarked Steve Biko to be one of our hospitals in terms of capacity. We’ve had to create more beds so that we’ll have one hospital that will be able to handle the load for Tswhane. “The plan is to turn the hospital to be able to admit only Covid-19 patients,” he said. George Mukhari, Jubilee, Chris Hani Baragwath and Kopanong hospitals are some of the facilities whose capacity would be increased.     A lot of businesses have been badly affected since the start of the lockdown, however, there may be light at the end of the tunnel for kasi based BnBs. Masuku said: “We are also going to be in discussion with BnB owners around Soweto and Joburg to see how we can assist them for their facilities to also be used for quarantining and isolation purposes.” He said discussions have already started and the only thing left was facilitating the rates. He said it was part of their plan for the Department of Health to contribute to economic development and job creation.
