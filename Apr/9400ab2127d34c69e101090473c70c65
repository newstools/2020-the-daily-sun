FORMER Baroka coach Wedson Nyirenda believes his countryman and struggling Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda is still frustrated. This after Lidoda Duvha refused to allow him to join one of the big Absa Premiership teams at the end of the last season. Musonda ended last season on a high in demand by a number of top clubs. He was PSL’s leading goal-scorer with 16 goals and won the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot award. The Zambian international was linked with a move to the likes of PSL defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United. There were also reports that the28-year-old was heading to China for a big money move. “But that also didn’t materialise, which also frustrated the former Orlando Pirates player. “I believe Musonda worked so hard last season, and that could have been to attract bigger offers somewhere else. “And if you remember, he was on the Chiefs radar and many other bigger clubs in PSL,” “It’s so frustrating to be in a position where you work so hard hoping to be recognised by other big clubs and get excited when you hear there’s an offer. But then you also hear that your club has turned it down,” said the former Zambian national coach. “So, it’s really difficult to get motivated to do well after your club turns down your dream move. I think that’s the case with Musonda.” This season, Musonda has only managed to score five goals, with six matches left to the end the season. But Nyirenda believes Musonda will turn the corner when the season reopens after the Coronavirus crisis. “Despite struggling this season, Musonda is a lethal striker. I gave him his first national call-up. He’s a striker who can turn things around anytime,” said Nyirenda. “True that this season hasn’t seen him smiling after a very good run last season, when he got the Golden Boot award. “But knowing the young man, he’ll pull through and come back strong and score more goals.”
