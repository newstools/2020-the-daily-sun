DEFENCE force chief General Solly Shoke visited soldiers at Tshwane Regiment in Tshwane yesterday. He was accompanied by defence force chaplain general, Brigadier-General Monwabisi Jamangile. According to the force, the aim of the visit was to engage with soldiers to boost their morale and strengthen their work in supporting government efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. They also visited roadblocks around Tshwane where soldiers were deployed to support other law enforcement officers. Shoke said everyone had the responsibility to protect themselves, those around them and the nation. “If any individual is irresponsible, we have to deal with him accordingly because he will threaten millions of lives and that cannot be acceptable,” he said. Jamangile said the troops should control themselves professionally. “As soldiers we must be professional in thinking, talking and doing our work. This is how we have been trained and that’s what the chief of defence is expecting from us.” He said soldiers should help people who don’t understand the danger of this enemy. “We’ll continue to do so until we’re called to step down in assisting our people. They must see us as people who assist them.”
