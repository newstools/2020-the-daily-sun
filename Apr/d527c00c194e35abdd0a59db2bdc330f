When choosing a wife, you have to consider qualities other than just beauty. Some men are lucky to have been blessed with wives who have brains to think and are real helpers. Others are stuck with blood suckers who want to be given money to spend on useless things. You need a wife who can support you whenever things go wrong, and one who’s able to save money to help build your home. You need a wife who is going to understand that you are earning a small salary and use it wisely. Most men who dated brainless beauties have nothing today as they spent all their money on these blood suckers for years. Wake up now because you don’t know what the future holds for you as you age.
