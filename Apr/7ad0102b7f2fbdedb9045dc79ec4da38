Late actor, Sipho Ngema's daughter, Mbali Ngema says no one was scamming people using her dad's name. On Monday, a screenshot of a lady called Gugulethu Xofa asking for assistance for Sipho Ngema's burial was shared on social media. That was said to be a scam and Mbali says it was not. According to Mbali, Gugulethu was Sipho's colleague. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mbali said: "After my dad passed on Tuesday, I approached the production that daddy worked for to ask for help with the burial. The lady I spoke to said I should write a message and put my contact details, my name and account details so they could share with people that are willing to help. I did that and I sent it to her, she responded and said she is circulating the message. The message went viral on social media on Saturday."

Some people contributed. Gugu and another colleague, Thomas, then started a WhatsApp group for daddy's colleagues, where they could talk about how they can assist," she said. She said she wants people to know that her family did need assistance and there was no scam. Mbali said: "Nobody scammed anyone, everyone who shared that message was legit. I also want to clear the names of my daddy's colleagues. Lastly, I want to thank everyone who helped with the burial." Sipho was buried today at Olifantsfontein in Kempton Park.
