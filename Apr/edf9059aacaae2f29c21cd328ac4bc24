Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene has revealed that he is working on obtaining his coaching qualifications as he prepares for life after hanging up his gloves. The Zambia international believes there is immense talent in his country and he is eager to help nurture the gifted goalkeepers who emerge in the future. "I said I am moving away from the national team for some time, or to be excused because at that time I needed to concentrate on my coaching course I am currently doing with a Spanish institution," Mweene told LusakaTimes. "I sat [and learned] under the likes of Kalilo Kakonje, Davies Phiri among others. "I stayed on the national bench for four years watching all these guys and that's how I got my experience." "In as much as I am playing, I am also training as a goalkeeper coach. I want to get the right qualifications and combine them with my experience to instil knowledge in the talented young goalkeepers," he added. "We have many talented goalkeepers in Zambia, but we are lagging behind in terms of qualifications for goalkeeper coaches and my desire is to be a goalkeeper coach. "I started to do this training while I am still active in goal so I can combine theory with practicals." - TEAMtalk media
