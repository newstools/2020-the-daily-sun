FREE State has taken a decision that all dead bodies will be tested for Corona virus. This is after a 77-year-old man who had died was found to have contacted the virus after his body was swabbed. Free State health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said they will now swab the dead bodies in order to trace the people that the dead had been in contact with while still alive. Five men had died of Covid-19 in Free State. Mvambi said this could be the first tile that a dead body taken a sample and tested for Covid-19. The 77-year-old man lived in Langehovenpark in Bloemfontein before he died on 9 April. Mvambi said a sample was taken from dead body for testing. He told Daily Sun: "This could be first case in the country of swabbing of a corpse. We do not know where else corpses get swabbed. The man (77) died on 9 April and corpse was swabbed on 12 April 2020. He lived in  Langehovenpark in Bloemfontein." He said they will continue to take samples from dead bodies and trace the people that the corpse had been in contact with. The incident has prompted the department to swab all corpses in order to ensure that we know for certain if anyone has died of Covid-19 which may not have been seen when the person was alive. But it is also to ensure that we trace all the contacts of the deceased in order to test them to eliminate uncertainty about the prevalence of Covid-19 amongst unsuspecting people. This is an added quality assurance towards our efforts of flattening the curve and curbing further transmissions," said Mvambi. He added that by Sunday,  Free State has registered 102 Covid19 positive cases from inception. "Our death tally in the Free State is now standing at five and we have seen 74 recoveries," said Mvambi
