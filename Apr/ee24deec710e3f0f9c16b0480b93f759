COMPANIES have been accused by government of not claiming unemployment insurance financial benefits as provided in the economic stimulus package during the lockdown. During an inter-ministerial briefing of the economic cluster in Tshwane yesterday, Minister in The Presidency Jackson Mthembu said a lot of vulnerable employees could benefit from UIF but were not as their employers were not claiming on their behalf. “These employees were particularly in the agricultural sector and helpers,” said Mthembu. Labour and Employment Minister Thulas Nxesi said the UIF only paid 38% of the salary as this was a relief. “We have challenges where employers are not assisting their employees to claim. We have calculated that 220 000 employees are entitled to claim, but have not done so. We are endeavouring now to contact these individuals,” said Nxesi. Tourism Minister Mmamoloko  Kubayi-Ngubane said to date, the UIF received 103 000 applications, which represented about 1,75 million employees. “As of today, the cumulative amount paid since 27 April is R3,3 billion. Of the received applications, the UIF has proceeded 59 000 employers applications, which means 862 000 employees will receive their benefits,” she said. Of the lot, only 10 000 could not be processed due to errors such as banking detail. Employers have been informed to correct those errors so payments could be made. Kubayi-Ngubane said the UIF call centre was working around the clock to file applications, and had even increased its capacity from 75 agents to 400 so as to speed up the process. Unfortunately, Nxesi said freelance workers were not covered by the current legislation, so they could not benefit. However, he said after the lockdown the law would have to be revisited to possibly accommodate them in the future. According to Small Business and Development Minister Khumbodzo Ntshaveni, those offering artisan services would be covered through a fund meant for small businesses.
