overturned the decision to place the City of Tshwane under administration. The application was brought forward

Maile, pointed out several challenges which led to the government to interfere
by placing the City under administration. The court made its decision on
Wednesday. It has found that the decision was
unlawful, it ruled in the favour of the DA and the costs were awarded in their
favour too. “Interference from one sphere of the

only be resorted in exceptional circumstances,” said the court. The court ordered the Tshwane ANC and
EFF councilors who kept breaking quorum effectively making the council

the judiciary of the Republic of South Africa,” it read
