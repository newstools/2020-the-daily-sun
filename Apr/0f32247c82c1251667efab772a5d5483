FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Sibusiso Kumalo is still hopeful of resurrecting his football career. The 29-year-old’s contract was terminated by Sundowns at the end of last season. This after he returned to Chloorkop following a loan stint with Bidvest Wits. He was looking for more playing time with the Milpark- based side but little came his way. Since then, Kumalo, who joined Sundowns from Moroka Swallows at the beginning of 2013-14 season, has had no club. “I’m at home at the moment,” said the 29-year-old. “I don’t have a team since my loan with Wits last season. Sadly, my contract was terminated at Sundowns.” Despite little success coming his way with Sundowns, he was with the Tshwane giants when they won the league title in 2013-14 season, Caf Champions League and Caf Super Cup in 2016 and 2017 respectively. He also won the MTN8 in 2012 with the Dube Birds under coach Zeca Marques. Kumalo said things have been tough after he was released by Downs as no club has approached him. But giving up is his last option. However, his hopes of a comeback suffered a further setback due to the outbreak of coronavirus that has forced the PSL to suspend both the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship indefinitely. “It has been tough,” revealed the Katlehong-born player, who Downs also loaned to Maritzburg United and Jomo Cosmos. “But there’s nothing I can do. It’s football and things like this happens. But I remain positive. I will keep on working hard until something comes up.”
