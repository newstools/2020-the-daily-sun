They said they were angry, hungry and in debt! The gatvol workers of KLT Automotive and Tubular Products said this during a protest yesterday. Employees of the company in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said more than 800 of them had not been paid their wages since March and demanded answers from management. Sipho Nkuna told Daily Sun: “We apologise to the president and the nation for violating the lockdown regulations.” Sipho said they were promised their money two weeks ago but were still waiting. “The president said all employers must pay their employees, but that’s not happening with us,” he said. “We have cars and houses to pay for. We’re hungry and angry. There’s no social distancing here. We’re putting our lives in danger. That’s how desperate we are.”  The company’s HR head, Kenneth Fakude, said they’d been engaging with the workers’ representatives. He said the company hadn’t been making any money since the lockdown started. “We’ve taken a step to apply for the temporary employer-employee relief scheme of the UIF,” he said. “We’re still waiting for a response from the Department of Labour regarding this. We’ve followed all the procedures.” He said they didn’t promise workers cash but paid wages for four days’ work recently.
