He was caught on camera in Welkom, Free State, on Tuesday calling residents “boesmans” while welcoming soldiers. “In Bronville, jy weet mos party van die boesmans. They take chances. Don’t hesitate. I talked to them yesterday, but when you’re not close then they drink again.” MAN DISAPPEARS FROM HOME TO QUARANTINE WITH NYATSI He jokingly tells the soldiers to skop and donner if necessary. Resident Piet Swarts (31) said: “Every race loves alcohol. I was hurt when it was implied coloureds love it more than any another race. “The worst part was when the mayor called us boesmans. That’s hate speech and I want to hear him account and apologise.” Councillor Khoarai Tlake said Speelman made another video and apologised. In the latest video posted to Facebook, Speelman says: I wasn’t undermining you. I want to apologise to everyone in Bronville, particularly coloured people. TB JOSHUA: THE HOLY SPIRIT MISLED ME! “On the issue of ‘skop and donner’, the president said the people must comply. I said if people fail to comply, soldiers must act. I apologise for using the word. It was a slip of the tongue.” Daily Sun tried to phone the mayor, whose phones were on voicemail.
