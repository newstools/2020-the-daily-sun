THEY protect spaza shops yet everyone ekasi is terrified of them. The spaza shop owners apparently hired the vigilantes after fearsome goons leaned on them or robbed them! The shop owners trust them with their lives, but they’re too trigger-happy for people’s liking. “Even when shop owners hear a rat moving they call them and they come running,” said Dina April (40), a resident of Makause squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. “We can’t live like this. We’re human beings.” WHAT MAKES A GREAT PUNANI? Residents accused cops of protecting the vigilantes, known as Nkanyamba. “Cops think they bring order yet they terrorise us,” said Gideon Mathabela (60). On her way from work a few weeks ago, Evelyn Ndaba (35), , had to run to her shack after hearing bullets whizzing over her head. “Dishes in the kitchen rattled and some broke.” Nhlanhla Nkabinde (50) said he uses a catheter after a bullet ripped through his lower body. He tried to open a case but cops wouldn’t give him time of day. “I go around carrying my own waste. My intestines stick out. It’s painful.” Shop owners confirmed they’re protected by Nkanyamba.  “They protect us from tsotsis. We pay about R500 or less,” said a shop owner. The cash is for protection against looteers and robbers! The big boss of Nkanyamba, Nkunzi Malinga, admitted that he protects Makause and Marathon spaza owners. “These people feed us,” he said but denied taking money forcibly. “It’s wrong of members to shoot randomly and put lives at risk. They must take thugs to the cops.” Primrose cops spokesman Sergeant Styles Maome referred Daily Sun to provincial police. Captain Kay Makhubele advised victims to go back to the cop shop and, if not helped, to phone him.
