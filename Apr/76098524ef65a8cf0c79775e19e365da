Singer Sha Sha is giving fans an acoustic version of amapiano songTender Love. This Kabza Da Small and Maphorisa track is a hit. She said she needed to do the acoustic version so music lovers could experience her versatility. The singer’s real name is Shamiso Maphimbiro (25), and she’s from Mothare in Zimbabwe. She told SunBuzz she wanted to expose her fans to another side of her music outside of her being an amapiano queen. “Tender love is that moment when you break up with a loved one and realise you’ve just lost a dime, someone who’s dear to your heart. “It’s about trials and tribulations. It’s a love song that’s inspired by people’s experiences. “I’ve heard this from love stories, and from some of my personal experience as well.” Sha Sha said this version of the song will let people into her sound, which she described as heart-warming, refreshing, and soulful. “I make music that heals, I hope. I don’t want to box myself. I respect all music genres and their effects. “The goal is to touch as many people as I can. And if that means me tapping into other people’s pockets of music, then so be it. I want to heal.” She said the reception to the song has been overwhelming, and seeing and hearing people sing the music she made from the heart was magical. The singer, who released her EP Blossom last year, said her mum used to teach her gospel songs in the kitchen, and she later joined the school. “I did music as a hobby at first, but my family and close friends encouraged me to take it seriously, and those encouraging my potential really kept me going and believing in the music. “I haven’t been in the game that long, but I’m learning. I’m spending time investing in the craft.” Fans can look out for Sha Sha’s music videos, which she said will be coming out soon, and she’s also working on an album. The acoustic version of Tender Love is available on all digital platforms.
