One of the
suspects involved in Simphiwe Sibeko's murder has been arrested.  The 22-year-old
linked to the murder of the 14-year-old Soweto teen was arrested last night in
Snake Park by SAPS members.  Last Friday, morning
Daily Sun reported on a body that was discovered by a passerby at an open space
at Emndeni extension.  Emndeni
community members expressed pain saying this is the third brutal incident
towards women in three weeks.  Police
investigations revealed that the victim was reported missing on Thursday last
week at the Dobsonville SAPS.  According to
Simphiwe's grandmother, Joyce Sibeko, she left home on Thursday at about 17:00
going to the tuck-shop to buy, and she never returned.  The following
day, the grade 9 Aurora Girl’s high school learner was found dumped half-naked,
allegedly raped and brutally murdered.  SAPS spokesman
Dakalo Phemula confirmed that following thorough investigations, police managed
to arrest one of the suspects and the second one is still on the run.  Executive Mayor
of Johannesburg Geoff Makhubo condemned this act of cruelty.  "We can’t
tolerate such barbaric acts in our societies. It's the responsibility of men to
protect women and children," he said.  Makhubo added
that they came to cry with the family and strengthen them in during their time
of grief.  "I'm
pleading with community to work together with law enforcement to expose these
criminals. I say this because they live among the community yet they are
animals. They should be locked up and never be released," he said  The arrested
suspect will appear in court soon.
