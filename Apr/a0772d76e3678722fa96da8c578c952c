Fourteen of 16 coronavirus patients admitted to Glen Grey Hospital in Lady Frere in the Eastern Cape almost two weeks ago, have been discharged, according to the provincial health department. They were discharged on their 11th day in hospital, spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said on Tuesday. "Two others are still under quarantine in hospital and will spend seven more days being treated." They were admitted from a bed and breakfast in Cala, where they had been in quarantine.     Kupelo urged locals to continue staying home and to adhere to the lockdown regulations, wash their hands and keep a safe physical distance.  "That is how we will beat this because the virus moves when people move. We need to be disciplined and be law-abiding citizens. The regulations are there to save lives." https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-14-people-discharged-from-eastern-cape-hospital-after-recovering-20200428
