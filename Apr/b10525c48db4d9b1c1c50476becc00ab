 Jabu “Shuffle” Mahlangu was feared by defenders for his dribbling skills and top of the drawer goals for Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana. He was also nicknamed “Ngwana wa Tshwenya” aka “Problem Child” for his wayward behavior, a life of girls and fast cars, and disappearing acts before big matches. Now, Mahlangu has matured into a responsible citizen and a parent. He is focused on his career as a TV pundit and an ambassador for SuperSport United - and has done so well in the last couple of years in his job, which requires a clean and mature image. Just like millions of South Africans, Mahlangu is  also feeling the pinch and is frustrated by having to sit home and do nothing during the national Lockdown. He took to Social Media to vent out his frustration and to lambaste the Liquor Board that took SA government to court in order to open liquor trading during the Covid-19 Lockdown.
