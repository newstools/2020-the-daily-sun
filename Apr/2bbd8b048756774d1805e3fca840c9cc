SIPHE Gqabu (25) believes the fire was sent to kill him and his family. “I was outside the shack for no more than five minutes and the fire started in my bed,” said Siphe from Phantsikocingo squatter camp in Browns Farm, Cape Town. “It was not a normal fire. It was vutha that was sent to kill us,” said Siphe, who’s now homeless. Nozuko Gqabu (42) said she heard her brother screaming. “But the fire was very strong. We tried everything we could, but we couldn’t save the shack,” she said. “The people tried to help us but it was too much. Our cat was burnt in the fire but it survived. That shows us the fire was sent to kill us, but our ancestors protected us.” Neighbour Mncedi Zokwana (56) said whoever sent that fire wanted to kill the family.  He said the fact that only their shack was burnt is a clear sign the fire was sent to kill them. Jermaine Carelse, a spokesman from the City’s Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters responded to a fire incident in Phantsikocingo squatter camp at 7pm. “The fire was extinguished at 8.07pm and no one was injured,” said Carelse.
