TV productions are suffering as a result of the lockdown. Casts and crews can’t work as top shows such as Uzalo, Isibaya, The Queen, The River, Imbewu and Rhythm City had to stop shooting. However, there’s light at the end of the tunnel after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the country would move to level 4 of the lockdown on Friday. This allows for productions to resume shooting. Daily Sun asked some production companies when they would resume filming. The River’s creative producer, Percy Vilakazi of Tshedza Pictures, said: “While we don’t know when we’re going to resume shooting as we’re waiting for guidelines from government, we’ve already started looking into ways to make it a safer environment for the cast and crew. “For example, this may include the number of actors in a scene or the number of crew members that would be shooting. We made sure the environment was safe and disinfected even before the lockdown and checked everyone’s temperature.” ALSO READ:CORRECTIONAL SERVICES RECORDS 11 NEW CASES Uzalo publicist Nomfundo Zondi said they’d start shooting on Friday. Speaking for The River, Gomora, The Queen and Isibaya, head of PR and publicity at M-Net’s Local Entertainment Channels, Philly Kubheka said: “We can’t comment on anything for now until we understand how new restrictions on production work. So we’ll have to wait until the minister of arts and culture, Nathi Mthethwa, has addressed us.” Skeem Saam publicist Sumaya Mogola said: “We’re waiting for production to discuss whether we can go back to recording or not.” Speaking to behalf of Rhythm City, Imbewu: The Seed and Scandal!, e.tv marketing manager Makatseng Mokome said: “We’re still evaluating the risk and discussing the way forward. We don’t want to put people at risk. “We’re not in a rush. We work with people that are committed, so we’re always ahead of schedule. We have more than enough episodes. We’ll go back to work once we’re sure it’s safe.”
