It is alleged on Saturday, Xolani Maneli, his younger
brother and four other men were at a house in Phelakula Street. This is when an argument erupted over a backpack and a
speaker. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said in a
statement: “The Manelis’ then left with the speaker. “The four suspects followed them and attacked them in
Sigcawu Street with sticks and knives.” The younger brother reportedly managed to run away while
Xolani Maneli was severely beaten and stabbed to death. According to Naidu while police were busy at the crime
scene, they received intel that one of the suspects was nearby. Naidu said a 43-year-old man was arrested, and at 06:00 in
the morning, cops arrested two more suspects, aged 28 and 30 at their houses in
Phelakula Street. The suspects are expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth
Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
