The Gauteng Department of Health (GDOH)  has warned the public to report against the continous spread of fake news. This after screening  and testing became a challenge after a video about COVID-19 doing the rounds misled the public. The department explained that in the video the public is told not to agree to being tested, because the swabs which will be used for the tests are allegedly contaminated with Covid-19. Gauteng Health Department Spokesman Kwara Kekana said : “We wish to state categorically that this is not true and we can assure the public that the screening and testing will not expose anyone to Covid-19, in any way.” “We urge the public to take Covid-19 seriously. Over a million people globally have tested positive for the virus, and thousands have lost their lives, including 11 in our country, ” he added. Kwara said community health care workers in Gauteng are working with multiple stakeholders. He said this is done to  undertake a large scale community testing and screening programme which is aimed at contributing to interrupting the spread of COVID-19. “ It should be noted that anyone that creates or spreads fake news about Covid-19 is liable for prosecution. We urge members of the public to verify information before distributing it to others,” urged Kekana. Citizens are urged to report fake news to: Whatsapp line: 0769664015 or email fakenewsalert@dtps.gov.za.
