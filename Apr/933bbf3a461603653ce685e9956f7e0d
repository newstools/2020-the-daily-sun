HTERE WERE SMILES and joy as some
of the residents will go to bed with their bellies full. This was after a generous gesture
by Former football stars, Brian ‘Spider’ Baloyi and Jerry ‘Legs of Thunder’
Skhosana. Though they played for rival teams,
Kaizer Chiefs and Pirates, yesterday they came together for a greater course. Adelaide Ngulugulu (68) from
Alexander struggled to contain her excitement. She told Daily Sun, “I’m so happy,
because during this lockdown, it is a nightmare at the shops. We are
happy." “Even when I go to buy, I will buy
us a few items that are not here.” She said she was thankful to Brain
and glad that he has not forgotten them as his neighbors. Ethel Mofokeng (68) said, “We are
happy we don’t even know what to say, we didn’t see this coming. “This food will help because the
children are also at home.” Another resident, David Matthews
said “It is beautiful, it shows that some of the guys that have benefited from
our communities find it necessary to in these troubled times to give back to
the communities. Brian said, “We decided to embark
on a drive to see how we can help the communities.” “We reached out to Hollywood Bets,
we are thankful to them that we are able to do what we doing today.” He said as part of the initiative
that they have been doing over the last two years, with the school tournaments
they’ve hosted, this is just an extension. “What we doing here is just lending
a helping hand to the community. “The whole idea was motivated by my
mom and my older brother. He said that he hopes that other
football professionals would give back to the respective communities and shouldn’t
have to wait for their clubs to tell them what to do. Skhosana said they just want to be
grateful to the community by giving back to them because they are the reason
why they are the people they are today.
