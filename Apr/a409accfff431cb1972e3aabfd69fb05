THE deadly coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the world to its knees, has also delivered a knockout blow to Bukiwe “Anaconda” Nonina’s hopes of fighting for the IBF bantamweight title. Nonina, a former WBF bantamweight champion and two time Boxing South Africa Female Fighter of the Year winner, was scheduled to challenge for the IBF title held by Argentinean Maria Cecilia Roman. But it has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Nonina’s trainer, Harry Ramogoadi-Manaka, said Covid-19 has delivered a sucker punch to his charge. “Bukiwe was supposed to fight for an IBF bantamweight title, but this has set her back. She is a high calibre fighter and one of the best in the country. “This would have introduced her in the female world of boxing and we had great plans for her. It is just a setback, even though we still have an opportunity. It’s an inconvenience as it has also pushed us back,” said Ramogoadi-Manaka. According to the young trainer, the coronavirus outbreak has cost his fighter the title and an opportunity to unify with other credible title holders in her division. However, the world renowned SA boxing trainer Colin Nathan is hoping that the lockdown is lifted soon so that they can get back to boxing. “Obviously, this has held us back a bit. But with regards to my fighters in the world ratings, nothing is going to change. “They cannot be punished because there are no activity due to the pandemic, which is global. “My fighters will remain at the same position they are in when the Covid-19 ends. We will resume and go back where we need to be,” said Nathan. His fighter, Hekkie Budler, is a fight away from challenging for a WBC world title shot. He was scheduled to meet Alphoe Dagayloan from the Philippines in a non-title international contest. Meanwhile, Golden Gloves stablemates, the IBO cruiserweight world champion Kevin Lerena, Rowan Campbell and Ricardo Malajika all had their championship bouts cancelled due to Covid-19.
