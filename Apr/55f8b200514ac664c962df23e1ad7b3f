TS GALAXY boss Tim Sukazi says it’s difficult to monitor players’ progress during lockdown. Sukazi revealed they don’t have resources to keep track of what his GladAfrica Championship players are doing at home during the coronavirus lockdown. “We depend on players training under lockdown and what they want to do,” said Sukazi. “We have asked them to do as much as they can. There are many things that are not possible because a lot of PSL and NFD (Championship) clubs don’t have the resources that European clubs like Liverpool have to monitor their players. Can one local club raise their hand to say they have all the resources, I doubt.” Sukazi stressed that not knowing when the football season will resume also adds to their dilemma. “It’s not easy since we don’t know how long the lockdown will last, and when the season will resume. When we went on quarantine it was zero death with 500 confirmed cases of the virus, now things have dramatically changed, so how can we expect the lockdown conditions to be relaxed when the situation worsens? “It’s logic that if the situation gets worse there will be further measures needed to curb the virus,” he said. Despite the setback, the former football agent is confident Mabhudi Khenyeza will guide his side to finish the season in a respectable position, having eyed a promotion to the top flight within five years. They started on a poor note which also led to the resignation of coach Dan Malesela in February after their failure to defend the Nedbank Cup. Galaxy are sitting in 12th position on the Championship table on 28 points from 24 matches. “We went through a lot of changes this season. But we want to finish the season in a reasonable position. We don’t set a target because we know what we want. South Africa is lucky to have a coach like Mabhuti and in the next five years you will see what I mean,” added Sukazi.
