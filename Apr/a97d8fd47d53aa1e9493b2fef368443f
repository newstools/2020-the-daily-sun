The ongoing measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in little football of late and, consequently, next-to-no movement in the latest FIFA World Ranking. The latest Fifa World Rankings were released on Thursday, but due to the lack of international action in March, there was just a single change to the entire 210 country list. A whole raft of international fixtures, including qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup™ and other major tournaments, were postponed, while dates were redrawn for showpiece men’s events such as the Olympic Football Tournament, CONMEBOL Copa America and UEFA EURO. Amid this upheaval, the Ranking was impacted by just four matches – all friendlies – and, as such, remains all but identical to the previous edition. The solitary change sees South Sudan move into joint-168th position with Bermuda after the latter dropped a Ranking point thanks to a 2-0 defeat in Jamaica (48th, unchanged) on 11 March. Bafana Bafana remain in 71st position in the global list and number 13 in Africa, and might be there for a while with the international calendar uncertain and potentially only set to kick-off again in September. Senegal continue to head the African list, followed by Tunisia, Nigeria, Algeria and Morocco.Belgium sit on top of the global rankings, ahead of world champions France, Brazil, England and Uruguay. The five other teams involved in friendly matches since the global ladder’s last update were Panama (played twice – 81st, unchanged), Uzbekistan (85th, unchanged), Belarus (87th, unchanged), Guatemala (130th, unchanged) and Nicaragua (151st, unchanged). The next FIFA World Ranking will be published on 11 June 2020.
