LOCKDOWN or not Implats mine employees have to return to work next Tuesday,
14 April. They have received messages saying they should return. Many said they fear
going to work because they can be infected with COVID-19. An employee who did not want to be named fearing he might lose his job said
he is shocked because mines are not part of essential services. "Twice the president has addressed the nation and not once has he
mentioned mines as providing essential services. These people are risking with
our lives. We cannot go back to work under these conditions. Management claims
they will provide training and protection but it's not enough," he said. However, Implats confirms sending out the messages. Spokesman Johan Theron
said that was done after their application to turn other areas in the mine
essential was granted by the Department of Mineral Resources. "The workers will not be coming to work for production but to get the
place ready to start production once the lockdown is over. "We are not recalling people to start production but to prepare
machinery and equipment. The mine standing is a problem, things break and need
to be attended to. "The workers will ensure underground is ready, that water is not
flooding, and there's no zama zama dealings. They will also sanitise and
install protective equipment to deal with the virus. They're only coming to
prepare the mine for the 40 000 people who will come after the lockdown is
done," said Johan.
