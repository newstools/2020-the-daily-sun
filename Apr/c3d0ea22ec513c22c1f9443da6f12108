EMILY Makhubela (27) from Arthurstone Village in Bushbuckridge was stabbed to death on Tuesday, allegedly by her ex-lover. Caiphus Makhubela (61) and his wife Mavis Ndlovu (46) said the couple had two kids, but had been separated for years. Emily reportedly left home early to go to work as a domestic worker in Dwarsloop. Caiphus said it seemed the suspect ambushed his daughter on the street. “Villagers heard them arguing.” He apparently stabbed her many times before fleeing. Neighbour Lucas Sivalo (75) said they heard a woman screaming and saw a man fleeing. “Emily was lying in a pool of blood.” CPF member Bill Hlabela said paramedics were called, but Emily was certified dead at the scene. Mpumalanga police chief, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma said in spite of harsh sentences, suspects prey on women and kids. “This shows a lack of morals in society.” Colonel Donald Mdhluli said a case of murder has been opened and a man was arrested.
