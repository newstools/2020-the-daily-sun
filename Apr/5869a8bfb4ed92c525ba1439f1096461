ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte
has urged those producing face masks using the emblem of the African National
Congress (ANC) to stop. In a WhatsApp voice note, Duarte said it has
come to the attention of the ANC that there are private sector individuals
producing covid-19 masks using the ANC emblem. Some are making masks using old ANC T-shirts. “We are making an appeal to people not to
abuse the ANC emblem. We are also asking the ANC membership to understand that
Covid-19 affects everyone irrespective of which political party you may belong
to. “We cannot be selling masks that have
political party emblem on them and be hoping that people will support the
private sector in this regard, “This flies in the face of unity that is
being forged in fighting against covid-19…we urge you not to sell masks with
the ANC’s emblem on it,” said Duarte.
