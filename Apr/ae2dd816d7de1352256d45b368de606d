JUST yesterday it was announced that the Jaguar I-Pace had won the Auto Trader South African Car of the Year tittle. The Jaguar-Land Rover stable doesn’t seem to be basking in the glory of the win, and will be expanding its electrified vehicle line-up with the introduction of its latest plug-in hybrid system, which will debut in the company’s two best-selling vehicles. A 1.5-litre three-cylinder plug-in hybrid that effortlessly combines a conventional petrol engine with an electric motor to provide sustainable, efficient all-electric performance for shorter trips plus traditional power or combined petrol and electric drive for optimum efficiency on longer journeys will be introduced. According to Jaguar-Land Rover, the new technology is being introduced in the latest generation Range Rover Evoque and widely updated Land Rover Discovery Sport, making them among the most cost-efficient compact premium SUVs available. In a statement, Jaguar Land Rover Executive Director of Product Engineering Nick Rogers said: “The 147kW engine, combined with an 80kW electric motor on the rear axle, gives fantastic all-wheel drive capability and the perfect blend of performance, depending on your driving style.” Rogers said efficient electrification, downsizing and lightweighting also enables incredibly low CO2 of just 32g/km on the Evoque and 36g/km on the Discovery Sport.  Additionally, both vehicles have an impressive all-electric, zero tailpipe emission range of 66km and 62km, respectively. Jaguar Land Rover was the first company to launch a premium all-electric performance SUV, the multiple award-winning Jaguar I-PACE, and has confirmed plans to transform its Castle Bromwich facility to manufacture a range of new electrified vehicles, starting with the new luxury Jaguar XJ.
