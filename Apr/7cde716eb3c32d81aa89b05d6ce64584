Dear MizzB I’ve been engaged for three years. The problem is my fiancee and I have been trying to have a baby for months but with no success. What could be the problem as she’s not on any prevention method? Could this be a sign we’re not meant to be together? Dear Frustrated Being unable to fall pregnant can make one extremely anxious and worried. Stress has been known to be a factor that contributes to the attempts to having kids failing. When one feels under pressure and wants to achieve something really badly, they usually struggle to keep a clear head and this affects the process. Getting a diagnosis from specialists is always helpful, and will paint a clear picture of what the problem is. This will also determine the type of intervention and treatment needed. Consider going for relationship counselling to can get a neutral platform to express your feelings. All the best.
