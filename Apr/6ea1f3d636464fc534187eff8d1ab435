Finzo said he lost control at the robots after a truck that skipped the red light appeared."I was trying to avoid being hit by the truck when I lost control. I'm not injured but I'm not happy because the truck driver did not stop. Unfortunately, I did not get the truck registration number. "My car is damaged because of the reckless driver who skipped the red light. Had I not avoided the truck, I would have collided with the truck and stood no chance to survive. I am thankful to the Lord that I was not injured. I am happy that I had my safety belt on," Finzo said.  The Mangaung metro cops attended to the scene and a towing truck later arrived. Hennie Waren from Cobra Towing said by the looks of things, the car suspension is damaged."The vender, ball joints and arm are damaged. But at least the car did not release the airbags," he said.
