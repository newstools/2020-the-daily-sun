A MAN accused of stabbing his ex-lover to death made a brief appearance in the Mhala Magistrates Court yesterday. The 30-year-old faces a murder charge after allegedly killing the mother of his two kids on Tuesday. Emily Makhubela (27), who was a domestic worker, apparently was on her way to work on Tuesday morning when she came across her ex-boyfriend. When an argument broke out between the two, the man drew a knife and allegedly stabbed Emily several times in the back, breast and on the neck. She was certified dead on the scene. Magistrate Tanya Du Preez told the accused he had the right to get a private lawyer or apply for one from the Legal Aid Board. The accused told the court he was aware of the charges and asked to be allowed out on bail. But prosecutor Connie Mashobela said the state intended to oppose bail. “The state is opposing bail as the accused is facing a very serious charge which falls under schedule six,” said Mashobela. Du Preez postponed the matter to 1 May for further investigation and for the arrangement of a lawyer from the Legal Aid Board. Emily’s parents Caiphus Makhubela (61) and his wife Mavis Ndlovu (46) said they wanted justice for their daughter after she allegedly suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of the suspect.
