Actress and singer, Letoya Makhene, shows off her new lover Lebohang Kheswa on Twitter. This is after their relationship was exposed by Sunday World over the weekend. Letoya posted the poster of the newspaper and captioned it: "Well, it was only a matter of time before the world found out about us @LebohangKeswa Here's to our beautiful future together, my love." Lebo shared snaps of herself and Letoya on Twitter as well. Lebo was once a spokesperson for the Gauteng Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Dikgang Moiloa. She was also associated with songstress, Simphiwe Dana, in the past years. Some people on social media weren't impressed by Letoya and Lebo's relationship, because Letoya is a mother of four and she has been married before. Other people were happy for the couple though.
