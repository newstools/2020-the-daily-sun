 A Joburg man says he was injured after police allegedly entered his shack in the city centre on Tuesday morning and opened fire with rubber bullets. Police moved into the Booysens informal settlement after a group of protesters set up burning tyres on Eloff Street to demand food parcels. LawrenceÂ Madihlaba claims he was sleeping in his bed when we was awoken by Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers kicking his door. "I was awoken by people running outside my shack. I then heard my door being kicked repeatedly and I went and opened. JMPD officers asked me where the other protesters were and I replied I don't know because I was in bed warming myself. "They accused me of lying and said I was part of the protesters. They asked me why was I wearing a pair of jeans and a jersey and I said I slept with my clothes on to warm myself as it was cold at night. They then opened fire on my foot three times at close range," said Madihlaba. After the shooting the JMPD officers disappeared, he said. Madihlaba said he removed three pellets from his right foot. He said he feared he could lose some of his toes as they were dislocated. "I don't know why they attacked me inside my shack. I was not protesting and I tried explaining to them, but they laughed and opened fire at me. They only focused on right foot as I was not wearing shoes," he said. He was later taken to hospital.
