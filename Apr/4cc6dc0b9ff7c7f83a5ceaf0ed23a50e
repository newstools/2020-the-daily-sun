BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt’s biggest concern during the lockdown is to have all his players fit and healthy when they report back for camp. The hard-to-please coach made it clear that he won’t tolerate players who report back for duty overweight. The Cape Town-born Hunt does not want lazy players as he has given them training programmes to follow during the lockdown. The four-time Absa Premiership winning coach said he is frustrated just like everybody else in the country and that he is hoping that the lockdown will not be extended. “I’m worried about the fitness of my players,” stressed Hunt. The former Black Leopards and SuperSport United coach said that the nature of the Premiership season requires fit players. “I told the players not to rest on their laurels and forget about their jobs while they are sitting at home. It’s important to keep fit and to stay healthy. I made it clear that they must watch what they eat as it could make them gain extra kilos,” warned Hunt. The ex-Moroka Swallows mentor said he misses his favourite sport, golf, and he expressed his desire to go hit a few balls once the lockdown is over. “I can’t play golf indoors. To enjoy golf, you must go to the golf course and play it with friends and colleagues,” said Hunt. In the absence of his favourite sport, Hunt has found a new hobby – reading books. “I read football biographies and watch football videos to boost my knowledge of the beautiful game. “There is not much that you can do when you are locked behind closed doors,” he said. Hunt said that football matters have taken a back seat for now as he doesn’t want to discuss his plans of beefing up his squad after the conclusion of the 2019-20 Premiership season. “People must adhere to the call of the president (Cyril Ramaphosa) and stay home so that they can be safe. This is not the time to talk about football or making plans about the game,” added Hunt.
