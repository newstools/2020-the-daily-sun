The Market Theatre will be going digital. Like most theatres that have been joining the digital world because of Covid-19, the Market Theatre will be hosting its virtual photo exhibition. The exhibition will be for Slaghuis II, a photo exhibition by photographer, Thembinkosi Hlatshwayo. “Slaghuis II is moving online so that our supportive community can continue to engage this body of work created during a yearlong mentorship. Over the course of five weeks, our social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) will delve deeper into the Slaghuis II and engage with Hlatshwayo about the motivations and themes at the root of the series. We encourage all to participate,” said Candice Jansen, the research and exhibition manager for the theatre, in a statement.
