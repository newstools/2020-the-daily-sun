FOR most couples, the day they get married is unforgettable in many ways. Yesterday should have held wonderful memories for a couple from Nseleni outside Richards Bay, KZN, as they were supposed to get married. IT WILL BE REMEMBERED – BUT FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS! That’s because the couple was arrested before they could say “I do.” Their perfect wedding was disturbed when Umhlathuze municipal officials, along with cops and defence force members, stormed the ceremony and arrested everyone present, including the pastor! They were arrested for exceeding the number of people who should gather during the lockdown, which is 50. All those who were arrested will face charges of not complying with lockdown regulations, as set by government to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Umhlathuze mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo said all those who attended the wedding were taken to Empangeni cop shop. “Their cases will be dealt with after the lockdown period. “They are charged with contravening, among other things, the Disaster Management Act and defying the lockdown regulations,” said Mhlongo.  He urged people to take the measures seriously as they were in place to save lives. He said: “The number of people being infected is rising sharply and we are now beginning to see people dying in the country like other countries. “The lockdown by government is aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus and to assist people not to be exposed to the virus by staying home for the duration of the lockdown. “We must commend all those citizens who are abiding with the rules and encourage them to do so until the end.  “We believe this is for our own health and survival.” National police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo confirmed that about 50 people, including the pastor and bridal couple were arrested.  “They are likely to be charged with the Contravention of the Regulations of the Disaster Management Act 2002” Naidoo told the People’s Paper.
