SHE left home to meet a man she had allegedly lent money to but never returned. The 40-year-old was later stabbed to death. READ: COMEDIAN TREVOR NOAH RECEIVES DEATH THREATS According to a source close to the woman’s in-laws, she received a call from a man believed to be her neighbour in Boitumelo in the Vaal. She then left her in-laws’ home in Sebokeng zone 13 with her 14-year-old daughter, but when she got there the man sent her child to a shop. “The child said when she returned from the shop the man chased her away and said he’d shoot her,” said the source. “No one knows how much money the man owed her and the family doesn’t know what the money was for.” When the SunTeam visited the shack where the woman was killed, a window was broken and there was a bloodied couch behind the shack.  The suspect’s mum said she had visited her son on the morning of the incident. “He left me and his wife, claiming he was going for a smoke next door. Moments later we received a call from him telling us he was now at the family home in Sebokeng. We didn’t mind, but it was suspicious that he left me at his home.” The mum said she received another call telling her something had happened at home. “We walked from Boitumelo to Sebokeng, and when we approached my house I saw scores of bystanders and cop cars. I was then told my son killed some woman in the shack.” She said her son allegedly tried to hang himself as they found an iron hanging from the ceiling of the shack. “Resident told us he told cops to shoot him when they came to arrest him,” she said. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder was opened and a suspect arrested. “A 40-year-old, who allegedly stabbed a 36-year-old woman, is expected to appear in the Sebokeng Magistrates Court tomorrow (today). “The deceased was allegedly at the suspect’s house in Sebokeng zone 13 to collect money she had lent him. The suspect allegedly stabbed the victim with a sharp object in the upper body,” he said.
