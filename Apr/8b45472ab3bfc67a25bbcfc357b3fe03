A BAD smell led cops to a butchery at Bara Taxi Rank in Soweto yesterday. And the police and health inspectors raided the butchery. They found that some of the meat in the store had long passed its sell by date, hygiene was not properly practised and some of the fridges did not work well. At the back, the meat was carelessly placed on the dirty floor of one of the freezers. As if that was not enough, health inspectors also found that the shop didn’t have proper business documents. The meat and other expired products were removed from the store and the owner was bust. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko said: “We were drawn by a smell and we decided to investigate where it came from. “We discovered that the butchery had all types of meat that had expired. The owner was arrested.” City of Joburg’s John Nyambi said they found there was an invalid certificate of acceptability. “The guy was told in previous inspections to apply for proper documents, but didn’t come to our offices. We are closing the business. He can’t trade without a certificate of acceptability,” said Nyambi. Cops then went to Dobsonville, where the streets were left clean and few people were arrested after flouting lockdown regulations. One person was bust for selling items that were not fruit and vegetables, while another one was arrested for cutting out slabs of lawn in the field.
