NORTH West Health MEC Madoda Sambatha has called for calm in Motswedi Village after one person who had visited the area died due to the coronavirus last week. Sambatha was addressing a gathering of not more than 100 people at the launch of the provincial roll-out of mass screening, testing and tracing of the virus in the village. He told the gathering that government decided to start the mass roll-out in Motswedi yesterday after it received reports from Botswana that the woman who died had visited Motswedi to attend a funeral.

Sambatha said the woman might not have contracted the virus in Motswedi as 82% cases of Covid-19 were mild cases. “Motswedi residents, you must not be worried that you’re the people who transmitted Covid-19 to that woman and Botswana citizens must also not worry,” he told the residents. He said his department had screened all the people who were in direct contact with the woman and started the process of screening everyone in Motswedi. Mosela Kausi, chief director at the Department of Health, said they screened 37 people and none of them showed symptoms of Covid-19. “We advised them to continue following regulations,” she said. The mass roll-out, led by Premier Job Mokgoro, is under way in the village.
