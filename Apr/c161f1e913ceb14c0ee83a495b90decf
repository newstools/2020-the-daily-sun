CHIEF of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), General Solly Shoke, visited soldiers at Tshwane Regiment in Pretoria earlier today. He was accompanied by SANDF Chaplain General, Brigadier- General Monwabisi Jamangile. According to SANDF, the aim of the visit was to engage with soldiers to boost their morale and strengthen their steadfastness in supporting government efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19. They also visited various roadblocks around Pretoria, where SANDF soldiers were deployed to support other law enforcement officials. Shoke said everyone had the responsibility to protect themselves, citizens and the nation. “If any individual is irresponsible, we have to deal with him accordingly because he will threaten millions of lives and that cannot be acceptable,” he said. Jamangile said the troops should control themselves professionally. “As soldiers we must be professional in thinking, talking and doing our work.This is how we have been trained and that’s what the Chief of Defence is expecting from us,” he said. He said soldiers should help people who don’t understand the danger of this enemy. “We will continue to do so until we are called to step down in assisting our people, they must see us as people who assist them,” said Jamangile. He added that God blessed them in their deployment. “Let’s be self-disciplined at all times as the Chief of Defence Force is in one line and is commanding a disciplined force. “Those who are practicing ill-discipline will be dealt with,” he said“Go out there and protect our people in a good manner,” he said
