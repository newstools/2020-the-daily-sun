FORMER Orlando Pirates striker Lyle Foster is pleading with PSL clubs to give more youngsters a chance to showcase their talent at a higher level. Foster, who plays for Belgian side Cercle Brugge on loan from French giants Monaco, said European Leagues are successful because they also believe in youth. Said Foster: “What I really want to see is more South African youngsters coming through and getting the opportunity to play in the professional ranks. “The boys in academies and the reserve leagues must get their chances to show how they can perform at a higher level.” The 19-year-old, who has now played abroad for 18 months, emphasised the youth have played a key role to help other clubs get success overseas. “In Europe, Borussia Dortmund’s two best players are 19 years olds. We can have a huge impact if given the chance,” he argued through a statement yesterday.“We must believe in young talent. Young players are hungry to prove a point, and can add a new dynamic and spark to the team.”Foster, an Adidas ambassador, who made his professional debut with Bucs at the age of 17 in 2017-18 season, said learning basics at a young age is vital.He went on: “In South Africa, serious development only starts around 13. In Europe, the top academies have age groups from age of six, where kids are already learning the basics of the game at a very young age, so they have a clear advantage when they move up to more competitive levels.“The other huge thing in development is parent involvement. I was fortunate enough to have parents who supported me every step of the way, and made huge sacrifices to help me get to where I am today. But many of the players I played with, their parents were not involved at all. It’s a big factor.”The Noordgesig-born player is also on lockdown in Bruges due to the coronavirus pandemic.“I do lots of home training and playing PlayStation with friends. It’s got to the point where I am even finding cooking and cleaning therapeutic,” he added.
