Dear MizzB I’VE been involved with my side man for over a month. The first time we slept together we didn’t use a condom. He did two rounds at night, but in the morning his 4-5 couldn’t erect. Afterwards he said when he urinated it hurt and went to the doctor. I also felt discomfort. We decided we’d use a condom when we poke. But every time he puts on the condom, he loses his erection. He said it never happens with his main chick and I never experience this with my main man, either. Please help. Dear Anonymous A sexual relationship between two people involves a lot of emotions and anxiety. When you know you’re with someone who has a partner, your conscience will always remind you of it. Erectile dysfunction is said to be caused more by psychological issues than physical ones. Your struggle might have to do with you guys “stealing” each other. Speak to your man and try relaxation techniques to help him lose his anxiety. Secret affairs are tricky, often not working out as expected.
