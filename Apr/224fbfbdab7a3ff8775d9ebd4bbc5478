THE call for large crowds not to gather during lockdown was disregarded in Port Shepstone, on KZN’s South Coast, on Monday. This after about 300 residents of Mkholombe gathered at Merlewood Secondary School to collect food parcels from NGO Gift of the Givers. The ward councillor was also part of the handover. But this gathering didn’t go down well with some residents saying people were at risk of getting infected by coronavirus. But others said they didn’t care because they were hungry. A resident said she didn’t like seeing so many people gathered in one place. She said she was not against what Gift of the Givers was doing, but they should have had a strategy to avoid overcrowding. “They should have called a few people at different times and not break lockdown regulations. By doing this, it seems they don’t care that cases are increasing daily in the province,” said the resident. Councillor Morafo Sello said he arrived to find that people were already at the school waiting for food parcels. He said he would have planned the handover properly if he was contacted two or three days before. Gift of the Givers’ Imran Mahomed said everything was in order until people demanded to enter the school. “Social distancing was practiced by people who were inside the school. “Ten people were allowed at a time to take the food and leave. “But there was chaos when people from the shacks arrived and demanded food,” he said.
