SANGOMA gogo Nongoku Makenana (88) says President Cyril Ramaphosa should consider sangomas as essential workers. For the month that Mzansi has been on lockdown, the gogo from Gugulethu in Cape Town has been frustrated as she couldn’t help clients in other provinces. “People are dying in their houses because we can’t help them. This is because we don’t have permits. Why are we not considered as essential workers? Our job is to save lives. I needed to go to the Eastern Cape but couldn’t because cops refused to give me a permit. They told me , wasn’t an essential worker and should wait for the lockdown to be lifted up,” said gogo Nongoku. Besides going to other provinces to heal her clients, gogo said she couldn’t go to the bushes to get muthi for her clients. “It’s unlike I’ll be going to the bushes for a month. “Not every sickness needs a hospital. Some need strong muthi from sangomas. The cops even refused to give me a permit to use around Cape Town,” she said. What frustrated her most was pharmacies had permits, yet some sold muthi just like her. She said there was no difference between pharmacies and sangomas. Gogo visited Gugulethu cop shop last Thursday. She said she wanted cops to take her to Ramaphosa so she could speak to him directly about the treatment of sangomas. “Cops said he doesn’t live in Cape Town, but in Gauteng. They told me he would address the nation that night and he’d tell us whether lockdown is ending. What he said was not useful, because we still can’t move freely as sangomas,” she said.
