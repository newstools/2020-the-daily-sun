THABO Maseko says his sister Zanele died alone in hospital. The death of the 36-year-old Mina Nawe singer and actress was announced on social media two days ago. Zanele, popularly known as Mazet, had been admitted in hospital for a week after complaining of a headache. Thabo said: “She suffered from headaches. We thought she’d get better like she normally did, but this time we realised her hand was not working when we got to hospital. Doctors informed us she’d suffered a mild stroke. “We were still hopeful she’d recover until we received the bad news this past Sunday that she’d passed on,” he said. “We couldn’t see her because of lockdown restrictions, but such is life and we unfortunately can’t change what happened.” Thabo said his sister was resurrecting her career. “She had released a couple of singles and was really trying to push a solo career. “We featured her music on one of the TV productions I was working on with my business partner, Sonnyboy Ndlovu.” TV producer Sonnyboy, who worked with Mazet on an upcoming TV series, said he was saddened by her death. “We’re going to miss her. She was a humble soul. “We’ve lost a lot. We used one of her songs as a soundtrack on our series, Isenzo Somubi.” He said the drama series was self-funded and they were getting it licensed with a local TV channel. Thabo said they hoped to bury his sister on Saturday.
