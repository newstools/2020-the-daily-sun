Churches have cancelled Easter services to curb COVID-19 spread. Maranatha Reformed Church of Christ (MRCC) in Mogwase outside Rustenburg will however bring the spirit of Easter to its members through the use of social media. Reverend Modisaotsile Motloba has urged religious leaders to act responsibly and not call for services in their church but instead encourage their congregants to engage in prayer within the comfort of their homes to stop the spread of the coronavirus. At the moment, public places including churches are a no go area. This creates a room for other ways of worship, said Motloba.Since the presidential address that suspended gatherings, believers have stayed in their homes following church services through social media platforms he said. "Much as this provides the much needed social distance, which is a preventative measure against the virus, it has affected how we fellowship. However it is a way that tries to take the church from a building to people’s homes," he said. "The church is not a physical building but rather, the heart of believers. "In times as such, when the church looks totally different, we are awarded time to spend with our families. This is also God's way of teaching us to look out for one another."With a congregation of about 300 people in his church, the spiritual life of these believers revolves around whatsApp group chats and other social media platforms. That is how they easily share sermons. "It was not an easy decision to make, but I did not want the church to be a killer. The  safety of the congregation is important."He argues that you have no worries of getting in contact with other people besides your family members. This means that the ‘stay at home’ rule is adhered to, yet church still goes on. He further added that ,"this is no time for the church to sleep, but to be vigilant and prayerful. knowing that we can enjoy a great time with God even in our house.
