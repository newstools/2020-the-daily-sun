PARLIAMENT has instructed Health Minister Zweli Mkhize to make the safety of health workers a priority and investigate the shortage of protective gear. Portfolio committee on health chairman Sibongiseni Dhlomo said there were concerns raised by unions about a shortage of equipment to protect health workers from the coronavirus. Nehawu has even threatened legal action against the minister. However, Dhlomo said Mkhize had promised to investigate. Parliament’s intervention came after Mkhize warned the country to prepare for a massive spike in cases. While launching 60 mobile testing sites in Joburg this week, he said the virus had started breaking out in vulnerable township communities. “Next month the flu season will start and these cases will flood hospitals and clinics,” Mkhize said. He said 45 000 people had been tested, which was far too low for a country with South Africa’s population. He said he believed the country could beat the virus if everyone did their part. The mobile testing sites formed part of the new phase announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his address to the nation this week when he said 10 000 health workers would be sent out to test people in their homes. “All clinics and hospitals will be asked to provide a daily tally. This will help us ensure we have enough stock of all the resources we need,” he said. Mkhize said testing sites would be set up in densely populated areas such as Alexandra and Khayelitsha, which both had confirmed cases. Everything possible would be done to protect heath workers.
