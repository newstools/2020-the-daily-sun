A HOLY man from Thohoyandou in Limpopo has been arrested for alleged spreading fake news in a recorded video. The prophet was arrested by the police today after the police got a tip off from local resident who were complaining about the video which was being circulated on social  media. In 1 minute 53 second video posted on Facebook last night, the alleged prophet is  denouncing the call by the state president of staying at home during the national lockdown. He said "They can lockdown the country for the rest of the year or for 5 years and they will not stop Coronavirus. Its coming, its there even if we are staying inside the houses they will not stop it. We are made to stay at home because of flue." "They don't even believe in prayer, your President never mention that we should pray against this. He mentioned a prayer long time ago. We are now suffering and people have stopped going to work. Let us go out and let our bodies get used to this pandemic." He said. MEC Dr Phophi  Ramathuba for Limpopo Health Department has welcomed his arrest. "We welcome the swift action taken by the police in apprehending the alleged prophet immediately after we alerted them.This will serve as a deterrent to many people who think it's business as usual to spread misleading information and fake news." "We will not tolerate anyone spreading fake news and insults directed at our President especially during this trying times where we are all called upon to fight the spread of COVID-19 pandemic" said Ramathuba.
