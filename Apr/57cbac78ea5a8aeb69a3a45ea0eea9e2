BLACK Leopards management have terminated the contract of striker Thuso Phala. SunSport has reliably learnt that Leopards boss David Thidiela has had enough of paying Phala’s huge salary estimated at R100 000 monthly while he is “not adding value to the team”. Thidiela declined to comment on the matter on Wednesday, referring it to his administrators. The 33-year-old Phala played a mere 13 matches for the club since his arrival at the start of the season from SuperSport United. The last time he played in a competitive match was on 21 December, when Lidoda Duvha lost 2-1 to Orlando Pirates in a Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium. Efforts to contact Phala were fruitless as he didn’t answer his phone nor reply to text messages. According to an insider at the club, Phala was hoping that the technical staff will allow him to play the remaining six league matches so that he could announce his retirement during their last game against Mamelodi Sundowns after the lockdown. But it is understood that Phala has bid farewell to his teammates and exited their WhatsApp group, telling them that he is no longer coming back. “Phala failed to break into the 18-man squad under coach Cavin Johnson and his situation never changed when Alan Clark took charge.” Leopards spokesman Barry Ramunenyiwa could not confirm nor deny Phala’s contract termination. He said: “I will speak to management and get back to you. But out of respect for Thuso, I think he should comment since he is the one who started the fire. It’s better if it comes out of his own mouth.”
