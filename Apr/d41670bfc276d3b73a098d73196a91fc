WITH six games left, the spectre of relegation looms large for several Absa Premiership teams, and you can expect the usual suspects to crawl out of the woodwork and avail themselves for relegation-escaping jobs. Here’s an assessment of the jobless coaches who are keen on a PSL return. GORDON IGESUND He last held a job as coach of Highlands Park and has been on a two-year sabbatical. The former Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns coach has a proven record with both the bigger and smaller teams. But in Steve Komphela’s words, who’s chair is he looking to cut? It would not be surprising to see him resurface at Black Leopards. KHABO ZONDO The former Tembisa Classic mentor has been off the PSL radar for some time and he may not attract as much interest. He has been doing work as a talent scout for the Nedbank Ke Yona Team Search project until the bank pulled the plug on the campaign. Almost every coach has mentored Chippa United and it could well be Zondo’s turn. Nothing is ever guaranteed at Chippa, not even for Rhulani Mokwena. DAN MALESELA Success in the Nedbank Cup with TS Galaxy has since elevated the status of Malesela to a point where he is linked with the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns. But Lionel Messi will have to leave Barcelona first before Malesela takes charge of an institution such as the Brazilians. However, he will be a good bet for a rescue job at Baroka FC, who are headed for choppy waters. CAVIN JOHNSON The mental scars from the traumatic experience at Leopards are still fresh for Johnson. But football comes only second to his family and Johnson wouldn’t have a problem rolling up his sleeves and getting his hands dirty on a relegation-survival job. He performed the task with aplomb at AmaZulu, helping Usuthu escape the dreaded axe after they were docked six points in September 2018. The 61-year-old will not be short of suitors for his services during the crucial relegation times.
