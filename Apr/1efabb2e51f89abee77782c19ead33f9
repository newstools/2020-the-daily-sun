THE KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala sent a strong warning to residents. He said residents don't obey the rules and this puts more lives at risk of getting the Coronavirus (Covid-19). Premier Zikalala revealed this in a media briefing at Mayville Durban this afternoon. The KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane- Zulu was also at the briefing. Zikalala said that in KZN there are 587 cases and 21 deaths across the province. He said the eThekwini region has the highest infections of 383 therefore they will intensify measures. Zikalala said all major townships are hotspots. "The reason for this is because in many townships people don't adhere to the lockdown rules.They are driving around as they please. The youth have also been seen gathered in groups on the road in the townships. They are not obeying the rules and they put more lives at risk," he said. He said each and everyday there are new cases recorded in eThekwini. "We will embark on an intensified screening and testing campaign. Working with SAPS, metro and soldiers we will have roadside blocks, movement checks especially in the townships. We willmonitor movement of transport, there will be no movement from one disctrict to another," said Zikalala. He said everyone who is tested will not be alllowed to self isolate or quarantine because they don't adhere to the rules, they end-up moving around. "People will now be isolated and quarantined in the different facilities which have been set for isolation and quarantining," said Zikalala. He said people in KZN need  behavioral change and these strict measures that will be put into place will assist in bringing that change. "Punishment will be given to those who undermine the regulations," said Zikalala. He said all this will be implemented as from tomorrow. "We are not bringing new rules but putting much stricter measures," said Zikalala. However, MEC Simelane Zulu said investigations into St Augustine Hospital and Kingsway Hospital are not completed yet.
