RESIDENTS of Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung can now sleep peacefully. This after they were tormented by a whistling and singing female ghost, which sang the hymn Hayo Mathata from 1am until 6am. Daily Sun published the story on 24 January last year. The SunTeam recently visited the area and residents said the family performed rituals to collect the spirit. But resident Thapelo Sereo (23) said the whistling and singing continued even after Daily Sun published the story. He said: “I thought she would stop singing after the story was published, but she didn’t. We could not see where the singing came from. We told ourselves we won’t be bothered if it doesn’t harm us, but we could not sleep.” Thapelo said the woman’s family came from Lesotho last month and performed rituals around the street.  Another resident, Adultia Nieuwoude (47), said she hadn’t heard the ghost since the end of last month and was now sleeping peacefully. The Competition Commission has referred pharmaceutical retailer Dis-Chem to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution for excessive pricing during the coronavirus outbreak, it said in a statement on Wednesday. From the end of March, the Commission received "several complaints from the public against several retail stores owned by Dis-Chem for engaging in excessive pricing of face masks, specifically dusk and surgical masks," it said.  “I have not heard any singing since I heard the family did rituals. I think the family saw the story in Daily Sun and knew it could be her. I want to thank Daily Sun and will continue to read it,” said Adultia. Sangoma Lenti Mosala said it was unlikely the ghost would come back if the family performed rituals.
