SINGER Gugu M has vowed to be different and hopes music lovers will enjoy her music. The singer, whose real name is Gugu Mbonambi, said she’ll win people’s hearts over by being herself. She said this is rare in the music industry. The 25-year-old from KwaThema in Ekurhuleni told SunBuzz: “I’m a new artist and I want people to know me, not a version of someone else. “That’s a recipe I think will work for me because being different always helps and makes you stand out. “I know that once people see that I am myself, they will support me. That’s my strategy. It will be good for my career.” Gugu released her debut single, Binnenkant, last month.

I knew I could sing, but last year I realised my talent would take me places. So I started working on this single.” The singer said she’ll drop an amapiano single titled Imizwa next week. She’ll also release an EP soon. “Binnenkant is also an amapiano song, but I don’t just want to do amapiano music. I’m also working on an EP,” she said. “It will have different genres which I’m still exploring.” She’d like to work with musicians such as Daliwonga and Njelic, and Scorpion Kings Kabza De Small and DJ Maphorisa.
