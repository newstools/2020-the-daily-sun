While most professional sports stars are using their time in lockdown to keep fit, Proteas speedster Kagiso Rabada is doing that little bit extra. The 24-year-old, enjoying a rare break from the game, is working hard to stay match ready but is also dabbling in the world of content creation where he has started a podcast with a friend, Cameron Scott, that is aimed at exploring everything that comes with the coronavirus. The podcast, Viral Wellness, is a project that seeks "to inform but also provide solutions through speaking to qualified people," Rabada told Elma Smit in an interview for the Jacaranda Breakfast show. "It started out as just a podcast, but we realised it could go much further than that," Rabada added. Two episodes have been aired so far, the first of which saw Rabada and Scott host a medical doctor while the second delved into how coronavirus is impacting the economy. The third episode focuses on mental wellbeing during the lockdown period. Rabada, who studied drama at school, added that while he loved sport and cricket, he had other interests that he wanted to explore. -SPORT24 Kagiso @rabada_25 talks about what he's up to in lockdown: he started a health podcast with a friend a week ago and they've got 3 eps out already, one of which is in Afrikaans (he doesnt actually speak Afr in it, sadly). He also shows us his room, talks about what he's getting around to now that he's got more time, whom of his teammates he misses the most, what he's watching on TV and what Cricket SA expects from the Proteas in this time off - in terms of staying in shape. @theviralwellness @jacarandafm @martin.bester A post shared by  E L M A S M I T (@elmakapelma) on Mar 31, 2020 at 9:20pm PDT
