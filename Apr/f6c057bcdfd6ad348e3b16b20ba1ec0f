About 8 inmates at the Barberton Prison in Mpumalanga will face a disciplinary hearing after they participated in a soccer game inside the prison's courtyard on Tuesday. The offenders are said to have contravened the regulations of the lockdown. In a video sent to Daily Sun, the group can be seen enjoying some time out in the yard. Ehlanzeni Correctional Centre communications manager Messiah Hlungwani told Daily Sun that before the lockdown, prisoners could use the courtyard as an exercising space, but things have now changed. Hlungwani said few offenders were seen playing soccer at the courtyard and they were immediately told to stop since contact sports is not allowed during the lockdown period. "The ball which they used to play with has since been confiscated and the offenders who participated will face internal disciplinary processes," he said. Hlungwani said this was the first group to break the rules and regulations of the lockdown since its inception. He further warned prisoners who will attempt to do the same that they will also face disciplinary processes and if found guilty appropriate sanctions will be applied.
