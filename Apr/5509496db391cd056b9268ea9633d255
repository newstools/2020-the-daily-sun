TV personality Ntando Duma joined Robot Boii this past weekend as a presenter at the Channel O Lockdown House Party hosted by Shimza and PH. One tweep commented on her outfit. The person disclosed their love for Ntando and then made a comment about her stomach and later deleted the tweet. Ntando has been at the receiving end of body-shaming especially on social media and has learned to hit back at tweets that body-shame her. Speaking to the SunTeam Ntando said body-shaming comments on Twitter do not get under her skin anymore because she realised that people who make such comments are not comfortable with who they are. “I have made peace with bullies because they are not comfortable and confident enough with their skin and body. The only way for them to feel better is to bash the next person who is very much comfortable with whatever they have. I have decided to send love to such people because if you check the person who tweeted about my Mkhaba has a bigger one than me.” Ntando said she was sending the person who body-shamed her love because she realised that the comment was not about her but what the person thinks about herself. “I normally clap back but this time I realised that the person needs loves. She needs to love and accept herself. People think because we are famous, we have to be perfect. I am happy with the way my stomach is, I gave birth to a person and it shows, so what?”
