Not many soccer followers know about Benni McCarthy and Desiree Ellis... They have both represented Mzansi at Bafana Bafana and Banyana Banyana with aplomb. The two soccer legends, who have had a glittering success on the field of play, have so much in common - Both ELLIS and BENNI GREW UP IN HANOVER PARK, in the notorious Cape Flats in the Mother City. Hanover Park is an area in the dangerous Cape Flats and it is notorious for its high unemployment rate, ruthless drug dealers, gang violence, drug addiction and high levels of crime. Ellis attended school at Salt River but her family later relocated to Hanover Park as the family got bigger and their house got smaller. She started playing soccer with boys in the neighborhood and he passion for the game intensified. She then joined local clubs such as Athlone Celtic. Ellis is still staying in Hanover Park and was recently quoted in the Cape Argus saying that it is not the place where you stay that shapes you. “I’m staying for the past 40 years in Hanover Park and a lot of people were shocked when they heard where I stay. I’m also regularly asked: 'you are the national coach, so why don’t you move out of Hanover Park?' My presence in Hanover Park is an encouragement to the community. Know your words and value where you come from. Look at Ronaldo, who grew up in the poorest neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and ended up becoming a leading striker in world soccer,” Ellis was quoted. Benni also grew up in the same ghetto and started playing for local teams Young Pirates and Crusaders. He then joined Seven Stars and that's where his stardom came to rise. He is the only SA player to have won the Uefa Champions League when he played for FC Porto under Jose Mourinho.
