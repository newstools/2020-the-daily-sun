THEY may be cops, but they are also human beings! Those were some of the good words expressed by people on social media after Tshwane Metro cops helped a woman give birth in the early hours of Saturday morning. Metro police spokesman Isaac Mahamba said the woman came to the police regional offices in Centurion at about 1am, asking them to call an ambulance. “But she couldn’t wait for the ambulance,” said Mahamba. “Our officers in the charge office assisted her to deliver a baby boy.” He said both the mother and her baby were transported to the local hospital and were both healthy. Social media users couldn’t stop singing praises of the officers. On Facebook, Mapula Raphiri wrote: “My South African heroes. Thank you and well done. Congratulations to the mummy. May this boy grow up to be a hero in our country.” Beverly Moreland said: “Nothing more precious than helping to bring a new life into the world. “A very precious baby. We praise the officers for going beyond the call of duty to help the woman. They did a great job.” Eunice Sakiri said: “Thank you very much. You do so much for the nation and yet little is done to recognise your sacrifices. Glory be to God for giving you the wisdom.”
