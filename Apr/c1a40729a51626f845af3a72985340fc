A man who was allegedly attempting to steal cables at a
sub-station in Joburg burnt to death on Monday evening. At least four City Power substations have been destroyed as
a result and nearby resident have been left in the dark. The man was electrocuted while climbing the 88KV electricity
tower. City Oower spokesman, Isaac Mangena said it is not clear
why he climbed up but vandalism which is rife in the area, is suspected.
"The electrocution also led to an extensive damage on some of the
equipment including the 88kv red phase jumper on Eskom side," said
Mangena. He said the substations affected include Hopefield
substation - Lawley 1 and 2, Ennerdale substation - Ext 1 - 14; Lunar
substation - Migson manor, Finetown, Mountain view; Lenasia south substation -
Ext 1 to 4, Daxina Hospital and Joburg Water reservoir. Mangena said operators
from both Eskom and City Power are on site to investigate and do the repairs. "Police have also taken over the area as a crime
scene, which may delay the repairs and restorations," he said. He said it's still not clear how long it will take for
repairs to be done and for power to be restored. "We will communicate to
the residents when information becomes available. We apologise for the
inconvenience caused to the residents," he said.
