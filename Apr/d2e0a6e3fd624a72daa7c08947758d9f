Dr Phaahla said that this doctor was never outside the country, but only went to another province a month ago. "His symptoms were very typical like having more of pains in his general body than known symptoms of Covid-19. "The doctor is in isolation and stable at the hospital, but this must be a lesson to us for the future experience we might have.
