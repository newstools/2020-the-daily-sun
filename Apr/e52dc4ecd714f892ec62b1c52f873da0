SOCIAL distancing has become the norm in South Africa but for prisoners, it’s impossible. Daily Sun yesterday visited Joburg Correctional Services and spoke to an inmate serving a life sentence. Bongumusa Mdlalose from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said he had been in prison for 17 years and feared overcrowding would spread the virus. TB JOSHUA: HOLY SPIRIT MISLED ME! “Communal cells have about 70 inmates and single cells have two people sharing. There is little the warders can do because lock-up time is lock-up time and they have to take us to our crowded cells,” he said. Bongumusa said the slightest sneeze or cough raised eyebrows. “People become aggressive and defensive, which can be dangerous because at the end of the day, prison life is what it is,” he said. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku and Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo visited the prison yesterday to check that regulations were being followed. Lamola said: “We are doing our best to make sure everyone complies with health department guidelines so we can prevent the spread of this virus.” LOCKDOWN CHEATER BUST! He said the public needed to be aware of the possibility of fake news being spread about confirmed cases. “We must remember inmates have their own agendas and will do anything to get attention. Whatever allegations they have made, we have followed through and verified as false information,” he said. “Overcrowding has always been a problem, especially with this centre because new inmates come here before being transferred anywhere else.” The minister said they were trying to minimise movement by having conference court sessions. “A guarded inmate attends court through watching a screen where he will talk to the magistrate. We have attended to hundreds of cases in this manner,” Lamola said.
