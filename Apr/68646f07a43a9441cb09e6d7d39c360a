A group of South African artists and musicians find themselves stranded in Antalya, Turkey after the country went into lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. About 29 creatives from Mzansi are trapped in that country since early March, with most of them on a year’s contract with different companies. Sisipho Lundi, who's among the group, said they cannot work to sustain themselves since the entire country is also under lockdown.

He said they have contacted the South African Embassy in Turkey, but their attempts drew a blank. “Initially we spoke to our embassy here and received responses that left much to be desired, but we refused to be demotivated.” Speaking in a media briefing about similar issues last month Minister of International Relations and Corporation, Naledi Pandor said government was aware about South Africans stranded in different parts of the globe and they are working with those governments to repatriate them.
