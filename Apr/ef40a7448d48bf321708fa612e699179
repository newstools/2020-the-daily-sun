IF HE had it his way, health department spokesman Popo Maja would recommend that all sportsmen and women, including match officials, be screened and tested for Covid-19 before their respective sports resume. Maja said this would be the best way to minimise the risk of infections. Sports events globally have been suspended or postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. He would also recommend that players and match officials be quarantined after the tests in order for them not to mingle with other people until their official results are released, probably after 72 hours. “Testing is not a vaccine. I may be tested now but tomorrow I might be infected by the virus,” said Maja, adding that there is a lot that they still need to learn about Covid-19. “Testing on its own is not a measure of success. v aI’ll be very interested to know what the government would say before the season resumes. “Will these players and officials be in camp (and) quarantined until the results come back? “The only approach here is that they should be tested and quarantined. And being quarantined means you don’t mix with other people and you keep social distancing.” While the PSL is hoping to conclude its programme on 30 June to avoid complications, which includes player contracts and broadcast rights, the department sees it as impossible for league matches to be played every three days. However, Fifa has recommended that players who are out of contracts at the end of June must remain with their current clubs until the season is over. But this is yet to be implemented. Added Maja: “I cannot say if the season can be concluded in June. “This virus spreads faster in cold conditions.”
