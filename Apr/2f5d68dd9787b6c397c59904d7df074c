TWO men aged 32 and 37 were arrested on Sunday morning after they were found in possession of a suspected stolen vehicle and live bullets. According to the police, the arrest came after they were notified about a man who was in possession of a firearm. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the police followed up on a tip-off when the man who tried to run away from the police was cornered. “The police then went to the man’s home and a thorough search was conducted whereby a green Toyota Tazz that did not have an engine was discovered,” said Hlathi. "Preliminary investigation revealed that the car was reported stolen at Sabie last year in September.”He said the police further made a second arrest whereby a man was found with live ammunition after being searched. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant - General Mondli Zuma applauded residents for providing police with valuable information which led to the recovery of the vehicle. "Members of the public are encouraged to continuously provide police with information on criminality and police will act accordingly. We also applaud the police for reacting swiftly where the two suspects were arrested." "The proliferation of firearms is a cause for concern and police are closely looking at reported incidents where firearms were used including in the lowveld area," said Zuma. The two will are expected to appear at Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Monday (20 April) facing charges of possession of suspected  stolen vehicle and live ammunition.
