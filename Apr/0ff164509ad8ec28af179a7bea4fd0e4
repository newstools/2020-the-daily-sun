COMMONWEALTH Games’ two-time bronze medalist Raswahl Samaai is working hard on his fitness while under the nationwide lockdown. As much as it’s frustrating for all athletes as they are unable to train or compete with most sporting events either postponed or cancelled because of Covid-19, not all hope is lost for the long jumper. Samaai’s biggest dream remains going to the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, next year. The biggest sporting global event was postponed from 3 July to 8 August next year in the Japanese capital. The International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) World Champs 2017 bronze medalist has a score to settle as injury prevented him from shining at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Injury in Brazil prevented the talented jumper from expressing himself the way he would have wanted to in the Rio Games. “I will remain focused, train as hard as I can as my ultimate aim is to go to the Olympics and do well there,” said Samaai to SunSport. The African long jump champion said he has not yet opened his campaign for the season and was scheduled to take part in the SA Senior Track and Field championships at Pildich Stadium in Tshwane next weekend, but Athletics SA (ASA) has since postponed all athletics events in the country until further notice. “The Olympic Games is the biggest competition in the world, and I will continue to working hard until I go back there again. It’s every athlete’s dream to compete at the highest level and I’m no different,” said an optimistic Samaai. For many years, Samaai and his long-term rival Luvo Manyonga have dominated the long jump events in the world. The pair have pushed each other to the limit during world events and it was not going to be any different if the Olympics forged ahead this year. Their rivalry in the sandpit has inspired aspiring long jumpers to work hard at junior levels. ASA will announce their plans going forward once the lockdown ends.
