PHILIPPI Browns Farm residents in Cape Town want more police visibility next to the park in Ntileni Street. Nombuzo Nkqezo (40) told Daily Sun criminals from other kasi’s hijacked cars at the park. “Uber drivers have been victims of crime as criminals request rides while chilling in the park. “As soon as the car arrives, they hijack it,” said Nombuzo. Residents said it worried them because people might think they were hijacking cars in their area. Nandipha Poni (56) said Uber drivers were not the only targets, but anyone who used the road. “We want the police to be more visible because we are being labelled as criminals while it’s people from other kasi’s doing criminal activities in our park,” said Nandipha. She said she was also concerned about their kids’ safety who like to play in the park. Siso Msindo (34) said the community should work with the police. “We need to call cops as soon as we see suspicious hijackers because we can’t carry on like this,” said Siso. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said there were a few hijackings reported in the area and a vehicle was deployed to deal with them. “This led to the arrest of two suspects on Sunday in possession of a vehicle that was hijacked in Ntselamanzi Street in Brown Farm,” Rwexana told the People’s Paper. Residents have been urged to call the police when they see such incidents. “We request them to check the description of suspects. They can share the information anonymously,” said Rwexana. Residents are encouraged to call Nyanga cops on 021 380 3304, 082 469 2470, 079 894 1342 or CrimeStop on 08600 1011.
