COVID-19 lockdown regulations closed down churches around the country. Rev Zama Mfihlo has become busier than ever before. He said community leaders around Gugulethu have approached him to assist the community with food parcels. “Since lockdown, I have become the pastor not only for my church but for everyone in the kasi. I realised that God gave me a job to do that is to help the communities that need help not only on Sundays but from Monday to Monday. “Those people need us, we have to go from door to door and know what is exactly that they need. When people came to me crying that they need food I have to act and that is what I am doing right now,” said Mfihlo. He said he has been running around asking various organisations to help his kasi but he still has a long way to go. Mfihlo said he has spoken to the Red Cross Society, who said they can assist at least 150 people especially the elderly and the disabled. He said he already has the names of the people who could be assisted by the Red Cross. Mfihlo said the biggest challenge ekasi right now is unemployed youth struggling to make ends meet. “The list of people I got from the community leadership had 900 people and it had lots of young people. So, we are trying other means to ensure everyone gets something to eat. I’m calling for Good Samaritans who are willing to help kasi people to get in touch with me,” said Mfihlo. The man of God said he is not a politician or a government official but a mfundisi who is doing everything in his kasi. “Hunger doesn’t discriminate, whether you are young or old, it doesn’t care about your political affiliation hence I’m trying to do everything to ensure all needy people get food,” said Mfihlo.
