Six
traffic officers were arrested for corruption and defeating the ends of justice
in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday. According
to provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the traffic
officers stopped a man who was transporting school children in his bakkie on 12
March. Instead
of issuing him with traffic fine, the officers allegedly took his driver's
licence and demanded money in exchange for the licence. But the
man told him he didn't have any money and was allegedly told that he would
never see his driver's licence unless he "pays" for it. "The
man then allegedly made arrangements to 'pay' them at the end of March. When
the day arrived, he contacted the officials and allegedly handed over the
money," Hlathi said. "The
police were then notified about the allegations and they followed up on the
information. The traffic officials were arrested shortly thereafter after being
found in possession of the money which was allegedly handed over as
payment." The six
officers appeared in the Middelburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday on charges
of corruption and defeating the ends of justice All of
them were released on a warning They are
expected to appear in court again 8 July. Mpumalanga
police commissioner Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma said: "As law enforcers
in the province, we made a decision that we need to tackle corruption head-on
without fear or favour and we cannot allow rotten elements to exist within our
ranks. If anyone is found to have been involved in any kind of corrupt
activity, [the person] must be rooted out as we are here to serve the public -
not victimise and take advantage of them." SOURCE:
