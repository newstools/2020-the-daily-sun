Ukhozi FM's new show, i-Lockdown noKhozi FM, proved to be a big success last night as it trended for hours on social media. The SABC said it created the show in response to the outbreak of the Covid-19, which led to a national lockdown since 26 March. Radio personality Sipho "Sgqemeza" Mbatha is the host of the show which started last night. It will air every Saturday between 7pm and 10pm for the duration of the lockdown.

It will focus on health and technology matters and the impact they will have on Covid-19. The identified time slot for the show is usually occupied by live commentary of sports games, mostly soccer matches. With the current suspension of all live games, Ukhozi FM decided to respond to the change in audience behavioural patterns by creating content that will assist in educating the general public and ultimately flattening the curve. The station's acting manager, Sbongi Ngcobo said: “It is imperative that the station adjusts its programming offering, particularly during this unprecedented time we find ourselves in. Our initiatives bear testimony to Ukhozi FM’s unwavering commitment in the delivery of its public broadcasting mandate and its responsiveness to listener needs”.
