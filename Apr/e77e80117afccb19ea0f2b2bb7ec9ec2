THE revival of the Sharks in this year’s Super Rugby campaign is perhaps best reflected in the sizzling form of Sikhumbuzo Notshe. The loose forward was pretty much a forgotten man after he disappeared from the Springboks’ World Cup radar and finished off what had truly been a season to forget with the Stormers. But fast forward to now, one will be hard-pressed to find anyone in local rugby as brilliant in the number 8 jersey as Notshe has been. The Sharks have won six and lost only one of their seven matches so far, and looked set to chalk up their seventh win against the sleepy Lions, before the season was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak three weeks ago. Notshe has certainly caught the eye with his ever-improving performance, playing an influential role for the Sharks, who also appear to have found their teeth under coach Sean Everitt. Since his switch to the Sharks, the 26-year-old has been rejuvenated and looks set to finally live up to the promise he showed early on at Western Province. The loose forward has been a perfect link with the forwards and backs, and has impressed with his skills set, particularly his ball-carrying ability. “Notshe has been one of the outstanding players in our pack,” said Everitt. “He’s got a good offloading game and we saw that in the first game against the Highlanders. We’re happy with him and his contribution. He is a good leader in his own right, a very good signing for the Sharks.” Notshe has been humbled by the early showering of praise, happy with his new lease on life in Durban. “I guess it’s been an ideal career move,” Notshe was quoted as saying. “I think it was perfect timing for me. At age 26, you don’t get a lot of these career moves these days. I have managed to pay back by delivering the way I did. I’m really excited about the Sharks and what they are doing.”
