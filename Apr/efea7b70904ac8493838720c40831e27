KEABETSWE Jan, known for starting the O Jewa Keng hashtag on Twitter, has scored an acting gig. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said she was overjoyed when she got the role of schoolgirl Lebo on SABC 2’s Lithapho after sending an audition tape to the channel. “My character is a proper Model C girl who, unlike the other black girls, actually lives in the suburbs. “She is a bully and all the girls do exactly what she says they should do,” she said. “She used to have a crush on Luke but he doesn’t like her and she has made it her mission to intimidate whoever Luke likes.” Kea said she was nothing like her character but she learned a lot from channelling Lebo. “Anyone who has watched an engaging film or read an engaging novel, knows we tend to invest ourselves deeply in the experience of living with those characters,” she said. “We also tend to respond to them as though they are real individuals. So even though I couldn’t directly relate to Lebo, I could still connect with her.” The youngster, who runs the O Jewa Ke Eng Foundation, told the SunTeam she was scared when she first arrived on set but the crew members helped her adjust. “At first, I was scared because I honestly didn’t know what to expect.  But the cast and crew members were truly amazing and always willing to help. Their work ethic is intense and truly remarkable. “When they work, they work,” she said. Lithapo airs every Monday and Wednesday at 9.30pm on SABC 2.
