The Gauteng Liquor authority board supported by a lot of South Africans asked the government to relax its ban on the sale of liquor. This issue saw political parties rallying together to oppose calls by the liquor industry for the government to lift its ban on the sale of alcohol during the lockdown. The World Health Organisation recommended that government leaders around the world limit access to alcohol during coronavirus lockdowns as alcohol compromises the body’s immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes. "Alcohol is known to be harmful to health in general, and is well understood to increase the risk of injury and violence, including intimate partner violence, and can cause alcohol poisoning. At times of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption can exacerbate health vulnerability, risk-taking behaviours, mental health issues and violence. WHO/Europe reminds people that drinking alcohol does not protect them from COVID-19, and encourages governments to enforce measures which limit alcohol consumption." WHO's website cited. The article also informs that alcohol is responsible for 3 million deaths a year worldwide, a third of which occur in the WHO European Region. Not only is this the region with the highest alcohol intake and the highest prevalence of drinkers in the population, but it is also the region with the highest prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the population and the highest share of deaths caused by alcohol, among all deaths.
