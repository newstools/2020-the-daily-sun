KZN has begun massive screening and testing for Coronavirus. Led by Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu and Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu teams of health workers began their first massive programme in Umlazi south of Durban on Saturday. They started at Q section  entering door to door screening and testing people for the virus. Simelane-Zulu said the reason why she decided to start the programme at Q section was because there was lot of panic after the first death occurred there where a teacher Tholakele Shandu died after testing positive. Explaining how the process works the MEC said the screening means that the family would be asked questions in relation to their health and whether they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive or not. She said if teams find someone with symptoms they will then test the person and if tested positive the entire family  will be tested.  She said what she did was just to pilot the programme so that when it is officially launched by the KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala next week at least the government has the understanding of how the people react and feel about it. The results takes 24 hours to come back. Ward 87 Councillor Zoe Shabalala who was accompanying the MEC said her ward has over 17 000 households. She said she was happy that the programme started at her ward and encouraged people to cooperate with health workers when they visit their houses. She said door to door visit was important because people are already flocking to two clinics in the ward thereby violating lockdown rules and regulations. One of the residents Dumisani Ndlovu said they appreciated and support the screening and testing because it is good to know early that you have infected or not so that you isolate if found to have virus.
