THE family of a teacher who was kidnapped and murdered in February don’t want her husband and his co-accused to get bail. The three suspects appeared briefly in the Nkandla Magistrates Court in KZN yesterday after their arrests on Thursday and Friday. They were not asked to plead and the case was postponed to 4 May for bail applications. ASO READ:METRO COPS BASE CLOSED OVER COVID-19 CASE! They’re accused of kidnapping Thalaneni Primary School teacher Makhosazana Ngcobo (41) at her cottage in Thalaneni Reserve on 17 February and killing her. Her body was later found near a road in the area. Her brother Lungelo (32) told Daily Sun granting the suspects bail was not a good idea. “The husband must not get bail because he’s dangerous and may run away. “He was arrested in Mpumalanga trying to leave the country. “He should remain in custody until the end of the trial.” He said the family hoped that he got a life sentence. “No one knew he was married to my sister. We suspect he wanted to inherit all her belongings as there are documents my sister signed saying he gets everything if she dies.” Activist Siya Maphalala wanted to see justice taking its course. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that three suspects had been arrested. “They’re facing a charges of kidnapping and murder.”
