Pilanesberg Platinum Mines situated in North West is playing its part in assisting vulnerable people affected by the nationwide lockdown. The mine which is currently on lockdown has embarked on a campaign called PPM COVID-19 Community Relief Programme to make a difference during these trying times. The CEO of the mine Casper Badenhorst said they were targeting non-profit organisations. “The Programme will supply home care-based centres in the Bakgatla-Ba-Kgafela (BBK) community with food and essential hygiene products which will run for the duration of current lockdown period,” Badenhorst said. The giant platinum mine said it partnered with local stakeholders and community leaders who identified the most deserving centres. Six centres received care packages on Friday and the other three facilities are expected to benefit during the rest of the month.
