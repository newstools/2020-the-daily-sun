Gogo Sophie Mtsweni (68) said according to Home Affairs, she had her first child at the age of eight. She said her ID states she was born in 1962 while her first child was born in 1970. According to the gogo, she has been going up and down to the department to try and fix the problem, but officials sent her from pillar to post. Sophie, from Moloto Village near Kwamhlanga, said all she wanted was for her age to be corrected. She said there was no way she could have given birth at the age of eight. “Every time I go to the department, they always tell me that I want a social grant. “The officials told me I’m still very young, and I must go look for work. I told them I’m running my own business I don’t need social grant money. I even took my first born’s ID to prove to them I’m old, but they still don’t believe me,” she said. “I feel like I am stuck with the wrong identity. “In 1962 I was already married, and I don’t look young. How can I be born that year and be married in the same year?” asked gogo. “I have even proven to them by showing them a letter for my lobola. The officials continued telling me all I want is to get social grant money. I have run out of ideas on what to do next. They robbed me of my age.” She said the officials don’t even tell her what to do to prove her case to them. She said the last time she went to their offices at Kwamhlanga, they ignored her until she decided to go back home. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said they had forwarded the matter to the provincial manager to launch an investigation. He said gogo Sophie will then be contacted..
