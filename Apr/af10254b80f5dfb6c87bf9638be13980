I learnt with disappointment of the closure of some soapies on DStv due to the national lockdown, an unavoidable situation. But replacing the soapies with useless reality shows such as Somizi & Mohale and Madam & Mercy is a smack in the face for the poor. There’s nothing to learn from the shows except watching people showing off their riches and talking rubbish. MultiChoice subscribers are forced to watch these because they have money? In fact, who pays who in these useless reality shows. Does a TV channel flighting the shows pay for them? I have no problem with people having riches, but in a poverty-stricken country like South Africa – where the majority of people are struggling to even put a plate of porridge on their table – it’s absurd that we’re inundated with such selfish people. Remember, these are reality shows and not fiction as may be seen on soapies like The Queen and The River. I wouldn’t mind being inundated with repeats of these soapies instead of these nonsensical reality shows. Replace these shows with lessons for matrics. Our pupils need every minute to catch up during this difficult time. ) Letter by Raletsatsi Makgato ) You’re quite right, Raletsatsi. Our entertainment industry seems perversely obsessed with the rich, some of whom have gained their wealth by exploiting the very poor whom these channels expect as viewers. To watch these people wallow in a disgusting amount of money, dealing with petty and trivial problems that have nothing to with reality, says a lot about our priorities as human beings.
