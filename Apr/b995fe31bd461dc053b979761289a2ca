DESPITE being left high and dry by his only champion, the unheralded local boxing trainer George Khosi says his love of nurturing aspiring boxers remains strong. Khosi was dumped like a hot potato by the South African junior middleweight title holder Simon “Destroyer” Dladla. The Free State-born fighter has left Khosi’s makeshift gym in Hillbrow, Joburg for a more fancier gymnasium under Vusi Mtolo in Balfour Park. The disappointed boxing mentor has vowed to continue discovering rough diamonds and polish them into valuable shiny jewels. “Simon is not a first fighter, and definitely not the last boxer to be snatched away from me,” said the 50-year-old Khosi. “Despite the circumstances, I will not stop developing boxers. Training young boxers is very close to my heart and through it I have changed a lot of lives. “I have discovered a number of boxers, including the former SA heavyweight Osborne Machimana and they were all taken away from me. “There are people who think that I don’t deserve to have good fighters. Anyway, God is watching. “I have taken Simon from nowhere and gave him 15 wins in the amateur ranks before turning professional two years ago. “Like any other young boxer in my gym, he arrived here knowing nothing and I shaped him into what he is today.” According to Khosi, he was expecting his charge to report for camp after the nationwide lockdown when he got a phone call from Dladla, saying his promoter Lebo Mahoko told him to change gyms if he wanted big fights. Dladla was a third national champion to be produced by the former amateur fighter, following the two female champions Rita Mrwebi and Julie Tshabalala. Mrwebi and Tshabalala were SA welterweight and middleweight champions when they left Khosi to join other stables. These youngsters were enticed with big perks and they dump him.
