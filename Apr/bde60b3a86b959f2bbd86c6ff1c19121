KAIZER Chiefs attacking midfielder Lebogang Manyama is frustrated! He admitted that he misses the excitement of playing in packed stadiums. But like everyone else in Mzansi, Manyama is stuck at home as the country is in lockdown. The PSL, like many leagues around the world, is indefinitely suspended following the deadly outbreak of the coronavirus that has claimed lives of thousands of people and brought the world to a standstill. But he said the lives of everyone come first and says the country must adhere to the government’s protocols of washing their hands, staying at home, keeping social distancing and staying safe. The 2016-17 PSL Footballer of Season and Lesley Manyathela Award winner said: “You can train on your own, but it is not the same because we (as a team), created a big vibe this season.” Chiefs are perched at the summit of the Absa Premiership table with 48 points from 22 games. They are four points clear of second placed and reigning champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who have a game in hand. Amakhosi last played on 7 March where they lost 1-0 to AmaZulu at FNB Stadium. It came as a major upset as Chiefs had defeated Orlando Pirates 1-0 at the same venue the previous week.
