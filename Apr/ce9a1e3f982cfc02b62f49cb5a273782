There is a growing concern over the misuse of child support grants by young mothers. The money is meant to uplift the condition of poor families. It doesn’t mean people must be lazy and stop looking for work. Sassa child support grant is not meant for parents to fix their hairs or play cards with it. Research by the Department of Social Development has found that child grants are not used for the benefit of the beneficiaries and the trend is escalating. There are many cooperatives people can join to work rather than wait for the child support grant. Many kids don’t see the money as it’s increasingly being used to finance the lifestyle of young women. Avoid going to loan sharks with Sassa cards. It’s up to every grant recipient to be responsible and use the money wisely for the kids’ benefit. It’s time to start behaving and functioning well as a society. Let’s stop blaming government by saying it’s not doing enough while we’re sitting at home waiting for grants. The R445 child support grant is meant to alleviate the most pressing needs of children from poor families.
