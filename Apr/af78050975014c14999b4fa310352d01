A MEDIA personality is giving up the microphone. Relebogile Mabotja, who recently got nominated in the Commercial News Bulletin category at the South African Radio Awards, did her last show on Metro FM’s afternoon drive yesterday. It was announced that Lindi Sirame would be taking over from her as the afternoon newsreader. Speaking to Daily Sun, Relebogile said leaving Metro FM was a difficult decision as the station had become like home to her. “I left to pursue new personal goals that weren’t in line with staying at the station. I’ll forever be grateful for my time at Metro FM,” she said. Relebogile said working at the station had taught her to be a team player. “I’m extremely excited about my new journey and can’t wait to share it with you in due time. Thank you to all the listeners for lending an ear every day and all the support and encouragement,” she said. The station released its new line-up but there were not many changes. Three new faces, Lindi Sirame, Rorisang Thandekiso and Nthabeleng Matele, were added. Meanwhile actress Mo Setumo announced she’d be joining Motweding FM’s drive time show as co-host with Lucas “LTK” Komanisi. She announced the news on her Instagram page after the station sent out a statement. The move came right after her departure from Mzansi Magic’s The Queen, where she played the role of Mmabatho. It was also announced Tlotlo “Vrrphaa” Mooketsi would be joining the Weekend Party Time show. Tumi Morake and Amon Mokoena would continue in their breakfast slot.
