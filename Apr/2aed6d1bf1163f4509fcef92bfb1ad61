THE decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to lift the ban on tobacco has been celebrated by smokers around Mzansi. The People’s Paper recently published a story about Peter George (31) from block 8 in Philippi, Cape Town, who was so desperate he had been smoking tea leaves. Peter said if the ban was not lifted, he would go crazy. He told Daily Sun: “The ban on cigarettes was hitting me hard, which was why I went for tea leaves. They didn’t help much except in the moment I smoked them. After that, I didn’t really feel anything any more. I’m glad I can smoke real cigarettes now. Thank you, President Cyril.” Peter said he went to his local spaza shop after the announcement was made and bought a pack of 20. “I smoked three cigarettes in 10 minutes. I didn’t believe it when I lit the cigarette after a long time of smoking tea leaves,” he said. His friend Xola Mavumengwana (36) said he visited Peter almost every day and not having cigarettes was affecting him. “I also smoke but the ban didn’t affect me too much because I’m not a chain smoker. I smoke once per day, even if I have a full pack of cigarettes in my pocket. My friend is the kind who smokes a lot, hence this was biting him too much,” he said. Xola said Peter was becoming aggressive and got irritated easily. “He is now the Peter I know, who is ever joyous and not a moody one. I didn’t know that people not having cigarettes could cause such misery,” he said.
