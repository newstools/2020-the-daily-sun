THE people of Sabelweni in Folweni, KZN, are fuming with anger. The residents of the kasi in the south of Durban claimed they were left out when cops from Folweni Police Station were tested for coronavirus. A cop shop was sanitised and staff were tested after an officer stationed there tested positive for the virus. Resident Nokuthula Ngcobo (41) said: “We fetch water from the station as we don’t have water in our homes.” She said when they saw doctors and nurses at the station with cops lining up, they were told they were being tested. Shu Hlengwa (32) said the cop who tested positive worked in the charge office. “Doctors should have tested everyone who came into contact with the cop. “Also, the cop might have used the same tap that the residents use to get water,” she said. “We are sitting here not knowing our status.” National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said on 23 March, the cop from the station was admitted to a Durban hospital with an unknown illness. “The member tested positive for coronavirus. As a precautionary measure, the station was evacuated and the sanitation process began.” Naidoo said all members were being tested for the virus by the health department.
