 The ANC in the Eastern Cape says it is shocked by the arrest of Chris Hani District Municipality councillor Madoda Papiyana. Papiyana, who is also ANC chief whip in the district, was arrested on Friday for driving under the influence of alcohol and for failing to uphold the lockdown regulations. EWN earlier reported that it is alleged that Papiyana refused to stop at a police roadblock. His car was chased down and he was stopped in the Ngcobo area. Papiyana appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. Eastern Cape ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi said they were shocked by Papiyana's arrest, and particularly by the seriousness of allegations leveled against him - undermining the rule of law, driving under the influence of alcohol and abusing his permit immunity to free movement around the district.  Ngcukayitobi said provincial executive committee officials had held a teleconference on Saturday discussing Papiyana's conduct.
