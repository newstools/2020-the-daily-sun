THE ANC COUNCILOR who was bust for breaking lockdown rules has been released from Seshego's police cells. That’s after he paid a fine of R1000 for defying the Disaster Management Act. The two other charges laid against him for resisting arrest and for intimidating the police during his arrest were later withdrawn when his lawyer Douglas Molepo took over the case. He was arrested last Monday together with five others who were with him at his house in Moletji outside Polokwane Ward 36 Councillor Jack Legodi told Daily Sun through his lawyer that he had done nothing wrong because when the police pounced on them, they were inside the yard. He claimed the police jumped over a fence and gained entrance to his home without his knowledge. "The police assaulted and harassed me during the process. They also violated my rights because they didn’t have a search warrant when they forcefully entered into my yard." “The police actually went against the law when they seized and destroyed the items found in my house without a search warrant. I was beaten to the extent that I went to see a doctor after my release from the cells." Legodi has been let off the hook for now but has another mountain to climb as Polokwane Municipality will be referring the matter to Limpopo Co-operative Governance MEC Basikopo Makamu. Polokwane Municipality spokesman Thia Selala said they were pursuing the matter with the police to get the full facts. "Once the facts are established and a report is forwarded to the Speaker of Council, the Speaker will follow due process in terms of the legislation that regulates council matters, including the code of conduct for councillors. Now that council cannot deal with the matter due to the lockdown, the Speaker may refer the matter to the MEC," he said.
