Mayor Mzwandile Masina followed suit. “I am pleasantly surprised by our staff member’s commitment to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa,” he said. “As the leadership of the City, we continue to urge all staff members and citizens to contribute whatever amount they can afford to the Solidarity Fund.” The City has set itself a target of donating R3m to the Solidarity Fund by the end of June. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/city-of-ekurhuleni-staff-donate-r600-000-to-solidarity-fund-20200424
