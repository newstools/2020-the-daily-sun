ANOTHER Tshwane man is expected to appear in court today. This was after he was arrested for mocking and swearing at the efforts to curb Covid-19 in a video clip which went viral on 27 March. According to police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo, the 23-year old man was bust for allegedly contravening the regulations of the Disaster Management Act 2002. THUGS BROKE INTO A LIQUOR OUTLET AND STOLE BOOZE! He said snippets of the video show the man bragging to his friend that he didn’t comply with regulations put in place to contain the virus. “In one of the snippets, one man appears to be standing in front of a police station and continued swearing about the virus,” Naidoo said. He said the matter was investigated and the suspect was traced and found at a residential complex in the Lyttelton policing area. “The suspect is likely to face charges of at least contravening regulation 11B of the Disaster Management Act 2002. “He’s in police custody and is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court today,” Naidoo said. He said the arrest of the man and at least six others who created such videos and posted fake news should be a reminder that security forces have the capacity to identify those responsible for such offences.
