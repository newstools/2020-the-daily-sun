SINCE Masechaba Ndlovu was appointed Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa’s spokeswoman, she has been running low on luck. The seasoned broadcaster recently received public backlash after sharing a video of musician Lindo Sithole and his son discussing coronavirus. She posted the video with the caption “the message is simple”. In the video, which she has since deleted, the musician can be heard speaking fake Chinese while discussing the virus. Although she soon deleted the video, it was saved by Twitter users, who accused her of being reckless as a government worker. Some even questioned her competence, saying she was undoing the good work of other national figures. In the video, Lindo’s son Valdo asks his dad whether he has heard of the virus and his dad responds by saying: “You should always have sanitiser with you.” They go on to discuss precautions people can take to protect themselves and others, such as using the elbow greeting demonstrated by President Cyril Ramaphosa. It was the second time Masechaba angered the public since her appointment last month. She previously tweeted that 119 people had died of the virus when there were no recorded deaths at the time. When called for comment, Masechaba told the SunTeam: “I have no comment about that at this stage.” When Lindo was asked for comment, he said people had lost their sense of humour. “It’s something we need during this period. I don’t think people would have reacted this way if it was someone else. Because it was Masechaba, people viewed it from another perspective and attacked her. “I have seen a lot of videos that are similar to the one I did and people have been engaging at laughing at them. I see nothing wrong with my video, it was about creating awareness. It was just shared by the wrong person,” he said.
