INFORMAL traders will soon be bidding farewell to their lockdown struggles. This morning they descended to Jorrisen Place in Braamfontein, where they applied for their temporary permits that will see them trading through the lockdown period. Securing these permits will mean a lot to them as they have been without income for the past week. When the lockdown was announced they were not listed as part of those who provide essential services, but on Thursday night they breathed a sigh of relief after the minister of Cogta Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma announced that they are free to trade, on condition that they get permits. Speaking to Daily Sun, Maria Nkuna said, "Last week we were just in the houses, this permit thing is something that was just announced recently, but at least we are going to be able to sell." She said this morning it was a struggle to locate Jorrisen Place, that is why she had to wake up extra early to look for it. However, there is still some confusion among those who are in the queue, as they were not sure what kind of documentation was required for the permit application.  Traders particularly those in Joburg needed to have, COJ Certificate of Acceptability, Proof of trading, valid ID and photo. One trader said he only had his ID and a card that he uses to purchase stock at Joburg Market. "I don't know if they will be able to help with just these, I've applied for the trading card but I've not received yet," he said.
