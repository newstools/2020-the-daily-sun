A GROUP of cops were lucky to survive a crash with a security vehicle on Sunday. The police van crashed into the vehicle near Philippi Junction Mall in Cape Town as a robot was not working. Nyanga station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncata quickly rushed to the scene to find out what had happened and the driver of the security vehicle insisted he was in the right. “The cops moved when it was my turn, which then led to this accident,” he said. The front side of his car was destroyed. Ncata confirmed to the SunTeam that the robot was not working. He said the two cops were on their way to Browns Farm when the accident happened. “The robot was not working, and what my cops told me was that they waited as they were treating it like a four-way stop. “When it was their turn to drive, the vehicle from the security company rammed into them. “What they told me was also confirmed by the driver of a Toyota Avanza who was also waiting for his turn to cross.” Resident Nosiphiwo Ledwaba (39) said she heard a bang and rushed to see what had happened. When she arrived she saw the cop van upside down. “I’m glad no one died. The traffic light has not worked for some time now and we thought an accident was bound to happen.”
