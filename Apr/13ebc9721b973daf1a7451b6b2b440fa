Singer and actress Demi Lovato finally opened up about going to rehab. Demi caused a stir when she overdosed on drugs and went to rehab in 2018. During a live video with her cast members of the Disney series Sonny With A Chance, she spoke about going to rehab and what happened to her. She said co-star Tifanny Thorton, who was also part of the live video, inspired her to go to rehab. "When I went away to treatment for the first time, you were my biggest inspiration coming out of it because you dealt with all of those pressures of being a woman on TV," she said. Speaking about her eating disorder, she said at the time, she didn't like how she looked, but she was happy with how she looked now. She went on to speak why her room was always hot. "My dressing room was 36 degrees because I had a eating disorder and I was underweight and freezing." Demi advised fellow child star: "I would just say, speak up for your needs. Always tell the people around you. If you're tired, tell them you're tired. If you're sick, be honest about being sick and not feeling good. Just speak up for yourself."
