IMPALA Platinum mineworkers are unhappy that they didn’t get their entire month’s wages. They were apparently told to return to work with the promise of full pay for April. But on Thursday they were told they’d only get half. Many of the workers said they were being belittled by the employer as they had bills to pay and families to feed. On Friday, which was pay day, miners said they received R1 300, some R1 000, while others only got R140. They’re now demanding full pay or no work would be done until their full salaries reflected in their bank accounts. Loco operator Buti Modikoe couldn’t understand why his salary was cut. Like many others, he demanded his full salary. “The agreement I remember having with management was that we’d get full pay this month,” said Buti. “But a day before pay day, management told us we’ll only be paid half salaries. “These salaries are not even half but a quarter of what we make.” Impala spokesman Johan Theron said theangry workers were not company staff members but independent contractors. He said relevant stakeholders were alerted and the matter was being investigated.
