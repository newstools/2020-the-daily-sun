Sport, Arts and Culture minister Nathi Mthethwa said on Tuesday that he's unconvinced the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) will resolve its internal problems. Mthethwa was reacting to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) who has called for SASCOC to resolve their own problems. "We wish to reiterate that as government we remain unconvinced that SASCOC has demonstrated the necessary will to deal decisively with their internal problems, particularly those relating to governance, as spelt out in the Ministerial Inquiry Report," read the statement from the minister. "The approach to SASCOC's International mother bodies was not only in response to the two elections-related disputes, faced by SASCOC, but also relates to a two year long process of ensuring that the recommendations of the Ministerial Inquiry into the affairs of SASCOC, are implemented." The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture have reached an agreement on 26 of the 42 sub-recommendations, while there is still work to be done on the remaining 16. "Through a Task Team appointed for this purpose, the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture, has been assisting SASCOC with the implementation of the recommendations, in the hope that the process would be concluded by the end of last month. "Whilst a few of the 16 might be addressed by the elective conference, others will require financial resources that SASCOC does not have. This is one of the reasons that the election of a new leadership is urgent. "The appeal to the IOC and IPC was therefore aimed at enlisting the help of the sports movement to address sports problems to avoid the perception that government was being heavy-handed through alternative ways of bringing back stability to SASCOC, in the interests of the struggling athletes. "Whilst we await what further developments arise, we remain committed to the restoration of stability, within SASCOC," the statement read.
