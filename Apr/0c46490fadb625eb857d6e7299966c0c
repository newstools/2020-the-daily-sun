I t doesn’t take an expert to realise level 4 of lockdown was brought prematurely. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections is still growing, and we don’t know how many people would’ve been infected if the president hadn’t declared a national state of disaster in March. However, by allowing more movement of people, we could be risking having a greater number of new infections every day. Should that happen, we could be taken back to level 5 of lockdown and many more lives may be lost. There are many people who’ve not been adhering to lockdown regulations during level 5. The number of such people is bound to increase during level 4. What makes me more fearful is that we’re getting into winter and the experts tell us the virus grows faster in cold weather. We can only pray that level 4 doesn’t make our situation worse. We don’t want to start well and end up in a massive Covid-19 catastrophe. It would not be dangerous for us to march into level 4 if all of us were abiding by Covid-19 regulations. The main problem is that people are in denial. Let’s hope that level 4 turns out well. By now every one of us must have seen how dangerous this virus is. So we’re all obliged to stop its spread. Let’s follow precautions. Letter by Abigail Ledubuko, from Bochum
