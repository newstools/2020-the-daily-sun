It was an Easter Weekend like never before. On Friday, the structures of the church remained shut without any sign of a worshiper. They were at their homes and streamed live their Easter sermons.Bishop Mosab Sono of Grace Bible Church delivered a special Easter message through Skype on Newzroom Afrika. Rhema Bible Church and Incredible Happenings church, led by Prophet Paseka ‘’Mboro’’ Motsoeneng were among churches that conducted their church sermons online. But for many others, the idea of listening to the scriptures at the comfort of their home was strange. Ntebogeng Komane (49) from Protea, in Soweto, she lives opposite her church.She said it was strange seeing the gates of her busy church closed.S he said: “My church is always packed. During the week, we have members of the church walking in and out for prayers. “But since the lockdown, it has been quiet and I can’t get used to it. This morning, I almost prepared myself for an Easter service but my husband reminded me. I never miss a church service during this time of the year, and it has been hard,” added Ntebogeng. Dorah Maseko (40) said her husband woke them early for a prayer.“He loves church wholeheartedly. Early in the morning, he asked all of us along with the kids to gather inside our garage for a prayer. Thereafter, he watched other church services online. I wish the coronavirus can come to an end, so our lives can return to normal,” added Dorah.On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a lockdown extension of two weeks. He said: “The message of Easter is one we carry in our hearts tonight. It is the message of hope, of recovery, and of rebirth. We shall overcome. May God Bless South Africa and protect her people,” said Ramaphosa.
