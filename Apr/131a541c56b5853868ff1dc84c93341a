BUDDING boxing trainer Immanuel Mutavhatsindi believes the five week national shutdown could serve as a lesson to local boxers to put money away for rainy days. South Africa is in the third week of a national lockdown which has brought Mzansi’s economy to a standstill, and fighters who depend solely on fights as a source of income, will be mostly affected. The R150 million Athletes Relief Fund from the Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation only accommodates those fighters who were billed on cancelled tournaments due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The majority of our boxers depend on fight purses to survive. This must be a lesson to them to save money for days like these. I know they are not getting much on their fight purses but they must learn to save,” said Mutavhatsindi. “We save money because we can’t predict the future. Putting money away can help them become financially secure and provide a safety net in case of an emergencies like this one. “No one expected this to happen and it is beyond our control. From a 21-day lockdown, it has been extended by two weeks and the more the lockdown is stretched, the tougher it gets.” Mutavhatsindi guided SA female boxer Bukiwe “Anaconda” Nonina to her World Boxing Federation (WBF) title glory. However, the pair parted ways last year after working together for six years. Mutavhatsindi established a boxing academy in Pretoria but had to close shop due to Covid-19. The Limpopo-born boxing mentor said that his academy accommodates mostly amateur boxers.
