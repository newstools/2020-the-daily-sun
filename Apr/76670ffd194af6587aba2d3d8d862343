Following an incident that had Tweeps breathing fire, DJ  Shimza is making things right. He was scolded last week when he responded to an upcoming DJ who had asked for retweets so Shimza could feature him on his lockdown sessions. Now the DJ, real name  Ashley  Raphala (29), says he has a plan to help  budding female DJs. Taking  to Twitter,  Shimza urged his followers to tag female DJs because he has a plan. "Been exposed to such amazing female djs and I strongly believe that there's room for more. Please tag female DJs you know of, ke Male plan", the muse tweeted.
