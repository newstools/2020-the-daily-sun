 WHILE the national lockdown is a massive worry for many, Jonas Ngobeni sees it as a blessing. As he can’t go out to work on his piece jobs, he has amazed his kasi by creating a one-of-a-kind shack. The 33-year-old from Riverside in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun: “As I can’t go around erecting shacks for other people for money, I can now focus on mine. “I want to see my double-storey mkhukhu finished after the 21-day lockdown.” Jonas said he couldn’t wait to sit in the cool air on his balcony like a bird. The father of four said it had always been his dream to build a double-storey house. He said he couldn’t afford to build a proper house, but he was building a shack that looked like his dream house. Jonas said he believed he would feel at peace sitting above all the other roofs. He said people shouldn’t undermine those living in shacks as they have the same dreams but less money. “My job is to sell shacks and toilets to people, but business has stopped because of the lockdown,” he said. He said he used wood, poles, zinc and flat sheeting to make two garages, two bottom storey rooms and a bedroom on the second storey. Jonas said he sold a six-roomed, double-storey shack in Stoffel Park, Mamelodi, in 2015 and decided to make one for himself as well. “People passing the area have been stopping to take pictures and others tell me my mkhukhu is beautiful.” He said people had told him they loved his shack.
