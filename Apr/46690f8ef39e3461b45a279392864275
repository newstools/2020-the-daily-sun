MOST villagers are still not adhering to the lockdown regulations and this is because there are not enough police to make sure they do and soldiers are also not visible. Churches and taverns remain closed and large gatherings suspended, but villagers continue to go up and down. So to make sure the message is heard loud and clear, police in Sekgosese outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo spent the whole day going to all the Sekgosese’s 12 villages on Thursday, reminding them of the lockdown regulations and also the consequences.  Their main focus was the Roerfontein village as most villagers do their shopping unnecessarily, buying non-essential things. Police moved around the village with a loud speaker so the message could be heard loud and clear. In a video a van is outside a shop and a policeman is seen holding a loudspeaker facing at the shop and passing the message in Sepedi. The policeman said: “This Covid-19 is very serious. There should be no going up and down by kids. Everyone should be at their homes and if you want to buy something, you must be having a permit. If you are going to a doctor you must be having a permit,” The policeman continues to say that if one is arranging a funeral, a permit must be there. “If you don’t have a permit as I speak, even if you’re hiding, immediately go to your home,” said the policeman. As the policeman is about to finish his talk, two women who seemed not to have permits can be seen walking out in a hurry from the shop. Modjadji Ramawela (24) said they heard the message loud and clear. “We will remain at our homes until the lockdown ends,” she said.
