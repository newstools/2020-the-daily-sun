CLEANERS at a hospital in Durban want to be tested for coronavirus. They told Daily Sun a nurse in the paediatric ward at Parklands Hospital in Durban was informed while at work that her husband had tested positive and she needed to be tested. On Friday, the nurse was told she was positive. However, only two cleaners at the hospital were tested. A cleaner said: “We were told to continue working like nothing happened. We work in all the wards and we were told to use one mask for seven days.” Regional Netcare director Craig Murphy said he was not allowed to share information about coronavirus cases, unless he had permission from the national health department. “We reject any claim that staff are required to reuse single use equipment. Reusable fabric masks are being distributed to staff with the eventual goal of supplying three to each staff member,” he said.
