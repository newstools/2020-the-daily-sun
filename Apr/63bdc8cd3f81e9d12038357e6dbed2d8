GABON FA president Pierre Alain Mounguengui wants Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join a club that matches his ambitions. Former Borussia Dortmund man Aubameyang has been banging in goals for Arsenal ever since joining them in 2018, and he grabbed a share of the Golden Boot alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane with 22 goals last season. Aubameyang has scored 17 goals this season despite Arsenal’s struggles, and Mounguengui believes a goal scorer of his calibre should be operating at the very top level. “I don’t want to say that Arsenal aren’t ambitious, but Arsenal don’t have ambitions as high as some other clubs as far as Europe is concerned,” Mounguengui told ESPN. “So if Pierre could secure a contract with a more ambitious club, he’d definitely find his place there. “On an individual level, we all consider him to be among the best players in the world, but the advice I give to him is to continue to work and to attract the attention of the biggest clubs and the most ambitious teams. “Football is a collective sport. Right now, he’s at Arsenal, and he’s won nothing here, so it’s a collective failing.” – SPORT24
