SANGOMAS and izinya-nga who make a living through their initiation schools and by performing certain traditional rituals want to be compensated for loss of income. Gogo Phandulwazi Masala from Zwide, Port Elizabeth, said she has turned away many clients who came for consultation. “For consultations I charge R150. This month I had to cancel four slaughtering rituals that I was supposed to perform for one of my trainees for R13 000,” she said.  “I have a family of seven and all of them depend on me. We deserve to be compensated because we play a huge role in healing people,” Khoisan social activist Christian Martin said traditional healers should be compensated. “They should also claim for loss of income.” Dr Cynthia Nquse, provincial chairwoman of the Traditional Health Practitioners under the African National Medicine Association, said members were allowed to provide health services such as healing and consultations as long as they adhered to safety precautions. “But slaughtering, cleansing and river rituals are not allowed,” she said. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said: “We have seen incidents where cops enforced the regulations to stop traditional and religious ceremonies. We thank them for ensuring that where they get reports of people breaking any of the regulations, they enforce the rules and effect arrests.” National spokesman for Traditional Affairs Mlungisi said he could not answer questions on compensation. “I don’t believe this has been raised with government yet, so I don’t have an official response for you,” he said.
