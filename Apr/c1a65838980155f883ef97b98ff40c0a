IT looks like sports fanatics will continue to wait on the sidelines as there would be no sport action under the national coronavirus level 4 which was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday evening. Ramaphosa announced that on 1 May national coronavirus level will be lowered from Level 5 to Level 4, however, he noted a lockdown remains the most effective way to limit the spread of the virus. He revealed that concerts and sporting events will not be allowed until it is deemed safe for them to continue. “People can exercise under strict public health conditions that will be spelt out," the president said. “All gatherings‚ apart from funerals and for work‚ will remain prohibited.” The Absa Premiership which was set to end in May remains on pause and now faces an uncertain future of resumption. Before the president update, South African Football Association (Safa) had said it will follow Ramaphosa's guidance before making announcements on when its ban on football in March will be lifted.
