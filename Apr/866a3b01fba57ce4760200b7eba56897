WITH seven days left of the 21-day national lockdown, there are still people in Limpopo who are not adhering to the regulations. A male motorist, who was driving allegedly under the influence of alcohol, was arrested today together with 36 other people for contravening the lockdown regulations in Jane Furse. The arrests come after Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha, MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale for the Department of Social Development and the provincial Police Commissioner-General Nneke Ledwaba took their lockdown operation to Jane Furse. Mathabatha and his entourage further went to a local taxi rank to fumigate taxis with sanitiser.  Kenny Mathivha, the spokesperson for Mathabatha, said that all the people who were arrested today during the operation will have to pay a fine. Most of them were small business owners who were operating without permits, including a car panel beater. "Their businesses were closed as some of them were operating without permits," he said.
