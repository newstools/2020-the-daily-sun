ZINHLE Akeelah Hlamalani of Giyani: Land of Blood now has her own cosmetics line. The actress told Daily Sun she started Akeelah Cosmetics in February as she had always loved the beauty industry. Zinhle, who plays Matimba on the SABC2 Tsonga series, said: “From a young age, I have loved being beautiful. “I always wanted to have make-up on my face. This year, I finally decided to do this. I was inspired to go for my dreams after I saw Kylie Jenner start her own cosmetics company. In January, I took money I had saved, did my research and contacted a company in Canada,” she said.

It is everything I have ever dreamed of. I also went with vegan products because I’m passionate about this. It’s not just about making money,” she said. “I know the vegan products will help people with sensitive skin. We made it for people with very bad skin. It’s going to help them.” She said she was supposed to officially launch the company at the end of the month but it had to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. “As soon as everything calms down, I will organise the launch again. It’s time people all over Mzansi knew about my products.”
