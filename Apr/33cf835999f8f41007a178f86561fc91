The Democratic Alliance says it will be reporting Police Minister Bheki Cele to the Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics to investigate his behaviour during the national lockdown. Andrew Whitfield DA Shadow Minister of Police said Cele made reckless comments in the first 21 days of the lockdown which might have caused the SAPS to act outside of the law. Whitfield said Cele recommended that SAPS “push” people home and said that police must deal with criminals “harshly” even going as far as instructing them not be nice to suspects. “These disgraceful comments are unbecoming of a member of Parliament and a member of the Executive. We believe Cele has not shown ethical leadership by encouraging SAPS to act outside the law,” Whitfield said. ALSO READ:3 SOLDIERS AND A COP INJURED IN ACCIDENT! Whitfield also said they have called for the President to remove Cele for his comments on the rape of a woman at the hands of a police officer. Cele is quoted saying “There is a report that a member of the police raped a woman during the lockdown. This is untrue. It was the woman’s husband, who happens to be a police officer, who raped her. We don’t go out and report that a pilot raped someone, or a taxi driver raped someone, why should it be any different now?” According to a report released by IPID, eight people succumbed at the hands' police officers with 30 other offences including assault being reported in the first week. “By encouraging law enforcement officers to break the law by destroying infrastructure the Minister has crossed a line and Parliament must urgently investigate whether this is conduct befits that of a member of parliament and the executive,” Whitfield added. Cele is also accused of instructing police to destroy people’s infrastructure if they are found selling alcohol.
