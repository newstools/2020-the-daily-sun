A MILITARY reservist was today arrested during a Covid-19 road block. The road block was held in Makhado, Limpopo. The reservist was arrested for violating the lockdown regulations and this included traveling to Gauteng, Pretoria with passengers without permits. Transport and Community Safety spokesman Matome Moremi-Taueatsoala said he was also arrested for lying about being a member of SANDF and illegally being in possession of Military uniform. “The reservist failed to respond to basic military protocols from army personnel who formed part of the roadblock,” said Moremi-Taueatsoala. The road block was conducted by the Transport and Community Safety MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya joined by the Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba and Makhado Municipality Mayor Samuel Munyai together with their officials. The aim was to monitor compliance in the Makhado Municipality in the fight against the COVID-19 spread at Elim and Louis Trichardt towns which are under the municipality. They visited the Elim Hospital, Louis Trichardt Hospital, shops and taxi ranks in the nearby towns. The visit was mainly aimed at monitoring adherence on COVID-19 rules and regulations. “This included a walkabout at the shops and taxi ranks around Elim and Louis Trichardt. As part of curbing the spread of the virus, taxis at taxi ranks were also disinfected,” Moremi-Taueatsoala said.
