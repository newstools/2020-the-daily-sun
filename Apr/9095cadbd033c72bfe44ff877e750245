 The
chairperson of the National Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Health,
Sibongiseni Dhlomo, has welcomed the continued ban on the sale of tobacco
products during level 4 of the lockdown. Last week,
when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the phased approach to exiting
lockdown, and that the country would go to level 4 on Friday, he said tobacco
products would be allowed to be sold, much to the relief of smokers. However,
when Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma announced the new regulations on Wednesday evening, she said
tobacco products would not be sold. In a
stunning about-turn on Wednesday, the government announced that a ban on the
sale of tobacco products and cigarettes would continue from Friday when some
Level 5 lockdown restrictions are eased. On
Thursday, the chairperson of the committee said they agreed with the decision. "We
understood all the reasons mentioned and we agree that smoking is bordering on
personal hygiene, and it is a collective responsibility for all of us not to
spread the virus from one person to the other," said Dhlomo, a former MEC
for health in KwaZulu-Natal, according to a statement "One
of the other aspects that we have noted from understanding the physiology of
this illness is that it heavily affects the respiratory system, in particular,
the lungs. We have observed that a significant number of people that have died
of Covid-19 are those that had asthma and other respiratory conditions." According
to Dhlomo, if you have the Covid-19 infection and tobacco on the same
respiratory organ, the lungs are simply overburdened. "We
note that the significant number of people that have died in the world as a
result of the pandemic have comorbidities that affect the lungs, asthma,
chronic obstructive airwaves diseases and cardiovascular diseases. This comes
in as a relief not to allow cigarettes, tobacco and related products at this
time," said Dhlomo. SOURCE:
