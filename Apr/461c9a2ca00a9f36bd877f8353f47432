The deadly Coronavirus has been a menace to society and brought the world to its knees. Sports has not been spared the effects of the pandemic with major leagues around the world suspended to stop the spread. As much as they miss doing what they love – sports – many sportspeople have made it their duty to raise awareness about the deadly virus. Orlando Pirates coach, Josef Zinnbauer, has shared his own message to the Bucs faithful and football supporters in general during this time. The German mentor urged fans to abide by the rule of the lockdown put in place by authorities. Like everyone in Mzansi, Zinnbauer is stuck at home as the country is in lockdown. However, he is looking to forward to reuniting with all the Bucs fans when things get back to normal. “Hello Orlando Pirates family, we can’t be with you at the stadium, but we can also play our part in the battle against Coronavirus,” said Zinnbauer. “I would like to encourage you all to stay safe, stay at home. When you need to go out for essential items put on a mask and gloves. Use hand sanitizers and wash your hands often. Stay safe and play your part.”
