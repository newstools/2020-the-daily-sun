Stellenbosch FC head coach Steve Barker believes it's crucial for Nkanyiso Zungu to become mentally resilient if he wants to succeed at Orlando Pirates. Barker says Zungu undoubtedly has the technical prowess to compete with the best players at the Soweto outfit, but admits the 24-year-old needs to develop the mental side of his game. "Football-wise technically yes [he was ready for the Pirates move]. I think his biggest challenge, and I had a good chat with him before he left and we still do keep in contact, is just mentally," Barker told Marawa Sports Worldwide. "Pirates is a big club, you know. It's just mentally handling the situation of competing with players that are on a very high level every day. But there is no doubt that in footballing terms and his technical ability it was the right time for him to go. "It's just for him to be psychologically and mentally handling the pressure of being at a club like Pirates and performing every day at training. But I am confident that he will do well." Zungu signed for the Buccaneers right at the end of the January transfer window, but is yet to make his competitive debut for the club. - TEAMtalk media
