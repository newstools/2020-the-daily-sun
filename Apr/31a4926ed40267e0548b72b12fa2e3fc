ANELISA Booysens has appealed to God to ensure alcohol sales remain banned. The 36-year-old from Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, is a member of the Jehovah Apostles of South Africa. She told Daily Sun her husband was a better man without alcohol. “Alcohol is destroying families and marriages. I am now glad it has been banned because of the lockdown. My husband is staying at home. He watches TV with the children,” she said. “He’s now good man in bed and he smells great. He used to drink daily and our house resembled a shebeen.” Anelisa said her husband Skumbuzo Makhato (40) treated her badly when he was drunk. “He would come with half his salary. He owed money to many mashonisas and our family was struggling. I pray every day that God will help South Africans to stop drinking too much.” Skhumbuzo and Anelisa have been married for 12 years and have three children. Skhumbuzo told the SunTeam: “I regret all the years I spent drinking alcohol. I wasted a lot of money and opportunities. I even hurt people’s feelings but I’m a changed man now. “I will not drink again after the lockdown ends. I have also gained weight. “I’m in a good relationship with my wife and children and my appetite for food has improved.” Police Minister Bheki Cele recently said alcohol was destroying Mzansi. He was supported by Gauteng Premier David Makhura, who said there were only two road accident deaths over the Easter weekend in the province.
