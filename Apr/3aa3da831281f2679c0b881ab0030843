 HUNDREDS of Impala Platinum mine workers were reportedly not
paid some of their salaries. The angry mine workers did not report to work demanding
their full salaries. When the workers returned to work on April 14, they were
told they would get full salaries. The workers say they are being disrespected by their
employers. They allegedly received salaries ranging from R1400 to R140. The workers are from three Impala shafts - 01, 09 and 20
shaft. Many of the workers who from as far as the Eastern Cape and
Lesotho, said they need money to pay rent, send some money back home and also
feed themselves. They claim it will be impossible to do anything with the
money they have been given.  They said they were reportedly told the mine wants production
but the workers said they also demand what is rightfully theirs. Angry employee Themba Stimela said the return agreement was
full pay for the month of April. "These people sent us messages from home saying we
should come and work on April 14. On Thursday, 22 April they told us we won't
get full pay. What are we supposed to do with the small change they give
us," said Themba. The angry workers said they will not be going to work until
their salaries are paid. Impala Platinum mine spokesman Johan Theron said the mine
wasn't aware of such claims from their workers. "It is not our employees but employees from a mining
contractor - we are speaking to them, the union and their employer to resolve
concerns ASAP," said Theron.
