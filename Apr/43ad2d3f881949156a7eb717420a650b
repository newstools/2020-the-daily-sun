Former Chippa United head coach Norman Mapeza's agent says AmaZulu have shown interest in his client's services. The former Zimbabwe international left the Chilli Boys last month and has since received numerous offers from a variety of clubs, according to agent Gibson Mahachi. Even though Mapeza has attracted widespread interest, Mahachi would only reveal AmaZulu as one of his admirers. "So far, nothing has materialized for a new deal for the coach. AmaZulu have, of course, made an inquiry together with several other foreign clubs which I'll not reveal by their names at this stage," Mahachi told The Standard. "But for the moment, Mapeza is resting until a better offer comes and in the meantime, we are open and listening to offers coming our way. "There is no need for us to rush. When the right offer comes we will embrace it but for the moment we are waiting and looking forward to it." "After his previous job, we felt he needed some rest as we look for the right placement for him," he added. "A number of offers are coming, but we need to be careful when it comes to selecting the right one." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
