An Eskom employee in Limpopo was arrested together with Scrap Metal company owner for copper wire theft. The two were found with stolen copper worth more than R100 000. They were arrested at Extension 44 and Seshego outside Polokwane by the Westernburg police on Friday after a tip off. According to Limpopo police Spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the police got information about the suspects who were offloading the copper cables and they acted immediately following the information. "Upon the police's arrival at the said house, they found the owner of the house who owns a scrap metal and recycling company. Police searched the house and discovered copper cables hidden inside. The cables were estimated to the street value of over R100 000 and he was arrested on the spot," said Mojapelo. He stated that when the cops followed up further with the information it led to the arrest of another suspect around Seshego. Mojapelo highlighted that when they dig deeper in to the second suspect it was found that he is an Eskom employee who stole and sold the cables to the Scrap metal company owner. "The two suspects aged 37 and 31 are expected to appear in Polokwane Magistrate's Court on Monday, facing charges of theft of copper cables and being in possession of presumed stolen properties. The Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo police General Nneke Ledwaba has commended the members for their swift response which led to the arrest of the suspects," Mojapelo added.
