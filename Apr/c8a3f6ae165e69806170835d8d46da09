Almost all women know the freedom and relief that comes with taking your bra off and when you are home, a bra is the last thing on your mind. We are well into week two of lockdown and most seem to have adjusted but you may need to put back that bra on. Experts have warned that not wearing your bra could cause saggy boobs, poor posture and even ligament damage. As tempting as it is to not wear a bra when working from home, remember that it is for your own good that you put it on. Speaking to DailyMail, Figleaves garment technologist Victoria Shelton said: "We all still need to wear a bra as our breasts need to be supported â€“ due to their weight you may damage your posture or have back pain (otherwise)."If breasts are left unsupported, damage can occur to the Cooper's ligament in the breast, causing them to sag." Instead of not wearing a bra at all, Victoria recommends switching to a flexi wire design often used in maternity bras or a non-wired style with a seam cup to support a larger bust.
