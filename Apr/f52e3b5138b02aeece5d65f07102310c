MAMELODI Sundowns forward Lebohang Maboe is grateful to coach Pitso Mosimane for not losing confidence in him at the time when he lost his form and he has vowed to repay the faith shown in him. The 25-year-old Maboe joined Sundowns from Maritzburg United at the beginning of last season, and helped the Brazilians lift the Absa Premiership title. A small band of Sundowns fans targeted Maboe and booed him after the club’s 2-1 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic at Loftus Stadium in February, an act that frustrated the talented player. This led to Mosimane reminding the fans that Maboe helped them win the Premiership title. Maboe was the club’s top scorer in the league last season, with eight goals in 27 appearances. “Hearing those words from the coach shows that this guy has got so much confidence in me and it would be so sad for me not to have that same confidence in myself,” said Maboe. “I understand the frustration, but I’m going to work hard for Sundowns. This is a club that has done so much for me, and I’ll rise to the occasion again.” This season, things have not gone the way Maboe had hoped. He scored only one league goal in 17 appearances before the season was stopped due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Maboe said this is just a phase and it will pass. “I’m looking forward to working harder and focusing on the positives,” he added. “I don’t think that being booed by fans will have much of an impact on me. Maybe I may blame my loss of form on fatigue, but I feel I could have done better.”
