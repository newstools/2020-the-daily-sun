 Ntuli, his deputy Nonhlanhla Nzuza, speaker Sondelaphi Sibiya and four municipality officials were bust while distributing food parcels and sanitizers to the street vendors at Inkandla CBD. Ntuli told Daily Sun this morning that they were arrested around 4 pm yesterday and were released in the early hours this morning (Friday). He said they were charged under national disaster management act and were told that that broke lockdown rules. He said they were arrested together 13 people who were supposed to receive food parcels.Â  Ntuli is also IFP provincial IFP chairman.  He said it became clear that their arrest was political because they heard that certain leaders from the political party instructed police to arrest them.  He said in the municipality coronavirus command team police also sit so they were part of the planning. He said to prove that it was political plan they were called to come back to be arrested because they have already left the area. Explaining what actually happened he said after government allowed street vendors to return to their tables the municipality decided to deliver sanitizers to them. He said they also brought some food parcells to support them because they haven't been selling anything during lockdown so they had no food to eat at their homes. He said if it was wrong to distribute food parcels why premier Sihle Zikalala wasn't arrested together with the MECs when they distributed food parcells in Umlazi yesterday. National cops spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed the arrested and said the seven officials were released on R1000 bail each while the 13 people paid the admission of guilty fine of R1500 each.
