MOST people believe the dead deserve to rest in peace, but the Sebelas have taken it to a whole new level. The family from Bonn Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, have made the local cemetery look like a mini residential complex with beautiful graves.

His death, two years ago, broke my heart. I had to let his body go but I made sure he received a roof to sleep under. “I sleep peacefully under a beautiful roof, so why can’t my son whom I loved dearly?” said Isak, who is now a businessman. He said his father Alphios died in 1999 and was also buried in the same cemetery. “This cemetery is home to many of our loved ones. It’s not about status or showing off with money. It’s about showing continuous respect for our loved ones,” he said. Isak said his late father, who was a senior pastor, moved to the village from neighbouring Sedan and brought the church to the village for the first time. “My father was a remarkable man and this is another reason why we saw it fit that we continue to honour our son, who was named after him,” he said. Isak said the head of the tombstone cost R100 000 and it was completed before the tomb house could be constructed. Village headman Macana Machimana said the family was setting a high standard for the village. “We had to work on the yard of the cemetery to make sure villagers followed suit. “We made sure their graves were neat and organised,” he said.
