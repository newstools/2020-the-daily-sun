President Cyril Ramaphosa says he has called on the Auditor-General to put in place systems that will prevent the potential looting of billions committed to the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. He made the comments to journalists on Friday, days after announcing a R500 billion Covid-19 relief fund, of which R20 billion will be given to municipalities. "I do not want to hear of a commission request after this. I do not want to hear of a Covid commission, therefore we want to take proactive steps," said Ramaphosa. The president spent most of Friday touring some of Gauteng's facilities, which have been prepared in response to the deadly global outbreak. "We are going to keep a hawk's eye on how the money is going to be spent," said Ramaphosa when asked how corruption could be prevented during the crisis.      Earlier, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Health MEC Bandile Masuku showed Ramaphosa a field hospital set up at the Nasrec conference centre. He also visited one of the province's food banks and Charlotte Maxeke Hospital.  Makhura told the president the province had more than 8 000 beds, and aimed to add more to reach 10 000.   Makhura also thanked Ramaphosa for providing support to the province and its municipalities, jokingly calling for more support, even in financial terms. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-vows-that-covid-19-budget-to-fall-prey-to-looting-20200424
