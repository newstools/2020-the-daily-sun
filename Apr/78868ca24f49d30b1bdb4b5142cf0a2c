ALMOST all the artists under Afrotainment are booked through the label's publicist Nkule Shezi. But DJ Cndo has set tongues wagging on social media when she posted her own booking details. This left many of her followers asking themselves if she has dumped her record label Afrotainment. DJ Cndo, real name Sindisiwe Zungu, posted her gmail account: sindisiwe.zungu59@gmail.com and cellphone number on Instagram and captioned it: destined for greatness as her booking details. DJ Cndo has been a member of Afrotainment, which is owned by DJ Tira, for a long time now. She is dubbed the first lady of the stable. But she has not been releasing and rumours were that she was no longer happy to be part of the stable which has released Dladla Mshunqisi, Joocy, Duncan, Tipsy and others. But when Sunday Sun asked her about that last year, she denied rumours saying they were lies. We couldn't get hold of DJ Tira and Afrotainment to respond to the booking details posted on social media.
