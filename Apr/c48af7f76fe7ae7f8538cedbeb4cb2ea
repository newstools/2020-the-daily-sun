Volkswagen is one of the worldâ€™s leading car manufacturers, and it is without a doubt that people are fascinated by the meanings of their badges. First of all, the TSI badge stands for Turbo Stratified Injection, the TSI is basically the petrol version of the TDI. TDI stands for Turbocharged Direct Injection, the TSI engine which was introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2014 on the Polo facelift utilises the features of the TDI.  The engines that come with the TSI badge are known for their powerful performance and fuel efficiency. These TSI engines allow for higher torque at lower Revs Per Minute (RPM), this means that the engine is able to offer more power with less petrol usage. In South Africa, the TSI badge was made popular by the Polo TSI which has been a best seller for several years, until the brand released a new Polo. Even after the new model was introduced, the TSI brand still supplies the needed power and less petrol usage in the current Polo and has even been extended to several other VW models.
