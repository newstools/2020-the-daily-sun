Finding a huge market for African content, US-based streaming service Netflix has not looked back. Another original African series, Blood&Water is on its way. The drama series that follows the life of 16-year-old Puleng Khumalo (Ama Qamata), who gets herself transferred to the same high school as a girl she suspects is her sister, who was kidnapped at birth. As she investigates the case of her older sister, who was kidnapped at birth, she meets the beautiful  Fikile “Fiks’’ Bhele from a nearby private school, played by Khosi Ngema. Puleng finds an ally in assistant investigator Wade, played by Dillon Windvogel, while having to handle the stubborn Wendy Dlamini, played by Natasha Thahane who's a bit too "woke". The series including a lineup of fresh talent including the two newcomers as the female leads, is directed by one of Mzansi's leading female directors, Nosipho Dumisa. About the casting process, Nosipho said: "Blood & Water presented us with the opportunity to bring a mixture of fresh new faces alongside seasoned actors. After seeing hundreds of actors and newcomers from Cape Town and Joburg, we’re excited to be a part of opening up the industry.’ SEE POST BELOW: The Second African Original Series.
