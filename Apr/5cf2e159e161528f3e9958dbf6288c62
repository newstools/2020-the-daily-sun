MAMELODI Sundowns are determined to defend their Absa Premiership title, says forward Lebohang Maboe. Sundowns are second on the Premiership table with 44 points from 23 matches, four points behind Ernst Middendorp’s Kaizer Chiefs. However, the Tshwane giants have a game in hand. The league was suspended last month due to the outbreak of coronavirus that has forced the PSL and most other leagues worldwide to be stopped. The PSL hopes to conclude the 2019-20 programme by 30 June, but there’s no guarantee that this would be achievable as South Africa is currently on lockdown. But when the season does resume, Maboe says they will have an edge over Chiefs because they know how to handle the final third of the season. Sundowns have been in this situation before in the past two seasons when they were chasing Orlando Pirates for the league with a couple of games to go, and they won both titles. “I think we have an experienced coach (Pitso Mosimane) with a lot of experienced players,” said Maboe. “We finished last season very strongly. We don’t want to put pressure on ourselves, we just want to take it one game at the time.” Statistically, Sundowns are strong when it comes to the last third of the season and more so under Mosimane. In the last six seasons that Mosimane has spent at Chloorkop, Sundowns have gained more points than Chiefs in the last 10 games on five occasions. It was only in 2014-15 that Amakhosi were untouchable under coach Stuart Baxter compared to Mosimane’s men. That was the last time Chiefs won the league. “Sundowns are a big team, not just in South Africa but in Africa,” added Maboe. “Every competition we compete, our fans expect us to win.”
