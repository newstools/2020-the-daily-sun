Actress and singer Jennifer Lopez has postponed her nuptials because of Covid-19, which has forced the whole world into a lockdown. The star is currently engaged to former basketball player Alex Rodriguez (44), and has been engaged to him since March last year. The 50-year-old star, who is a mother to twins Max and Emme, both 12, told Ellen DeGeneres from the comfort of her Miami home that the coronavirus has indeed had an impact on her planned nuptials, which she has had to shelve. "Actually, yes it did affect it a little bit, so we will see what happens now, as far as dates or anything like that," she told the host via a recorded video to Ellen.
