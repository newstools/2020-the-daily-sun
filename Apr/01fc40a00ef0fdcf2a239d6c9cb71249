Actress Brenda Ngxoli remembers her time on SABC1 comedy show Ses'TopLa, when she played Pinky. She said she cycled to the audition because she was low on funds. Fortunately, she got the role and she said her co-stars, Warren Masemola and Busi Lurayi were there for her. "Warren would pick me up every morning and give me a lift to work. Because I mostly roll solo in life, during this period Warren would insist I be his date (if there were function) or at times second date.... much love to his beautiful wife," she wrote. She went on to thank her other co-stars, like Jason Goliath, Judy Ditch and Trevor Gumbi. Brenda won her first SAFTA award for acting in a comedy. Read:Â WATCH: FANS MEET THE DRUNK BOITY!
