Karel Selota (53) wants the person who killed his son to bury him! This was after his body was allegedly thrown into a river outside their village of Kgomo Kgomo in the North West on Wednesday. According to the family, Bokkie left home last Tuesday to go hunting on the farm with his friends. His uncle Jacob Pitsoane (32) said he left with his two dogs. He said Bokkie didn’t return home and they only suspected something happened to him when he got a call from his friends. “They asked if Bokkie came home safely. It was strange and I even asked them if anything had happened to him as they’d never called me before.” He said they then went to the cops to report him missing. His other uncle Koloba Modibane (42) said they asked the police to search the farm Bokkie was hunting at. “His friends didn’t want to tell us the truth, but we knew something was wrong. We searched the farm until we found him in a dam. We also found his two dogs, which were also killed.” Bokkies’ mum Sophie (43) said her son was her last hope for a better life. Karel said he warned Bokkie about going hunting. “He never listened. But he only hunted for rabbits and small animals. He wouldn’t go to people’s farms to hurt their animals.” He said Bokkie was bright and had finished matric last year. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops in Pienaarsrivier outside Bela Bela opened an inquest docket. “The police search and rescue unit received a report about a body that was seen floating in the dam. “On arrival at the scene with emergency services, they then recovered the decomposed body of a man and some of his body parts were allegedly missing.” He urged anyone with information to contact Detective Warrant Officer Joseph Skhosana on 082 403 4035 or 08600 10111.
