  She has requested areas, including farming communities, who have water to share with those who do not have. Sisulu said they have now centralised the direction of water and procurement to provide it where it was unavailable. "Our municipalities are called water boards. They have the right to have water and they take water from bulk supply to home taps. "Water control will now be under the command centre which is situated at Rand Water and where all directions and commands, where water is concerned, will be coming from," Sisulu said. The command centre will ensure that all water tanks, which have been procured, are taken to places that are in need. Sisulu said municipalities would be responsible for identifying places where the water tanks would be placed.Â   "All water boards will be reporting on a regular basis to the command centre in Johannesburg. Should anybody experience water shortage, this is the place we will be able to direct our tankers to.
