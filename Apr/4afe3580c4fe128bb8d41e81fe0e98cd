RAPPER L-Tido and his former label are working on fixing their issues. This after the rapper posted a video on social media claiming he can’t release his new single Ghetto because of his previous contract with Universal Music. L-Tido, real name Thato Madonsela, was an independent artist for 10 years before he joined the label in 2017. The Dlala Ka Yona hitmaker said his contract was negotiated based on the fact that he was an established artist. “I released an album with Universal and was not happy with the way they handled it. That’s what made me want to leave. ALSO READ: MASTERCLASSES BY ACTRESS RAMI CHUENE “I spoke to people at the label and we agreed to go our separate ways. I communicated six months ago and signed that I am leaving. But when I was about to release my single, I found out I can’t upload my music on digital platforms.” He said he spoke to the label’s lawyers, who said there was a big misunderstanding and they were fixing it. “The label called me and we had a great talk. We are good right now,” said L-Tido. When contacted for comment Michelle Green, who’s the label’s head of legal, said: “L-Tido was amicably released from his contract with Universal Music on 12 July last year by mutual written agreement between us. We have not tried to stop any of his music from being released – to suggest otherwise is false. L-Tido was mistaken when he made a comment on social media that Universal had prevented the release of his new song.”
