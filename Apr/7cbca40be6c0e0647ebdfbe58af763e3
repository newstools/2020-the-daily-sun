Former Isidingo and Scandal! actor Bohang Moeko is not allowing the lockdown to slow his workout sessions. The hunk star may be indoors, but he is making every effort to stay in shape during the lockdown period. What is fun about Bohang's workout is that he is doing it with bae, Chantel, whom he met two years ago via social media. Taking to his Twitter account, the heartthrob wrote: "Lockdown can't keep us down. Adapt to the given circumstances. Do what you have to do keep growing physically, mentally and spiritually."
