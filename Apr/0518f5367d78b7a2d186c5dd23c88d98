 LAST year around this time, the body count of the people who died on the roads was leading the news headlines. Last year 162 people died last year during the Easter Weekend as a result of road accidents. But this year, not even a single life as has been lost as a result accidents, thanks to the lockdown. Though corona virus has killed 25 people in South Africa so far, the number is lesser than the people who died in accidents last year. Lockdown might have inconvenienced a lot of South Africans, but it has prevented the regular blood spillage on the roads. The then Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande last year when he announced the stats said that the fatalities had decreased by 48% from 309 in 2018 to 162 in 2019. There was decrease of 147 fatalities. RTMC Spokesman, Simon Zwane, who always keep the SunTeam updated on what is happening on the roads during usually busy times such as Easter, said they haven’t received any reports of major accidents this weekend. “There was only one accident in the Eastern Cape, no one died there it was just injuries he said.” He said it is because people have to carry permits when they travel from one province to another, which is why there has been less movement of the national roads. The N1 to Polokwane, N3 to Durban, N1 to Bloemfontein and the N4 to Mpumalanga as well as the N2 in the Cape Provinces are usually the roads that would see a lot of traffic around this time, but because of the lockdown they have empty. Crime has also gone down due to the lockdown. Analysing the crime and comparing the first week of the lockdown to the same period in 2019, Minister Bheki Cele confirmed that: - murder cases had dropped from 326 to 94; - rape cases dropped from 699 to 101; - cases of assault with intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, dropped from 2 673 to 456; and - trio crimes dropped from 8 853 to 2 098.
