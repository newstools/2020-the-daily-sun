"No soldier will be able to find our booze." With Lockdown rules allowing no transport or sale of alcohol, boozers have come up with ways to transport their favourite drinks. A video showing how some men came up with a plan to move their booze from one place to another has emerged on social media. In the video, the men, who are not showing their faces, could be heard boasting that no soldier or Bheki Cele will be able to find their booze. The men are seen hiding several booze bottles in a punctured car wheel. The origin of the video is not known. Boozers have been having a hard time as there's nothing to quench their thirst with since lockdown started. All Liquor outlets are banned from selling any beverage during this period. A Joburg based Liquor Forum has been reported as planning to take the president to court to try and force him to lift the ban on booze.
