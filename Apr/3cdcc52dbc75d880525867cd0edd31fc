THE Douglasdale Police Station in Fourways, north of Joburg, temporarily shut its doors. This after some members of the police station tested positive for the Coronavirus. Sunday Sun understands this came into effect yesterday, when officers started their morning shift. According to a police officer, who cannot be identified because they are not allowed to speak to the media, officers have now resorted to opening new cases telephonically, and if necessary, they come to the residence of the complainant. “We were told as we came for the shift today (yesterday), some members have tested positive for the Coronavirus, so the station’s main building had to be closed to protect other staff members,” said the officer. When the SunTeam visited the station yesterday, we established that police were using a mobile station situated at the parking area outside the main building. None of the officers we found agreed to talk to us, but directed us to police national spokesperson, Vishnu Naidoo. Said Naidoo in a telephonic interview: “I’m currently awaiting a report which should be finalised in the afternoon. So, I can’t comment on the matter right now.”
