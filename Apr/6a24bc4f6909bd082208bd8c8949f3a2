SIX people have been arrested and charged for pretending to be cops and soldiers. A 47-year-old retired army reservist from Tshwane was among the six arrested. Tshwane Metro Police spokesman Isaac Mathamba said the man was caught skipping a red traffic light in Pretoria North on Saturday. He said during the arrest, the man was wearing an army uniform, despite no longer being an office. “He is retired as a reservist. He has been charged with impersonating as a South African National Defence Force member,” he said. Masondo said on Sunday, a 40-year-old man was arrested after being caught driving a vehicle fitted with red lights and a siren. The suspect could not produce proof that he was an Emergency Services employee. “As police were searching the car, they found an unlicensed firearm with ammunition as well as traffic cones belonging to the South African Police Service,” said Masondo. He said a former reservist and two accomplices were also arrested for impersonating police officers and common robbery. He said they received information about two women wearing police uniform and a man committing common robbery. “A lookout for the suspects was conducted. A vehicle matching the description given was spotted and stopped in Soshanguve. Upon questioning the occupants, it was established that one female was a former police reservist while the other female and male were just members of the community,” he said. Masondo said inside the vehicle there were police uniforms, an unfilled in police docket and trays of eggs.
