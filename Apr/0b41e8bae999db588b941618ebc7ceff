THE late Charles “Big boy” Maja’s family held a meeting to discuss all the challenges they faced during his funeral service on Saturday. The meeting was held at the late Skeem Saam actor’s home in Kopermyn Village at Ga-Maja outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Wednesday. This followed the R5 000 fine the family received from police for failing to comply with lockdown regulations after more than 50 people attended the funeral. Charles’ daughter, Mologare (25), said they took necessary precautions to ensure compliance. “We had arranged for 50 people to attend the funeral and barricaded our street corner with red tape. But things got out of control as his fans joined funeral proceedings outside the tent,” she said. “We’d like to take this opportunity to convey our sincere apologies to law enforcement agencies on behalf of those who came without our confirmation.”  His wife Sophy (53) said life would never be the same without him as he was their pillar of strength. “His life was the same on and off screen, except he never touched alcohol. He loved playing Ladysmith Black Mambazo songs while designing clothes. He had time for us and did everything we needed, despite his busy schedule. We’re going to miss him in many ways.” Charles left behind three kids.
