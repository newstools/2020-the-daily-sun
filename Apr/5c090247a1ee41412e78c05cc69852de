With everyone being urged to stay at home during the
lockdown, public healthcare patients have been advised to collect their chronic
medication at ATM pharmacies. Right ePharmacy has erected ATM pharmacies for patients
living in and around Joburg and Bloemfontein. The ATM pharmacies are chronic medicine collection points
designed to give out medication quickly to patients who depend on the public
healthcare system. Fanie Hendriksz, managing director of Right ePharmacy
urged patients to use ATM dispensaries so that they don’t have to wait in long
queues at their local clinics. “It’s become more urgent than ever that we transfer
patients to these fast and advanced ATM pharmacies. “We have seen a steep increase in patient numbers at our
ATM pharmacies over the last couple of weeks and we have geared up for the increase,”
Hendriksz said. ALSO READ: SHORTAGE OF LAB MICE DELAY CORONAVIRUS CURE! The advanced pharmacies are located in the following
areas: To use the ATM pharmacies, you will have to consult with
your clinic first so that they can confirm whether you are eligible or not. “You then complete a consent form and become registered.
You will be given a two months’ supply of medication and you will be given a
date for your next collection at an ATM pharmacy. “On that day, go to the ATM pharmacy helpdesk with your
ID or passport and clinic appointment card where you will be helped,” Hendriksz
added.
