SBAHLE Mpisane has fully recovered from the car accident that nearly killed her. The Fitness Bunny, as she’s popularly known, was involved in an accident on the Victoria Embankment in Durban in 2018 and was in a coma for a month. Sharing her experience, she said she didn’t have steel rods in her body any more. “I had metals in my body from last year and it was going through my wounds, which was tricky for me. I’m taking everything one day at a time,” she said. “I had the metals taken out even though they were meant to be removed late this year.” Sbahle said she was pushing herself to do new things and she believed that was why she made such a quick recovery. “When I was found at the scene, the doctor thought I wouldn’t make it. I broke 95% of my bones and my face was badly fractured. “I recovered because I’m used to hectic training. I always joke that I’ve fully recovered because my body probably thought it was one of my training sessions. “My recovery has made me look at life positively. I’m grateful because when I had the accident, I was supposed to lose a leg. “But my mum made sure they didn’t amputate. I couldn’t even take three steps. I spent a lot of time crying.” Sbahle said she could now walk around the house and go out like normal people. “I’m no longer using a wheelchair. I cook, clean the house and take steps. I’m grateful for my stubbornness. “I work out a lot and eat healthily because I understand I need to keep my body in good shape and have a strong immune system.”
