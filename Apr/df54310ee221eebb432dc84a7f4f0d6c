FORMER Bafana Bafana midfielder Maimane Phiri has also been forced to move his annual MAP Games indefinitely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Phiri, who started his professional career with Jomo Cosmos, said the virus has disrupted his plans for the tournament to start next month as per norm. “We have engaged the sponsors and everyone involved in making MAP Games possible to come up with a solution. We will have the games before December this year, but we still need to find a suitable date,” said Phiri. Phiri has also raised his concerns about Alexandra residents who refuse to adhere to the nationwide lockdown order due to the coronavirus outbreak. He explained: “Everybody must stick to the rules to avoid infections and spreading the virus. We need to keep a safe social distance, wash our hands and stay home until the government has defeated the virus. “It pains me that there are people who still don’t believe the virus exists. “I would like to thank the nurses and doctors who are helping in hospitals. “I hope they will one day get acknowledged for the good work they are doing.” The 45-year-old started the amateur sports festival in 2001 in a bid to plough back to the community of Alexandra township for the support they have shown him during his football career. The games host four different sporting codes – soccer, netball, disabled schools sports fun day and a fun walk. The football off-season games have grown significantly since their inception and have drawn interest from participants throughout Mzansi and neighbouring countries such as Botswana and Lesotho. The games have helped unearth top class footballers such as Kaizer Chiefs striker Lebogang Manyama and Mpho Makola of Cape Town City. Added Phiri: “The Under 13, 15, 17 and 20 football competition was due to start at the end of May. But we realised that it won’t be possible due to the lockdown.
