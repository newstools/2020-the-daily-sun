A DURBAN hospital may have to be shut down after about 20 workers tested and 11 were discovered to be positive of the Coronavirus (Covid-19). This was revealed by the KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala during a media briefing that was held in Mayville Durban this afternoon (Friday). The KZN MEC for Health Nomagugu Simelane Zulu was also at the briefing. Zikalala said they are currently tracing patients that were admitted and treated in this particular hospital. "We will not disclose the hospital for now but we may have to shut it down. We have also asked them not to admit more people for now," said Zikalala. Zikalala said the hospital where a teacher from Umlazi south of Durban died at is also their concern. "Her three relatives who tested positive are currently being treates," said Zikalala. Zikalala said that in KZN alone there have been six deaths reported and 225 cases of Covid-19 cases. "All districts now have positive cases. So the focus now should be on how people should adhere to the lockdown rules," he said. He said they are appealing to residents to adhere to the lockdown and stop moving around. "When residents are in stores and clinics they should practice social distancing at all time," he said. Zikalala said tomorrow they will launch home screening in Umlazi south of Durban. He said there are so far 1 400 tracers and 10 400 community health care workers that are currently being trained for screenings. MEC Simelane Zulu said the community health workers that will be screening will be easily identified. She said they should start on Monday. "We will announce in advance which area will go to. And the field workers will be introduced to local leaders so that criminals will not take advantage of this programme," said Simelane Zulu.
