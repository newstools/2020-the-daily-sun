GOSPEL singer Vusimuzi Phalane wants to fight gender-based violence through his music. The 40-year-old from Mogoto Village in Zebediela, Limpopo, has been preaching the word of God through his music for 19 years. He recently released his seventh album, O Ya Halalela. He told SunBuzz he saw the 16-track album as an opportunity to address the challenges many people come across in their daily lives.

He said music is powerful and can reach every corner of the country. Having been in the industry for nearly 20 years has shaped him into being a better artist and person. “I believe in God and I’ve seen His power in all my successful projects,’ he said. “Challenges were always in my way. However, through God’s presence in my life they were easily overcome. “My love and passion for gospel led me to my debut album Ke Nako, which I released in 2001.” He said he’s never thought of quitting. “My presence in this industry after so many years has proven that nothing is impossible,” he said.
