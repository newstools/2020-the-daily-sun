THEY have had water shortages for years and can’t just wash their hands every day. And now residents of Pax Village, Senwabarwana, Limpopo fear the coronavirus will attack them. Resident Johannes Mataboge said they see it attacking them. He said they all queue early in the morning at a single tap, hoping to get water. “Yet there is no water,” he said. “We still have a long way to go to winning this battle if we have to do it without water.” Johannes said their leaders are in a comfortable place. “They can wash their hands any time, while we are at risk in our villages,” said Johannes. “Water is life and we need water from our government.” Resident Shocky Seakamela said they had to dig deep in their pockets to buy water from neighbouring villages. “Our government has failed us and we should not be blamed for spreading the virus,” she said. “If government knew water is life, it should have given us water before. We are living on the edge of the grave because of our government’s negligence.” Capricorn District municipal spokesman Moffat Senyatsi said the municipality has made water tankers available for everyday household use. “The municipality has received 30 Jojo water tanks from the Ministry of Water Affairs to add to the capacity of our tankers, so we can get to everybody,” said Senyatsi. He said the tankers could also be requested for unplanned events such as funerals. “Residents can contact their ward councillor to arrange a tanker and fill up their drums as temporary relief while the municipality looks for a permanent solution,” he said.
