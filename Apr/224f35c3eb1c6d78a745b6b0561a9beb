ON 7 April, a video showing the Mangaung Metro Municipality spokesman saying dead will infect other dead with coronavirus went viral.  This was when the spokesman Qondile Khedama was interviewed by the SABC TV news on matter of funerals of those who had been killed by the virus. In the short video, Khedama is heard saying: "We have separated the graves. This is to make those who died long time ago not be mixed with these ones (who died of Corona virus) be cause they are still infectious." He further explained that there will be few number of the people at the grace during the burial of person died of the virus. The video made rounds on social media with many people laughing with confusion. But Khedama has clarified the confusing video and said he retracts from the confusing statement he has made. Khedama said: "As Mangaung Metro, we are aware of the confusion that came as a result of our recent statement on the burial of remains of persons infected with COVID-19. This communiqué serves to retract the version broadcast on SABC News which caused anxiety in the community that “burial sites of people who died as a result of Covid-19 will be separated from others." To this effect, the version is hereby unconditionally retracted. As the city, we are working closely with the Free State provincial government. We are also encouraging communities to play their role by following the regulations to curb the spread of COVID-19. We wish to apologise for the confusion that our earlier statement might have unintentionally created." Khedama
