IT’S saddening that opportunistic petty criminals have exploited the lockdown period. This as they’ve broken into schools and helped themselves to equipment that’s necessary for pupils to learn. So far, Mpumalanga has reported 72 break-ins, while Gauteng has about 28 schools burnt down for reasons unknown. Only the thieves can explain why because, from a distance, there’s no justification for such barbaric behaviour. Remember, schools haven’t been shut permanently. We’ll need them when the lockdown period ends. I’d like to urge these petty thieves involved in such irresponsible behaviour to stop destroying our children’s future. This does more harm than good.Although many of the thieves will make the excuse of being unemployed and trying to eek out a living, profiting from theft isn’t good. It does more harm than good. Also, people within our communities know these thieves and vandals. They must blow the whistle on them. We can’t keep them among us, as they’ll tomorrow steal directly from us.
