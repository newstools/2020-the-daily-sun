TIP-OFFS from residents have been helping mistreated workers. Authorities recently acted on a tip-off that workers were allegedly being made to sleep in groups, which is against coronavirus regulations. After investigations, a manager at the Trade Port Distribution Centre in Phoenix, Durban, was arrested on Monday. A group of 11 foreigners were arrested for working without necessary permits. Economic Development MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said the operation was conducted by inspectors from the department, the Consumer Protection Unit, the labour department, police, crime intelligence, Metro cops and Home Affairs officials. “We continue to receive complaints and tip-offs from residents who’re witnessing indignity and hardship during this period,” she said. The MEC said there’d been an increase in tip-offs relating to the illegal practice of locking up workers in warehouses and factories. “While we understand this is done to avoid arrests in connection with lockdown violations, we blame employers for putting the lives of workers at risk,” she said. The MEC said any complaint received by the department would be investigated and addressed. “The business community must know employing undocumented foreigners during this period will have devastating consequences,” she said. The suspects are expected in the Verulam Magistrates Court soon on charges relating to hiring undocumented foreigners, visa violations and possession of a firearm without a licence. Resident Khanyisile Khumalo (39) said: “People who are scared to lose their jobs end up doing things that put their health at risk. “But I think they’ll now think twice.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said a total of five illegal immigrants and a manager were expected in court.
