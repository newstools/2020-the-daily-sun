Dear MizzB I’m a 23-year-old journalism student who’s dating a celeb. When he proposed last month, I told him I needed to talk to my parents first. They don’t like him because we’re from a poor family. I love him but my family says he’s out of my league. What should I do. - Confused Hey Sista People perceive backgrounds differently. Generally, rich people date rich people, but that’s not always the case. Individuals are allowed to make choices and decisions. Talk to your boyfriend and find out what his views are. Love knows no boundaries, and sometimes parents find it difficult to accept this. Once you and your partner agree, it would be fruitful to talk to your parents to make them understand.
