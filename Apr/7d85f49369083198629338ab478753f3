REALITY TV star Lasizwe has done his bit to help out during these trying times. The YouTuber and media personality, whose real name is Thulasiwe Dambuza, took to Twitter on a mission to bless a few lucky people with electricity tokens on Wednesday. He asked tweeps to send him their meter numbers, and bought R100 worth of electricity for 10 people. The internet sensation said he realised that people desperately needed electricity during the lockdown. “When I thought about it, electricity came out number one on the list. People need electricity for lights and cooking, and entertainment,” he said. “Staying at home without electricity must be horrible. I figured this would help.” This was not the first time Lasizwe had helped out during this lockdown. “Before the electricity tokens, I gave people food vouchers and sent them money to buy groceries. We need to help each another during this time. What I’m doing is not a lot, but it’s helping and I’m happy about that.” Lasizwe shared his good deed on social media and advised the recipients to use his gift wisely, which seemed to rub some Twitter users up the wrong way. When asked about how he handled the negative response, he said: “I just meant that people should use it sparingly.They shouldn’t switch on unnecessary appliances and they mustn’t cook food that takes time. The people who were bashing me weren’t offering any help. I did.”
