WASHING hands in these troubled times is essential. But yesterday, residents at the Trafalgar building in Jeppestown, Joburg, were furious as they haven’t had water since Friday! They have to leave their homes to get water from a building across the road. “Usually, when we don’t electric, the taps also go dry,” Sthembele Sibanda told Daily Sun. She said the building manager wasn’t telling them why there isn’t water. “I have kids in the house. I tell them not to flush when they pee. The smell has become unbearable,” she said. The building manager said the electrical pump which pumps water into the building was damaged because of load shedding. “We couldn’t get replacement parts because of the lockdown and the plumber by-passed the pump,” said the manager. He said the pressure was not that good during the day, but later in the evening, people were able to get water.
