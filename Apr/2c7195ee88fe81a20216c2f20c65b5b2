A 22-year-old suspect was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly selling fake permits to informal business owners. Allegedly, the suspect from Olivenhoutbosch in Centurion was selling permits to business owners who are not part of the essential services. Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the Hawks’ serious corruption investigation office received a tip-off and made contact with the suspect while pretending to buy a permit. “The suspect met with a team member and was immediately arrested after he produced a permit for an R300 payment,” Mulamu said. The team proceeded to his house where they seized a laptop and other documents. He is expected to appear at the Pretoria Magistrates Court.
