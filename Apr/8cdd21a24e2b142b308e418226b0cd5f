THE ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters have described some of the ANC premiers as populist after their faces were put on hand sanitisers. The move to put the premiers’ faces as part of the branding of sanitisers, which are distributed to citizens to curb the spread of Covid-19, has also been described as abuse of power. In a scathing statement, the red berets said: “This is a direct abuse of power, tax payer’s money and outright populism. “Above all, it is a desperate and shameful use of the Covid-19 pandemic for popularity. “By putting their faces on the sanitisers that they distribute on behalf of government, they are essentially campaigning for their political party and themselves. They do this cheap political scoring during a difficult time of vulnerability to Covid-19 that we are faced with as a nation.” According to the EFF the populists are Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Free State’s Sefora Ntombela, Job Mokgoro, premier of the troubled North West, as well as Mpumalanga’s Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane. The EFF also accused the premiers of using taxpayers' money to engage in self-worship and must be seen for who they are. “We call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to condemn and reign on these attention seekers, and put this nonsensical behaviour to halt. These premiers must not be allowed to traumatise our people with their differently looking faces. “Our people do not deserve such disrespect and abuse of office by these nasal gazers who pose as public representatives.” The EEF stated that the Covid-19 pandemic is not a time for individuals to make messiahs of themselves. “It is not a time for ridiculous acts of selfishness and glory seeking. We call on public representatives to practice decency, humanity and focus on protecting our people.”
