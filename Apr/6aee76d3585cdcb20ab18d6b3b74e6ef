Newly married Mohale Motaung bragged on Twitter about his stock of booze during the current lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered that all booze-selling stores be closed for the duration of the lockdown period. Many South Africans prepared themselves by stocking up on booze and Mohale followed suit. Taking to Twitter, he bragged about the booze he has at home. "25 bottles of champagne, 6 bottles of sparkling wine, 2 bottles of Prosecco, 8 bottles of gin, 12 bottles of vodka, 4 bottles of whiskey, 1 bottle of aperol, 2 bottles of tequila, 1 bottle of JÃ¤germeister, 72 ciders, 12 beers and 4 bottles of wine. Quote Tweet," he responded to a tweep, who asked how much booze fellow tweeps had left in their stock.
