Sixteen suspects have been arrested since the weekend in Cape Town for breaking into businesses that are closed due to the national lockdown. Bob’s Bar, Harrington’s, Revelas Fisheries and Liny’s Baby shop were all targeted. CCID Safety & Security manager Mo Hendricks said the crimes were done by opportunists at various precincts. Hendricks said the most dramatic arrest took place on Saturday when three suspects were spotted stealing alcohol at Bob’s Bar. “Three suspects disappeared inside the premises, and the steel door was closed from the inside. Two of them then tried to escape by jumping from the top of the door but they were apprehended by CCID officers. “It was then discovered that alcohol to the value of R9 000 had been stolen from Bob’s Bar. The third suspect was never found. We believe he escaped over the rooftops and jumped down into Canterbury Street,” he said. Hendricks said the biggest arrest took place on Sunday at 10h35 where seven suspects were arrested for breaking into Liny’s Baby Shop. Three suspects were also arrested on Sunday for breaking into Revelas Fisheries in Long Street, with another two arrested for a house break-in. Meanwhile, two suspects were arrested for being in possession of tools used to break into cars. “We will not tolerate criminal activity in the CBD during the lockdown while our nation is trying to combat the coronavirus crisis. Criminals need to know that they will be caught and brought to book,” Hendricks added.
