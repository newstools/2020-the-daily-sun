HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has assured many that the Cuban doctors who have arrived in Mzansi will not take jobs of locals. Speaking during a special technical briefing this evening ,Mkhize squashed some of the skepticism around the arrival of the doctors. It has been particularly unions in the health sector who have been vocal that local health practitioners should not be sidelined in favour of the Cubans. But Mkhize also stated that doctors looking for placement should contact their provincial health departments. "Cuban doctors will not take anyone's post. They will be working alongside South Africans. We are also talking to some of the deans who have offeredn medical students" to help. As of today,South Africa's death toll sits at 93 with 4996 cases having been recorded.There are 2073 recoveries. "Cuban doctors will work alongside SA doctors and student doctors.Cuban doctors will help analyse trends and break it down block-to-block",added Mkhize. The Nelson Mandela-Fidel Castro (NMFC)  programme was forged by Presidents Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro in 1996 as part of the various bilateral agreements between South Africa and Cuba. Every year Mzansi sends its students doctors to Cuba and receives those who have finished their training. The 217 Cuban medical specialists will be dispersed across Mzansi as the country nears the end of its more than month long lockdown. "Gauteng will have 29 doctors, KZN 28, EC 20.Every province will have Cuban doctors.Cuba has always supported SA says 
We have to the game at this point," said Mkhize. "Once we have dealt with the issue of screening they will be released. They have been in quarantine for 19 days in Cuba, Mkhize says about the doctors.
