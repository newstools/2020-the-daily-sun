A HUSTLER and a businessman. This is what social media users called Prophet Shepherd Bushiri recently. Reports have emerged that Bushiri, known as Major 1, charges followers an R80-per-month subscription to be part of his online church services. But his church disputed the claims. Speaking to Daily Sun, spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said the online church service is free. “Our technical team generates a link that’s shared with all our church members and followers, and they log in and join the church freely. “On the other hand Prophetic Channel, our television, has developed an app people can download, subscribe to and watch programmes live. “The online church operates on video conferencing technology, which is completely different from the Major 1 app.” On Sunday, Bushiri announced the launch of his online services, supposedly in an attempt to curb the spread of Covid-19 and give worshippers a platform to praise from home. Enlightened Christian Gathering Church followers worldwide will be part of the free church services using the Zoom video conferencing app. Over six million people had apparently joined it. “Through video conferencing, those connected interact with the prophet just like in a normal church gathering. “They’re able to talk with the prophet and, most importantly, pray with him as their number one prayer partner. “The video conference is then broadcast live on Prophetic Channel TV, Major 1 Connect, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter,” said Bushiri. He said 6 000 people connected directly through Zoom during the launch, and more than 6 million connected to live broadcasts on Prophet Channel TV. According to Bushiri, more than 25 000 people were expected to connect through Zoom in coming weeks. Social media users had a lot to say.
