Two men were arrested for when they were caught transportating booze from Phokoane in Limpopo to Mpumalanga during Lockdown. The duo aged 27 and 49 were caught with a taxi full of cases of alcohol between the two provinces in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The two met a  roadblock which was comprised of the traffic officers from both provinces. Spokesman for Transport and Community Safety Matome Tauatsoala says the two suspects' car was pulled out and searched and alcohol was found.  "Our officers were conducting their routine duty when the Toyota Quantum approached them. The preliminary investigating revealed that  the alcohol in the car was a delivery from Phokoane in Sekhukhune and they were delivering it to Witbank in Mpumalanga. The suspects are facing charges in terms of Disaster management regulations. They violated the Nationwide lockdown regulations," he said. Tauatsoala urged motorists and residents to stay in their homes and avoid finding themselves in the wrong side of the law. He said violating the lockdown regulations is a serious case and the officers will not hesitate to arrest anyone found to have violated the laws. Since the lockdown started late last month several people who were found to be undermining the regulations were arrested and charged.
