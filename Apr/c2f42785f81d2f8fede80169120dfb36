THE air was thick with grief at Bokkie Selota’s funeral, held at his family home yesterday morning. The 24-year-old’s body was found in a dam on a farm outside Kgomo-Kgomo Village in the North West following his disappearance two weeks ago. According to his family, Bokkie left home to hunt with friends and never returned. His uncle Koloba Modibana said whoever killed Bokkie didn’t know the pain they caused. “We’re worried as a family and community, but we’re letting the police do their work,” said Koloba. “The community has been supporting us and giving us love. We’re grateful.” Koloba said the family had accepted that Bokkie is dead. “Everyone has their own way of passing. It’s unfortunate that we lost Bokkie like this, but we have to move on,” he said. Bokkie’s dad Karel (54) said the family had lost a potential breadwinner. “My son had a bright future. He finished matric last year and was going to start university after the lockdown,” he said. His mum Sophie (42) told Daily Sun the family would only find closure once the perpetrator was arrested. “The person who did this to my son must rot in jail,” she said. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police in Pienaarsrivier, outside Bela Bela, had opened an inquest docket. He said the investigation and post mortem would reveal the cause of death. “Anyone that can assist the police in this case should contact the CrimeStop number 08600 10111,” he said.
