 IF the Springboks’ 2019 World Cup triumph was a heroic tale, the story behind the famous win is even more remarkable.It’s an adventure that will be given life in the coming months with SuperSport and SA Rugby’s six-part documentary, “Chasing the Sun”, deep in production ahead of release, planned for August.A SuperSport camera crew travelled with the Boks for the duration of 2019 getting unprecedented behind-the-scenes access throughout the lead-up and during the Rugby World Cup.With unique access and exclusive contributions from coaching staff, players and commentators, the documentary is the story of how a team, a nation and the world came to discover that we are all indeed stronger together.“From the clips I’ve seen, this will reveal an entirely new layer of what makes the Springboks great,” said Gideon Khobane, SuperSport chief executive. “It is a powerful story about changing fortunes and changing mindsets, about pressure and hope, about recognising the power of inspiration, and learning what representation truly means.”  Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby, said: “The team welcomed the SuperSport crew into the inner sanctum for a warts-and-all view of what goes on behind the scenes. The team was very clear in its main focus – which was to win rugby matches – but we ended with a story and a journey that proved to be far bigger than the game.”  While the final against England is recalled by millions for several great moments, very few were in the inner sanctum from the start. “Chasing the Sun” therefore intends to lift the lid on the world of Springbok rugby like never before.
