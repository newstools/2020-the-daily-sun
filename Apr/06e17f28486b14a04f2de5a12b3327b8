TWO ANC Nelson Mandela Bay councilors are in hot water
for contravention of the lockdown regulations. It is alleged that ward 20 councilor Morris Ngabase
illegally issued permits to taxi drivers to enable them to operate during the
lockdown, while Vukile Dyele of Ward 29 is accused of holding a public meeting
which also contravenes the regulations. ANC Provincial Secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi welcomed the
arrest of the two councilors for their conduct. He said: "We also applaud the leadership of the
ANC's acting chief whip, Litho Suka who was instrumental in ensuring that the
ANC members serving in the Council are compliant and subjected to the same regulations
that all the citizens are supposed to follow. "We call upon the Nelson Mandela Bay Bay
Municipality and COGTA MEC Xolile Nqatha to urgently initiate disciplinary
proceedings for breach of the Code of Conduct of Councilors as their conduct
brought the government into disrepute," said Ngcukayitobi. "All ANC members and public representatives are
expected to display conduct which is above reproach and must lead by example as
they serve our communities. The ANC will institute its disciplinary proceedings
against the two councilors for bringing the organization into disrepute." "Majority of the citizens have heeded the call of
staying at home, and the ANC calls on all South Africans to abide by the
lockdown regulations as well as precautionary measures which were announced by
the government as part of curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic," he
said
