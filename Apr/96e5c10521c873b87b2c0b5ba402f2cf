The lockdown affects every South African. This means most people won’t be allowed to go to work and most businesses will close. The intention is to control the pandemic. During self-isolation, one may experience various emotions including: - Satisfaction and frustration: feeling productive and satisfied yet less productive at times - Optimism: looking forward to the break and using it to catch up on activities you’ve been avoiding - Anger: being confined may get too much and you may find yourself easily irritated and angry at times - Determination: telling yourself that even though it’s not an ideal situation, you’re going to push and stay positive - Depression: with time you’ll get bored and lose interest in your routine - Making meaning: reminding yourself of the importance of self-isolation - Acceptance: finally, you may end up accepting the situation for what it is and making peace with the fact that you have to do your best to manage this period without losing your sanity. This is a good time for families to be together!
