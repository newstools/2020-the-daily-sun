Outspoken poet Ntsiki Mazwai is taking on billionaire Patrice Motsepe. While the businessman and his family recently announced that they were donating R1 billion for Covid-19 relief, Ntsiki is not impressed. This time, she has taken to her Twitter account to ask if South Africans were consulted about the 5G project, saying he only wants to make money. "Did Patrice Motsepe engage South Africans about his 5G project? Did we say we re okay with the radiation and birth defects and getting cancer, so that we can make money?" she wrote.
