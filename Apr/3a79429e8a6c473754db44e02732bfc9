FOUR alleged criminals terrorizing the area of Seshego and its Extentions outside Polokwane in Limpopo were brutally assaulted by the community. Two of them died in separate incidents while the third one was hospitalized and the fourth suspect managed to run away from the mob. The attack took place on Friday and Saturday after reports of several burglaries at Extention 71 and 75. The same group of suspects allegedly broke into several houses in Extention 73 and 76 two weeks ago and the community chased them but they disappeared in the bushes in the middle of the night. The residents says the suspects had been breaking into their houses threatening them with a gun. One of the residents who spoke to Daily Sun on anonymity says unresolved cases are piling up at Seshego police station hence residents got angry. "Criminals are controlling our area and we live in fear in our homes. I can't blame the community for their actions because housebreaking is becoming a norm in our area." "Since the beginning of the Lockdown the community had been under attack from these criminals, hence the manhunt was launched against them," resident said. Limpopo Police Spokesman Motlafela Mojapelo said the community started with a manhunt on Friday finding whom they attacked. He said people must avoid taking the law in to their own hands. "An unknown man was attacked on Friday morning after he was accused of being part of the suspects terrorizing the communities. He later died in hospital. "On Saturday morning three unknown men believed to be aged between 22 and 25 were attacked at Extension 75. The third one managed to ran away while two of them were assaulted. They were taken to hospital and one of them died due to the injuries," said Mojapelo.
