CRUCIAL talks between unions and government are underway to save SA Express from collapsing. This is amid reports that a new airline will be launched to replace SA Express after the Gauteng High Court placed it under provisional liquidation. The final decision will be made in June, but Numsa spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said unions were talking with the government with a view to saving the airline. I MISS 4-5! Hlubi-Majola said the next few days would be crucial in determining the airline’s future. “We have to agree in the next 48 hoursWe’re discussing a restructured SAA and the form it takes,” she said. “What would it take to save the airline? A commitment from government. “If government doesn’t commit, SAA and SA Express will definitely collapse.” She said Numsa and the South African Cabin Crew Association accepted that the aviation industry had taken a knock from the coronavirus pandemic.

In a joint statement, the unions warned members against what they called propaganda being circulated by business rescuers driving workers to sign severance packages. The statement said if workers signed voluntary packages, they’d be helping those who wanted to destroy the airline and have it sold. Hlubi-Majola said the unions had discussed the issue of the airline being put under provisional liquidation with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, and they were encouraged by his commitment.
