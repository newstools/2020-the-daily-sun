CAPE TOWN looks set to welcome back the Cape derby, if indications in the National First Division are anything to go by. Ajax Cape Town lead the pack with 48 points and look a sure bet for automatic promotion back to the elite league. And that is certainly pleasing for one John Comitis, who has keenly been following developments in the lower division. Just as local football was happy to welcome the birth of the Cape derby, Ajax crashed out of the Absa Premiership. But the Cape Town City boss is among those ready to see the return of the Urban Warriors. On 48 points, Ajax only need four more wins to wrap up their GladAfrica Championship and get on board the PSL gravy train once football returns after the coronavirus lockdown. “It looks like Ajax will be coming back. They are leading in the NFD at the moment,” said Comitis. “In the last Cape derby we had 18 000 spectators. It was a record number for local football in Cape Town. “But we still need to find out about the future of Ajax. “I mean, we’ve been reading stories in the newspapers.” Comitis is also optimistic about the completion of the PSL season. “We should try everything we can to finish the season,” Comitis said. “Even if it means we have to adapt the next season in some way, maybe play all cup games in midweek instead of weekends. “I know it’s not an ideal scenario for the sponsors. But we all have to toe the line and cramp fixtures. “If we get to restart in May and June or June, July, we can finish the season. Then we start straight away end of August, maybe two months behind and play catch up, meaning playing every Wednesday and Sunday, have no normal pre-season but a two-week break. “However, I think what’s important is to fight the virus in unison, then when we see a window of opportunity to resume, we can then put our best football forward.”
