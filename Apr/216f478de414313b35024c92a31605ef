THE Department of Social Development and Sassa have been working around the clock to come up with a credible system to enable the payment of unemployed people. In announcing his R500 billion stimulus package on Tuesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled a special grant of R350 per month for people who are jobless and not benefitting from UIF. Yesterday, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu could not say when the system would be ready, but was hopeful the department and grants payment company would come up with something concrete and reliable within a week or two. Zulu said the matter was receiving top priority and would be dealt with as soon as possible. However, speaking on SAFM, she pleaded with the country to be patient and warned against confusing messages circulating on social media. She said her department would release the details, which would include the criteria and how to apply, when it was ready. “We have to make sure how the money will be sent, whether it will be through eWallet, cash send or through vouchers,” said Zulu. She said the department was already engaging with private companies to roll out the system. Zulu said she hoped it wouldn’t take long. On how many people the department was looking at paying, Zulu said it would depend on what criteria will be used to identify the beneficiaries. However, she said between 10 and 14 million was the number they had in mind. She said she’d make this announcement today with more details when she responds to Ramaphosa’s latest regulations.
