NXIWENI residents need answers from the City of Ekurhuleni. They told Daily Sun they’d waited for title deeds for 11 years. Community leader Nomsa Baba (60) from Nxiweni, Tembisa said when RDP flats went up, everyone was happy but they never received title deeds. “I was told they were changing stand numbers but they never informed the community. No one knew the people whose names were on stand numbers.” Nomsa said she was told they were still processing the numbers. Sibongile Dlangamandla (60) said: “I’ve lost hope in our municipality.” Noluthando Malima (49) said she had gone to the municipality countless times to enquire, but was turned away every time. Ward committee member Woodwell Philiso (71) said: “We don’t want to die and leave our kids without homes.” Human settlements spokesman Tahir Sema said a community meeting was held in January over the issue. “Since 2014/15, the department has had a backlog of over 74 000 title deeds. At present, the backlog is at 50 000 and the department is planning to register 6 000 this year.” He said the problem was due to a backlog in the township formalisation process.
