ANOTHER Durban hospital has closed its doors following a patient testing positive for the corona virus. The admission at Kingsway Hospital situated in Amanzimtoti south of Durban have been temporarily closed. The KZN Department of Health has sent a team of senior Departmental officials to investigate what has transpired, as well as to establish how the hospital is managing the situation. In a statement released by the department today the KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane Zulu said these latest developments will also form part of the ongoing investigation involving St Augustine's Hospital, which is owned by the same hospital group. "The Department will continue to closely monitor the situation, and will expect consequence management if any negligence is found on the part of any individual," said MEC Simelane Zulu. Denosa's KZN provincial Secretary Mandla Shabangu told Daily Sun that they held  meeting with the hospital management earlier today. He said they told them that they closed admission on Tuesday afternoon and tested about 40 nurses. "They refused to tell us the  exact number of nurses that were tested and they also didn't give us the results. They refused to give us a lot of information regarding this matter," he said.
