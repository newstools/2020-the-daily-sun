Up- and-coming maskandi singer Idlozi Elikhulu claims celebrity inyanga Dr 3 Seconds owes him R5 000. Idlozi Elikhulu, whose real name is Bongani Xaba, said he performed at Dr 3 Seconds' (real name Thulani Nkwanyana) event, the Dr 3 Seconds International Music Festival in December and he wasn't paid the full amount. He told Daily Sun: "I performed and he didn't pay me all my money. I wanted R15 000 at first, but he convinced me to settle for R10 000 and I did. However, he only paid me half and hasn't paid me the other half." Idlozi Elikhulu said what annoyed him was he was trying to make something of himself but Dr 3 Seconds was messing that up. "People on social media think he is a good person and this just shows that he is not. I am trying to make something out of myself and my career and he is disturbing that. In fact I was called by two more artists and they said that they also weren't paid but they are scared of speaking up." Read: ACTOR SIPHO NGEMA PASSED AWAY! The singer said when he asked for his money, Dr 3 Seconds changed the conversation. "Whenever I ask about my money, he starts another topic. Sometimes, he doesn't answer his phone. I want my money from him," he said. Dr 3 Seconds said R5 000 is a small amount for him, so he wouldn’t owe anyone a small amount of money. “First things first. I did not hire him, my people did. I wouldn’t owe anyone R5 000. I have money, that amount is small. Also, I had nothing to do with the payments. However, I asked his people to come through to see me, so we can discuss everything.” said Dr Seconds
