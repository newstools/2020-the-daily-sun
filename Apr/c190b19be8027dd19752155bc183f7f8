A medic determined to enforce coronavirus social-distancing rules while out for her weekly shop has devised a cunning new plan to work out if people are too close. Mindy Vincent, a social worker and therapist from New York City, has launched a clever initiative called #ProjectPenisMask to remind strangers to politely “back the f**k up” in public spaces. In a Twitter post, Mindy posted an image of herself wearing her brand new coronavirus-fighting masks which are covered in 4-5s. From a distance, the masks look as though they have a cute floral pattern on them. But on closer inspection, it appears the masks have different shaped 4-5s on them. In the post, which has now gone viral, Mindy explains her cunning planning. She said she intends to "kindly" tell people to back up if they get close enough to tell her the masks have penises on them. Mindy Vincent said: "Behold! My masks have arrived! "I wore this to Walmart and PETCO today.  "When someone tells me my mask has penises on it, I will kindly let them know this is how I determine they are too close, kindly back the f***k up." Following up in a video posted on Friday, Mindy told Daily Star  that she had originally purchased the masks for herself and her colleagues at the Utah Harm Reduction Coalition. She said she wanted to ensure a safe way for her staff to continue to serve vulnerable people without putting others at risk. Mindy has since decided to make and sell the phallic face coverings for $20 and will put all proceeds towards the non-profit.
