THUGS have been taking advantage of the lockdown to rob schools! Now parents are appealing to President Cyril Ramaphosa to place the defence force members at every school to protect them. Thugs even left notes, like: “We took everything with a smiling face”, which recently went viral on social media, angering Mzansi.  Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has called on people to provide police with information to help catch the culprits. Daily Sun spoke to residents of the Vaal, who said thugs were showing no fear. They said unless soldiers or cops guarded schools, the crimes would continue. Nomthandazo Ngobeni (42) from Evaton didn’t hear anything when a school near her house was broken into, only learning what happened the next day. “My neighbours and I were talking about how the robberies would increase. There are no police or soldiers guarding schools, and thugs will have a feast.” Gabriel Tsatsi (33) from Evaton, who lives near Mofolo Primary School, said there were no soldiers or cops in the area. “People do as they please. I see an increase in criminal activities.” Brian Khumalo (47) from Evaton said he saw young men passing near Beverly High School as if they were assessing it. “There was no security and the next day, I heard the school had been robbed,” he said. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said Mofolo Primary, Tsokodibane Primary, Beverly High, Katleho Impumelo Primary and Dinokaneng Secondary School were burgled. “They stole valuable equipment and school groceries.”
