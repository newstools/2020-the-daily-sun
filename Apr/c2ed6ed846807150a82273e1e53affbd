People stood in shock as they watched the body of a beheaded woman lay lifelessly in an open space at Mndeni, Soweto. According to information received the body was discovered by passersby early in the morning. Residents expressed fear as they claimed this was the third act of brutality towards women in three weeks. A woman who refused to be named said she did not expect such cruelty to take place while their kasi was heavily guarded by the military. "I am very shocked it means killers are taking advantage of the quietness in the streets since the lockdown. I thought we would have peace of mind and a break from criminals during this time," she said. "This girl's head was cut off... there is a guy who is being questioned right now, he has blood all over his clothes, he tried to run. I am scared," wrote Gabisile Ndlovu on Mndeni Facebook page. The man, who was spotted acting strange at the crime scene, was taken in for questioning. This is a developing story.
