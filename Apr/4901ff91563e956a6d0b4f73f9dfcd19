ANXIOUS residents set dogs on health workers while others, accusing the workers of spreading the coronavirus, locked them out. When health workers went door to door to screen residents of New Payne in Mthatha, Eastern Cape on Saturday, they were chased away. A 79-year-old man died on Monday. The cause of death was confirmed on Friday by the Department of Health in the Eastern Cape.  The health MEC’s spokeswoman, Judy Ngoloyi, saidthe man’s status became known after he had died. “He was an outpatient at Nelson Mandela Academic. “He was attended to for urinary incontinence and went home on the same day, where he passed away. “His family have been tested and results came back negative.” Ngoloyi said health workers had worked tirelessly to tackle the spread of the virus since its outbreak in the OR Tambo region. Resident Thembelani Mdingi (54) told Daily Sun he spent more than three hours with the man on 30 March. But he didn’t have physical contact with him. Ward 30 councillor Bongani Bikani condemned residents who chased health workers with dogs. Bikani said workers would now work with ward committees to do screenings. He said many people were in contact with the dead man. The first Covid-19 cases in OR Tambo Municipality were reported in Majola Village in Port St Johns last week. Six people and another two later tested positive. Officials will be sent to Ndibela Village in Mthatha to test people who attended a funeral a few weeks ago.
