LESEDI Kapinga says he is not in a rush to make a decision on his future or where he will be playing next season. The 24-year-old Black Leopards midfielder, whose contract with the troubled Absa Premiership side is due to expire at the end of this season, has been linked with a move to defending Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates, SuperSport United, AmaZulu and Bidvest Wits. But Kapinga told SunSport yesterday he is using the PSL break, due to the coronavirus pandemic, to think carefully with his family about his next move. “I am at home relaxing and training alone as we have been given a programme to follow,” he said. “With regards to my future, I have had lot of stories linking me with many teams but to be honest, I have not spoken to any team or made decision about my future. All I know is that I am Black Leopards player and I have to be professional.” He added: “My focus is at Leopards. I want to make sure that Leopards move from the danger zone. I cannot start to think about going somewhere else when I am still contracted, and we are not in a good position.” Meanwhile, Leopards are in big trouble at the bottom on the log with 20 points from six matches remaining to end the season.
