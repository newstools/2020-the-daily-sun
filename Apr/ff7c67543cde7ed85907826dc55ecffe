THE family of a 14-year-old boy who was seriously injured on Saturday at a farm in Eshowe, northern KZN, wants justice. The teenager from Nyanini was allegedly hacked with a panga on his way to KwaHlokohloko sugarcane farm to fetch honey from a beehive. His older brother (35) told Daily Sun they learnt about the incident on the same day. “Some policemen came by and notified us that my brother was seriously injured and had been admitted to hospital. The police told us to go look for him in hospital, but not to open a case because they were caught in a sticky situation,” said the brother. He said after the teen was discharged on Sunday, they asked him what had really happened. “He told us they were caught by farm security guards while they were busy with honey in the beehive. He said the guards didn’t ask any questions but beat them. “He said the guards said they finally caught the thugs who stole their clothes on the farm,” he said. The brother said they suspected the boy and his friends were punished for something they knew nothing about. “The guards might have been victims of thugs who stole their clothes, and when they caught my brother and his friends they immediately thought it was them who had been stealing their clothes.” He said they wanted justice to prevail and that’s why they ignored the police’s instructions and opened a case. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of assault was being investigated by Eshowe cops. “On Saturday, a 14-year-old boy was allegedly assaulted while on a farm in Eshowe. He sustained head injuries and was rushed to hospital for medical attention,” said Gwala.
