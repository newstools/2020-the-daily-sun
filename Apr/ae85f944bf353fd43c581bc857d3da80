WITH many self-employed people at home, hunger has been knocking at the door. But the Mangaung Bangladesh Community in Heidedal, came to the rescue of over 600 families on Wednesday, thanking them for supporting their shops over the years. Habib Hasaan said they handed food parcels that included maize meal, cooking oil, potatoes, beans, tea bags and sugar. “The community has supported us at our shops for years. We can’t sit back and do nothing while they are in need,” he said. Councillor Ettie Terblance helped to compile a list of needy families. He told Daily Sun: “I am thankful for what the Bangladeshi community of Mangaung is doing. Most people are suffering because they can’t work.” Beneficiary Lawrence Jacobs (62) said he was very happy with the food parcel. “I hope the community will stop attacking their shops now. There is a saying that goes ‘don’t bite the hand that feeds you’. I hope residents don’t destroy those who help us,” he said. Chantel Tseletsele (18) said the food would make a huge difference.
