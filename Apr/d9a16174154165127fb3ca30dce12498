ELECTRICITY continues to be a problem for some Soweto residents. The situation has even forced some mums to sneak out and disobey lockdown regulations to get hot water to make baby food.

Residents of Braamfischerville told Daily Sun they had not had electricity for a month and when they made enquiries with Eskom, they were told it would be fixed. Nomthandazo Ngwenya (35) said she lived with two kids, one of whom was six months old. She said she had to sneak out to ask for boiled water as she had a Primus stove but couldn’t afford to buy paraffin. “I’m a domestic worker. Right now, I’m not working and there’s no salary coming in,” she said. Lihle Ngomane (41) said she didn’t understand why Eskom was taking so long to fix their electricity problem. She said she paid for her power. “I have a gas stove but it makes one of my kids feel sick and get a headache. I have no choice but to go and ask neighbours for help,” she said. Siboniso Mavundla (38) said life had been hard without electricity. He said he worked as a street vendor but was not making money since the lockdown. “I can’t afford to buy a Primus stove and certainly can’t afford paraffin. We really need electricity,” he said. Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said if people paid their electricity, the utility would intervene. “I’ll check what the problem is and we’ll get back to them,” he said.
