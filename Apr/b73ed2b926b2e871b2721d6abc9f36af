Laptops and food for feeding schemes stolen from Limpopo schools during Covid-19 lockdown . According to Limpopo Department of Education, in the past few days, it has recorded 30 incidents of school vandalism across six the province's education districts. The departmental spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene said in their statement that National School Nutrition Programme food supplies and laptops top the list of items that were stolen during the process. Other stolen items include a fridge, digital camera, television set and desktop computers. Chuene said two schools have also reported vandalism , and another had all copper water taps taken. The MEC for Education, Polly Boshielo said these occurrences add  the ballooning national figure of schools that have fallen victim to criminals since the beginning of a national lockdown to curb the spread on Covid-19. MEC Boshielo added that it is disturbing to note that Limpopo has not been spared the wrath of criminals who have taken advantage of the COVID-19 lockdown to pillage on our already limited school resources. "The sad reality is that our children who must contend with missing out on learning for more than a month, now also face another hardship of their food and learning tools stolen” he said Chuene explained that the affected Education Districts are Capricorn South, Mopani West, Sekhukhune South, Vhembe East, Vhembe West and Waterberg and all cases have been reported to the police.
