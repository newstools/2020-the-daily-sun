SOME women find themselves locked in their homes with their abusers during the lockdown. And they suffer all forms of abuse, including rape. Cops are now urging victims to speak up and not suffer in silence. This after two victims from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni opened rape cases. A 30-year-old man was then arrested for allegedly raping his own sister (24). Cops said their father was away when the incident occurred. Sergeant Media Khoza of Kwa-Thema Police Station said the suspect was alone with the victim when he allegedly overpowered and raped her. “She immediately reported the case at Tsakane Police Station. The suspect was traced and arrested on Friday. “The victim claimed she was repeatedly raped by the same suspect since 2017,” said Khoza. In another case, a 47-year-old man from Tsakane was arrested after he allegedly raped his 18-year-old daughter over the weekend. “As police, we condemn violent acts against women and children and strongly warn those who continue to abuse women and children when they suppose to protect them,” said Khoza. She said the suspects will appear before the Tsakane Magistrates Court soon. “Community members are encouraged to break the silence and report the abuse of women and children at the nearest police station or contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” she said. Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said gender-based violence command centres were opened to help victims of domestic violence through Skype via “HELPMEGBV”, the toll-free line 0800 428 428 and by dialling *120*7867#
