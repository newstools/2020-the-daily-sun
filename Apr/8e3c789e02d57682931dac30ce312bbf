An Australian doctor has warned that the coronavirus could be spreading through farts. Andy Tagg pointed out that tests revealed the virus was present in the faeces of 55 percent of patients with Covid-19. Other medics have previously warned farts contain tiny poo particles that can spread bacteria. Dr Tagg wrote: “Well, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faeces and has been detected in an asymptomatic individual up to 17 days post-exposure.” Dr. Norman Swan also made a cautionary suggestion when it comes to particles of faeces set adrift within a fart and the spread of COVID-19 on his podcast last Friday saying that we shouldn't fart close to other people, and that we shouldn't fart with our bottom bare. A recent study also suggested that a post-flush toilet plume could be the cause for concern when it comes to spreading the coronavirus via “aerosolised faeces". “Studies have clearly shown that a significant percentage of Covid-19 patients do have GI [gastrointestinal] symptoms (alone, or in combination with respiratory or other general symptoms) at the time of illness presentation,” Glatt told The Post. For now there is not great deal of research to prove this point about transmitting Covid-19 but it is better to be safe than sorry.
