NORMALLY, boozers gather at pubs, but with the lockdown they can’t buy alcohol. A group of businessmen has used this opportunity to start a Facebook challenge encouraging people to donate money they’d usually spend on booze to those in need. Yesterday, five young men from the Vaal donated R20 000 collected from the challenge to feed 100 families in the Boiketlong and Bophelong squatter camps. They donated food parcels including maize meal, oil, tins of fish, baked beans and sugar. Andre Lekota told Daily Sun how the project started.  With the help of Lawrence Khekhe, who runs an NGO, poor families were identified. “We were helped by councillors and Lawrence, who’s involved in initiatives to give back to the kasi. This will continue. We have other Good Samaritans who wish to donate more money to help families that are not well off,” said Andre. Teboho Mosito (22) said: “I applied for government food relief but didn’t get it. Now that I have received food parcels, I’m happy.”
