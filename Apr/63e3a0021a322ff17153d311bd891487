The Mamelodi Sundowns' first team held a video meeting to maintain dressing-room spirit last week with the players and the coaching staff calling in from their respective houses. Following the informal meeting of some 20 minutes in which they were able to catch up the team proceeded to their daily fitness session. Furthermore, Doctors Carl and Paul continue to carry out individual meeting with each of the injured players in the squad who at the same time are in permanent contact with the teamâ€™s fitness coaches. "Training at home can be tricky but we are doing our best to keep the boys sharp and focused. When the league resumes we will be as ready as we can be," said Mosimane. www.sundownsfc.co.za
