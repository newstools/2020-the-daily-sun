ACTRESS Nombulelo Mhlongo is writing a play about Covid-19. The young playwright, who acts on Uzalo, said her play was about the plight of poor people during the lockdown. “As a writer, I’ve observed most people in the townships and also in the rural areas are not necessarily scared of the coronavirus, but are scared of the police and defence force,” said Nombulelo. According to the actress, the lockdown period has also exposed social inequalities in the country. “I decided to write this play so I could capture our history. I want to show the impact of lockdown in the poorest areas of South Africa. I know that, one way or another, we are all affected or by the lockdown but the effects will not be the same. My duty is to capture these moments so we can tell the next generations,” she told Daily Sun. “I feel it is rather too soon to decide on the title of the play.” Nombulelo said the play will be ready for showcasing after the lockdown.This will not be her first stage play. She has written a number of plays already, including Ukukhanya Kwam. “It is an educational children’s play. I wrote it before I joined Uzalo. “I love writing children’s plays, because kids have many ideas,” she said. Nombulelo also writes plays with health-related themes.
