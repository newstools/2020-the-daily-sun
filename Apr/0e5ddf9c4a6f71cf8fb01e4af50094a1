RAMPANT theft at schools during the lockdown is a cause for concern for Gauteng Education MEC Panyazi Lesufi. The latest break-ins were at Harmony Primary School in Lenasia, Eersterust Secondary School in Eersterust and Matseke Primary School in Atteridgeville, between 9 and 11 April.

Panyaza told Daily Sun: “It seems these criminals are not bothered and they don’t have a sense of the damage they are causing to the future of our children and our country. Because without education, we are doomed. “The future is bleak. Indeed the coarse behaviour of these criminals is annoying. They must be apprehended and face the law.” Gauteng cops have already arrested 41 suspects for cases relating to burglary and burning of schools. Seventeen suspects were arrested in Joburg, nine in Tshwane, seven in Sedibeng, four in Ekurhuleni and another four in the West Rand. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela has appointed a team of experienced senior cops to investigate and identify the culprits. “The team has been working tirelessly to apprehend the suspects. Thus far, 41 suspects have been arrested and more arrests are imminent as the search and investigation continue,” said Masondo.
