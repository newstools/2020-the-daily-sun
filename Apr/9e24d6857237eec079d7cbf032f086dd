GOSPEL singer Dr Tumi swapped the mic for his scrubs when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the 21-day lockdown. The multi-award winning gospel star and medical doctor has volunteered at a government hospital. Speaking to Daily Sun about his experience at Tembisa Hospital in Ekurhuleni, he said: “I started working the day after the lockdown was implemented. I do a couple of hours on certain days. It has been an experience in its own way as I have not been in a hospital for many years. I would not call it an adrenalin rush, but I’d say it feels like a place I know I have not been to in a long time. I’ve missed working around a lot of people because in private practice, it’s just you and your patient.” COULD MZANSI'S LOCKDOWN END IN JUNE! The Wafika hitmaker found it heart-warming that people who work in the public healthcare system were more driven than those in the private sector. “I haven’t come across a patient who has tested positive for the virus. There haven’t been reported cases in the area I am in. I have come across people who were screened, but did not test positive.” Dr Tumi told the People’s Paper it was important to have the right protective gear anytime health workers come into contact with infectious diseases. “Patients should not be mixed. It’s important to separate people.” Asked if he thought the lockdown helped stop the spread of the virus at the moment, he said: “Time will tell if the lockdown is effective as it also depends on factors, including if people comply and if they’re getting the help they need when they feel they have been exposed to the virus. It’s important to comply.” He also said he hosts daily lockdown worship shows at 8am, which draw thousands of people.
