A FIRE left 13 people with nothing but corrugated sheets on Friday morning. The blaze broke out in the early hours of the morning at Organic Market squatter camp in Alexandra, Joburg, destroying six shacks. A madala told Daily Sun the fire started in his shack. He said he had lived in the area for 20 years. “I’m not sure what happened because it was already midnight when I woke up to a blaze in my shack. I started screaming for help only to realise the fire had already spread to other shacks,” he said. Nomusa Dlamini (30) told the SunTeam she was woken up by screams and realised her shack was burning. “I was sleeping with my husband and child when we heard people screaming. We quickly ran outside and tried to rescue whatever we could. In the three years I’ve lived here, this was the first shack fire I’ve witnessed,” she said. Nomusa said she was grateful to her neighbours for helping. “If it wasn’t for the neighbours, I don’t know what would have happened. We are also grateful to people who brought us food parcels and blankets,” she said. City of Joburg Housing MMC Mlungisi Mabaso visited the area on Saturday. He said: “We don’t want people moving around a lot because it’s a lockdown. We will make sure we clear the burnt area and provide those affected with materials to rebuild their shacks,” he said.
