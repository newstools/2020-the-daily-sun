IT SEEMS some residents were not saddened by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to extend the lockdown. This is because they don’t feel they are in lockdown! READ: TWEEPS PAY TRIBUTE TO BENNI MCCARTHY! Easter weekend was a normal one for villagers of Ga-Sekgopo outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo. Taverns and churches remained closed, but villagers filled the streets as usual. The SunTeam walked around some of the streets and villagers could be seen wandering around. Some could be seen playing football, while others walked around holding hands. When approached, they told the SunTeam they did not feel threatened as the Greater Letaba Municipality had not yet recorded any cases. “Staying home is very difficult and unbearable. We don’t have things to do to push time in our homes, so we end up going to the streets,” said a 27-year-old villager. When asked if they had knowledge about Covid-19, a 19-year-old villager said: “We watch TV, so yes we know. “But it’s a bit difficult to follow some of the precautionary measures to curb the spread of the virus. This is because we don’t have running water and no sanitisers and masks. It’s also difficult to adhere to social distancing because other families have more than 10 members who share an RDP house. We pray the virus does not come to our village or else it’s going to be a disaster.” There were also no police or army visibility to enforce lockdown regulations.
