But I will have to compromise it and cover my body at the party. I understand that families are spending time together during this time and most of them watch the entertainment together. "This party that I am going to be part of, will start at 5pm and kids are still not in bed at that time. So I must make sure that I look dignified and at the same time make sure that I do not compromise my brand completely. I am still going to wear a G-string and a bra, that is not a problem and I am still deciding on the second outfit which will be more dignified,” said Zodwa, whose real name is Zodwa Libram. She revealed that she has a work permit that she maintained through her company called Zodwa Wabantu Investment Holdings. ALSO READ:PREGNANT HIJACK HORROR! "I am an artist and I must make money.
