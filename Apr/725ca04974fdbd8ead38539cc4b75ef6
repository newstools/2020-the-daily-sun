SINGER Simphiwe Dana has angered men across the country. The Usikhonzile singer instantly created controversy after she took to Twitter on Sunday and said South African men are gold diggers. “Truth is that South African men are the biggest gold diggers. They even dig the maintenance money,” Simphiwe wrote. ALSO READ:TINA CONNED OUT CASH She continued: “Bacele iUber. Ubathengele iairtime. Ubabhatalele irent. “They’re driving your car. Using your bank card. And you’re paying all the bills. “Shameless. Still have the audacity to go out there and say they’re taking care of you. That you’re a gold digger. They’re not paying maintenance.” This triggered a #SimphiweDanaMustFall, which trended on Sunday and continued to grow yesterday. Samuel Jr tweeted: “To the guy who chowed Simphiwe Dana’s money, go back and finish her so she can call us gold mines.” Lerato Pillay said: “We have not forgotten in 2012 Simphiwe Dana slept with her friend’s husband and destroyed the marriage.” @SneKhumaloSA tweeted: “I don’t know about SA men being gold diggers. “I’ve only dated SA men and they’ve always spoilt me rotten. “Largely, the SA men I know have this manly pride thing about providing, especially Nguni guys. “Lastly, sisi. You don’t have clean hands. Yeka amadoda abantu.” Simphiwe’s publicist Boniswa Meslane said Simphiwe didn’t have anything to say.
