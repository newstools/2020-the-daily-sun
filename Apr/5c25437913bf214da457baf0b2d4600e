A car driver was stopped on the N11 Road in Ingogo in KwaZulu-Natal. This after cops received intel about a suspect that was transporting drugs from Gauteng to Newcastle. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police officers were then placed on strategic points and the car was spotted travelling on a gravel road just outside Newcastle. “A search was conducted, and a loose compartment was found in the vehicle,” Mbele said. It was then opened and Mandrax tablets were found hidden inside. A total of 3 372 Mandrax tablets to the total value of R200 000 was recovered.  “An amount of R1 000 was also confiscated from the suspect, a 32-year-old suspect was placed under arrest for possession of drugs,” said Mbele. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula said the results shown by the integrated approach is much-admired.
