  FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns player, Esrom Nyandoro is doing the most in the
fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. He has selected his best football jerseys to auction them to raise money
to buy one million sanitizers and one million masks in a campaign to help the
vulnerable communities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. According to the former football star he will have to part way with his
favourite t-shirts and boots during the auction. Nyandoro said he will auction one Sundowns, two Warriors t-shirts and
one pair of boots which he used during his playing career. The former Zimbabwe national team player said he will donate to his home
country and South Africa where he spent most of his playing career and retired
in the game. He said that he doesn't want to give money."I want to give back the
jersey because I feel it's more special to give a jersey for auction. "This is a sacrifice for me because a jersey is something worth
keeping for memories sake and children, but in this case, I feel it's best to
give back to the people who supported me,‚Äù he said He added that he has decided to auction his football jerseys to help in
the fight against the Corona pandemic. "I would have loved to keep the jerseys, but the sacrifice is worth
it," he said. Nyandoro said the one million sanitizers and one million mask campaign
is organised by Samantha Tshuma, Vimbai Musvaburi and Tapiwa Virima. The former player was part of Sundowns as a player for 11 years. Back in
his home country he played for Amazulu and he is currently a Sundowns football
scout. The auction will take place next week Monday on his Instagram page
@esromnyandoro at 8pm. Anyone interested in the auction can call Grace Ndlovu
