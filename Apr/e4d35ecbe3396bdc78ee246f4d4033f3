With the coronavirus pandemic spreading to all four corners of the earth, we are now required to take more and more precautions to keep ourselves and our families safe. “The world has been plunged into a crisis situation that we are not prepared for, and if we want to beat the novel coronavirus education needs to be at the forefront of any communication,” says Sarah Webb, brand manager for laundry brand, Personal Touch. “We all have questions about what we need to do in order to protect ourselves and prevent the virus from spreading. One such question is, can the virus or any other virus survive on surfaces such as our clothes? And the answer is an emphatic YES.” Viruses and germs can live on surfaces for extended periods of time and this includes clothing fibres.  Although, the lifespan of any virus on clothing, including the coronavirus, has not yet been determined, washing your clothes thoroughly is highly recommended. The action of washing your clothes combined with the active ingredients in the soap such as surfactants, help to remove the virus from the clothing fibres. “If you have come into contact with someone who may be infected, or if you have been in a position where the virus could have been transferred to your clothes, it is very important to make sure that your clothes are hygienically clean and virus-free in order to stop the spread,” says Webb. “When washing your clothes to make sure that they are virus free there are no new tricks and methods that need to be implemented, just a few, small changes to your current laundry regime,” says Webb.
