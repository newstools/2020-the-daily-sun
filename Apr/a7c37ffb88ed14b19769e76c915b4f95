Drummer and vocalist Gregory "Keke" Mabusela has gone solo. The artist, who made a name for himself as a member of the award-winning band The Muffinz, now goes by the name of Kekelingo. He explained that his new name was inspired by a language he created himself. His new song Khonza featuring Ami Faku released under a VTH Season is also sung in that language.  "Kekelingo’s my own spiritual language expressed and sung through chant, with no meaning but translates through the emotion of feeling. It is inspired by the day Kekelingo was born and his reason and purpose for being on earth.

He said he was thinking about his amazing mother who gave birth to him by herself at home in a four-roomed house in Soweto. “I wrote Khonza as a thank you to my late mother, grandmother and my sister. Powerful and strong African Queens that raised and shaped the man that I am today. I featured songstress Ami Faku because I knew her voice will represent the gentleness and loving nature of these incredible Queens that I hold dearly in my heart and spirit being,” said Kekelingo.
