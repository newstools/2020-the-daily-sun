TAXI operators in Tshwane feel targeted during the lockdown. This comes after sixteen taxis were impounded on Saturday in Pretoria CBD for not following the lockdown rules. Tshwane Metro Police spokesman, Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, told Daily Sun that the taxis were impounded after drivers failed to follow the rules. “The drivers were operating outside the regulations of lockdown and this was outside the law that had been put in place by the transport ministry,” he said. On Friday, the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula said they only allowed taxis to operate long hours to accommodate social grant beneficiaries. “We updated our directives to accommodate essential service works, pensioners for social grants and people in rural areas who need to access far areas for essential services,” he said in a statement. Mbalula said public transport will only be allowed to operate between 05h00 and 10h00 in the morning and 16h00 and 20h00 at night. However, the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) said it felt those taxi owners were targeted by the cops.

Molelekwa said they were beginning to think that the cops were targeting the taxi industry to demonstrate that they are working. “Our appeal to law enforcement agencies is that they must not see lockdown as an opportunity to intensify their target on the taxi industry but they must see the shutdown as an effort to fight the disease,” he added.
