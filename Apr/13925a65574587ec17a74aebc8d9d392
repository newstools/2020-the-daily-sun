Two Mpumalanga cops are expected to appear at Kabokweni Magistrates Court on Tuesday (14 April) after they were arrested for escorting three bakkies loaded with alcohol. The two cops stationed at the Pienaar Cop Shop were arrested on Friday (10 April) after they were stopped by members of the SANDF during a stop and search roadblock on the airport road. According to national police spokesman, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, the members were driving a marked police vehicle when they were stopped. "It was discovered that the two members were escorting three bakkies that were loaded with alcohol,” he said.He said the alcohol was allegedly transported for an owner of a tavern at Pienaar. “The tavern owner was arrested together with the other two drivers as they are not allowed to be transporting alcohol during this period of the lockdown," said Naidoo. The two police officers were arrested for defeating the ends of justice and using motor vehicle without the owner's consent. Naidoo said both members are detained in police custody until their appearance in court on Tuesday. Meanwhile investigation is continuing.
