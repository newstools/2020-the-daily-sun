Former Bafana Bafana head coach Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba believes former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates striker Bongani Ndulula was mismanaged. Ndulula has struggled to kick his career into high gear, after showing great promise early-on which even earned him a call-up to the national team during Mashaba's reign. After being released by Chippa United in 2017, Ndulula flattered to deceive at Bloemfontein Celtic, Pirates, AmaZulu, and Chiefs. Mashaba is convinced the young man needed more guidance off the pitch to help him stay focused and professional as he developed his game. "Let's talk about the question of the money players are getting," Mashaba told Marawa Sports Worldwide on Metro FM. "Somewhere along the line somebody said that our PSL need to take these players to schools where they will be taught about money, but somebody said 'it's not our money, we have paid the player and we are out of it.' "Can you imagine such kind of a comment? "He might have been a good player here and there but people didn't give themselves time to look at him away from football. "What kind of player is he, what kind of life does he live? "Sometimes in life some things get into your head and you forget who you are or you don't listen to people. "What I would say to about Ndulula is that the problem was just lack of discipline and professionalism. "You would talk to him and he would talk to you, then you would say 'yes this boy is good, he is disciplined' but he needed more than that. What a player, what a striker. "I know what kind of a player he is as long as he is in the right hands. That is what is killing most of our players, they are not taken care of the way they are supposed to."
