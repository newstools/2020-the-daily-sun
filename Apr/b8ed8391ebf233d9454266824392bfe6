MOST footballers come a long way before they crack it big time in the PSL, and later Bafana Bafana. Siphiwe Tshabalala, affectionately known as “Shabba”, is no exception – and little did he know when he was posing for this picture at Kgotso Grounds in Phiri, Soweto that he would one day score Bafana Bafana’s opening goal at a Fifa World Cup. The 35-year-old Tshabalala was born in Soweto and played for local clubs such as Phiri Arsenal and Phiri Movers before Kaizer Chiefs noticed him. It was not a great start at Amakhosi and he crossed the floor to Moroka Swallows - he also had stints at Alexandra United and then Free State Stars. Chiefs were forced to buy him back from Stars and the rest, as they say, is history... Shabba went on and established himself as star and played more than 200 matches for Amakhosi and also gained 90 caps for Bafana.His last club BB Erzurumspor in Turkey.
