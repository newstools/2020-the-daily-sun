HALF a loaf is better than nothing. This is what people told Daily Sun about the child grant increase and R350 social grant that will be paid to the unemployed for six months.   President Cyril Ramaphosa made the announcement on Tuesday. They said it wasn’t a lot but they were grateful because it would make a difference to those who had no income at all. According to StatsSA, the number of unemployed people in quarter four of 2019 stood at 6,7 million. This means the government will spend about R2,3 billion a month on unemployed people. Bonani Mongwe from Diepkloof, Soweto, said: “Although it’s little, this shows the president is doing something for us. We’ll accept it. Beggars can’t be choosers.” Edwin Matela from Orlando West said: “It will offer some relief and stop people from doing crime.” He said the cash will cover only mealie meal, sugar, tea bags, milk and washing powder. “But half a loaf of bread is better than nothing. We must be grateful for what we’re given.” Palesa Moloto from Diepkloof said the money won’t sustain a family. “If I had R350 I’d buy cosmetics,” she said. Ziphozonke Mchunu from Denver said: “We’re supposed to stay at home. We don’t know what we’re going to eat. The government came through for us.” He said he’ll spend it on veggies, canned food and mealie meal. Sam Mwelase from Denver said: “It would be better if the beneficiaries are paid all at once instead of monthly.”
