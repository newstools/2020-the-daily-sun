Dear MizzB I AM dating a man who’s 18 years older than I am. He treats me well and loves me. But when I try to express my feelings, he dismisses me and treats me like a child. I just want to be treated with respect. How can I make him understand this? Please help. - Worried Dear Worried It’s not every day that one finds a partner one can relate to and connect with. Age doesn’t decide the success or failure of a relationship, but it’s how the people involved treat each other that matters. Dating someone who’s older doesn’t mean allowing him to take advantage and hurting your feelings. A partnership is a joint effort and you both need to play your part in making it work. Regardless of the age difference, a younger partner must to be given a chance to have their say and to express how they feel. Communication is key in every union. Be honest about how you feel. That response should give you an idea whether the relationship is healthy or not.
