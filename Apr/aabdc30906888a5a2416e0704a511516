IT is fast becoming a reality that suspended AmaZulu coach Jozef Vukusic’s days at the club could soon be over. Usuthu have started an investigation to find reasons as to what led to a dressing room revolt at half-time during their game against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on 29 February. SunSport previously revealed that players had questioned Vukusic’s approach on the day, and had reported him to management. A few days later, Usuthu released a statement, saying the coach was suspended. “Our chairman (Dr Patrick Sokhela) is conducting an investigation,” said club general manager, Lunga Sokhela. “Once he has done that, we’ll take it from there. I don’t want to pre-empt the outcome. But there’re a couple of concerns that have been brought to the club’s attention. “I’ve laid them on the chairman’s table to investigate and come up with direction. He needs to do the right thing in terms of the process that’ll be fair for the coach and come up with a conclusion.” Vukusic, who helped Polokwane City qualify for the Top 8 last season, was appointed by Usuthu in September last year on a three-year deal. He was in charge of 20 games in all competitions, winning only five. The club have since appointed Ayanda Dlamini on an interim basis, assisted by reserve team coach and veteran goalkeeper, Moeneeb Josephs. The duo’s first game was the biggest in their lives – when they stunned log leaders Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 at the FNB Stadium on 7 March. It was the team’s second victory of the year and it slightly eased their woes, moving from 16th to 15th on the table before local football was called off last month, due to COVID-19 crisis. When asked if Vukusic still had a future with the club, Sokhela said they would be guided by the chairman’s findings. “I don’t know because I’m not the one conducting this investigation,” he said.
