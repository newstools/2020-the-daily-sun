ZIMASA Lukwe is feeling the pinch of the lockdown regulations. She runs Zim Trading in Walmer kasi in Port Elizabeth. She supplies decor at weddings, birthday parties and funerals. She also provides cutlery, linen, tables and chairs. But following the lockdown she’s lost income. Zimasa told Daily Sun: “This lockdown has hit me badly. I’m battling to feed my family of 10. Everyone is at home and groceries are running out quickly. “Kids are bored by staying in one place. I have to try and entertain them by buying them snacks.” Zimasa has been running her business since 2000 and has four workers. “I will never forget this year because I never expected to suffer like this. What hurts me more is that I had to refund two of my clients who had booked me for weddings,” she said. “On 6 April I was booked for a R35 000 wedding in Port Elizabeth. On 1 and 2 May, I was booked for another R25 000 wedding in Jeffreys Bay. “I have four people who help me when I have bookings. But they’re also suffering because there’s no business. But there is nothing we can do. We have to obey the rules and stay home.”
