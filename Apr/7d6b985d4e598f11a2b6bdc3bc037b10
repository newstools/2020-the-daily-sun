COMMUNITIES have been complaining about the rubbish that’s piling up but the City of Cape Town said they’re doing the best they can. Water and waste MMC Xanthea Limberg, said every effort was being made to maintain delivery of basic services despite the threat posed by the coronavirus. “We have taken every legal step to address the backlog and have employed two private contractors to assist with collections,” said Limberg. “Our external service providers have also committed to working extended hours to work on major repairs so that more trucks can be released as quickly as possible.” Pheliswa Nokwanda (35), who lives along Link road in Philippi, said rubbish has been piling up in their area because cleaners were not cleaning as often as they used to. “Rubbish piled up last week and it was smelling badly by the time they removed it. We are glad that the cleaners will be busy at work during the lockdown because it was going to be a disaster with rotting rubbish on our doorsteps,” she said. Limberg said they were working on ensuring that cleaners and refuse collection staff had proper protective clothing. “This includes gloves and masks, to ensure that they are properly protected while performing their duties,” she said. Limberg said workers were expected to practise social distancing and hygienic practices as they work. Residents were also expected to keep a distance between themselves and refuse collectors when they are conducting their work.
