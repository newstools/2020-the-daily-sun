 THE nurse went to a church gathering – and now the clinic where she works has been shut down! Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza cop shop in Ekurhuleni said the nurse was one of the people who went to a church gathering at Divine Restoration Ministries in Ribblesdale in Bloemfontein, Free State, on 10 and 11 March. It’s the same gathering attended by ACDP leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe and the party’s chief whip, MP Steve Swart. The municipality confirmed they closed down the Duduza Clinic and the facility will be sanitised. Mayoral spokeswoman Phakamile Mbengashe said the nurse underwent tests on Monday, and the clinic staff who may have come into contact with her have been placed in isolation. Those showing symptoms were tested and are waiting for results. She said two mobile clinics will be brought to the area. Resident Johannes Tema (46), who went to the clinic with his brother, fears he might have the virus. According to the workers, earlier this week their colleague was handed a package labelled Covid-19. One of the workers told Daily Sun the woman was never isolated. “She was here with us,” she said. “This place is going to close down and we are going to die.” She said when they asked about being tested and self-isolation, they were told they didn’t have leave days. Another worker said they were traumatised as they were promised they wouldn’t be handling linen that may be contaminated. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said they were still establishing the facts around the query sent by Daily Sun and would investigate the matter.
