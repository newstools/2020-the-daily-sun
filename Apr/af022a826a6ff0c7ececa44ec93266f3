LIKE most people, prisoners fear getting infected with the coronavirus and are demanding to be released! Jailbirds at Baviaanspoort Prison in Tshwane threw out shoes, plastic bottles and other items, demanding warders open prison gates. The incident was captured on video, and inmates could be heard shouting: “We’re opening this prison today. Let us out! Open this prison. We want to go out.” They threatened to go on a hunger strike if the department didn’t heed their call. The department announced last week that 38 inmates and 56 warders, most of them from the Eastern Cape, tested positive. A prisoner said they’d leave overcrowded jails in body bags as there were no measures to protect them. South African Prisoners Organisation for Human Rights CEO, prison rights activist Golden Miles Bhudu, wanted answers by yesterday, failing which members, supporters and sympathisers would refuse to eat, be disobedient and take off their clothes! Correctional services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said: “This is totally irresponsible and reckless and there’s no need for such. We have detailed our plans on how we’re dealing with Covid-19. “Hence it’s not a secret that today, out of 243 centres, there’s only one centre where inmates contracted the virus. “We quickly acted by activating containment and treatment measures, whereas all other centres are enforcing prevention measures.” The state would not simply open the gates for inmates to walk out. “Offenders have been removed from society for a reason. Releasing them back into society has to be done properly, having been convinced they’re ready to reintegrate.”
