POLICE have been left egg-faced after they were forced to arrest two of their own for buying liquor worth R4000 in Strand in Cape Town. This as the country is currently under Lockdown and the sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. According to national police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, the two warrant officers, aged 45 and 50, were nabbed after members of the public alerted the cops while the transaction was taking place. "Both officers were arrested on the spot and taken to Strand Magistrates Court together with the liquor store manager and teller. The two officers were released on R1000 bail while the manager and teller were released on warning to appear in court again on April 17," said Naidoo. The warrant officers are from the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. Brigadier Naidoo said they face charges under Regulations of the Disaster Management Act in obtaining liquor illegally.
