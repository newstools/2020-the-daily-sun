Bidvest Wits captain Thulani Hlatshwayo insists the reports linking him with a move to Orlando Pirates are all simply unfounded rumour. The Clever Boys defender appeared to be keen on a move at the start of the season, and was consequently tipped to be on his way to the Buccaneers. However, he opted to stay with Wits and has now explained that he is happy at the club and unlikely to head for the exit any time soon - especially after penning a new deal last August. "My answer would be for me as a player I am happy at Wits," Hlatshwayo said on SAFM. "Yes, I could see Pirates supporters talking about me and social media posting me wearing a Pirates jersey. "To put the record straight, nothing official came from Pirates so everything that has been said has been hearsay." He added: "Nothing could stop me from extending the stay at Wits because I have had a good stay here."
