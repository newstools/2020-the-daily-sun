MPUMALANGA Agriculture MEC, Vusi Shongwe has urged small and commercial farmers to make sure their workers are supplied with safety material. Shongwe was visiting Athole farm on Wednesday to inspect and ensure that farmworkers were adhering to Covid-19 safety requirements. He said farms were classified as an essential service because food production could not be stopped. “It’s our duty to produce and feed the nation. “Production on farms cannot stop, but we must be safe as we produce food for communities. “We shouldn’t underestimate the dangers posed by this virus. “Should workers get infected, it could also affect the same products they’re working on. “The safety of workers on farms should be a priority.” Shongwe brought gloves, masks and sanitisers to last workers until the end of the lockdown period. “You must wear gloves, cover your mouths with these masks, and wash your hands regularly for at least 20 seconds,” he said. “When you’re working with each other, always keep at least a metre away from each other.” He said the department would continue to make unannounced visits to farms for inspection. Farmworker Johannes Ngwenya (43) told Daily Sun he was happy with the information received and for the protective gear.
