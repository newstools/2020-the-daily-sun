FORMER Safa vice-president Mwelo Nonkonyana has been placed on precautionary suspension for allegedly violating the Covid-19 lockdown regulations. Nonkonyana, who is also chairman of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, has been vocal about the strict regulations imposed by government to curb the coronavirus pandemic. The decision was taken by provincial cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha after Nonkonyana attended the funeral of a relative that exceeded the limit of 50 people. Nonkonyana was dismissed as the Safa deputy president for violating the associationâ€™s one-voice policy back in 2014.
