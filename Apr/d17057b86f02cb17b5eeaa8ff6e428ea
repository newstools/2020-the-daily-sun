THE sports ministry has put aside R150 million to help athletes and artists who could not earn an income because of this pandemic that has put everything on hold. Athletes and artists have been hit hard by the coronavirus, and most of them depend on their line of work to earn a living. But some have been unable to work because their events have been either postponed or cancelled. Artists, athletes and sports federations were invited to submit financial claims to the sports department. The deadline for submitting requests was last week. Minister of Arts, Culture and Sports Nathi Mthethwa appointed a team that will handle all applications and queries. Keitumetse Lebaka has been appointed as the chairperson for the Adjudication Committee, while Michelle Constant is the chairperson for Arts and Culture. Mthethwa said the vastly experienced panel can now get the ball rolling and start working on the fund destribution. Mthethwa said: “The department is fortunate to have such iconic performers and highly experienced industry experts on both adjudication panels. We would like to thank each one of them for having accepted our invitation to serve on the Adjudication Committees and look forward to receiving their recommendations.” The panels have been tasked with the job of looking into various applications to probe if the parties that have submitted applications indeed qualify to receive the relief funding or not, and if so why. After their findings, they will then send recommendations to the minister and his office for consideration. It is then that the Mthethwa and his team will consider the matter for implementation.
