THE cops went on raids in the capital city over the weekend. On Saturday night, Police Minister Bheki Cele led an operation in Mamelodi, Tshwane. The minister said 97 people were arrested for not following lockdown regulations. An illegal firearm was also recovered at one of the road blocks. Cele said: “The contraventions included possession of an illegal firearm, exceeding the permitted loading capacity as one taxi had 22 passengers, transporting passengers with no valid permits, selling of liquor, failure to confine to place of residence and possession of drugs.” Cele said a taxi was stopped at a roadblock with no passengers. “Police conducted a thorough search of the vehicle and found a number of bags which the driver claimed were his. On searching the luggage, police recovered an illegal firearm in one of the bags. “The driver confirmed to the police that the luggage belonged to a number of unknown passengers who he had dropped off as he approached the roadblock in an attempt to avoid trouble with the law.” Cele said the driver told police the passengers had no permits for their movement. “The man was arrested for possession of the illegal firearm and further investigations will be undertaken to establish whether the firearm could be linked to any previous violent crimes,” he said. Police also pounced on a tavern which had been raided after a tip-off earlier last week. Two men were arrested for illegally selling liquor. The operation included members of the SAPS and the SANDF as well as immigration officials from Home Affairs. The police had road blocks in Eesterust, Nellmapius, Mamelodi and Silverton. During the operation, Cele was joined by Gauteng community safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela and Tshwane Metro Police Chef Johanna Nkomo.
