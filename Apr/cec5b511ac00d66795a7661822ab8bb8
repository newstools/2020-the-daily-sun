Ntsiki Mazwai seriously needs help. This is one person who often finds fault in everyone else except herself. She seems to take out her failures on other people. We have an old adage in Pedi: young wood needs old wood to lean on for support. Now Ntsiki, the young wood that she is, has been denounced by old wood. Her own parents nogal. Ntsikiâ€™s behaviour and actions portray her as a bitter person who needs serious support.
