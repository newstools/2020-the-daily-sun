The Wimbledon tennis tournament, scheduled for June 29 to July 12, has been canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, organizers of the 3rd Grand Slam event announced on Wednesday. At the same time, ATP and WTA have announced that the men's and women's professional tennis circuits will remain suspended until July 13, the entire season of field tournaments. "It is with great regret that the All England Club Board of Directors and the (Tournament) Management Committee have decided that the 2020 edition will be canceled due to the public health risks associated with the coronavirus epidemic ", write the organizers of the oldest Grand Slam tournament. "The 134th edition of the tournament will take place from June 28 to July 11, 2021," they add. It is the first time since World War II that Wimbledon will not take place. This decision was widely expected, given the uncertainty regarding the date of the real resumption of the circuit, the difficulty of rescheduling all the events, but also the peculiarities of a field and outdoor tournament. The hypothesis of an in camera edition had always been categorically rejected by the authorities. In a tweet posted shortly after the announcement of Wimbledon, the organizers of the US Open, the usual last Grand Slam lift, said that they were still hoping, "for the moment", that the tournament would be held as scheduled from 24 August to September 13. Last month, Roland-Garros, the second Grand Slam event traditionally held in late May-early June, announced its postponement from September 20 to October 4 due to the pandemic.
