SHE calls her son’s cellphone every day, hoping he will answer and tell her he is coming home soon. But his phone is always off. This is because her son has gone missing. And Nokulunga Ntshumayo (45) from Tshelimnyama in Durban is looking for information on his whereabouts. She told Daily Sun Sicelo Hlatshwayo (27) left for work on 2 March but never returned. She said he worked at a bakery in Durban and would leave home very early and return in the afternoon. “When he didn’t return that day, I thought he’d come back the next morning. I thought he had a problem with transport as he used to complain about it.” Nokulunga said she called him very early in the morning, but his phone was off. “I asked if anyone in the area had seen him, but nobody had. Even his baby mama doesn’t know where he might be,” she said. She said Sicelo’s colleagues also came looking for him as he didn’t go to work. “I’m worried that something bad might have happened to him,” said Nokulunga. “My son is a responsible young man. He used to go to gym and spend most of his time with his friends. He would never just vanish without letting anyone know,” she said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said cops were looking for Sicelo and urged anyone with info on his whereabouts to contact Mariannhill cops.
