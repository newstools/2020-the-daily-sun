NORMALLY, this part of the city is buzzing with people going up and down, shopping for vegetables and fruit while on their way to catch taxis. But now, during the lockdown, Warwick Junction in Durban, KZN, is like a graveyard! On Tuesday, Daily Sun spoke to street vendors in the area. They said although they were happy to be allowed to sell again, they were not making money like before because people were locked up in their homes.  Zodwa Ntuli (45) from Dassenhoek, who sells amadumbe and sweet potatoes, said normally she goes home with about R500 or more a day but during this lockdown she makes R200. Street vendor Happiness Mkhize (50) from Bester said she came back on Monday because she supports her family. “But so far it’s been hard. There are very few people in town,” she said.  Happiness, who sells spinach, said she normally goes home with R300 a day but that amount has gone down to about R60. Musawenkosi Mthiyane (66) from Mzinyathi said he hoped the lockdown won’t be extended because he would suffer even more.  He said selling vegetables was the only way he has been able to support his family. “I’ve been selling vegetables for over 20 years and there has never been a lockdown. I hope it will never happen again,” he said. He said his earnings had dropped from R500 to R100.
