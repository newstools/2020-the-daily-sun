BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt is hoping that the Absa Premiership will go down to the wire… when the season resumes. And his Clever Boys are determined to play their part in making sure that there will be a tight finish. Hunt’s side will have a big say in who will win the title. Wits still have to play Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs twice and third placed Orlando Pirates. Hunt doesn’t like what he is seeing in the English Premier League (EPL) where one team has dominated from the start of the season. Liverpool, who have lost only one league match this season, had been running away with the EPL title before the coronavirus outbreak almost brought the entire sporting world to a grinding halt. Hunt wants to see the title race go down to the final day once the season resumes when the Covid-19 is contained. Pitso Mosimane, coach of defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns, is determined to take Chiefs all the way to the finish line. Chiefs lead the standings with 48 points from 22 games. They are being chased by Downs, who are four points behind with the Tshwane giants having a game in hand. Hunt reckons it will be a tight finish, saying: “The top teams still have to play each other. It’s going to be crazy.” Wits, who won the league title in the 2016-17 season, are sixth with 38 points from 21 games. Although the Clever Boys are out of the race, Hunt is looking for a strong finish from his Students. He added: “We won’t play Sundowns again. We’ll play Chiefs twice and Pirates. It’s very interesting.”
