She did more than I ever did,” he said. V-Mash, best known for hosting the 90s music show Jam Alley,was found dead in her house in Mamelodi, Tshwane, on Monday. Her brother Thabo told Daily Sun they had been trying to get hold of her since Sunday and when they went to check on her on Monday, they made the sad discovery. Collins said paramedics told them his daughter died of a heart failure. He said she died just as her career was picking up again. He said her death has badly affected his grandson, Oratile Mashego, who is Vinolia’s only child.  “It is difficult for him, but with our support he’ll be okay,” he said. He said he’s a pensioner and they needed funds to bury her. He said they’d appreciate any donations to help with the funeral preparations. Collins said it was a shame she won’t get the send off she deserved because of the lockdown. “Some of her friends in the entertainment industry said once everything has gone back to normal they will do a memorial service for her,” he said. Vinolia will be laid to rest in Mamelodi on Friday.
