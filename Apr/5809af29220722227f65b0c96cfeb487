MAMA Sally Mashego became worried when she noticed kids wandering around her area against lockdown regulations. She soon realised they were hungry and instead of doing nothing, she started a feeding scheme to give them two meals a day. ALSO READ:EFF WANTS DA'S BOOZE PROPOSAL SCRAPPED! The 45-year-old from Organic Market in Alexandra, east of Joburg, said: “I spoke to some of the kids and they told me they couldn’t sit still because they were hungry. “They said it’s better to play and ignore the hunger and not sit at home with frustrated parents. I’m currently feeding 300 kids and at times, we can’t help them all because there is not enough food.” She said it broke her heart to see them leaving without a meal because some of them didn’t have food at home. Sally said although she receives food parcels from Good Samaritans, they were not enough. “I give them breakfast and a heavy lunch of rice or pap so their parents just have to provide supper,” she said. When Alex-born actor and musician Israel Matseke-Zulu, also known as GP-MaOrange, heard about the recent fire in the area, he visited to hand over food parcels, masks and hand sanitisers. “As an ambassador of the South African Youth Movement, I felt there was no better time to help. They say charity starts at home.” Actor Presley Chweneyagae, who also handed over food parcels, said he’s worried as people didn’t know how serious the pandemic was. “We know it’s not only the responsibility of the government to educate people about it. “We have a platform, so why not use it wisely?” he asked.
