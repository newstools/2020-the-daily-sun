My man wanted a boy and I wanted a girl, so we were hoping for both sexes,” she said. Dezry said she woke up in the morning on 18 April with a terrible pain in her tummy. “My abdomen felt uncomfortable and my legs were stiff. My fiance took me to hospital and I was rushed straight into theatre,” she said. She said it felt as if she was going to die. “I was bleeding internally. I don’t know if I’d have survived if I hadn’t gone to hospital immediately.” She underwent surgery and lost the triplets. She was two months’ pregnant. She’s recovering well at her home. The fusion singer and rapper, whose real name is Desiree Kekana, said the doctor told her the miscarriage was caused by a heterotopic pregnancy. “Two foetuses were growing in the uterus tube and one was in the fallopian tube,” she said. “None of the babies could be saved due to the complications. “I’ve got stitches on my belly from the surgery.” Dezry’s fiance Shaun Reddy (36) said: “This experience has brought us closer together. We’re still hopeful that our wish to have children will come true.” Dezry, who released a single titled Mantra in February, said she wants to share her experience with other women.
