ON WEDNESDAY, mothers, kids and traders at the Lower Crossroads Clinic in Cape Town received face masks. They were donated by the Government Communications and Information System and the Mazwi Media Commission. Soyisile Magwayi, a senior environmental health practitioner, told Daily Sun they partnered with CGIS to also hand over soap and toilet paper. “We used the time to educate the mothers about the virus. “They don’t apply the social distancing rule at the clinic,” said Magwayi. He told the patients to apply the rules to stop the virus from spreading. The mothers were told if they don’t have sanitiser, they must wash their hands often. The kids were also given masks so they are also protected.  Pam Zokufa from Zokufa Media said they took the opportunity to tell people about Covid-19. “It is our way of giving back to our communities,” she said. Zokufa told Daily Sun the company Colourplus, which specialises in fabric printing, has produced more than 350 000 masks for community organisations throughout the Western Cape. “We are grateful for the good work they are doing,” said Zokufa. Resident Nolubabalo Sokaba (22) said they didn’t have money to buy masks. “We are grateful for the donations of masks for our babies and us,” she said. Eyethu Matiwane (24) said she didn’t know there were masks for babies. “We are pleased the masks are reusable. We are going to wash and use them again instead of buying new masks,” she said. Trader Thandeka Matose (45) said she was happy to receive a mask. “Mostly people visit us to remove our stock,” she said.
