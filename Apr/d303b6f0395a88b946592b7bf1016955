DJ Tira doesn't let those who accuse him without proof get away with it. The Afrotainment boss put his accuser in his place when @DJ_Tchzi accused him on Twitter of using a disconnected deck when he performed live on MTV Base. That DJ posted that only CDJs were connected to the mixer. He called on Tira to explain, saying, "We're not stupid. Mara we not stupid yaz (you know). The only thing connected here is the CDJs to the mixer. There are no sound cables taking out the sound from the mixer. @DjTira @MTV MBaseSouth #BasementBattle Please explain. Only a few see this. Mixtape vele 99," posted DJ_Tchzi. But Tira defended himself, telling this DJ to "tsek" and go to school. "In the words of Euphonik Nonkeeeeeee. The youngsters I'm sure you don't even know how to connect this mixer now you making jufgrmrnts from what you see. Tsek!!! You need to go to school and stop thinking deejaying is an easy option to make a living." But Tira later posted an apology apparently from the accused. ItÂ  seems the DJ apologised on WhatsApp after Tira threatened to sue him.
