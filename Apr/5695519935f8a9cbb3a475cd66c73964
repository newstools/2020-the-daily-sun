COULD former Orlando Pirates and now Highlands Park midfield maestro Musa Nyatama and Rhythm City veteran actor Bra Kop be relatives, perhaps? Nyatama, made his presence in the PSL felt when he turned out for Mamelodi Sundowns before he was loaned out to Bloemfontein Celtic. He was then snapped up by the Buccaneers after some Man of the Match performances. He has left Pirates and is now on the books of Highlands Park. Bra Kop, real name Setlhabi Taunyane, is a veteran actor and political activist who once applied for asylum in Canada. He kas acted alongside Danny Glover in the film Where Once Wavered. He has also performed in stage productions in the USA, Australia and Canada. With their striking resemblance, maybe Nyatama and Bra Kop are long lost relatives. Do you agree with SunSportâ€™s observation that they do look alike?
