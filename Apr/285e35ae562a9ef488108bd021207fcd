MORE than 100 health workers and patients at the Polokwane Provincial Hospital in Limpopo have been quarantined at the same hospital premises after they made contact with a medical doctor who recently tested positive for COVID-19 pandemic. The doctor's family members have also been quarantined together the health workers. MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says they have quarantined staff on Thursday after the doctor informed the department that he tested positive for COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking on a national radio Ramathuba said "The doctor isolated after doing the test but had to take extra precautionary measures when his result came back  positive of the virus. We have managed to traced all the people made contact the doctor including his family members." "When he tested was on self-isolation, we just need trace on how and where he was infected as he  says he didn't travel abroad." Ramathuba said. Limpopo currently has 24 confirmed COVID-19 cases, that include a 9-year-old girl who tested positive of the virus possibly infected by her who was told to self-isolate himself on his arrival from India and Bangladesh prior taking the test.
