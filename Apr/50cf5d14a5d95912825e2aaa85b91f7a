MATJHABENG Municipality mayor's spokesman Tshepo Davids was arrested and spent five hours behind bars before he was released and charges dropped. This was after he was arrested after he was found walking the streets of Bronville on Saturday morning. He was about to be charged with contravening the disaster management act during lockdown. But Davids said he was not just roaming the streets but was getting list of the residents who will be getting the food parcels. He said he spent five hours behind bars before he was released. Davids posted the photos of him and other people who were arrested at the Bronville cop shop on his Facebook account after the arrest. Davids then wrote: "I just got arrested by the Bronville police. The charge is contravention of disaster management act and lockdown regulations. The question is do our police officers understand the lockdown regulations and acts? Or are they planning to implement apartheid ways when the people see a police van should run? A person doesn't need a permit to go to the shops. I think our police need a serious workshop." He later told Daily Sun: " I was alone in the streets when I met with the police that arrested me. I was getting the information of the residents that need to get food parcels and the police did not want to understand me. This need to be fixed. The police randomly take others and leave the others freely. This is state resource wasting.""I am now released and the charges against me are dropped. This was after a permit for me to work w as arranged. Five hours have been wasted because I could have assisted our community with organizing the food parcel list that I was busy with." Davids was arrested just days after his boss, mayor Nkosinjane Speelman, got suspended by the provincial ANC after he was caught on video calling the coloured people Boesmans.
