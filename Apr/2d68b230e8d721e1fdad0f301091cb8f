A FAMILY wants answers after a woman was allegedly neglected in hospital. This after Nombulelo Maphanga’s baby died at Dundee Hospital on Monday. The 30-year-old from Glencoe in KZN allegedly arrived at the hospital bleeding and in labour, but was apparently not attended to. She allegedly delivered a 24-week-old premature baby alone, and the baby fell on the floor and died. Speaking on Nombulelo’s behalf, Nozipho Sithole (26) said the family was angry. “Nombulelo called me while in labour at home. As I live in Ladysmith, I told her to call an ambulance.” She said Nombulelo later contacted her and told her nobody attended to her. Nozipho said she called Dr Imran Keeka, who contacted the hospital and informed them about Nombulelo. “Only then did they attend to her. But it was already too late as the baby had died. We want this matter investigated by the Department of Health,” she said. The DA is also calling for an urgent and full investigation by the KZN Health Ombudsman. DA KZN Health spokeswoman Dr Rishigen Viranna called on KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu to take immediate action to ensure the nurses who were on duty are immediately suspended, pending the outcome of the investigation. The MEC said preliminary information at their disposal is directly contrary to what is being alleged. “The nurse had left the patient temporarily to get medical supplies in line with the patient’s management when this happened. The patient was indeed given medication for pain and after the delivery, and she received counselling from senior hospital officials,” she said.
