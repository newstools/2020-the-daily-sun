AN American actor has lost his leg as he has been battling the deadly corona virus since the beginning of this month. Nick Cordero (41) is an award-winning stage actor in the US who had his right leg amputated this past weekend following complications from the virus. His wife Amanda Kloots posted on an Instagram story on Saturday. According to the HuffingPost she said, "“We got some difficult news yesterday,” Kloots said in an Instagram Story on Saturday. “We’ve had issues in his right leg with clotting and getting blood down his toes. ... They had him on blood thinners for the clotting and, unfortunately, the blood thinners were causing some other issues. ... So the right leg will be amputated today.” Six hours later, she posted that Cordero was out of surgery. “I just got a call from the surgeon,” Kloots said. “He made it through the surgery, which is really big because obviously his body is pretty weak. ... Hopefully, he’ll just kind of relax and rest. But good news.” Saturday was day 18 of him being sedated in the intensive care unit, Kloots told her social media followers,according to CNN. Cordero, 41, is hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was performing in “Rock of Ages” and living with his wife and 10-month-old son, Elvis. He has been sedated since April 1, Kloots said.  We did this photo shoot with our friend @ash_a_ley about a month ago. I remember at the time saying to her that I really wanted to capture this time right now. Wow, am I glad we did! It’s Day 17 since Nick went under. Today his body is adjusting. Adjusting to being off ECMO, adjusting to more medications and some sideways steps but we are staying positive. He is no doubt receiving the best care from the team @cedarssinai ?? Continued prayers for our guy. I’ll see you at 3pm to sing and dance to Live Your Life! #wakeupnick A post shared by  AK! ?? (@amandakloots) on Apr 17, 2020 at 1:45pm PDT
