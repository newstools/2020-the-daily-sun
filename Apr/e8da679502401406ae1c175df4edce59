ON Tuesday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced relief funds would be distributed during the fight against Covid-19. He said the unemployed and those who don’t get UIF benefits will also get a grant. As a result, Kwaito artist L’vovo Derrango took to Twitter, saying artists shouldn’t be left out as they’re also going through a rough patch.

I really need it.” He told Daily Sun artists were hard hit by the lockdown and couldn’t earn an income. “Most of us depend on crowds and performances – not possible at the moment. “All artists are impacted by this pandemic. Some are scared to say they’re struggling, so I’m representing those voiceless ones. “We have kids to feed, to pay rent, and a lot of other responsibilities. The money from the president would go a long way.” He hoped Ramaphosa saw his video.
