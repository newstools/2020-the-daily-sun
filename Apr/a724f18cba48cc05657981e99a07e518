INFORMAL traders thought their problems were over when they heard they could go back to business. But all their hopes faded yesterday when they were unable to get trading permits from Joburg’s economic development department. After witnessing chaotic scenes, officials on Tuesday decided to suspend the issuing of temporary permits. Those who had not heard the news woke up early yesterday and were shocked to arrive at the department to find notices telling them of the suspension. Sibongile Mvundl (48), who sells food at Noord Taxi Rank, told Daily Sun: “I’m so disappointed. We can’t be told we must come and get permits and then suddenly hear they have been stopped.” Constance Mahlangu (54) said she was worried she would have to wait until 4pm to go home as taxis were only allowed to start operating again in the afternoon. “I didn’t know the issuing of permits was suspended,” she said. Traders were desperate to get permits and even after hearing the news, they still kept trying to get answers from the authorities. There was a large crowd and no one was observing social distancing. They were eventually chased away by defence force members. Assistant department director, Elliot Dubase, said: “We issued permits from Monday but on Tuesday, we had problems as people didn’t follow the lockdown rules. “The suspension is until further notice.” He told the crowds those who wanted to apply for the first time or were selling anything other than fruit and vegetables would not get permits.
