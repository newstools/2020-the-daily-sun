Ignorance is bliss Log off of all your social media, don’t watch the news and switch everything that connects you to the world off for as long as you need to take a breather. We’re getting hit by bad news from every direction, switch off for a moment, don’t pay attention to the bad news for a bit. Go look at videos of cats, anything to make you feel less anxious. Meditate Relaxation meditation, which typically involves cultivating calm by using an object of focus, such as your breath or a visualization can be one effective tool to help manage and ease stress. During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being. Remember, hard times don’t last, make sure you stay focused on what you can control and don’t let what’s happening in the world alter your thoughts too much.
