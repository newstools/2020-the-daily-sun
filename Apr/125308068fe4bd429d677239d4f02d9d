BUSINESSMAN Linda Twala has come out to defend the soldiers. Twala, also known as the Father of Alexandra, said the army did nothing wrong and no steps should be taken against them. His remarks came after the soldiers were criticised for using unnecessary force on citizens who failed to adhere to lockdown regulations. The iconic 76-year-old worker for the Alex community said he saw first-hand how citizens disobeyed the law. “I saw with my own eyes how terrible most residents behaved in the presence of the soldiers during the lockdown.” Following images on social media last week of soldiers forcing women and men to do push-ups and frog jumps in kasis including Alexandra, Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said such heavy-handedness was not in the interest of safeguarding citizens. She instructed the soldiers’ managers to monitor the situation on the ground and deal with members who use unnecessary force against citizens. Twala said: “I appeal to the minister not to take action against soldiers on the ground. “They were disobeyed and disregarded.”
