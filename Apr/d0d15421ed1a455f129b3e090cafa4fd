“I’M STILL alive and kicking!” These were the words of gospel singer and pastor, Thulani Manana, after he has been getting messages from his fans that he had died. He didn’t dispute that he was seriously ill the whole of last year, going in and out of hospitals. He said he received a shocking message almost two weeks ago that he must rest in peace. “This is the sixth time my fans sent condolences, saying I’m dead. In the process, others are shocked when they see me,” he said On the other hand, Thulani said it was good to know some people cared about him, but they should not worry as he’s still alive. The Zion music singer reflected on his situation last year. “Doctors said I suffered from piles and high blood pressure.” He said he spent the month of September at Arwyp Private Hospital in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni and three months at Heildelburg Hospital, where he still goes for check-ups. “I’m better now and have recovered. Thank God that I’m back,” said Thulani. He said he was almost done with his 14-track album titled Umhlaba Ujikile. “On the album, which will be released after the lockdown, I talk about my life journey and the world.”
