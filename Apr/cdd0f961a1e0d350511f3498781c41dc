Chinese government.The first PPE shipment consisted of 275 600 KN95 masks and
100 000 face shields and arrived at OR Tambo International Airport on 20 April.

equipment from China was a signal by China to maximise production and open its
medical supplies market to South Africa. "Naspers

is a model of close co-operation between China and South Africa. "Today's
event once again demonstrates our two countries' strong determination and
concrete actions to fight as one against Covid-19," Li added. SOURCE:
