THE little girl had big dreams and wanted to become a mechanical engineer in future. But Siphiwe Sibeko (14) from Dobsonville, Soweto, was murdered. The body of the grade 9 pupil was found by a passerby on Friday morning in Emdeni, Soweto. Her heartbroken mum Nandi Sibeko (40) said she believes her daughter saw her own death coming. Nandi said Siphiwe had asked her to rearrange and spring clean their bedroom. “ I told her I was tired but would help her. She went on to clean up herself, “ said Nandi. “She also told me she’d take my base and I’d sleep on the mattress. “That’s how we mourn when a person has died.” Siphiwe’s gogo, Joyce Sibeko, said her grandchild left the house at about 5pm on Thursday, saying she was going to buy snacks from the local spaza shop. Joyce said when Siphiwe didn’t return, they became worried and asked people in the kasi if they hadn’t seen her. “We even went to her friend’s house in Emdeni, but she said she last saw her on the last day of school,” said Joyce. “Ever since the lockdown started, she had been studying in her bedroom. She hardly went out as her only friend lived in Emdeni.” She said they opened a missing person’s case. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the motive for the killing was unknown. He appealed to anyone with information to call CrimeStop on 08600-10111 or send it via MySAPS App. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was saddened and shocked by the death of the Aurora Girls High School pupil. “How do people sleep after committing such a barbaric and cruel act?” he said.
