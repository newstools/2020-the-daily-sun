Following the coronavirus outbreak in South Africa that has been spreading gradually and currently sitting on 1 353 confirmed cases and five deaths. The government has created posters and a WhatsApp group where they educate the public about this deadly pandemic. Actress Florence Masebe has raised her concerns, asking why the government is only using certain languages to disseminate the information. The veteran actress argued that the government's lack of use of other languages on their communication platforms about the coronavirus will result in other communities in South Africa being left in the dark about this deadly pandemic. “It does not sit well with me that the WhatsApp service left other languages out. As if the virus discriminates,” she wrote. This statement by the actress followed after a Twitter user noticed that XiTsonga and Venda languages have been left out. The Tweep pleaded with the department of health that they should include these languages, as there are many people who speak the language, and people such as Flo can help with the translation of the messages.
