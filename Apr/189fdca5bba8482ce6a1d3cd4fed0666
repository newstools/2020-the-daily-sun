THEY believe prevention is better than cure. And with zero coronavirus infections in the area, the Ulundi Municipality in northern KZN has been doing everything possible to keep it that way. The municipality’s biggest concern is that once the virus gets into the villages, it will spread like wildfire because many residents are old or sickly. Since the lockdown started, there has been no sleep for officials who have been educating villagers on how to protect themselves. On Tuesday, they started with the process of disinfecting taxi ranks and bus stops. Mayor Wilson Ntshangase said they would also disinfect all government offices and buildings in town. “We saw it as very important to disinfect areas people visit on a daily basis, because we want to make sure it’s clean and safe for the elders, who are the majority of our population,” he said. “We’re happy that people in the area are following regulations but we’re worried some are not getting the information. Each and every day, we are happy with the progress we are making with this awareness.” Gogo Eunice Madondo (89) said she was scared to even go to town to buy essential goods. “I thank the municipality for the food parcels given to me as I’m scared to go out. “They say this virus spreads from person to person. I don’t want to die and leave my grandchildren alone.”
