THERE was outrage recently when two French doctors suggested the potential coronavirus vaccine be first tested on Africans. Mzansi celebrities weighed in on the issue. Actress Katlego Danke told Daily Sun it didn’t make sense to test it on Africans. “They should test the vaccine where a high number are infected, like Spain or Italy. Africa has the fewest infections,” she said. Singer Yvonne Chaka Chaka said the suggestion was upsetting and showed no regard for Africans. “They don’t care about us. They’re basically saying: ‘Use them as guinea pigs and if they die, they die’. They should first test the vaccine on themselves because they’re the ones dying in huge numbers,” she said. Author Jackie Phamotse said African presidents needed to stand up for their people. “We can’t fight this virus alone. We unfortunately need to rely on the World Health Organisation to do a collective medical effort. “It wouldn’t be the first time where Africans are used as a trash market to test new things. African presidents allow them to do whatever they want. “No African president has spoken out about this. No political party has commented. It took America to get these doctors to apologise.” Actor and presenter Lunga Shabalala said: “They should find people willing to be guinea pigs. We’re not lab rats.”
