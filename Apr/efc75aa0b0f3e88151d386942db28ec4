Somi Vilakazi, the first person to die from coronavirus in Soweto, was laid to rest on Thursday in a funeral attended by few family members. His death was announced by popular radio personality Redi Tlhabi.  In a tweet responding to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize's daily updates Redi shared that her husband’s cousin had succumbed to the deadly virus which has brought the world to a standstill. Redi said that Vilakazi (56) had started feeling ill after attending a funeral in Limpopo last month, before the national lockdown was implemented. According to Redi, Vilakazi had been tested for the virus on March 26 and the test came back negative.  His condition worsened and was admitted in ICU on April 9 and he passed away two days later. The seasoned broadcaster continued to thank staff of the public hospitals at Charlotte Maxeke and Leratong hospitals.
