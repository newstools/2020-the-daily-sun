Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has recommended that South Africans start wearing cloth masks to help limit the spread of Covid-19, rather than using medical masks reserved for healthcare workers. "Wearing masks is important. We want to recommend widespread use of masks. We are recommending that people use cloth masks and just make sure there's a three layer kind of thing," he said during a briefing on Friday. Mkhize said wearing a mask in public places can help slow the spread of the coronavirus, but that other hygiene measures were also crucial. "Even when wearing a mask, hand-washing and social distancing remain the most important interventions to reduce the spread of Covid-19. "Cloth masks are easy and not expensive to make, reusable and help reduce the transmission of Covid-19 by acting like a shield to contain the respiratory droplets through which the virus spreads," said Mkhize.      "The public should not wear medical masks. These are reserved as personal protective equipment for our healthcare workers, who are on the front line of our battle against Covid-19.  "Our healthcare workers need medical grade masks and respirators to stay healthy so they can save the lives of people who have Covid-19. Let us give them the tools to fight that battle," he said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-everyone-should-wear-a-cloth-mask-in-public-says-mkhize-20200410
