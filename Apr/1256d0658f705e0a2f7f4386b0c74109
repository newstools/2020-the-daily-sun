  PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the extension of the national lockdown to curb the spread of the Coronavirus by another two weeks. In his address to the nation on Thursday night, Ramaphosa thanked the nation of having complied with the published regulations but said lifting the lockdown now would reverse the gains that have been achieved by lockdown. He said the lockdown has seen the infection rate decreasing from 40% to 4%. “You have understood that we must do everything in our power to prevent the loss of lives, that would occur if we do not act. For your cooperation, patience and commitment, I thank you. “I'm mindful of the great and heavy burden this will impose on you. I'm aware of the impact it will have on our economy. “Unless we take these difficult measures now, the Coronavirus will engulf us. The National command council has decided to extend the lockdown - most of the measures will remain in force until the end of April,” he said. Ramaphosa said that the total number of new confirmed cases was 1934. He didn’t announce any death related to the virus. This is a developing story.
