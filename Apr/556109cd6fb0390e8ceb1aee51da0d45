THOSE of you who are selling liquor during the lockdown . . . watch out! This was the warning from Gauteng police commissioner General Elias Mawela. “Those people forget we are also on the social spaces. We see these adverts and then we order. “When we go to collect, we collect the owner and we take all the liquor,” he said. Mawela said booze sales was a problem for them. “They close the front door while using the back door to sell to their known customers. Some place orders online before collecting.” He said the confiscated liquor has filled their storage places. This weekend, cops seized booze worth R1,5 million at an outlet in Orlando East, Soweto and bust the owner. “We see people are making umqombothi and that tells us people are struggling to get liquor.” As expected, several people were arrested in Hillbrow yesterday for walking around the streets for no reason. One pedestrian claimed to be working for the SABC but was taken in for questioning and media workers noticed discrepancies with the permit he presented.  In Yeoville, people were bust, one with a bottle of vodka and a bottle of whiskey. Mawela said they received complaints from residents and they knew this area was one of the areas where non-compliance was high. “As we all know, Joburg is the middle of the epidemic. If we don’t take care of the situation here, we will completely lose Gauteng. We came here to apply the law and educate the community.”
