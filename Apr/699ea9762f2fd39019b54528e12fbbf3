Since its outbreak the coronavirus pandemic has caused a lot of panic globally and we have witness many countries going under lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. Everyone has been doing their bit to help fight this deadly pandemic and music producer and DJ, Black Coffee has recently helped raise funds amounting to R76 000 to help South Africa’s fight against Covid-19. The internationally recognised DJ recently did a free live-stream concert called Home Brewed 001, which its sole purpose was not only to entertain but a way to raise funds towards the solidarity fund that was set up by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Blown away by all of the love and generosity following yesterday’s stream. For Home Brewed 001, we were able to raise over 76,000 ZAR towards solidarity fund. Thank YOU!” Furthermore, the DJ who has decided to bring entertainment to people at the comfort of their homes for a good cause said he will do another live stream this upcoming Saturday. “I’ll be streaming again next Saturday to continue raising money for the cause... we’re still accepting donations,” he wrote.
