The Eastern Cape wants to place a moratorium on the use of tents and catering at funerals, as people continue to break the coronavirus lockdown limit of 50 people at such events. "Because [the] number of positive cases linked to funerals is escalating, we have to do things differently," Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba said in a statement on Sunday. With 270 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the province, Gomba is worried that people are still hosting more than 50 at funerals, sporting events and traditional ceremonies despite the Disaster Management Act regulations stating this is unlawful. Gomba's proposal is to start by banning tents or catering at funerals as a first step to reducing numbers. The streams of visitors offering condolences at the homes of the bereaved, and the sharing of spades, picks and drinking water jugs by the grave diggers have also been identified as possible contributors to spreading the virus. Gomba called for numbers of mourners to be reduced, and for grave diggers to adhere to strict hygiene practices. "We value human life and we will always place life ahead of everything else, which is why we will be submitting this proposal to the premier." The Eastern Cape government has already had to trace more than 100 people linked to a funeral in Majola, Port St Johns, and 400 people who attended the KwaDwesi funeral of a nurse, following Covid-19 diagnoses related to these gatherings.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eastern-cape-government-planning-tougher-funeral-rules-to-curb-spread-of-covid-19-20200419
