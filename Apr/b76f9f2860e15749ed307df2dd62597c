RESIDENTS of Ramaphosa squatter camp have allegedly connected izinyoka on a distribution box next to the Magqaza family’ house. The box exploded a few weeks ago and Nosiphiwo Magqaza (45) now fears their house might be razed by fire one day. She’s worried she might not be able to save her sister Nondumiso (29), who uses crutches, should this happen. “I’m always unsettled and fear leaving my sister alone. “Distribution boxes are always exploding and it’s a ticking time bomb,” said Nosiphiwo. She said she once shared her fears with two men connecting izinyoka, but they told her to get a life. “They told me I didn’t come with electricity from wherever I came from, so I should let them do as they please. They didn’t care to listen to the concerns I had about my sister.” Nondumiso told Daily Sun Nosiphiwo always spoke about her worries. “I don’t want to think about it because it scares me. “We heard about people who died in their homes because of electrical faults. I hope this will not happen to me,” she said. Residents said they didn’t have electricity, so they would have to find ways to light up their shacks and cook. Energy and climate change MMC Phindile Maxiti said they were aware of the izinyoka situation in the area, but could not distribute electricity in the squatter camp as it was on private land. “The community has been tapping into the existing electrical network illegally, be it from overhead lines, underground cables, public light poles or distribution kiosks. “The informal settlement is located on private land and the city doesn’t have approval from the owner to provide services,” said Maxiti.
