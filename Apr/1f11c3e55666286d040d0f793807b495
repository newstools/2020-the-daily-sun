CASTLE, who are the main sponsors of world champions, the Springboks, Bafana Bafana and the Proteas, have admitted that millions of rands will be lost, with no matches taking place due to COVID-19. But with these sports bodies not having an idea as to when they’ll see their teams play, these are dark days for Castle. Match shirts are folded in closets and players are confined at home. The sponsor has lost visibility. Bafana’s Afcon qualifiers in March and those in June were postponed by Caf until things become clear. The Springboks’ scheduled test match in July and Rugby Championship, is up in the air. The Proteas were in India recently. After one match, the tour was suspended. The next tour is in Sri Lanka in June, and then West Indies in July. For all these federations, Castle’s marketing budget for home matches is R7 million. But these funds have now been donated to the state’s Solidarity Fund. According to Castle, the priority right now is the safety and well-being of everyone, despite the cost involved. “COVID-19 has impacted us a lot because we’re the sponsors of these bodies and can’t do anything until everything has been cleared,” said brand director Kudzi Mathabire. Vaughan Croeser, who is Castle’s marketing manager, told SunSport: “Obviously, we can’t disclose the figures in public as to how much each federation gets because that’s confidential.” Another event Castle had to suspend is the continental Africa 5s, led by four-time African Football of the Year, Samuel Eto’o. Roping an all-time goalscorer of Afcon with 18 goals was the clear statement of strong marketing drive. Eto’o is said to have been paid R10-million.  As the country is on lockdown, Castle have urged South Africans to wear their national team jerseys every Friday, take pictures and share them on Castle’s Twitter handle.
