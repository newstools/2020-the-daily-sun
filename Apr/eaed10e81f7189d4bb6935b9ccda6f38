PEOPLE are urged to practise hygiene during this difficult time. But for the Mkhize family in Mbulwane area in Ladysmith, KZN midlands, it’s impossible due to the conditions they live under. This is because the family has to mop sewage water out of their house every day. They claimed this had been going for almost 25 years and they’d lost hope it would ever be fixed. Sphamandla (43) said he moved into the house in 1995 and the problem was just minor. “We have been living with the unbearable smell for almost 20 years. The whole place smells and we have to eat and sleep in the smelly house,” he said. He said it was worse in the yard with sewage water puddles all over. “The sewerage pipe for the whole area passes near my house, and sewage water flows straight inside the house when it busts,” he said. He said he’s tried several times to get the municipality to fix the problem, but with no luck. “When I call them, they tell me I’m annoying. They say I must not call them anymore.” Sphamandla said he feared their living condition left them vulnerable to the coronavirus. Uthukela municipal spokesman Jabulani Mkhonza said Mbulwane was under the Alfred Duma Municipality, which had historic sewer management challenges. “These challenges are worsened by acts of vandalism and theft of electric panels. There is evidence of stripped newly installed equipment at our sewer pump stations,” he said. “The challenge we face is we have a recurring problem of repairing pump stations and have them vandalised shortly after commissioning. “We also have financial constraints that make it difficult to provide the required security to water and sanitation infrastructure.”
