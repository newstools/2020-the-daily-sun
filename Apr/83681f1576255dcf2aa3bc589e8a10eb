FRIENDS of Skeem Saam actor Charles Maja are heartbroken they won’t be able to bid him farewell. Known for playing Big Boy on the show, the star died at Polokwane Provincial Hospital in Limpopo on Thursday. Only his family will bid him farewell as gatherings of more than 50 people are banned during the nationwide lockdown. In addition, the family said only two representatives from Skeem Saam, two from Thobela FM’s radio drama Mahlakung and two from Limpopo Artist Movement would be allowed to attend. The rest of the attendees will include his wife, three children and other family members. His friend Daniel Raphotle (50) said he was heartbroken he won’t be able to pay his last respects to Charles in Lebowakgomo on Saturday. “We have no choice but to take the instructions from the family as they are respecting the lockdown rules. It hurts because we became friends since the 1990s,” he said. Another friend, Joseph Madie (52) said he would remember Charles for his jokes. “It’s still unbelievable I won’t be part of his burial,” he said. Family spokesman Wilson Maja said they had a meeting with Lebowakgomo police and two police officers would observe the funeral proceedings. He told Daily Sun it was never the family’s intention to prevent people from coming to the funeral, but they have to follow the rules. “We had planned to slaughter three cows to ensure there is enough food for everyone, but the extension of the lockdown has just frustrated everyone in the family. “There will be a memorial service after the lockdown where everyone, including his fans, will get a chance to remember him,” he said.
