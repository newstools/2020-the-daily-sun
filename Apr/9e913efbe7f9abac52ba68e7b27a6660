KARABO Tshepe’s marriage with Black Leopards is over! The 31-year-old midfielder yesterday revealed to SunSport that his contract with relegation threatened Lidoda Duvha had been terminated before the Absa Premiership closed last month due to coronavirus. “I am no longer a Black Leopards player,” confirmed the Randfontein born midfielder. “I know that people have been asking where I am. The truth is that my contract with Leopards has been terminated and the club management have their own reasons why. I cannot tell you the reason why. “To be honest I do not understand why my contract was terminated. But I have just taken it like a man and I have moved on with my life.” He added: “I have been in the game for long and I understand that these things happen. I am training alone at home. My focus now is to stay fit and get a team next season. It is tough to train alone due to the lockdown.” The PSL and all leagues worldwide have been suspended due to the deadly Covid-19. The last time Tshepe’s name was on a Leopards team sheet was in their league clash against Chippa United at Thohoyandou Stadium on 8 January. But Lidoda Duvha’s No.10 was an unused substitute. A source told SunSport that the reason Leopards terminated Tshepe’s contract is because he could not agree terms for a new contract. Tshepe’s contract with Leopards was due to end in June. “Leopards tabled an offer but Tshepe wanted more,” said the source. “The two parties did not agree. Then Leopards were not happy with Tshepe and decided to stop him from training with the team and finally they alerted him that his contract has been terminated and he should look for a new team.” Despite his contract being terminated, Tshepe says he does hold any grudges against Leopards. Tshepe joined Leopards from ABC Motsepe League side Magesi FC in 2017. Tshepe was one of the key players who helped the Venda based side gain promotion to the top flight two seasons ago
