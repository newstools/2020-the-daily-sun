You're smart, hardworking and have a great sense of humour that could easily light up a room. You have an idea that could solve a problem at work. You could be the perfect boyfriend or girlfriend for the person you secretly admire. But no matter how hard you try, something keeps holding you back. Your inner voice might tell you you're not smart enough to be a good employee or good-looking enough to have the man or woman of your dreams. We all have moments where we lack confidence in ourselves. However, if your life is defined by a constant sense of self-doubt, then there's a problem. If you're tired of being held back by low self-esteem, here are some tips to help you on the road to a positive self-image: Stop trying so hard You can't please everyone all the time. You are not obligated to live up to other people's expectations. No one knows you better than yourself. Happiness comes from living your life the way you want. Learn to say so People with low self-esteem are usually pushovers. Learning to say no teaches us how to speak our mind in a polite but firm manner. This helps to build a long-lasting positive self-image. Allow yourself to make mistakes People with low self-esteem are focused on perfectionism, which in turn causes them to be overcritical of their mistakes. No one is perfect. Learn from your mistakes instead of being defined by them. Help someone Did you know that studies have proven that helping another person for just a few minutes a day can boost your self-esteem. Try and find something helpful to do in your daily life. Set realistic goals Achievement is the best way to build self-confidence. Write down a list of things you would like to accomplish. Then draw up a plan of how you intend to reach your goals, keep track of your progress and reward yourself for achieving your goal.
