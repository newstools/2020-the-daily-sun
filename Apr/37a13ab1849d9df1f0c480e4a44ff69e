 When one door closes, another one opens. Up-and-coming artist, DJ Ceega Wa Meropa can attest to this. The DJ was trending on Twitter on Saturday after Shimza snubbed at  him on social media. It all started off when he asked for Shimza to include him on the line-up for the Lockdown Party and Shimza said he was annoying and he should stop harassing him. Since then, brands like Capello, Audi and Global Oil South Africa, have offered to help him. He bagged himself a R5 000 cash voucher and R10 000 voucher from Bogart Man Capello. They also said they will give him a national tour at their stores, nationwide. Global Oil said they would give him fuel when he travels to DJ and gave him a R10 000 cash voucher. Audi Centre Sandton said they will be Ceega’s vehicle partner when he plays in Gauteng.
