RHULANI Mokwena remains non-committal on his future at Chippa United, insisting only God knows where he will be next season. The interim Chippa coach has six games to re-assert his credentials and prove he is the right man for the “poisoned-chalice” job in the long term, having joined the Port Elizabeth-based outfit on loan from Orlando Pirates last month. Mokwena hopes that he will be the first coach to see out his contract at Chippa. But he remains evasive on his future plans, pointing to the heavens for guidance. “Many are the plans of man, but it’s the God’s plan that prevails. As a child of God I rest solely in his arms and in the shadow on his wings. Wherever he blows me to is the direction I will take,” said Mokwena. Mokwena is yet to taste victory, having drawn his first match, a goalless draw against Bidvest Wits, before football was brought to a screeching halt by the coronavirus pandemic. He had been kicked into the periphery at Bucs, following the arrival of incumbent coach Josef Zinnbauer, and it seems highly unlikely he will be welcomed back aboard the Bucs ship. “I’m not afraid of failure. I’m inspired by positivity,” he said. “Even in a thunderstorm I look for the silver lining. There is never enough time in football. The lifespan of a coach in a job is 18 months. “There can never be a request for more time. It’s just to do the best we can.” Mokwena would know that philosophy doesn’t mollify the Chilli Boys owner Chippa Mpengesi when his mind is set on pulling the trigger on a coach. Despite the arrangement for his temporary appointment, Mokwena is not immune from the sack. His long-term future appears to be dependent on how he fares at Chippa, with potential suitors for the services of the young, but highly ambitious coach keenly looking. “The longer the lockdown happens, the longer I will stay in my position,” Mokwena joked. But will he mentor the Chilli Boys next season? It remains to be seen.
