KAIZER Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has urged "Amakhosi to remember and honour" Freedom Day "by respecting the Government regulations that are aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus". This he said as the country commemorated Freedom Day on Monday on Day-32 of the national lockdown where all football activities in the country have been halted, including football. Chiefs are favourites to lift the 2019-20 Absa Premiership title after having an amazing season under coach Ernst Middendorp where they went to the forced break while at the summit of the PSL log. Motaung said this day must serve as "inspiration to all South Africans as we celebrate our 26th year since this momentous day happened". "The struggle against the apartheid regime was a demonstration of our resilience as a nation," Motaung said in a statement through the club's official website on Monday. "Through unity we were able to emerge victoriously from difficult times. We must use the same dedication and discipline to fight against the spreading of the virus.” He further dedicated Freedom Day to the healthcare workers and all other essential service providers. “I wish to pledge my solidarity with the healthcare and other essential service providers. The world is indebted to you and the service that you are rendering during this testing time. Remain resolute in your profession and calling and have faith that we will soon be out of this situation. Stay strong. “Of course, this time it is a bitter-sweet celebration because the day happens during one of the most challenging times that we have seen in the world. “We are confronted by the Covid-19 pandemic that is claiming lives on a daily basis and put all countries on alert. Therefore, the celebrations will be muted due to the regulations imposed for people by the South African government to be safe.”
