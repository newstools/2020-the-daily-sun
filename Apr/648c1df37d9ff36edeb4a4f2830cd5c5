Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has announced another death from Covid-19, and that the number of positive cases has increased to 1 749. The latest victim is a 60-year-old man from KwaZulu-Natal who had advanced-stage cancer. Meanwhile, Mkhize said St Augustine's Hospital, in Durban, may have to close more parts down because of an outbreak there. The hospital closed its emergency unit this week after staff members tested positive."We are concerned about developments at St Augustineâ€™s Hospital. 66 tested positive over the past few days. About 48 of them are staff. The Provincial dept. is engaging the hospital, with a view to closing parts of the hospital down."We hope the fumigation process will start soon there. We have also assigned specialists there. We must always be on the lookout. The infection can seep in from any institution. We must now trace all the contacts. It is a matter of serious concern and we are dealing with it."      https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-all-the-latest-news-about-covid-19-in-south-africa-and-the-world-20200312
