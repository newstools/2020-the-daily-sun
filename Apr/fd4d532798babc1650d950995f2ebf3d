NECESSITY has become the mother of invention for Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic. Faced with an unprecedented situation after the outbreak of the coronavirus, the Zambia national team coach has had to come up with creative ways to keep his team in shape. Micho was unveiled as Zambia’s coach in February and the Serb has been preparing for his maiden assignment in the back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Botswana before the Covid-19 pandemic brought world football to a standstill. This has forced the former Orlando Pirates coach to come up with an unconventional training regime method at the time of the crisis. “We are really facing a tough situation, an unusual situation and one has to come up with ways to maintain training and also follow health guidelines,” said Micho. “We are all affected but under the circumstances I do online distance coaching for my players. It is not easy but we are learning as well.” Micho has been having sessions with the players in and outside the country, keeping everyone on his set programme. Among the players are the Bucs duo of Justin Shonga and Augustine Mulenga, as well as Salulani Phiri and Mwape Musonda. France-based Emmanuel Banda and Stoppila Sunzu are some of the few plying their trade overseas. “I do sessions individually with 10 players per day, ” Micho explained. “We have the majority of our players in Zambia but some outside the country. We can only hope the virus gets contained so the normal programme can return.” Zambia have never qualified for the World Cup before and Micho is hoping to become the first coach to achieve the feat. But his first objective is the 2021 Afcon finals. “We have to grow the team’s confidence through mental strength, to turn talent and quality into performance and results with unreserved support of all Zambian football stakeholders, and therefore reach the desired level of criteria and standards that will help us qualify,” Micho said.
