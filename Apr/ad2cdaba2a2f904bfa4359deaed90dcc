“CRIME does not pay. Easy come, easy go. I do not even remember what I did with the money after I robbed people.” These were the words of former tsotsi, Collen Rakumakoe. Collen said crime led him into a wheelchair and the worst part was he was not the victim, but the perpetrator. But now he’s a changed man, changing young lives on social media. Collen said he was part of an armed robbery in 2005, when things went wrong. “I was the mastermind who left with the money. I was shot in my neck that led me to become an incomplete quadriplegic. I can move my arms but my hands are not functioning 100%. My lower body is not functioning at all,” said Collen, who relies on a personal assistant. Born 38 years ago in Jericho outside Brits, North West, Collen now lives in Centurion, Pretoria, using a powered wheelchair for mobility. “If I used a taxi, there would be a challenge. I’d be unable to transfer myself from the wheelchair into a taxi. I prefer being driven in a vehicle since it’s easy to transfer myself. I travel 70% on the Gautrain and 30% in motor vehicles. Taxis won’t be patient with me.” Collen said: “I was a member of Joburg CBD tsotsis as a teenager. Change was painful. “I want to plead with youth not to do what I did. That biggest mistake must not be repeated. Anyone can reach me on Facebook as Colleen Collenzo Rakumakoe and my page is Collen Changing Lives.” He wanted to meet Gauteng Education MEC Panyasa Lesufi, as tsotsi ways start at primary school.
