North West health MEC Madoda Sambatha has called for calm in Motswedi village after one person who visited the area died due to Coronavirus or Covid-19 last week. Sambatha was addressing a gathering of not more than 100 people at the launch of the provincial roll out of mass screening, testing and tracing of the virus at the village. He told the gathering that government decided to start its mass roll out in Motswedi after they received reports from Botswana saying the woman who died due to covid- 19 had visited Motswedi to attend a funeral. The woman was buried on March 29 in Ramotswa in Botswana.  She came to Motswedi in South Africa on 14 March and left in 15 March. Sambatha said the woman might not have contracted the virus from Motswedi as 82 % cases of coronavirus were mild cases. “Motswedi residents you must not be worried that you are the one who transmitted the coronavirus to that woman and the Botswana citizens must also not be worried.  It does not mean when you cross the border to come with something wrong,” he said. He said his department screened all the people who were in direct contact with the victim and also started the process of screening everyone in Motswedi. Chief Director at the department of health Mosela Kausi said they screened 37 people and none of them showed symptoms of covid-19. “We advised them to continue following regulations because we do not know that walking on the streets will do to us. She said residents who attended the funeral have been calling and only one of them from Borakalalo village said he was catching flu. “All of the people who called were all healthy with no symptoms,” she said. The mass roll out lead by Premier Job Mokgoro is currently underway at the village.
