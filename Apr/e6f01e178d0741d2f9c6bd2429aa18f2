THREE men thought smuggling booze would be a walk in the park. But cops outwitted them and stopped their white BMW with a GP registration number on the N8 just outside Bloemfontein, Free State, on Sunday afternoon. Bottles of vodka, whiskey, gin and beer were found in the men’s possession. Photos of the bust men soon started making the rounds on social media and users had a lot to say. John Matlala said: “I wish the cops would give us, the people who obey the stay-at-home rule, that booze. My eyes are on those Skyy bottles.”  A cop said the men told officers they bought the booze in Bloemfontein. “They said they were heading to Thaba Nchu with it. “We’ll be investigating to find out where in Bloemfontein they found the booze,” he said. “They had a case of beer and bottles of Tanqueray, Johnnie Walker, Jameson and Skyy,” Free State emergency medical services manager Sipho Towa warned people they’d not be fooled and would search cars. “We’re regularly involved because we do screening if needed at roadblocks,” he said. National police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed the incident. “Three men aged between 40 and 50 were arrested about 30km outside Bloemfontein. They were driving a white BMW with liquor inside,” he said. “The arrest was made at about 3.30pm. They’ll be charged under the Disaster Management Regulations Act for transporting alcohol.”
