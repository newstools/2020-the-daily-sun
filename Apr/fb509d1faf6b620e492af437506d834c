THEY should have been in their new house by now but because of the lockdown, they have to live in a shack. The construction of their house in F section KwaMashu, north of Durban will be delayed even more. Their home was demolished under the R293 project and is supposed to be rebuilt by the eThekwini Municipality. Family member Mbukwa Dlamini (37) told Daily Sun their home was demolished in January, along with their neighbour’s house. “The house was old but my two brothers and me lived in it without any trouble. The councillor told us about the new project,” he said. “Then in February, people from the municipality came and took soil samples. But that was the last time we saw anyone from the municipality until there was a lockdown.” He said when the lockdown was announced they were shattered, as it meant the construction of their house would be delayed even more. “We are sleeping in two rooms in a small shack. Our neighbours went to rent a room in another section. “I wanted to ask the councillor to make sure our house would be built immediately after the lockdown, but I couldn’t get hold of him.” He said they hoped the lockdown wouldn’t be extended further. Councillor Cedric Ntshangase said nothing could be done now for the two households whose homes were destroyed. “Their houses will be rebuilt once the lockdown is over. We understand their frustration but they need to be patient.” He said the reason for the delay was many other houses were demolished and rebuilt in the ward.
