 ITHUBA has confirmed that the biggest jackpot for 2020 has been won by a
KwaZulu Natal player. The PowerBall winner bagged a massive R135 Million making them not only
the biggest jackpot winner for 2020, but also the biggest online jackpot winner
since ITHUBA took over as the operator in 2015. The Kwa-Zulu Natal based player used the FNB banking app to play
PowerBall with a ticket wager of R100 and opted for the quick pick selection
method to select the winning numbers of 06, 12, 32, 36, 45 and Powerball number
04. Due to the strict lockdown regulations, the winner will only be able to
claim their winnings once the lockdown has been lifted or relaxed. “We ask the winner to please be patient with us particularly because
they have to wait longer than usual before they can claim their winnings,” said
Khensani Mabuza, Corporate Relations Executive at ITHUBA. “We understand that the winner could be experiencing feelings of both
excitement and anxiety at winning these large sums of monies, but we want to
assure them that we are prepared to assist them through a smooth claiming
process once the lockdown period is lifted. “This includes psychological counseling which is essential in helping
them deal with this life-changing moment,” said Mabuza. “In line with the lockdown regulations announced by the President,
ITHUBA continues to firmly urge players to utilise the National lottery digital
platforms as Lottery sales are not permitted at retailers. “We have seen a significant
increase in online game participation since the COVID-19 lockdown began,”
Mabuza said.
