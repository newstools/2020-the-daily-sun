Golden Arrows head coach Steve Komphela has called on all men to look after their families during what is a difficult time for the country. As South Africa enters a second week of a 21-day lock down as a result of the coronavirus, the Golden Arrows boss has delivered a strong message. With families forced to remain in their homes for extended periods there is always the concern that increased frustrations could lead to greater tensions in homes. And writing on his Twitter account, Komphela stressed the importance for men especially to be protectors and providers to their families. He posted: "The message is directed to us men...as men we are not only protectors, we are providers. We are not only providers, we are protectors. Inasmuch as we know time for provision is when we (can) go to work and come back and provide for our families it is now the time when we need to protect.
