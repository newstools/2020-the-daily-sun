RETIRED general of the 28 gang, Welcome Witbooi (39), told Daily Sun gangs had agreed to a national ceasefire to lend a hand and provide relief during the Covid-19 pandemic. He said all gang activities and the selling of drugs had been stopped. The tattooed reformed offender has turned his life around. He said he joined gangs when he was 12. “My father was always absent. I wanted a sense of belonging.” Welcome said he was arrested at 17 for various crimes and was sentenced to 23 years in jail at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town.  “I joined the 28 numbers gang and this was mostly because I wanted to survive prison. I stabbed my way up the ranks and at 25 I became a first star general of the 28s gang.” He said while he was in prison he started thinking about the kind of father he wanted to be and how he would protect his daughter.  “I decided to walk away and retired as a general. I applied to study through Unisa and got an Abet qualification,” he said. “I started teaching numeracy, English, and human social sciences to other offenders at prison school.” Welcome was released in 2012 after serving 14 years of his sentence and started an NPO called Bright Spark Foundation SA. The changed man from Valhalla Park, Cape Flats, said they work across Mzansi communities where young people join gangs to survive. “Instead of joining a gang that destroys the fibre of their communities, I encourage them to join initiatives that build their communities.” He said he gets his daily motivation from his six-year-old daughter.
