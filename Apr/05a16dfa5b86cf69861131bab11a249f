Dear MizzB I’M a 27-year-old woman who was involved with a married man for four years. We loved each other but decided to end the relationship two years ago. I felt like I was living a lie. I’m now having issues finding love as I compare other guys to him and want them to treat me the way he did. Please help. Dear Helpless It takes courage to end a relationship, especially when you’re still in love with the person. It might be difficult for you to exercise patience but you must. Don’t be too hard on yourself. When you’re ready for a new relationship, you’ll be able to see the uniqueness of the person in your life. Human beings are not the same and, therefore, you can never meet someone who’s a replica of your ex. Allow yourself to be open- minded and embrace each person for who they are and not what you desire them to be. Though two years might seem like a long time, keep in mind that some people take longer than others to get over their previous relationships, and this is normal.
