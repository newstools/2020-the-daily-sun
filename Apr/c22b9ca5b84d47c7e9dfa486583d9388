COVID-19
pandemic has pushed many business into a creativity to ensure that they survive
the difficult period. Estratweni
Mobile Foods founders Siphemandla "Space" Mavumengwana and Siphumeza
"Blax" Ramncwana said after the lockdown was announced they had to
find other ways to survive the difficult period. The
popular duo is known in their kasi for making delicious burgers and have
employed several young people in their kasi. “We
had to find ways to work it out so we started to delivering burgers to people’s
houses. Since big companies had closed down, there are people who were
delivering for Uber Eats were left stranded so they approached us and we
started working with them. We have six people who does the deliveries,” said
Mavumengwana. Ramncwana
said they had the plan to deliver food to clients since they started the
business back in 2016 but COVID-19 pandemic was the catalyst. “Delivering
food to clients is our original plan, we used to do that when we started this
business but we stopped. “We
had it in our mind that we must continue but this virus has pushed us into it,
it was like a catalyst. Even after lockdown we are not going to stop delivering
to our clients,” said Ramncwana. The duo said currently clients order their
food via WhatsAap but they intend to develop a website and an application that
makes the process easier. They
said in the beginning, it was not easy to manage orders on WhatsAap but now
they are used to it.  The two friends
started the business after the quit their jobs at a local NGO and decided to
pursue business. They borrowed R200 from Mavumengwana’s sister and started
selling muffins ekasi and that’s when they developed their business into
selling burgers, chips and chicken.
