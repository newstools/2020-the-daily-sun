HE’S using his skills in fashion design to help fight the coronavirus. Fashion designer Tshepiso Disemelo from Noord in Rustenburg, North West, makes his own masks. He started doing this for his family, and when his friends saw them they too wanted the masks. The 27-year-old designer said the masks were in short supply and, as an entrepreneur, he saw the need to fill the gap. He decided to make use of all the fabric in his house to make colourfully designed masks for his customers. The masks are 100% cotton. “Masks are in high demand. Many people in local communities can’t afford to use one mask and throw it away. Hence cotton masks are recommended because you can wash them. Knowing they can’t get medical masks, people still have to get something to protect themselves.” Tshepiso also advised people to wash their hands frequently. He started making clothing a few years ago and opened a company, Genius Original Designs. “I have a stall where I exhibit and sell my clothing. I supply various shops around North West,” he said.
