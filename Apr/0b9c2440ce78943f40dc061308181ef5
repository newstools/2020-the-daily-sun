TWO families from KwaMakhutha township south of Durban want the eThekwini municipality to compensate them for damages caused by a burst water pipe. Nomathamsanqa Hlongwa (62) told Daily Sun that around 11 pm on Wednesday she heard a loud bang, when she looked through the window she saw floods. She said she immediately woke up her family members, but the water was all over the house within minutes. She said they did not sleep and worked the whole night trying to divert water and stop from getting into the house. "We need to be compensated for this damage because this is not our pipe it belonged to the municipality, so they must service it," said Hlongwa. She said the damaged furniture include wardrobe and fridges, while her neighbour Bathobile Nhlangulela said she was asleep when she started feeling wet in her bed. She woke up and found a pool of water all over the house. She reportedly woke up her family to remove furniture which was already sinking in water. Nhlangulela said they want the municipality to compensate them because they lost food and both families said the damage is plus or minus R50 000. Hlongwa said the pipe belongs to the municipality but it was fitted inside her yard. She said the pipe first burst in 1993 and again in 2008 and it was the third time now. By the time SunTeam left the house municipality team from water and sanitation was already on the scene. Water and Sanitation head Ednick Msweli said he will send engineers to see whether the pipe can be removed from Hlongwa's yard. On the compensation issue, he said the engineers will assess the damage and advise the municipality on how families can be assisted.
