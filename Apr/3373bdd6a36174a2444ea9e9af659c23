MASKANDI artist Mthandeni "Igcokama Elisha" Manqele is now venturing into a detergent business. Manqele revealed on his Instagram on Wednesday that he is now going to have a sanitiser manufactured under his brand, Igcokama Elisha. Speaking to Daily Sun, Manqele said he saw it necessary to come up with this kind of business given the situation that the country is currently facing. “People are now fearful because of this coronavirus that has reached our shores and spreading like wild fire.

He said as a public figure, he has a duty to teach people about the things they need to do in order to keep healthy. “For example, in the coronavirus case, our people need to be taught that they must practise cleanliness, that they must wash or sanitise their hands regularly and that is where the Igcokama Elisha sanitiser comes in,” said Manqele. He said the sanitiser is going to be available in garages and supermarkets soon after the lockdown given the fact that at the moment movements are currently being limited. He also added that people might end up seeing it be launched with other cleanliness products like soaps because he is aiming to spread the word that people need to keep clean. “You’d know that even before this whole coronavirus outbreak, my brand has always been associated with cleanliness, so right now, it’s about spreading the word across the country,” he said.
