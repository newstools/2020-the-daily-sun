A THWASA who was allegedly raped by her gobela at a gravesite is living in fear after she reported the matter to the police. This is because nothing was done against the alleged rapist. The incident allegedly happened in Tweefontein in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, earlier this month. Daily Sun published the story on 2 April headlined: “Thwasa raped at gravesite.” The 27-year-old thwasa from Dark City in Nkangala told Daily Sun: “I don’t feel safe knowing he’s out there living his life. I am surprised he has not been arrested.” The incident has since sparked anger among sangomas. Gogo Felleng Magongoa, chairwoman of Siyakhula Njalo Traditional Healers Organisation, said it had become the norm for thwasas to be abused by their gobelas. She said they wanted to put an end to this demonic act, which had tarnished their sacred calling. “It’s about time we as abangoma rise up and protect our beautiful healing fraternity,” she said. Vice chairwoman, Nonkanyiso Mhlekazi, said: “We have heard too many stories like this one and we don’t want this to continue. It tarnishes our image. Traditional organisations need to stop doing lip service and we must unite and fight for these helpless thwasas.” Phephisile Maseko, national co-ordinator of Traditional Healers Organisation based in Jozi, said: “If there’s foul play in the matter, we are going to report it. The gobela should stop practising immediately.” Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they took statements and the docket was sent to the prosecutor for a decision.
