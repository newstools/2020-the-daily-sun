PROPHET Bushiri never took money from the poor! So said Shepherd Bushiri’s spokesman, Ephraim Nyondo. This comes after social media users accused Bushiri of giving back to the community money he took from the same poor people. Since the lockdown began, Bushiri and his team have been distributing food parcels and health kits among vulnerable communities. TB JOSHUA GOES ON 40 DAY FAST FOR CORONA! The parcels included meals, toiletries, sanitary pads, as well as masks and sanitisers. Nyondo said: “The public shouldn’t forget that the prophet is an astute businessman and philanthropist.” He said Bushiri is the church’s number one donor and gives to the poor unconditionally. “He assists the church when it’s unable to satisfy its debts,” he said. Last Friday, Bushiri was stopped by the Hawks as they were about to leave for Mpumalanga in trucks filled with parcels to be distributed to 200 families. “This meant cancelling the charity to help the poor,” said Bushiri. “We follow all laid-down procedures. We work closely with the social development department, and we’ve never experienced such a challenge.” I MISS 4-5! Nyondo questioned the cops’ motives. “Bushiri felt it was a witchhunt,” he said. “It’s for the first time we hear the Hawks are enforcing lockdown regulations.” He said this is the work of the police and soldiers. “Everyone can read between the lines,” said Nyondo. Spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said it was Bushiri’s attorneys who told the Hawks he was travelling. “We advised them to hand the parcels to the social development department for distribution,” said Mulaudzi. “No one is allowed to travel from one province to another except for a funeral. “Nobody stopped his trucks. This matter was discussed over the phone.” He dismissed claims the Hawks had a vendetta. Bushiri was expected in Tshwane today to hand over to the department food parcels meant for the Mpumalanga families.
