THE family raced against time on Friday for permits to travel to Polokwane, Limpopo to bury their loved one. They didn’t have clarity earlier in the week how they could get permits until Co-operative Governance Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma addressed the nation on Thursday. She said people would be allowed to move between provinces, metropolitan and district areas to transport a body for burial purposes. People permitted to travel to funerals are also limited. STAY SAFE, PLEADS MANYAMA! The 10 family members rushed to the cop shop and were told to get help in the Protea Magistrates Court. Esther Rakgwale said they were burying her father. “We were supposed to be in Polokwane on Friday. Esther’s sister, Anne Letwaba said the documents needed to get the permits was not a lot. “They wanted IDs, the death certificate and also asked who had died.” Funerals services in Limpopo start at about 6am and Anne said they agreed to delay it for an hour to give those travelling overnight a chance to get there on time. A court official said they had to see a lot of people. One mum, Lindiwe Radebe (30), said her three-year-old daughter was safer with her than at their home. One of many at Dobsonville Mall in Soweto , she told Daily Sun a woman in the yard where she rents a room went to hospital for showing Covid-19 symptoms.
