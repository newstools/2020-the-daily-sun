THEY say lightning does not strike twice in the same place. But Baroka captain Gerald Phiri Jnr has vowed that it will happen when Bakgaga face their Limpopo rivals Black Leopards in the quarter-finals of the Nedbank Cup at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The Ga-Mphahlele-based side are fresh from beating Lidoda Duvha 2-1 in their Absa Premiership derby last weekend at the same venue. And the player Leopards will never forget in last week’s defeat is Baroka’s 19-year-old striker Evidence Makgopa who netted a brace. “Obviously they will be coming for revenge. It is a big game, we beat them last Saturday and they want to win too,” said the Malawian international. “But we are ready for them. Our aim is to continue with our dominance over them and qualify for the semi-finals. It won’t be an easy game as it is a derby but we have been preparing well and everyone is excited to face them again.” He added: “They lost to Bidvest Wits in a league match on Tuesday and they will be aiming to get back to winning ways. We can’t wait for this clash.” On their chances of winning the cup which has a winner’s purse of R7 million, the 26-year-old midfielder says they are taking one game at a time. “Our focus is Leopards,” he explained. “It will be great to win the competition for this team like they did last season when they won the Telkom Knockout. But it is still a long way to go. We need to take one game at a time and respect our opponents.” Bakgaga beat their other Limpopo rivals Polokwane City and ABC Motsepe League side Hungry Lions to reach the last eight. Bottom of the Premiership, Leopards have been lucky as they have faced minnows North West University and Amavarara to advanced to the Ke Yona quarter-finals. But Leopards have been struggling in the league with their 1-0 loss to Wits at Milpark seeing them firmly rooted to the bottom of the table.
