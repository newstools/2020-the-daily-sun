BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka, ground keepers and management staff were allegedly not paid their February salaries by Siwelele boss Max Tshabalala. According to employees who asked to remain anonymous, Tshabalala has been making empty promises since they didn’t get their salary on 27 February. He allegedly sent managing director Ralli Ramabodu to inform them he has only paid players because his company is having financial problems. Said the Source: “We were surprised when we didn’t get our money last Friday. We needed clarity from Tshabalala and were promised that we will be paid on Thursday. But instead of getting money in our bank accounts, we were told that we will get it on Friday. They suddenly changed the date to say we will now get paid on the 15th because the company doesn’t have money.” Tshabalala allegedly told those that are not happy about the changes to resign. Added another Source: “How are we going to survive between now and the 15th? How are we supposed to feed our family and pay for our children’s school fees without a salary? Celtic gets a monthly grant of R2 million from the PSL and we don’t understand why we can’t get paid on time. They don’t respect us, I mean how can Max say if you want to resign you can do so? They feel we are replaceable and under-pay us. They are aware we love the team and they think we are stranded.” However, Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco denied that they didn’t get their salary together with his technical staff. He added: “We have all been paid together with all the technical staff members.”
