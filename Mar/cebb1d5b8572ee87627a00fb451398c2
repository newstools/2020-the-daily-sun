 DIPUO Nyambiri can finally have a good night’s sleep. This is because her three-month-old baby boy Tshegofatso was found unharmed. He was kidnapped from Mamelodi Clinic in Tshwane on Friday. According to Dipuo, she received a call from the police in the early hours of yesterday morning to come to the police station to identify a baby. She said no words could describe the joy she felt when she saw it was Tshegofatso. Daily Sun published her story yesterday, headlined: “Help Dipuo find her stolen baby.” Her devastation began when she took her baby to the clinic for immunisation. A woman sitting next to her offered to hold her baby, only to steal him. “I’m grateful to everyone who helped us look for him and for sharing his pictures. The pressure from the public and the media must have forced the woman to bring back my boy,” Dipuo said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said Tshegofatso was found on Sunday night. He said the baby was found by a couple dumped next to the University of Pretoria’s Mamelodi campus. He said a case of kidnapping remained open. “We appeal to anyone who might have information that can help in the investigation to call Warrant Officer Mhlanga on 071 675 6774 or call the nearest police station,” said Masondo.
