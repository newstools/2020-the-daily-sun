 The Menlyn shopping centre in Pretoria has
unreservedly retracted an internal communication sent to tenants which
suggested that an employee of an MTN store had tested positive for the novel
coronavirus (Covid-19). The centre
said it had made the announcement after learning the store was closed. It said
later it was advised that no employee had tested positive for the virus. The
shopping centre said the store had closed due to concerns from staffers that
they had indirectly, through three levels of separation, been in contact with a
person who showed symptoms of flu. A day after
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced strict measures to deal with the Covid-19,
South Africans in their droves, began to stock up on essentials. Queues at the
Makro in Woodmead, Johannesburg snaked throughout the store. "Out
of an abundance of caution, the store was closed to be sanitised and will
reopen on Thursday 19 March 2020. Tests have been undertaken but there is no
evidence of any infection, whatsoever, of any individual," the mall
management said in a statement. The
shopping centre has apologised to MTN, its customers and shoppers for the
misinformation. SOURCE:
