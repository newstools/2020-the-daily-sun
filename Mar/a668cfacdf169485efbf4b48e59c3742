A SUSPECT was bust over the torching of the Regeneration Church building and cars belonging to Pastor Laison Molimi in Acornhoek. The 27-year-old, who faces charges of malicious damage to property and arson, will appear in the Acornhoek Magistrates Court on Monday. It happened last Tuesday while Molimi and his family were sleeping. They were woken by the sound of people breaking the windows of his five-roomed house.  The pastor said his two cars went up in flames, and when he went out to check the intruders had vanished. He said residents came running and tried to put out the fire, but it was too late. Minutes later, people phoned to tell him his church was on fire. The attackers left a red painted message on the burnt church wall: “In Regeneration they rape because they have a snake.” Molimi was shocked about the message alleging he was a rapist and used a snake to attract church members. Commissioner Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said the suspect was bust after detectives launched a manhunt and worked tirelessly with residents. “Subsequent to the incident about a week ago, we made a call for the arrest of the suspects. “Police as well as the public did not disappoint us. Lawlessness can never be tolerated in society.” Zuma said regardless of any grievances, no one had the right to destroy property and that the law must prevail. “The relevant structures will work hard to ensure this man gets the punishment he deserves for the charges against him.”
