BAFANA Bafana legends Benni McCarthy and Steven “Schilo” Pienaar took to Social Media to show their ball-juggling skills in defiance of the wide-spreading Coronavirus. This week, people all over the world went to supermarkets and stockpiled on tissue paper because of the Coronavirus scare – but Pienaar and Benni had other plans on how to use their tissue paper. Pienaar, who had an illustrious career in Europe where he played for Ajax Amsterdam, Borussia Dortmund in Germany and Everton in the English Premier League, is seen hilariously juggling toilette paper.  McCarthy too jumps in and also shows off his diski skills. McCarthy recently departed from Cape Town City as head coach. He is Bafana’s all time leading goalscorer and he won the UEFA Champions League with FC Porto under Jose Mourinho. Benni ended his wonderful career at Orlando Pirates, where he scored vital goals and endeared himself to the Buccaneers supporters. #stayathomechallenge I nominate @chrissamba4 @stevenpienaar @victorwanyama @thabo_nodada @moeneeb @vasilimanousakis A post shared by  Benni McCarthy ????????
