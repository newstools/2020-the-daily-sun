ON-FORM Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Andile Jali is back with Bafana Bafana after being included in the 25-man team to face São Tomé in back-to-back 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against São Tomé and Principe. The first match will be played at FNB Stadium on 27 March while Bafana will travel to São Tomé for the second match three days later. They have picked up three points from their opening two matches, losing 2-0 to Ghana before they secured their first win, 1-0, against Sudan. Jali last played for Bafana two years, but his ever-improving has caught the selectors’ eyes. São Tomé are ranked 181 out of the 210 Fifa federations. It will be the first ever South Africa face São Tomé. But Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is not taking them lightly. “On paper São Tomé look an easy opponent. But my experience with Seychelles has taught me not to look down on my opponent,” said Ntseki. Bafana will assemble for camp on Sunday. Kamohelo Mokotjo, Thamsanqa Mkhize, Thato Mokeke, Kermit Erasmus and Thapelo Morena haven’t been considered for selection as they are injured.
