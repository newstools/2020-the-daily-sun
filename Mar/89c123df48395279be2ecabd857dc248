NKOSINGIPHILE Masondo is relieved. This comes after the 64-year-old from KwaMashu G section, north of Durban, found her adopted daughter Amahle Xulu (12) on Monday. READ: AVOID HAVING SEX DURING SELF-ISOLATION Amahle had disappeared on Saturday after Nkosingiphile questioned her about a cellphone that went missing from the house. She said she cried tears of joy when she found Amahle in her local social development department’s offices when she went to report her missing to social workers. “She was with another gogo who lives with her brother in J section. The gogo had come to report to the social workers that Amahle arrived at her home very late on Saturday. “They were still doing a consultation in an office when I saw them passing by the office I was in. I couldn’t contain my excitement.” Nkosingiphile said when social workers asked Amahle how she managed to walk such a long distance, she said she was asking for a lift from two men when a child she knew from J section came by. “She said she felt as if God was answering her prayer because she had no idea how to get there. I usually take her in my car to visit her brother. She said the child told her they could walk together,” she said. READ: 64 FOUND DEAD IN A CONTAINER!
