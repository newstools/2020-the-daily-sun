THE Coronavirus is a world disaster. To this end, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced several guidelines on how to prevent the spread of the virus. So, let Mzansi follow the president’s counsel to deal with the pandemic. Let’s stop the myth that Corona doesn’t affect black people and that it’s for wealthy people. There may be zero deaths now, but it has begun spreading locally. People should stay indoors. The pandemic is spread through touch. This as your child will go out to play with their friends, who may be affected by the virus. They may have gotten it from their parents, who might have gotten it from work or travelling abroad. In the meantime, let’s wash our hands often and use hand sanitisers as much as possible. We can also use bleach, soap and any other thing that could help in an effort to stay clean.
