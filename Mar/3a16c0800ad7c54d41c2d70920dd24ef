Germany has expanded restrictions on social interactions
to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak. The country has banned public gatherings of more than two
people. In a televised address, Chancellor Angela Merkel said
"our own behaviour" was the "most effective way" of slowing
the rate of infection. BBC reports that measures included closing hair, beauty
and massage studios. Other non-essential shops had already been shut. Shortly afterwards, Mrs Merkel's office said she would
quarantine herself. A doctor who vaccinated her on Friday against
pneumococcus, a pneumonia-causing bacteria, had tested positive for
coronavirus. The chancellor, 65, will be tested regularly in the next
few days and work from home, her spokesman said. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has so far confirmed
18,610 cases and 55 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. People will not be allowed to form groups of three or
more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the
gathering is work-related. Police will monitor and punish anyone infringing the
new rules. Restaurants will now only be allowed to open for takeaway
service. All restrictions apply to every German state, and will be in place for
at least the next two weeks. "The great aim is to gain time in the fight against
the virus," said Mrs Merkel, urging citizens to keep contact outside their
own household to an absolute minimum and to ensure a distance of at least 1.5m
(5ft) from another person when in public.
