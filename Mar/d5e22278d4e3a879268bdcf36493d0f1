Due to the coronavirus outbreak, candidates can't meet their potential employers face to face so interviews are being conducted online. Big tech companies have asked their employees to work from home as a strategy for social distancing. Travel restrictions and other factors are also making it hard for candidates and their potential employers and some are unable to see their clients so they end up up using video calling to communicate. "It was actually easier to get hold of many clients because they were at home, bored and on the end of a mobile phone than it was when they were in meetings, walking factories or flying somewhere," said recruitment firm PageGroup's chief executive Steve Ingham talking to BBC. Although video calling is not exactly the best situation to find yourself in when you’re trying to convince a potential employer that you’re the best candidate for the role, it seems like the only way to go for now. Here are 8 ways to nail your video interview: 1. Choose a location that's quiet, where you won’t be interrupted 2. Look appropriate 3. Check all connectivity 4. Make sure they can see you clearly 5. Remember to speak clearly 6. Make sure they know you’re listening 7. Look into the camera 8. Make sure your username is professional
