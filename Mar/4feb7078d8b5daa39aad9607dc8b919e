A man on twitter is receiving all the love from the ladies. From his celebrity crush, Natasha Tahana to social media influencers to twelebs. All he did was introduce himself as “Mbuso” and ladies started gushing over him. Those who thought they were not into light-skinned brothers, found themselves gushing over Mbuso. Some ladies are ready to risk it all for the handsome eye candy, sending him tweets such as “Please come ruin my ovaries,”. Some even started tagging him on pictures, comparing him to the guys who want them, he keeps winning. On the other hand, Mzansi men are not pleased with the hot man trending.
