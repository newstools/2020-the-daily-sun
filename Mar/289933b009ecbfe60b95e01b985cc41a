More than
60 suspected undocumented migrants from Ethiopia were found dead on Tuesday in
a cargo container in Mozambique's northwest Tete province, a hospital official
said. "A
truck transporting illegal immigrants from Malawi, suspected to be Ethiopians,
was stopped at the Mussacana weight bridge in Tete, and 64 people were found
dead. Only 14 survived," the senior official, who asked not be named, told
AFP. SOURCE: NEWS24
