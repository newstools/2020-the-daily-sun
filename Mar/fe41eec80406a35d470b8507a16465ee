  THE
parliament process to remove Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has
been put on ice as the National Assembly has been forced into recess by the
Coronavirus pandemic. National
Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise said the motion to remove Mkhwebane tabled by
the DA will be processed once the house resumes its business. It
is known when the house will be back from the recess as the country is
currently battling with the spread of the virus with confirmed cases souring to
402 on Monday afternoon. ”The
parties participating in the application by the Public Protector for an interim
interdict of the parliamentary process, which was scheduled for hearing on 26
and 27 March 2020, have agreed that it be postponed until further notice. This
agreement has been made an order of the Western Cape High Court,” Modise’s
office said in a statement. Also,
the court hearing where Mkhwebane has filed an urgent application to interdict
the parliamentary process has been postponed indefinitely after both parties
mutually agreed. Mkhwebane’s
lawyers in a letter to Cape Town High Court President Judge John Hlophe
confirmed that they have agreed to an indefinite postponement. “The
parties participating in the application mentioned above have further agreed
that if in the future any of them wishes that the application be enrolled for
hearing, the parties shall request that you to set the matter down on a future
mutually agreed date and after giving reasonable notice of not less than two
weeks, to allow for the allocation of judges, the exchange of Heads of
Arguments and other practical matters,” her lawyers said in the letter.
