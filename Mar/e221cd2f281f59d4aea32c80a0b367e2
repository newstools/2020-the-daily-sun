WHEN commuters boarded a taxi from Lenasia to Joburg, they didn’t know they were riding in a moving coffin. Moments later, the taxi collided with a Toyota Avanza on the R553 Golden Highway outside Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, yesterday morning. Eleven people died, including three young siblings. WATCH: TEN PEOPLE KILLED IN HORROR ACCIDENT!  City of Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun: “We attended to the accident involving a taxi and a Toyota Avanza, where 11 people, including three children, were confirmed dead. “Eight people received advanced medical care and were transported to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.” Acting Gauteng education MEC Jacob Mamabolo expressed concern over increasing deaths on Gauteng roads.  “My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of those who died in this horrific accident. I’d also like to wish those in hospital a speedy recovery,” he said. Mamabolo later visited the injured in hospital and also visited Robertsham Primary School, where the three pupils attended. JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla said a case of culpable homicide was opened.  “At the moment, we are not sure what caused the accident,” he said. Family spokesman Noel Maart said the family was devastated. “We are not keeping so well. The toughest part is for a mother to lose all children at once. It’s unbearable. We don’t blame anyone for what has happened. We don’t justify what happened. It’s God’s way of taking these kids, so it’s His will,” he said.  “Our cry is against all transport drivers. They don’t have an idea how hard it is for a mother to lose all three children at the same time. We are devastated.”
