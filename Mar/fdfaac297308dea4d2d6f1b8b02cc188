 As South
Africa prepares to go on a 21-day national lockdown to curb the spread of
Covid-19, the basic education department has vowed to work towards ensuring
pupils continue benefiting from the school nutrition programme while at home. This was
announced by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Thursday, who outlined
the department's plans to support pupils during the lockdown. Motshekga
said the department's council of education ministers met on Thursday morning to
consider and evaluate plans they have been working on since schools were closed
after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a national state of disaster in terms
of the National Disaster Management Act. The
discussion included the provisions of a school nutrition programme during the
lockdown. Nutrition She added
the issue of nutrition was, however, a complex one because pupils were not at
school, saying the department would therefore be working with the social
development department to ensure underprivileged families would be provided
with nutrition support. "The
thinking is that one member of the family will be allowed to a collect one food
parcel once a week during the three weeks for the use of the entire
family." Motshekga
said this would ensure social distancing. She added
several food companies - such as Tiger Brands, Nestle, Pioneer, Old Mutual,
First Rand and Add Hope Foundation - have expressed their willingness to
support the initiative. The
department said it had been working since schools closed to ensure that pupils
were being educated about the virus while they are at home. Motshekga
said after the announcement of the lockdown by Ramaphosa, the council of
ministers had agreed to focus on catch-up programmes as part of the department's
efforts to promote learning and teaching at home. This was
also part of preparations for when schools reopened at a date that was yet to
be announced, she added. SOURCE:
