COPS acted on a tip-off about a stolen car and ambushed the suspects in a house. When the cops arrived at the house in Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni, on Monday, they found three cars including two white Mercedes Benz cars and Ford Kuga. The police found seven AK47s among high calibre firearms during a foiled robbery. They also found two others high calibre rifles, explosives, and ammunition of different firearms. Soon after the recovery, police went on a manhunt for the suspects, the search paid off when six suspects were arrested within the vicinity. They were found with two more pistols and a VW Polo. Investigations indicated a possible connection between the suspects and their vehicles to robbery cases. It was also discovered that the two Mercedes Benz cars were reported stolen in Jeppestown and Sunnyside, recently. Further investigations will be conducted to establish other links of the suspects, the vehicles as well as the firearms. Acting Gauteng police commissioner Major General Andr√® Wiese praised the collaboration of SAPS members and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Department for foiling a potentially violent robbery, arresting six suspects and recovering nine firearms with ammunition as well as three vehicles that are suspected to be stolen.
