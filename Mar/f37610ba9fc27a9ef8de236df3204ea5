Mzansi's hip hop is best recognised for the bangers people remember for decades. These remind us of the culture of a particular time. Unfortunately, some of these hits go sour as time goes on as these rappers became the biggest flops in the industry. Pitch Black Afro:    The jailed rapper from Orlando East, Soweto fell through the cracks and now is more widely known for allegedly killing his girlfriend. Maggz:  Also born in Soweto, the rapper whose real name is Gift Magubane seemed to show some promise in the early 2000s  but the became one of those whose  star just seemed to fizzle out. Mawe2:    After releasing the amazing album A Fool’s Hope he couldn’t capitalise on the hype in time. His latest offering, Almost Brave released last year, failed to live up to people's expectations. Molly:  Molly got people talking when he signed a fat deal with Ghetto Ruff, but after few guest performances on TV, nobody really knows what happened. Infa:   Infa showed great skill as a leading member of rap group Skwatta Camp, but he also didn't live up to people's expectations.
