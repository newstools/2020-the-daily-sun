ABUJA, NIGERIA NIGERIA’S anti-corruption commission has smashed a criminal syndicate of bankers specialising in forging signatures of deceased bank customers and stealing from their accounts. The syndicate allegedly executes fraudulent financial transactions, including unauthorised debits of depositors’ funds. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission arrested the suspects in the city of Uyo, the capital of the southern state of Akwa Ibom. They have been named as Akwa Akwa, Mbong Essien, Precious John, Kenneth Udoetuk and Ubong Udom. The suspects have appeared before Justice Archibong Archibong at the Akwa Ibom State High Court on a 23-count charge bordering on conspiracy, forgery, obtaining by false pretence and criminal conversion of depositors’ funds to the tune of N37,69 million (about R1,6 million). Their arrest follows a petition by 72 clients of Fidelity Bank of suspicious withdrawals from customers’ accounts, including deceased customers. The bank referred the matter to the commission. Investigations revealed Mbong used his position as head of operations, transaction service and delivery to establish the syndicate. Further investigations showed the defendants managed a fictitious fixed deposit account. They pleaded not guilty to the charges. The matter has been adjourned to June for hearing, while the defendants were remanded in the custody pending the hearing of their bail applications. – CAJ NEWS
