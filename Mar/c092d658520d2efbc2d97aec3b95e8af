MAMELODI Sundowns kept their hopes of a triple alive after toiling to another hard-fought victory over Highlands Park in Tembisa on Saturday night. Sundowns, who were dumped out of the CAF Champions League by Al Ahly of Egypt last week, are now in the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup. They won the Telkom Knockout and they are still in contention to win the league. Keletso Makgalwa scored Sundowns' solitary goal in extra time. Sundowns were visibly tired and having to go to extra time took its toll on the Sundowns team. Highlands, coached by Owen da Gama, gave a good account of themselves and really gave the PSL champions a difficult time. They created numerous scoring opportunities but luck was on the visitors, leaving Da Gama disappointed but not discouraged. Sundowns join Bidvest Wits and Baroka FC who have already booked their place in the Last 4. On Sunday, Bloemfontein Celtic will face TS Sporting to finalise the four teams in the semi-finals. Sundowns will now focus their attention on the big match league against Orlando Pirates on Tuesday.
