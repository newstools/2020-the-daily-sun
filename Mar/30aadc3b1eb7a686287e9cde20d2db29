Forget tissues, in Holland people filled up shops and even queued outside after coffee shop closures were announced due to the coronavirus. Weed smokers in Holland filled up coffee shops to stock up on their weed as they go into self-isolation. According to Daily Mail, staff set up separate lines for cash and cards as customers hurried to order supplies for what could be a weeks-long quarantine.  "For maybe for the next two months we're not able to get some weed, so it should be nice to at least have some in the house," one cannabis buyer in the Hague said. "My friend called me five minutes ago, he saw the press conference - good friend," the Dutch shopper called Jonathan said.Â The cannabis queues came despite Health Minister Bruno Bruins making an "urgent appeal" to Dutch people during Sunday's press conference, saying: "Do not hoard. It is not necessary."
