MEMBERS of the community came out in their numbers to witness the opening of the Unjani Clinic 1 on Tuesday. The private clinic, built in H section to help reduce overcrowding at health facilities in Botshabelo, outside Bloemfontein, provides affordable private healthcare. Network support operator Shaun Trom said: “Unjani is a development aimed at empowering black professional female nurses so that people are treated in their own language.” He said the clinic created permanent jobs and the time would come when it would need to employ more people to help reduce the workload. Clinic manager Elisa Konyama said the facility was part of the Unjani Clinic network. “There are people in Botshabelo who can afford a clinic but can’t afford a private hospital,” said Konyama. “The clinic provides affordable quality healthcare, whether people have medical aid or not.” Konyama said the clinic also accommodated pensioners. “It is time to take care of our lives and taking care of ourselves is important.” Ward 30 councillor for H and G sections Maureen Moopelo told Daily Sun government clinics were overburdened. “Sometimes we can’t assist all the people. This clinic is going to reduce the workload at our local clinics,” she said. Masabata Moletsane (65), a resident of H section, said residents were happy to have the clinic. “The clinic is going to change our lives. We used to travel long distances to check our blood pressure.”
