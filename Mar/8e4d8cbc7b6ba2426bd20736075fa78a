HE is a rapper, TV host and executive producer of Idols SA. This is why Proverb will not be going broke during this coronavirus pandemic. Although Idols auditions have been put on ice while the country continues to fight the coronavirus outbreak, it will not hit Proverb's pocket. Advising his Twitter followers to "diversify their portfolios", he wrote: "Times like these are a reminder to diversify your portfolio, to try and never rely on one source of income and to grow your passive income streams." Prince Kaybee was in agreement with Proverb, and responded by tweeting: "Lol. Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat and they called me arrogant, before they come for me let me go check on my other side hustle BECAUSE THIS ONE OF THE MASTERS GIGS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED."
