A man who
was worried that he had the novel coronavirus arrived at the Lakeside Fire
Station in Muizenberg, Cape Town on Monday, pleading for help. But it turned
out that he had an unrelated virus. Fire and
Rescue Services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said Covid-19 protocol kicked in
and a metro doctor was called in. The people
who examined him wore the appropriate clothing and he was managed as if it was
possible that he would test positive. Ukraine is
closing schools, kindergartens and universities and suspending flights to Italy
as part of measures to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. The government
said in a statement it was also banning all public events with more than 200... "It is
a serious matter," Carelse said on Thursday. Eventually,
it was established that he had a stomach virus. Carelse
said it was an isolated incident and that there were no other similar calls. Isolation
uni On
Wednesday, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde told reporters that the province had
its first positive case â€“ that of a man who returned from international travel
on Monday. He is in self-isolation. The Daily
Voice reported that he was from Muizenberg. Winde has
urged people who think they may test positive due to international travel, or
who have been in contact with people who have travelled internationally, to
first call the National Institute for Communicable Diseases' (NICD) hotline
instead of rushing to a medical facility. An
isolation unit is already operational at Tygerberg Hospital. The hotline
number is 0800 029 999 and the operators have a checklist of symptoms and
questions regarding travel. The number
of people who tested positive in South Africa increased to 17 on Thursday. SOURCE: NEWS24
