MULTI-GRAMMY Award winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s US tour has been suspended due to the coronavirus. The group members which recently lost founder Joseph Shabalala, are expected to arrive home on Thursday. They were on a three-month tour, which started in January and was scheduled to end next week. Group manager Xolani Majozi told Daily Sun the members would be screened before they could reunite with their families. “They had shows in several cities in the US but their lives are more important. We’re grateful they will be back home while no one has been infected,” he said. They are expected to perform at several events this year to celebrate the group’s 60th anniversary. “The Inanda Dam World Music Festival on 29 March will continue as planned, until we get new instructions from authorities about public gatherings,” he said.
