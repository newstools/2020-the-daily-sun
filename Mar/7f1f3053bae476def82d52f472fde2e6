THE decision
to renew his contract with Mamelodi Sundowns was a no-brainer for Hlompho Kekana. The midfield lynchpin agreed
a fresh four-year deal with the club on Thursday, which will keep him at the
Brazilians until 2024. “I renewed my contract simply
because I’m home here, I’m loved here,” says Kekana. “I have made beautiful memories
with the club. And I felt I should continue with the people I’ve been working
with since my first day here. They’ve been good to me, always kind to me. That’s
why I’m always free and happy to do business. “I’m happy because the
fans love me, I love the fans and I love the club. And that’s what made it easy
for me to sign renew contract.” The contract four-year extension
is a clear demonstration of the club’s commitment and loyalty to the 35-year-old,
who has served the team with distinction for nine years.
