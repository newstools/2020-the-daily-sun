POLITICAL parties and unions in KZN have urged the government to help South Africans protect themselves against the coronavirus. They said when President Cyril Ramaphosa told people to buy hand sanitisers and use masks, he’d forgotten most people were poor and couldn’t afford those things. Their comments came after the president declared a national state of disaster on Sunday night, revealing that 61 cases had been confirmed in Mzansi. EFF leader in KZN Vusi Khoza said the price of masks had jumped from R2 to R35. He said condoms are free, so masks and hand sanitisers should be free, too. “We also feel the country should be put on total shutdown.”  DA leader in KZN Zwakele Mncwango said there should be a budget for a national disaster. “At most shops, hand sanitisers are sold out, but many people can’t even afford to buy them. As the DA, we feel there should be a way for the government to assist people.” The IFP welcomed the president’s decision to declare a national state of disaster. However, the party said Ramaphosa didn’t properly address the impact these measures would have on the government’s ability to continue delivering services. The party said he didn’t address sanitation conditions in kasis and villages.  Nehawu spokesman Ayanda Zulu said the union was worried about workers. Zulu said they should be protected, especially those working with the sick.
