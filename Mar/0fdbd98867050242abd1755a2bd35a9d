A SCAMMED gogo dropped dead after failing to get R45 000 back from a woman claiming to be a business consultant. The scammer, whose identity is known to Daily Sun, is on the run after allegedly targeting pensioners from Kagiso, Mogale City. Georgina Kekana (62), who introduced her to friends, is worried about her cash and for dragging people into the mess. “My business partner died of a heart attack after trying to get her money back from this evil woman. Her family wants nothing to do with me,” she said.

She fooled me by taking me to look at potential businesses.” Georgina said the woman was very convincing and she asked her friends to join in. When she realised she was being taken for a ride, she tried to verify if she had been registered as a businesswoman, and which businesses were under her name. “To my shock, there was nothing under my name. I tried to get lawyers to help me. The lawyer was interested in helping me until this woman asked me for his contacts and he stopped taking my calls.” Georgina said she had not been paying for her house and had three days to move out.

Jim Dijwe (57), who shared a business, said they gave the woman R45 000 last year after she promised them a filling station in North West. “She said she’d get us funding and charged us R3 000 a meeting. She didn’t like me because I questioned her. She ran off with our money.” Captain Kay Makhubele said the complainants must take the woman to court. “As they gave her their money willingly, they should report it. The court will summon her so an agreement of payment is reached.”
