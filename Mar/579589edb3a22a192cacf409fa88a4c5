Nine people were left injured this
morning, one of them seriously, when a taxi crashed into the bakkie at the
Rhode and Harvey Road intersection in Oranjesig, Bloemfontein. ER24 paramedics, Provincial EMS and other services,
arrived on the scene at 07h20 to find the bakkie on its roof next to a traffic
light. "The taxi was found parked next to the bakkie and members of the public had already pulled several people
from the two vehicles," said ER24 in a statement. Medics assessed the patients and found that one woman had
sustained numerous injuries and was in a serious condition while eight other
people had sustained minor to moderate injuries. The patients were treated for their injuries and the
seriously injured woman provided pain-relief medication before they were
transported to Pelonomi Provincial Hospital for further care. Local authorities were on the scene for further care.
