RETIRED soccer player Brilliant Khuzwayo has failed his dead friend’s daughter. In January, he promised to take care of Senzo Meyiwa’s daughter Namhla (14) but he has not come through for her. Speaking to Daily Sun earlier this year, Namhla said life was difficult without her father. “I sometimes go to school without any food in my lunch box. My grandmother and uncle try but it sometimes becomes too difficult for them.” After the article was published, Brilliant came forward and told the SunTeam he would help Namhla. He asked her to draw up a list of things she needed for school. Speaking to the SunTeam this week in the presence of her gogo Ntombifuthi, Namhla said: “I was very happy when he asked me to draw up the list. I immediately made it and forwarded it to my uncle Sfiso. I asked for roll-up crayons, a pencil case, flip files, plastic covers, pens, sellotape and lead pencils. “The items were needed in the first week of February but I never received them. Fortunately, I received help from other Good Samaritans and bought the items.” The SunTeam was in constant contact with Brilliant to check if he was keeping his promises but he kept making excuses. Last month, he said he was on holiday. He later said Namhla’s list was not clear. On another occasion, he said he needed to meet with Namhla’s uncle Sfiso. Sfiso said he forwarded the list to Brilliant and the meeting he was speaking about had nothing to do with his promise. Ntombifuthi said they had really hoped Brilliant would help Namhla. “People saw a good side of him and he was praised all over but in reality, he raised our hopes for nothing,” she said. Daily Sun tried numerous times to call Brilliant but his phone rang unanswered, and he had not responded to text messages by the time of going to print.
