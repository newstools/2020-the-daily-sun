HE THOUGHT he was being funny when he wore the full defence force uniform. He even showed how he’d deal with those who don’t abide by lockdown rules. In the video he then punches a punching bag and even kicks it. And it now seems Bloemfontein Celtic player Tebogo Potsane is in hot water after his video went viral on social media. According to Celtic spokesman Sello Nduna, the video was recorded on Thurday. He said it was recorded while Potsane was visiting a friend. “He was in a playful mood and the video went viral. He was not aware he was committing a crime,” said Nduna. But law enforcement did not find the video funny at all. Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the matter was handled by the military police as it involved the SANDF. Defence force spokesman Colonel Ronald Maseko said Potsane was bust and released on warning to appear in court. “SANDF can confirm that a suspect from the Free State was arrested by military police officials at his place of residence in Turflaagte. The arrest follows a social media video showing the individual illegally wearing full military combat regalia without authorisation.” He said Potsane was arrested in the presence of his family and charged with the illegal wearing of military uniform and impersonating a soldier. “Subsequent to his arrest and in consultation with the court, the suspect was released on a court warning to allow for further investigation,” he said. “Upon investigation, it was found that the uniform belongs to a Reserve Force member based at 3 Para Battalion. The Reserve Force member alleges that the uniform was left in the suspect’s car since they are friends. The Reserve Force member has since faced an internal disciplinary hearing at his unit.” When asked if the team would discipline the player, Nduna said: “We have not met as a team because of the 21-day lockdown. But we won’t leave it and want to assist our players. We will only go back and meet after the lockdown.”
