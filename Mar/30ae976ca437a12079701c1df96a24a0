Our drains are one of the most hard working things in our houses and all the mess that we are disposing passes through them, which might lead to a stinky smell sometimes. This smell is one of the most irritating things, whether from the kitchen or bathroom, because it doesn't matter if the space is clean or not. The smell is caused by mould that builds up because food scraps remain in the drain and when it is hot or raining heavily outside, the drain can quickly emit an unpleasant odor. Fortunately, you can use the products that already in your house to combat the smell. To make the remedy for those bad smells, use the following products:- 100 grams of baking soda - 1 cup of white wine vinegar - Half a liter of hot water Bring the water to a boil, add the white wine vinegar as soon as it boils, and mix well. Then sprinkle the baking soda in the relevant drain and pour the vinegar mixture into it. The drain is going to fizz, but don’t be shocked by this. This is the intention! Cover the drain for about an hour and then flush it with water. You will then notice that all bad odors have disappeared!
