FORMER Proteas skipper Graeme Smith look set to commit his long-term future to South African cricket. The Cricket South Africa (CSA) acting director of cricket is currently on a three-month deal but the association have indicated they will be tying him down to a long term agreement. ”We are in final negotiations and we are hoping to make an announcement next week,” acting CSA chief executive officer Jacques Faul said in a video media conference yesterday. “There are other factors to be taken into consideration. But we are at an advanced stage and hopefully we can make an announcement next week.” Smith, who joined CSA in December, explained he had been in the position for a short period of time to assess his performance. But he pointed out some positives as well as the challenges. “Some aspects have been good others in last two months from the commercial side to the teams performing well on the field,” said Smith. “This includes the women’s team and the under 19 side. “We are going into the new financial year and obviously there will be some changes. "I hope we are able to take a strong team in the 2020 T20 World Cup, and also have an idea who are our 40 players are to take the Proteas to the future.” Smith added the coronavirus outbreak was having an impact on the plans for the teams. The Proteas returned from India without playing any of their three ODI matches due to cancellations last month, and are scheduled to travel to Sri Lanka in June. But it looks highly unlikely the team will make the four for three three planned three One-Day internationals and the three T20 matches against Sri Lanka. Faul would not predict when cricket will resume.
