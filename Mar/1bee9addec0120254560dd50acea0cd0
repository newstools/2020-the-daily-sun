Zoleka Mandela has revealed that she has left the father of her two kids, Thierry Bashala whom she affectionately called Mr Bashala. She said in an Instagram post: "Leaving someone you once loved, for eight long years feels like it completely unhinges your entire life until you realise that it’s sparked self discovery, inner peace and has set you on a path of self love. It’s taken me two years to leave a relationship that no longer serves me, one that has eroded (for far too many years) my self esteem, independence, my mental and emotional state. "Over the years, I’ve continued to fall in habit and have tied my sense of worth to things outside of me and placed it in the hands of others. Leaving someone you once loved, reaffirms your strengths, it leaves you feeling more liberated and forces you to look into yourself and to move on even when you’re more comfortable staying in a relationship that (for the worst part) leaves you feeling invisible and undervalued ... because you have a fear of abandonment and a fear of being alone. "I have left someone that I once loved for eight whole years, to live a life that is more true to me, to shift the power back from the relationship I have long left, back to me. I have left someone that I once loved for eight whole years, because I need to learn to be alone, to work on myself harder than any other relationship, to recognise and accept my weaknesses, to forgive myself and to finally celebrate my FREEDOM. #ZolekaGotHerGrooveBack #ZolekaMandela #NeverTooLateToRewriteYourLifeStory Leaving someone you once loved, for eight long years feels like it completely unhinges your entire life until you realize that it’s sparked self discovery, inner peace and has set you on a path of self love.
