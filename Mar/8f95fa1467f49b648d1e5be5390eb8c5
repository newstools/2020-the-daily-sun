THEY cannot transport the dead to their final resting place. They sometimes have to carry coffins to the cemetery themselves as hearses cannot travel on the damaged road. Residents eventually fixed the road themselves, saying the dead won’t rest in peace. Itsoseng residents near Hebron in North West said they’ve been fixing the road leading to the cemetery for over 20 years. But the damage worsened in the past three years. Marble Molefe (50) told Daily Sun: “The road has potholes and overgrown grass. Cars can’t pass through and this affects us when a resident has to be buried.” Marble said residents carried stones and soil to fill the holes on Saturday, and also cleaned the bushy area. Another resident, Sunday Sithole (62), said residents volunteered to fix the road on many occasions, but it didn’t help as it was badly damaged. “We need help to fix the road as no one is helping us fill the potholes,” he said. He said the councillor did not take their grievances seriously. Baroka Funerals marketing manager, Khutsi Malala, said: “Our cars get damaged and sometimes cars wait at least an hour. “Residents are doing a good thing by fixing the road. “We can help them if they approach our office.” Councillor Oupa Marapyane said: “We will fix the road when the rain stops.”
