SUPERSPORT UNITED are stalling on renewing their head coach Kaitano Tembo’s contract, which is set to expire at the end of the season. The Zimbabwean-born coach’stwo-year contract is nearing its end. But he is yet to receive an indication of whether his stay will be extended or not. The three-time league winners are waiting to see where the club will finish at the end of the season before they make their final decision. Matsatsantsa a Pitori are fourth on the log table with 40 points from 23 games. They are likely to finish in fifth place after playing their remaining league matches. Tembo has already helped them to win silverware by bagging the MTN8 trophy earlier this season. The Tshwane-based giants have been blowing hot and cold in the league. They seem to have recovered from their recent bad patch where they had gone four games without a win. And their back-to-back identical 2-0 league wins against Bidvest Wits and Highlands Park, have eased the pressure on Tembo. When asked why it’s taking too long to decide on the fate of the coach,no-nonsense CEO Stan Matthews said the club are not in a hurry to make a decision. Said Matthews: “I don’t understand what the fuss is all about when it comes to Tembo’s contract. “His future is guaranteed at the club, whether as a coach or in a different capacity. “So, what’s the rush for?”
