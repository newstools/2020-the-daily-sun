SHE was sleeping on the couch when her brother snuck up on her. Seeing that she was fast asleep, the 26-year-old allegedly raped her. He’s now behind bars. But angry residents of Slovo Park in Springs are baying for his blood. “How can you rape your own sister? He must not come here because we’re going to teach him a lesson. We can’t be harbouring rapists in our kasi,” said Jan Mukansi (40). Another resident, Paulina Moremi (45), said: “It’s sad that men continue to rape women despite gender-based violence campaigns.” The girl (14) is undergoing counselling. She told police she was sleeping on the couch when her older brother returned home from a tavern last Wednesday. “He tried to wake her up, but she didn’t. The suspect then went to the kitchen, where he prepared food for himself,” said police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo. He said the suspect wen’t to his car to eat and allegedly returned to rape the girl. “He blocked her mouth with his hand. After the incident, she screamed to attract her younger brother’s (12) attention.” The younger brother was sleeping in the outside room. “As he approached the house, the door was open and the girl told him she had been raped by their older brother. While they were standing there, the suspect came from the back of the house, wearing only a shirt.” They called the cops and the suspect was bust.
