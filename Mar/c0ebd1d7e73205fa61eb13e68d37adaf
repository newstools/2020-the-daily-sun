A truck smashed into multiple cars stopped at a checkpoint on a large Cairo road on Wednesday, killing 15 people. The incident happened just a few hours after a night time curfew took effect in Egypt to curb the spread of the coronavirus. A dozen people were reported injured. Under the curfew, public transport shuts down after 7pm and people are forbidden from the streets unless they have an exemption. The health ministry reported more than 50 new infections on Wednesday, bringing the case total to 456, including 22 fatalities. â€“ NEWS24
