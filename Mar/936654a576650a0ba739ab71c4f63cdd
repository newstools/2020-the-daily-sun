A suspected burglar in Kimberley, Northern Cape made a wrong choice when he tried to break into a house on Tuesday. He was caught by two dogs (Rottweiler) in the yard and bitten while neighbours and passer-by’s watched on. The owner of the house, who didn’t open a case, said the tsotsi deserved what happened to him. A video of the burglar was recorded by a passer-by who noticed him trying to fight off two dogs that got him pinned to the ground and tearing his arm, bum and legs. In the video the witness recording can be heard asking the thug what he was doing in the property. “We were walking by and saw the thug on the ground being bitten by the dogs,” said witness Tshepo Boom. He said, “I believe the man was trying to break into the house but didn’t realise there were two dogs on guard. I immediately started recording the video as there was nothing I could do to help him. Everybody in the neighbourhood knows not to enter that yard when the owner is not around. I alerted other neighbours to call the owner who was at work. The thug was lucky as the owner was just around the corner. I believe he learned his lesson,” The owner of the two dogs who didn’t want to be named said, “The thug got what he deserved. It is clear he was trying to break into my house. “He jumped over the gate and walked around the house before he met with my two dogs, ‘Rover and France’. He is lucky that I came to his rescue before the dogs did too much damage on him.”
