 Bad news Fast and Furious fans. The ninth instalment of the
popular racing movie has been delayed until April 2021. It's delay, as well as a number of other movies scheduled
for release this year, is due to the spread of the coronavirus and preventative
safety measures taken to reduce social gatherings much like President Cyril
Ramaphosa's announcement of a SA lockdown on Monday night (March 23). Putting the brakes on There is no point in releasing a movie if no one is going to
watch it and it makes for a wise move even if fans are anxious to see John Cena
and Vin Diesel go at each other. Others not so much bothered about the movie will be relieved
that they don't have to sit through unrealistic flying car scenes for another
year at least. It won't be ending with F9 though, as there are plans for a
tenth and final movie also in the works. The Fast saga has so far been lucrative to Universal
Studios, raking in more than $5-billion around the world. The latest instalment
would no doubt push that number up significantly. If you really want to appease your Fast and Furious
appetite, and you're not too bothered about animation, then why not watch Fast
& Furious: Spy Racers on Netflix.  SOURCE: WHEELS24
