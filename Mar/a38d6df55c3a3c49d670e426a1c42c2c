STREET vendors will be affected the most by the lockdown. Some of them still have piles of stock, which would most likely go to waste during the 21-day lockdown. But Ska Bhora Moreki hitmaker King Monada became a real moreki on Wednesday after spending R20 000 on buying from vendors in Tzaneen, Limpopo. King Monada and his manager Albert Makwela arrived in two cars to buy their stock to give to their fans. Makwela told Daily Sun when they heard about the lockdown, they thought about people who sold tomatoes and onions to put food on the table for their kids. “We had to go and support them as we know their pain. Our parents also sold things to raise us,” said Makwela.  But King Monada and Makwela had to leave early as vendors and fans approached them in large numbers. “The situation was becoming dangerous for everyone. We were also adhering to the new regulation of a gathering of no more than 100 people,” said Makwela. Trader Johanna Maluleke (49) said she was thankful King Monada bought all her stock worth R950.
