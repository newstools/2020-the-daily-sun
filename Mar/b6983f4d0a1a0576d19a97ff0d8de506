Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane feels Chippa United is the perfect club for Rulani Mokwena to show that he belongs to manage in the top-flight of South Africa football. Mokwena had an unsuccessful spell as Orlando Pirates interim coach this season before he was replaced by Josef Zinnbauer on a permanent basis. After Norman Mapeza abruptly resigned as Chilli Boys coach this week, Mokwena has now been roped in for the rest of the campaign. Mokwena started his professional career as an assistant coach to Mosimane and the two remain close. Mosimane told reporters: "Rhulani is a hard worker and he will take all the footages of Chippa from the past few games. "He has already asked me about how we played against Chippa. "He has already worked on my game against Chippa when we played here, and we won 3-0. "Can you believe that? It shows that he really wants it and I wish him all the best." Mosimane compared Mokwena's situation to the time he took over as SuperSport United head coach in 2001 and then when he moved to Sundowns and had to help the Tshwane club climb the PSL table. The Sundowns mentor continued: "It reminds me of when I came to Sundowns and my job was to just move the team from 15th place and we ended on number nine with no Top 8 and we said let's see the following year. "Chippa is the right space for him to start. When I joined SuperSport United, they were also 15th on the log table. "People can say whatever, but I have earned my stripes. I was down there and worked myself up." Mokwena's first game in charge of Chippa will be against Bidvest Wits on Saturday. - TEAMtalk media
