THEOPHELUS “Bunny” Manzini from Pretoria is crazy about his Suzuki Hayabusa 1340, 2011 model. Q: Is it your first bike? A: No, it’s my ninth. Q: Is anyone allowed to ride it? A: No ways! My baby is still new and I don’t see myself sharing her with anyone. She’s like my girlfriend. I love her so much. Q: Have you gone on long-distance trips yet? A: Yes, I’ve just returned from Kuruman, in the Northern Cape and I’ll be heading to Mthatha in the Eastern Cape soon. Q: Is this your dream bike? A: To be honest, she’s not my dream bike. But it doesn’t mean I don’t love her. Q: How often do you ride? A: I always ride, but on weekends you’ll definitely find me riding my bike. Q: When did you start riding? A: I started riding in 2003 and consider myself a veteran. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I hardly get a fine. Q: How many bikes do you own? A: At the moment I own three and all my bikes are superbikes. I think I also need a cruiser bike. Q: Take us back to when you first rode a bike, how difficult was it? A: I remember going straight from my house into my neighbour’s fence. People came in numbers to see what had happened. The problem was that I never took bike lessons before I bought my bike. I just decided to teach myself how to ride and it went all wrong. Q: Tell us about your outfit? A: I have leather protective riding clothes that I always wear when I ride my bike. It’s important to safeguard myself. Q: Do you belong to a bike club? A: Yes, it’s called the Parias Locos MCC. It’s based in Secunda, Mpumalanga but we have members all over Joburg and Pretoria. I’m the president of my club.
