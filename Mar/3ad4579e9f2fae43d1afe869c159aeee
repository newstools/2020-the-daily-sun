MADALA Rector Mogakane from Allandale, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, escaped death when the walls of his pit toilet collapsed on him. The wheelchair-bound 63-year-old was rescued by his wife Magareth Phasha (62) and passersby. Magareth said she was doing laundry when the incident happened on Thursday. “I was busy in the backyard when I heard a loud bang coming from the direction of the pit toilet,” she said. “The wall suddenly collapsed on my husband and I thought the bricks would bury him alive. She had tried to pull him out and remove the rubble, but he was screaming helplessly. Magareth said: “Luckily, workers who were passing by came running and helped me pull him out and rush him to Mapulaneng Hospital.” The madala was treated for head injuries. She said the family of five had been using the crumbling toilet for more than 20 years. “I’m glad my husband is recovering from the injuries, but we do need a new toilet,” said Magareth. African Federal Convention organiser in Mpumalanga, Dennis Malope, said: “They’re poor and have no breadwinner. “We’re glad that madala’s life was spared.” Bushbuckridge municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi was, however, not aware of the matter. Said Mnisi: “We will send human settlements department officials to the family to see how they may be assisted.”
