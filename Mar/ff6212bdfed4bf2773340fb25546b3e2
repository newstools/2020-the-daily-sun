SOCIALITE and publicist Lerato Sengadi says the advice people are getting about coronavirus is not accurate. After a recent trip to Europe and Kenya, Lerato spoke about the experience on Twitter. She said she reached out to the government hotline, but didn’t get any help. She said a message has been circulating telling people with symptoms to call the hotline so someone could be sent to test them. “I felt a bit sickly after coming back from a trip to Europe and Kenya a week or two ago and called the hotline. I was asked for my details and trip details. I expected someone to be sent, but this never happened. “I was told to go and see a doctor.” She said she paid R1 500 for the test and was relieved it came back negative. “They said it’s free but it’s not,” said Lerato, who’s the widow of Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo. According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, people should only get tested if they have symptoms, been in contact with an infected person or travelled to a high risk country. The message circulating reads: “Please use this hotline if you display any signs of the virus. Don’t go to your doctor and infect him and everybody in the waiting room. By calling the hotline, someone will come to you to have you tested for the virus.” Daily Sun sent a screenshot of the message Lerato was talking about to the NICD. Organisation spokeswoman Sinenhlanhla Jimoh said: “Please note that although the number is correct, the attached communication is not from NICD. “The information is fake. Yes, patients should contact a healthcare provider or our hotline to alert the facility so that precautionary measures can be taken before they come into the facility.”
