Afro-house singer Winnie Khumalo is back with a new single titled Phezulu. It's a motivational song produced by  Melusi “Melchisa” Msimang, who co-wrote DJ Zinhle's popular song Umlilo, and was  written for all single mums who’ve been through a lot raising their children by themselves. “I wrote Phezulu as motivation to all the single mothers going through a hard time raising their kids. No matter the challenges of life, if I could do it, so can you. In my darkest time I drew strength from God because that’s where my help came from," said Winnie. The song's beat and energy will also allow men to join in and shake things up in their lives. Phezulu is a house song, a genre Winnie has been commanding for years. The new single is from Winnie’s upcoming album set to be released later this year under her independent record label Winnkay Music Records, with artists such as her daughter Rethabile Khumalo, as well as Shuga and King Groove. Winnie also revealed she has left Kalawa Jazmee Records, her musical home for many years.
