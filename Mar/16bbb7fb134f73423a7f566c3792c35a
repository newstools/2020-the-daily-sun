SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter is desperate to hang on to his captain Lebohang “Cheeseboy” Mokoena beyond this season. The former Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder is considering hanging up his boots at the end of the season. The 33-year-old has been one of Swallows’ best players this season as they look to return to the top-flight next season. Mokoena’s experience in a relatively young Dube Birds outfit has been invaluable, said Truter. This is why the former Richards Bay mentor will do anything he can to convince Mokoena to keep playing beyond the current campaign. “I remember coming here and Cheese (Mokoena) told me that he is thinking of hanging up his boots at the end of the season,” said Truter. “I’m still trying to convince him to keep playing beyond this season. I think he is now enjoying his football again. I don’t think he will retire. His experience, input and role in the team are invaluable. “I value him along with the other senior players such as Vuyo (Mere) and Virgil (Vries), who have been there and done it at the highest level. Their roles are crucial. I wouldn’t like to lose them for the next season. They are all important figures in the dressing room.” Truter believes Mokoena and other experienced players in the team will play a key role in final stretch of the season. The Birds are hot on the heels of GladAfrica Championship leaders Ajax Cape Town in the race for automatic promotion to the land of milk and honey. Swallows are second in the Championship standings, seven points behind the table-topping Ajax Cape Town with six matches to go. Truter has vowed that his side will push the Mother City outfit until the end of the season. “They are seven points ahead of us at the moment, but a lot can still happen. We still have to play them in Cape Town. They still have to play some of the top five teams as well. There are six games left and 18 points to fight for, anything can still happen.”
