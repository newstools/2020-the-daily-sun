HOME Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the department had no option but to send refugees causing chaos back home. For the past six months, refugees have been camping out on the street, demanding to be taken overseas as they’re victims of xenophobia in Mzansi. Motsoaledi yesterday told parliament’s Home Affairs portfolio committee that many of the refugees taken off the streets in Tshwane last year went back to the communities they came from. However, the group in Cape Town continued saying they wanted to be taken overseas.

This is not our choice,” he said. “We are ready to welcome refugees here, we are prepared to integrate them into communities. The countries they want to go to are not ready to welcome them. Namibia has put that in writing.” UDM MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa said the minister needed to put his foot down. READ: MEET THE 2ND PERSON TO BE CURED OF HIV!

Committee chairman Bongani Bongo gave the department a month to act and report back.
