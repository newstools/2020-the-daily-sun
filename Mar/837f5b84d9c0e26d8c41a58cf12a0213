WORKERS who contract the coronavirus at work are entitled to special leave and can claim for lost income from the UIF. This was agreed at a special meeting held by the National Economic Development and Labour Council yesterday. The meeting was attended by government representatives, employers and trade unions. “It was acknowledged that many economic sectors and especially small and medium enterprises will be severely affected by the epidemic, and that workers should not be punished with a reduction of income due to factors outside of their control,” the council said. “The meeting recognised there were areas that needed more attention with the most pressing being ways to contain the epidemic spreading through public transport and the impact of school closures on feeding schemes.”  The council said employers and unions agreed to work together to manage issues such as shift work, changing working areas and lunch breaks. It was also acknowledged that working from home was possible in many cases. The council committed itself to stepping up public health campaigns, and to finding ways to improve hygiene and slow the spread of the virus. The importance of tracing contacts and testing to identify people who have contracted the virus was also discussed.
