ZULU King Goodwill Zwelithini wants to meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask him to cancel the new sex education curriculum expected to be taught at schools. Speaking at the official opening of the KZN legislature at the Pietermaritzburg Royal Showground yesterday, the king said he would make a presentation to Ramaphosa. He urged all parents and civic organisations to accompany him when he met with the president to show their disapproval of the comprehensive sexuality education programme.  The clearly emotional king said he was shocked that the government had failed to consult with him or parents about the subject before approving it. He said it needed to be cancelled because talking to kids about sex was the responsibility of parents. “As custodian of culture, I find it disturbing that while I’m discouraging young girls from engaging in sex through the Reed Dance, the government is doing the opposite by teaching our daughters how to engage in sex,” he said. “I want to warn the government that this will encourage sexual engagements among kids at schools because they want to experiment with what they have been taught in theory.”  The king said in terms of his culture, it had always been the duty of parents to talk to their daughters about sex when they reached puberty. In his response, Premier Sihle Zikalala said he would pass the king’s message to the national government. The king also lashed out at the government for cancelling SAA flights to Durban, saying it would harm the province’s economy.
