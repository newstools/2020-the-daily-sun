PARENTS were shocked on Thursday when disaster struck. Royden Plaatjies (9), the eldest son of Raldo Bell (38) and Sharon Plaatjies (26), was electrocuted. A trust owns the land in Fernwood Park, Nelson Mandela Bay, and many people use izinyoka. Royden’s friend Maxwell Thana (14) told Daily Sun: “His brothers thought he was playing but his eyes became huge and he was shaking. “My stepdad helped him sit against a fence. He’d been shocked while playing with a ball, but a live wire touched the fence.” Raldo said: “For 15 years I’ve never wanted izinyoka connections. I chose wood fires to protect my kids.” Sharon said: “He’d be alive if the municipality had given people electricity.” Spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We’re sad a child lost his life. Condolences to the family.”
