AmaZulu have received an injury boost going into their final push for Absa Premiership survival with the return to fitness of attacking midfielder Charlie Hlalele and striker Andre de Jong. The pair have been sidelined for nine and four months respectively, but will be able to return once the seasons resumes following the suspension due to the coronavirus outbreak. Hlalele has not featured at all this term after suffering a tendon injury in the weeks leading up to the start of the 2019/20 campaign. “I am very happy to be back in training, it’s been nine months since I last played any football, which was really frustrating for me,” he told his club’s website. “I am really thankful for the help that I have been getting form the team, I can’t wait to compete for a spot in the starting line up as well and help the team.” New Zealand striker De Jong suffered a foot fracture during the international break in November, but is now also ready to return. “It feels really good to be back among the boys, it was about 15 weeks being out of action, it’s been a bit of a frustration, but I’m really pleased with my progress nonetheless,” he said. -SuperSport.com
