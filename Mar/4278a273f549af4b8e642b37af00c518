KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi has pleaded with the Amakhosi faithful to “stop supporting individuals” and throw their weight behind the entire team. The Nigerian stopper has been involved in a battle with teammate Itumeleng Khune for the number one jersey. Akpeyi has been the first-choice keeper for Chiefs this season but Khune has also been relentless in his push to regain his position. And when Akpeyi made a costly error leading to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Maritzburg United a few weeks ago, fans were quick to call for him to be dropped. That is despite all his heroics earlier in the season.But Akpeyi reminded Chiefs fans of his quality in the Soweto derby on Saturday. He made a number of vital saves and was named the man of the match. “I want to share this award with my coaches, because since day one they are the ones that actually believed in me following what happened two weeks ago," Akpeyi told SuperSport TV after the match. "When these people (Supporters) turned against me but they stood by my side and believed in me and we as a team we have it at the back of our minds that we're the only ones on the field, it's only when it's good you get the support but when it's not good you get turned down. "And that is why I had to play with that mindset coming here today to be here at this point, I'm only fortunate to be at the right place, at the right time for this game and I hope it continues going well like that. "I want to say this again, every supporter should support the entire team not the individual because that's the problem I think we have and I told everyone that's supporting me stop tugging me against my reserve goalkeeper or Khune rather because as far as I'm concerned he's a legend and he's still number one. "I'm just fortunate to play as always, so let's support the entire team and not the individual.”
