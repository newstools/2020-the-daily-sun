Mamelodi Sundowns will have to do without striker Mauricio Affonso for the remainder of the Premier Soccer League season as coach Pitso Mosimane reveals they have already lined up new signings for next season. Affonso has had surgery on his groin and is not expected to be back in action this campaign, a blow for the club in the run-in to the Absa Premiership title race, and their quest to lift the Nedbank Cup. Affonso has been mostly out the team through injury since his arrival, but when the Uruguayan has always impressed when he played in his six goals appearances, scoring seven starts in all competitions.  But Mosimane is also already looking ahead to next season following the side’s ousting from the CAF Champions League quarter-finals at the hands of Al Ahly at the weekend. "We have made new signings, just that you don't know, we don't say," Mosimane told reporters. "We have made signings that I have recommended and the club has gone with them. So we have strengthened the team for next year. "We have two more. We have three players already signed. But we can't talk. That will be a better team in next year's Champions League.” Ajax Cape Town midfielder Grant Margeman and Black Leopards playmaker Lesedi Kapinga are two players strongly linked with The Brazilians.
