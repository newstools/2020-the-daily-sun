THOKO Sibuyi has been trying to get Eskom to remove poles from her yard for 15 years. The 57-year-old from Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said the poles were making it impossible to extend her house.  Thoko said a contractor from the power utility came in 2005 and connected electricity lines to section C of the kasi. The workers erected power lines with supporting poles cutting through her yard. “I told the contractor and Eskom officials about the problem, but they said there was nothing they could do. “I raised the matter with councillors, who talked to Eskom. Nothing was done. “I can’t extend my house for my three kids because of these supporting poles. “To make matters worse, I constantly keep an eye on my two grandchildren.” Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said: “We’ve investigated the matter and a decision has been taken to remove the poles. We regret the inconvenience caused to the family.”
