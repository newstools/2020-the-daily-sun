BANYANA Banyana vice-captain Refiloe Jane, who currently plies her trade in Italy, the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus, has revealed that she is “fine, healthy and keeping fit.” Jane, who plays for Italian giant’s AC Milan, is doing her best to stay safe, healthy and in good shape in a country that has been ravaged by the deadly virus. “To all those who have been worried about my well-being here in Italy, I just want to let you know that I’m fine, I’m healthy and I'm keeping fit,” Jane said. “I’m doing everything I have been told to do because it is very important to follow the instructions of the authorities. They know best.” She also urged South Africans to ensure that they follow the advice and instruction of authorities as the battle to contain the coronavirus continues. In an attempt to try and stop the spread of the deadly virus which has threatened to bring the country to its knees, the South African government imposed a national shutdown for 21 days. This is similar to what the Italian government has had to do. Italy is currently under national quarantine, restricting the movement of the population except for necessity, work, and health circumstances. Jane insists that it is important to heed the advice given by authorities and to take all safety measure to save lives. “This is to urge all South Africans to please follow instruction from the authorities, they know best," she added. "Let us all try and do our part in following the instruction. Let us all practice good hygiene and wash our hands regularly, use sanitizers where possible. "During the lockdown, let us all stay at home and only go out for essential services. Let us all do what we can to flatten the curve and stop the spread of the virus.”
