MEN have come out to condemn gender-based violence, saying it didn’t only affect women. “Women who abuse men should also face the full might of the law,” said Noordgesig Gender-based Violence Organisation spokesman, Thulani Dlamini. This came after Daily Sun published a story on Monday about Mlungisi Nzimande (39) from Noordgesig near Soweto, who was beaten up by his girlfriend. Mlungisi’s girlfriend of four years, Snenhlanhla Hadebe (26), didn’t deny she had beaten him. She said he had cheated on her with a woman she knew, which showed he didn’t respect her. Thulani said Snenhlanhla had no right to beat Mlungisi. “Violence is never an option. Whether it comes from a man or woman. We condemn it. We call on women to stop using violence on men.” He said they’d visit the couple and try to talk to them. More men told Daily Sun they had also been victims of violence. “But we don’t know who to turn to because when we go to cops, they laugh,” said Victor Mbele (30) from Vooslorus, Ekurhuleni. He said he was being beaten every now and then by his girlfriend. “I don’t even go to the cops and I can’t retaliate because I’ll be arrested.” said Victor. Mdu Hadebe (38) from Kagiso in Mogale City said: “Being beaten is my daily bread and there is no law that protects me.” Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of assault was opened at Orlando Police Station and was being investigated.
