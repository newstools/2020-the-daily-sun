It has been barely a week since the premiere of the cutting-edge Netflix series Queen Sono and people are already pirating it. After the show's lead character Pearl Thusi announced the drama series is currently sitting on number one in Kenya and South Africa, a tweep replied and said he's going to download the series online. Replying to the tweet, Pearl pleaded with the fan not to pirate the series as the success of the show will pave the way for other shows that will come out of Africa on Netflix. Soon after Pearl's response, DJ and music producer Shimza jumped into the conversation and said, “this is the support.” And further wrote that people do not pirate just because they cannot afford, they do it because it is free.
