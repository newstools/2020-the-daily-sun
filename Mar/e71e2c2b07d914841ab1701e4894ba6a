Scientists in London will pay volunteers to be infected
in experiments to develop a vaccine for the deadly virus. Volunteers could be paid £3,500 (R79 000) to be infected
with the coronavirus as scientists race to find a vaccine. The Queen Mary BioEnterprises Innovation Centre, London,
is recruiting 24 people for the study. They will be injected with two weaker strains of the
deadly virus – which has killed more than 3,800 people worldwide – giving them
similar respiratory symptoms. A jab developed by the company Hvivo will then be tested.
Patients will remain in quarantine for two weeks to see if it is successful. Some 35 other vaccines are in development, and the UK
government has promised an extra £46million in the fight against coronavirus. However, experts have said a vaccine is unlikely to be
approved in time to halt the current epidemic, which has so far seen more than
110,000 people across the globe fall ill with COVID-19.
