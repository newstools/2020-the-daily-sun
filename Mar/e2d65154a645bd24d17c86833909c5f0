Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has revealed the secret to getting the best out of Kaizer Chiefs striker Khama Billiat. Mosimane signed Billiat from Ajax Cape Town as a fresh-faced 22-year-old and the Zimbabwean went on to become one of the most if not the most important member of the Brazilians' squad. Billiat has been unable to replicate the form at Chiefs that saw him nominated as the CAF African Player of the Year award in 2016 - the year in which he helped 'Downs win the CAF Champions League. And Mosimane believes that he is largely responsible for the player that Billiat has become and gave some insight in to how to get the most product out of the tricky winger. "Khama played different football [at Sundowns]. Khama is totally different. It's unbelievable - every week I am watching [him]. You must know that I took this boy as a 22-year-old from Ajax Cape Town. "They were flirting with relegation and I told him that he's the greatest player Zimbabwe has ever produced and would be a big player for Sundowns. I sold him the vision and look what happened when Khama was on the pitch," Mosimane told SAFM. "He is a totally different player and you've got to know how to deal with him, soft and he also likes to be told he's a star." -TeamTalkMedia
