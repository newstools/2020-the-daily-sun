A prisoner said: “We don’t have anything to help us protect ourselves from the coronavirus. We are not safe at all. “What the department has been saying to the media is not true because we have not been screened,” he said. He said they wanted the department to test them and ensure they were safe. “We share cells with people who have different diseases, but we don’t have hand sanitisers and soaps to wash our hands. It will be easy for us to contract this virus,” he said. He told Daily Sun they asked management to set up a meeting with the area commissioner, but were denied. Ehlanzeni region correctional centre spokesman Messiah Hlungwani said the issue was not about the coronavirus, but managing the issue of free movement within the centre. Hlungwani said the movement of offenders in the centre was not controlled. READ: 64 FOUND DEAD IN A CONTAINER! “Offenders were moving from one unit to the other with no supervision. In mitigating the security threats, officials were instructed to lock the gates so that movement can be controlled. Offenders were not happy with the decision, consequently they threatened to strike,” he said. Hlungwani said with the issue of Covid-19, the department has put all systems in place.“We have sanitisers in all the units, even those who are working in the kitchen have full protective gear. When they go out, they use the disinfectants. Same applies when they come back,” he said. Hlungwani said the situation was under control.
