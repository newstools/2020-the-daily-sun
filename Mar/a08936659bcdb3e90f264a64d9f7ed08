THE City of Cape Town will seek relief from the courts in a bid to deal with the refugee crisis. On Sunday, the city removed a group of about 200 refugees from Greenmarket Square, where they had been camping for four months. The removal came after a court order was issued giving the municipality permission to enforce by-laws and stop refugees from dirtying the streets. Safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith yesterday announced the municipality would take the police to court for refusing to arrest the refugees. On Monday, Metro cops handed a group of refugees to the cop shop, but police refused to arrest them. “The police declined to detain the people,” he said. “When the original eviction order was issued in October, they arrested more than 100 people but within an hour they had released them.” Among the reasons police refused to arrest the refugees was that there were kids among them. Smith said the city had been trying to reintegrate the refugees into communities and provide them with night shelters. He said the municipality had secured at least 170 bed spaces. “It’s not possible for us to offer alternative accommodation, but we’ll assist as much as possible to find temporary shelter and reintegrate people into communities where they were living before,” he said.
