GAUTENG Premier David Makhura told church leaders in Tshwane the provincial government would intervene in any municipality where residents were suffering because of poor service delivery. Addressing interfaith leaders at Sammy Marks Square on Tuesday, he outlined the efforts to restore service delivery and stabilise governance in Tshwane. “Good governance has collapsed,” he said. “The supply of clean drinking water is severely compromised and refuse collection is at its worst.” The premier said as pastors they were the leaders in their communities. He asked church leaders to be patient. “We never had such big rats in Atteridgeville and other places around Tshwane. “These rats came from Alexandra in Joburg looking for rubbish,” he said. Makhura said rubbish had not been removed in Laudium for some time and water had been cut off. Makhura said people of Hammanskraal needed clean water. “I’ve been everywhere in Tshwane and housing is a very big problem,” he said “I don’t want to talk about political parties. The provincial government wants municipalities to correct their mistakes.” Makhura said the provincial government would bring a team of administrators to Tshwane that would clean the city within 90 days. “I know there are bush pastors who make people do bad things, and that there are also bush lawyers,” he said “Religious leaders of Tshwane, you are the custodians of the truth and you are the people of truth.” Church leaders told the premier title deeds for churches were still outstanding and that they were struggling to get Bible schools accredited. Pastor Johannes Tshabalala of the Apostolic Faith Mission New Life said: “We have a tent for our church, but no electricity, water and no title deed.”
