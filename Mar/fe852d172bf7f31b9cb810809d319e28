Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer says his charges needed a bit more luck against a team as strong as Kaizer Chiefs. The Buccaneers were highly motivated to topple their old foes in the Soweto derby at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon and close the gap to the top of the Absa Premiership table to three points. However, a first-half goal from Lebogang Manyama was enough to give Chiefs the win on the day as Pirates struggled to take their chances. "First on the supporters, top atmosphere, top support. I think we have the chance in the game to make the first goal and we had a lot of chances to make the goal and yeah today we have not the luck what you need when you win against this team," Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV. "For me, we have a tough game, it's one of the best teams in the league, I think we had (deserved) a little more from the game, I think we dictated the game, but we have not the final pass. It reminds me of (Luvuyo) Memela had a big chance in the second half, towards the goal-line, normally you make this but today we did not have the luck you need when you win against Kaizer Chiefs." The German tactician was then asked whether he now shifts his attention towards building for next season, as they now trail the league leaders by nine points, to which he responded, "I don't know, it's now directly after the game, it's not so easy, we made a good game, I cannot say to my team it was bad, no, it was good. "Next season? We have eight games now in a row, what we have, we have a break and we'll see what has happened and we prepare the team for next season I don't know. But with this performance, we have a good look in the future." SOURCE: SPORT24
