Musician Papa Penny has joined the long list of celebrities that have raised awareness about the coronavirus. The reality TV star, whose reality show has been renewed for another season on Mzansi Magic, made a video where he shared his concerns about people who are not listen during this lockdown. In the video, Papa Penny says people should start respecting themselves, their lives and the president. He urges people to start adhering to the rules because when they get sick they’ll start blaming the government that they don’t care for them, whilst they were the ones who didn’t listen to the president when he urged everyone to stay indoors. “Avoid being in the street, stay indoors, your home is not a prison. We need to be good examples to other countries, on how to behave, our behavior is totally wrong, stay at home. “Every day we see people ignoring the army, this is about us, not other people. Please, South Africans, this is not it,” he said. Musician Arthur Mafokate shared the video on his Instagram page and thanked Papa Penny for the message. "Guys, let’s be at our homes and indoors at our offices till we reduce the infection rate," he wrote. Although the reality star's message was strong, bold and reasonable, people made jokes and laughed at his English.
