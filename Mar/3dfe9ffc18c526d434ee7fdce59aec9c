A SCHOOL principal was arrested by the Hawks during a memorial service yesterday! The 39-year-old was bust at the school in Taung, North West, over alleged travel claims fraud. Hawks spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase said the travel claims were made in 2017. “In October of that year, a claim of over R17 000 was fraudulently made,” he said. 'COPS MOERED DAD WHO KILLED HIS 4 KIDS' Nkwalase said the investigations were ongoing. “We are not ruling out any further arrests but at this stage, we feel we have had success in arresting the one directly linked to the case,” he said. Nkwalase said corruption such as fraudulent claims affected service delivery. The woman is expected to appear in the Taung Magistrates Court tomorrow.
