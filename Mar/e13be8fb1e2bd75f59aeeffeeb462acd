In wake of the global pandemic outbreak, COVID-19 also know as the Coronavirus, the world has become even smaller. The spread of the virus has forced many countries who have been infected and affected to share information urgently about the virus. Local broadcaster, DStv and Multichoice have announced the launch of new news channel AfricaNews. This is in response to the announcement by the World Health Organization who have called on for African countries and Africans to empower themselves with information about the outbreak. AfricaNews channel launched today and most of the news covered are centered around Covid-19 and the monitoring of the rise of numbers of confirmed infections in and around Africa and beyond. Currently South Africa was announced to be sitting at 202 confirmed cases with no deaths. The number keeps growing but the government has put into place measures to try combat the spread even further. This includes most organizations who have launched the “work from home” campaign where most employees are now effectively working from home. In a statement MultiChoice Group CEO Calvo Mawela said: “We have been in constant communication with health authorities such as the World Health Organisation, and we will be rolling out Africa-wide public service announcements on COVID-19. It is important that all of us take heed of the announcements and advice from trusted experts so that we can look after our own health and that of our loved ones.” Some news channels have also been made available for subscribers and non-subscribers on the DStv Now app which can be accessed from cellphones to computers. Catch all the news update on 24-hour news channel AfricaNews, DStv Channel 417 and across digital platforms.
