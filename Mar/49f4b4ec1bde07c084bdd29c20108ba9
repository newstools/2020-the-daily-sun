It’s the end of the line for Thandeka Ndlovu – just like that! She met her death after her arrival home. Thandeka is no more and the Zungus and Ndlovus are heartbroken. Her husband Sbusiso, who was with her when she was gunned down, is out for blood and wants to kill Judas Ngwenya, who everyone knows was behind the hit. Thandeka’s father, Sengwayo, who was on the phone with her when she was gunned down, has vanished into thin air. His family does not know he was on the phone with her when she was killed, but not knowing where he is while Judas is still on the loose makes them feel as if they have lost him too. Siphokazi has been admitted to hospital after she had a breakdown upon hearing the news of Thandeka’s death. Thandeka’s passing was one of the saddest, as she was loved by everyone in the valley where she grew up. The question is: what is going to happen to Sbusiso, who has to raise their two sons alone? Rest in peace, Thandeka. On Scandal!, Yvonne finally finds Tebello after he went missing while in the “care” of his father Nare.
