SOUTH Africans have been encouraged to socially distance themselves from one another to minimise the spread of Covid-19. But DA shadow minister of health Siviwe Gwarube said it would be difficult for people in squatter camps to stay away from one another due to the limited spaces they live in. She was speaking in parliament on Tuesday afternoon regarding measures that needed to be taken to fight the pandemic. Gwarube said the practical way to deal with the crisis was to ensure kasi people were well- informed about the disease and encouraged to maintain good personal hygiene. “We have unique circumstances in South Africa where we have many South Africans living in informal settlements,” she said. “Social distancing for them is something that is not going to be possible. The other intervention that can assist us in this regard is that we need communities to be aware of what is going on.” She said it didn’t help that people were in the dark. “They need to understand some of the mitigating factors they can use.” The Eastern Cape is one of the provinces that have been struggling with drought this year, with many rivers drying up, especially in areas such as Cala and Whittlesea. Gwarube said government needed to intervene by ensuring that areas that didn’t have water were provided with water tankers. “The government has to make sure there is running water and at least mobile water supply in certain areas so that we can adhere to personal hygiene,” she said.
