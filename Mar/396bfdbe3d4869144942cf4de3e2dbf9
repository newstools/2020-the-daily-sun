ANELE Lucuku wants to know when gunmen who shot him in September will be bust and locked up. The 42-year-old meat trader from Witsand in Atlantis, Cape Town, accused the cops of dragging their feet in resolving the matter. Anele was shot in the stomach by unknown gunmen at his shisa nyama business, which he ran from home. “The people who came to shoot me pretended to be customers,” he said.

No one is saying anything. I don’t feel safe because those people might come back to finish me off. Those people wanted to kill me and my family,” Anele said. His wife, Mandisa Dumezeni, (38) said it was difficult for the family to forget what happened that day. “It feels like it happened yesterday. Our lives have changed and we are always afraid,” she said. Constable Mihlali Majikela said a case of attempted murder has been opened but no arrests have been made.
