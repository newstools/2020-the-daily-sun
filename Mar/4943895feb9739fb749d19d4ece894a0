THE police have launched a 72-hour activation plan to find the two men who killed off-duty Constable Sibusiso Gqadushe. His wife Phumeza told Daily Sun she heard shots just after 8pm outside her house in Makhaza, Cape Town, on Saturday night. “When I heard the gunshots, I didn’t think it was my husband because it happens every day. I was shocked to see him lying in front of our house, bleeding,” she said. Phumeza said she was outside with her mum when she went back in to put her toddler to sleep. “I didn’t know by 8.30pm my husband would be dead because of a cellphone. They took it before shooting him,” she said. Phumeza said her brother called her outside to take her to her husband. “I ran to my neighbour’s house to ask for a car, but it was too late,” she said. The mum of four said she didn’t know what she’d do as her husband was the only breadwinner. Sibusiso worked at the Strand Police Station and was known as someone who loved his family. His four kids are aged between three and 11. Brigadier Novela Potelwa asked residents to help cops in find the suspects. Strand station commander Colonel Devina le Roux said they lost someone who loved his job. “I never had a problem with him. He was a quiet person,” she said. Le Roux said Gqadushe would be missed as he always had a smile on his face. “It’s difficult to accept he’s no more and it will take time because he showed love to everyone around him,” she said.
