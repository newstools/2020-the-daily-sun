COPS in Rietgat have bust a man suspected to have been one of the three thugs who murdered a bakery driver last weekend. The suspect was arrested early yesterday morning after cops in the area of Soshanguve, Tshwane, received a tip-off. Captain Mavela Masondo said the driver was stabbed last Friday morning. “The suspect was allegedly among the three who robbed and stabbed the bakery driver in block BB after they locked up his crew in the back of the truck,” Masondo said. He said the suspect would appear in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court soon on charges of murder and armed robbery. He said the other suspects were still at large. “For any information about the whereabouts of the other suspects or the case, we appeal to people to contact Rietgat police on 012 432 7806 or 08600 10111.” Rietgat station commander Colonel Stephina Nkosi praised the efforts of the team who made the arrest. “Your dedication and selflessness in the fight against crime is much appreciated. Keep doing the great job that you are doing. In no time, his accomplices will be sharing a cell with him,” she said. Nkosi called on residents to come forward with any information that may lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects.
