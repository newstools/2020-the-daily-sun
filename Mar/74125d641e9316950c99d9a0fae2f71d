Mpumalanga cops have launched a manhunt for suspects after an elderly couple was attacked and killed on Wednesday. According to a statement released by the police, two bodies of a 70-year-old retired pastor and his 67-year-old wife were discovered in their vehicle which was left abandoned at a veld next to Bethal dam. The police spokesman in Mpumalanga Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said according to information they received; the couple left their home earlier in that day to drop off their helper at Emzinoni but never returned. “Later in the day police were alerted about a white vehicle spotted at the said veld, upon arrival police searched the vehicle and discovered the two bodies, with severe visible injuries,” said Hlathi in a statement. He said Emergency Medical Services were called but unfortunately the two victims were certified dead at the scene. He said a case of murder is being investigated and a manhunt for the suspects has been launched. The motive for the murder is unknown at this stage. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said it is disheartening dealing with such cases where certain individuals brutally attack and kill vulnerable and defenceless citizens.
