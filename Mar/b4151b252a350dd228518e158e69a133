NIGERIAN pastor Timothy Omotoso’s lawyer yesterday tried to poke holes in a state witness’s testimony. Andisiwe Dike (30) continued her testimony against Omotoso and co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday. The three face 97 charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault. They have all pleaded not guilty. Omotoso’s lawyer Peter Daubermann said Dike’s statement to the police on how Omotoso allegedly raped her didn’t correspond with the testimony she gave in court last week.

This came after Judge Irma Sachem refused to have a trial within a trial regarding the credibility of the statement. Daubermann asked the witness: “Why is it not in your statement that you resisted during the alleged nonconsensual sexual encounters with accused number one?” Dike told the court she told the police she resisted on many occasions, but Omotoso told her to relax and be herself. “I signed the statement because it was a summary of what I said to the police and I didn’t know it was supposed to be exactly what I said,” she said. Daubermann put it to Dike that she was not forced to live at Omotoso’s Durban house and signed a consent form to live there. She said: “Yes, I joined the church voluntarily after my mother invited me because she believed it could change my life as I had a drinking problem. “I signed the form because I couldn’t go against anything said by Omotoso in fear of recourse.”
