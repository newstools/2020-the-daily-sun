SHACK dwellers living in the congested Cato Crest area in Durban, KZN have received tips on surviving the lockdown. Premier Sihle Zikalala and Human Settlements MEC Peggy Nkonyeni visited the area yesterday for a clean-up and also handed over masks to residents. They picked up rubbish and informed residents of ways to keep clean and the kind of food they should eat during the 21-day lockdown. Resident Nhlanhla Mkhize (34) said this showed them government officials cared about them.  Thabisile Ngcobo (28) was glad the premier and MEC came to the area to clean and inform them they would not run out of water during the lockdown. “They promised to bring us water tanks because we often run out of water,” she said. Nkonyeni said they would continue to meet with departments to make sure everything went well during the lockdown. Zikalala started his day at the Chinese Embassy, where he received 100 000 masks donated to stop the spread of Covid-19. Zikalala said the donation would provide the necessary support. “We made sure we arrange water tankers for all residents, especially in rural areas. We call on people to co-operate during the lockdown.” He said soldiers were sent to all areas and were ready to work with cops.  “We know people have started heading to their families. We hope they don’t infect them when they arrive home,” he said. Zikalala ended the day in Pietermaritzburg, where he met with the KZN Christian Council for a day of prayer.
