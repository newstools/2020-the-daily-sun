IT’S all about the luck of the draw in the Nedbank Cup. That is the view of Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt whose Clever Boys have been paired with high riding Mamelodi Sundowns in the semi-finals. But the last four showdown is on hold as the competition and all other Premier Soccer League fixtures have been suspended due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Hunt won the Ke Yona when he was in charge of SuperSport United in 2012, reached the final in his first season with Wits in 2014 but lost to Orlando Pirates. He was philosophical about the semi-final draw: “Obviously you always get a team that is doing well in the league in the semi-finals “It is all about the draw. Who you draw and where are you drawn. “Some teams go to the final without playing any top teams. “This season we played Pirates which was a tough away draw in the first round, then it was Chippa United at home in the Last-16.” Hunt’s Students then got a “kinder” draw in the quarter-finals when they met GladAfrica Championship side Real Kings in Durban. Despite Hunt saying the Kings clash was a tricky fixture, the Clever Boys romped home to a comfortable 4-0 win to reach the semis. But he knows that he will be up against it when he faces Pitso Mosimane’s ambitious Brazilians who are targeting the treble this season. Downs won the Telkom Knockout in December. They are determined to defend their Absa Premiership title as well as adding the Ke Yona Cup to their trophy cabinet. Downs are second in the Premiership with 44 points, four behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs but Sundowns have a match in hand. Downs were not given an easy passage into their semi-finals. They needed extra time to beat a fired-up Highlands Park 1-0 in the quarter-finals played in Tembisa. Both league fixtures between Wits and Downs ended in draws this season.
