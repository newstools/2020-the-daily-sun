Singer Rethabile Khumalo has released a new single, Hlonipha. Rethabile, who rose to fame after she was featured on DJs Zinhle and Mvzzle’s hit song Umlilo, said her new single will heal souls. “My songs are all about uplifting people and healing souls,” she said. “I’m expecting this song to teach the youth that if you respect your elders, your life will go accordingly.” Hlonipha, which she wrote, was produced by Melusi Msimanga. It’s a song about respecting the elders.  The 24-year-old said the song is inspired by all the lessons she’s learnt from her mum, singer Winnie Khumalo. “I decided to be straightforward and entitle the song Hlonipha because it’s about respect,” she said. “I want people to know that the more they respect, the more respect they’ll receive. “I respected my mother and I’m reaping all the fruits of this. “Most of the things that I know, I know through her. She’s taught me a lot of respect. “Even when things weren’t going well, she stood firm and supported me, and I am here today.” The young singer, who’s been making us dance to her voice throughout December, told SunBuzz she’s planning to release a full album at the end of next month. She said the album will feature songs that will inspire people, help them grow spiritually, and bring them back to God. Her single is available on all digital platforms.
