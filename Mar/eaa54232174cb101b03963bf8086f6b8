 The body of Tiyiselani
Nokuthula Rikhotso, a 11-year-old missing Giyani girl, was found dismembered
and dumped in the local Klein Letaba Dam on Tuesday. Rikhotso was reported
missing on Monday. "The discovery was
made by community members, who called the police. On arrival at the scene, the
police retrieved the body and discovered that some of her body parts were
missing," said Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo in a statement on Tuesday. Convicted rapist Nicholas
Ninow took the stand on Wednesday, as he testified in mitigation of sentence.
This is after he was found guilty of raping a 7-year-old girl in the bathroom
of a Dros restaurant in Pretoria in 2018. While the motive for the
murder is unknown, authorities have not ruled out that it could be a ritual
killing. The provincial commissioner
of Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, strongly condemned the brutal
killing of an innocent child and instructed the police to hunt down the
killers. The police have
subsequently launched a manhunt. Authorities are calling on
anyone with information to come forward. SOURCE: NEWS24
