PORPORWANAS are private cars operating as local taxis in Mamelodi and Nellmapius. But Paulina Gedhe (34) regrets getting into one in Waltloo on her way to Nellmapius last Saturday. The driver took off with groceries worth R2 800! She had bought groceries in bulk and was helped to the taxi by store workers. Paulina said the driver and three passengers were drunk, but she took the taxi as it was getting late. Two female passengers said they’d run out of beer and the taxi stopped at a petrol station. “They went to buy beer while the driver poured petrol.” She said the driver agreed for her to go to buy bottled water. “I saw the taxi speed off. I ran out. The two girls got in quickly and it sped off.” Paulina said another taximan stopped and helped her look for them, but they were gone. She managed to get the driver’s contacts and home address. “I phoned him. He said sorry and blamed it on alcohol. I told him I was on the way. He dropped the call and blocked my number.” The taximan, known only as Mduduzi, said he was drunk. “I’m sorry. Another passenger or my girlfriend could have offloaded the groceries. I don’t remember.” He had asked his lover what happened, but she blamed it on alcohol. “It’s either her or a passenger. I don’t remember.” Spokesman Jeff Kola said Four Plus One Taxi Association doesn’t allow drivers to work under the influence, and it’s a serious offence. “The woman should come to our offices and we’ll help her.” The driver’s lover couldn’t be reached for comment.
