WHEN the Coega Industrial Area opened near Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, it created job opportunities. But it also created new targets for thugs to rob. A couple from nearby Kamvelihle kasi has found a way to benefit from this. Fezeka Sakata (47) and her husband Mxolisi Nonkewuse (59) built their own ladder gate for workers to take a short cut over a three-metre wall around the development, dodging thugs and taxi fees. Fezeka told Daily Sun: “When my husband lost his job in 2011, our lives became very difficult. Then Coega built this concrete wall and closed the street the workers used. “They started to climb the wall and some of them broke their legs. My husband then took planks and made a stepladder for workers. After it was stolen, we decided to put it in our yard,” she said. “We decided to charge workers R2 to use it because it was in great demand. We are able to make between R600 and R800 a month in this way.” Mxolisi said they were not only doing it for the money. “We built this ladder to save lives. I have watched many people getting injured trying to climb the wall. Many have been robbed while passing the nearby squatter camp,” he said. Worker Nomthandazo Thoboshe (31) said many of his colleagues were robbed in jikeleza taxis before the stepladder was made available. “We used to spend R400 a month on taxis but it only takes a few rands to cross here. We also don’t have to wait for taxis,” he said. Sindiswa Ngqalo (33), another worker, said if you needed the ladder, you just threw a stone on Fezeka’s roof. “If you are going to knock off early, you just tell her in advance and she will wait for you,” he said.
