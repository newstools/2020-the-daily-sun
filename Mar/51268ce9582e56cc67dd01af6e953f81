Seasoned actor and businessman Unathi Platyi is planting a golden seed from his humble beginnings. The former Keeping Score protagonist has gotten his foundation of the ground and is working with young talent from his hometown in East London, Eastern Cape. He says the self-named foundation was started in 2017 when he realised the need to give back to the community. “A lot of youngsters have talent but do not necessarily have the skills and education needed for a successful career in the television and film industry,” he said. He added that he and his team are working on a funding model that would help them teach these skills on a national scale.  “We are currently working on a programme that we will roll out in Joburg, but next month we will start on mentoring the homeless people around the area and give them food and clothes.” He added that it sometimes takes someone who can recognise raw talent to make a difference in people’s lives.
