SWALLOWS FC coach Brandon Truter has hailed the impact made by new signing Phumele “Ace” Bhengu since he rejoined his former team. The ex-SA Under-23 international has hit the ground running, scoring two goals in as many matches for Dube Birds. His latest was in Swallows’ 3-1 win over relegation threatened Royal Eagles at Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday. Bhengu still holds the record for the most goals scored in a single season in the NFD, now known as the GladAfrica Championship. He banged in 22 goals for now defunct Thanda Royal Zulu in the 2014-15 season. “Ace is a proven goal scorer,” said Truter. “He has long been on my radar, even when I was coaching other teams. He is a player I have always admired, and I knew he would add a lot of value to this team.” “We did not hesitate to bring him over as soon as the opportunity arose. He is a top player and a model professional. “He also knows the club inside out, having spent time here before. The club and management also know him well. It was a no brainer to bring him over. He raises the level in the striking department, certainly. He will challenge the other strikers we have and they will raise their game as well. “His experience is also something that will really come in handy for us. It will lower the load on the other experienced players we have like Vuyo Mere, Lebohang Mokoena and Virgil Vries.” Swallows are in a rich vein of form recently, unbeaten in their last nine matches in the Championship. They are in second place on the standings with 40 points from 22 matches, just five points behind leaders Ajax Cape Town. The Birds, who are in their first season back in the professional ranks following a lengthy absence, are eager to return to the land of milk and honey. They face University of Pretoria in their next match at the Absa Tuks Stadium on Sunday.
