 In China
alone, 3015 people have died due to the Coronavirus. There are
80 000 infections of the Coronavirus reported in China and the South Africa
government has reportedly sent the South African National Defence Force to
repatriate 184 Mzansi citizens. In South
Africa, one case of a man in KwaZulu Natal who tested positive for the
coronavirus has been reported. Instead of
the country panicking or showing concern, they have decided to make fun of the
situation.
