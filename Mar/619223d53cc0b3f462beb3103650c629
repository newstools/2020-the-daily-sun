Due to the coronavirus outbreak that has led to South Africa to have a total lockdown, songstress Holly Rey has decided to host an intimate concert on her social media platforms. The singer told Daily Sun that she is just adhering to a call that was made by her fans. “People want to be entertained, during this lockdown, people want something interesting to watch,” she said. Holly promises her fans a jam-packed session, where she will be experimenting with different sounds. Even though data, prices were reduced by 50%, is still expensive to some people and that might affect the turnout of her concert. When asked about that the Deeper hitmaker said it doesn’t matter if only five people are watching, as long as she will get to entertain her fans. “One of the main reason we decided to include Facebook watch party, it’s because Facebook has lower data cost, I also understand that data is expensive and people need to save, since some of them won’t be working for the next weeks. Five people is also a great turnout,” she said. Furthermore, the young singer said what also prompted her to host, is the cancellation of concerts and events. “The cancellation of events due to Covid-19 has affected us badly because that is our main source of income as artists, but luckily for me I still have some income, so I  just wanted to give people a free concert during these difficult times,” she explained.
