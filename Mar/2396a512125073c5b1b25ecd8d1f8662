A MALE teacher was attacked by hawkers at Cheta Kekaka High school in Zebediela, Limpopo. He threw away snacks and kotas bought by schoolkids on Monday. He allegedly told hawkers they were selling rubbish. After throwing the snacks on to a thorn tree, hawkers confronted him and a fight broke out. Teachers rescued the man from the angry women. Pupils said his behaviour didn’t shock them. One angry pupil said: “He enjoys insulting pupils. He doesn’t know how to discipline children without insulting them. These women were allowed to sell inside the yard, so we don’t get out of school during break.” They said he’s always angry. “He said we eat kak and took our snacks and threw them on to a thorn tree.  One hawker said: “He kept telling us we sell rubbish while insulting children who bought from us. “We confronted him to explain to us why he insulted us. We are parents. How can we sell what is not good for our own children?” Education spokesman Sam Makondo said: “We directed the district office to investigate and provide us with a detailed report.”
