CULTURAL experts have frowned on Joseph Shabalala’s widow, Thoko. This after she publicly denounced her stepson Thami as leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. This despite Nkosinathi, Thami and several sources confirming he was nominated by the late Joseph to lead the group. ALSO READ:MSHENGU’S FINAL SEND-OFF! But Thoko told a KZN-based publication there was no such nomination. She said in fact, there’s a new head of the Shabalala family. Cultural experts slammed her actions. They said it was not her place to comment on this as she was supposed to be mourning her husband. Cultural activist Dr John Mbuli said it was unAfrican for a widow to make public comments. “Once a man dies, his wife takes the back seat and mourns him. Under no circumstances must she directly make public announcements because it attracts bad luck,” said John. Another cultural expert, Themba Masinga, said: “A widow cannot address the public on any issues. Instead her in-laws act or speak on her behalf. What she did was uncalled for and it is against African culture.” Another cultural expert, Loyiso Nqevu, said: “A widow is expected to refrain from all public domain. She is usually indoors and cannot randomly be making public comments. What she did is anti-African.” Daily Sun contacted Thoko for comment, but she gave the phone to someone else. Her spokesman refused to provide his details, instead he said: “I can confirm that Mrs Shabalala commented on a media platform. She wanted to clarify some issues and she is glad she did. If there are further questions, we request they be sent via email.” Although Daily Sun send questions to Thoko, she did not respond.
