ROSE Soares and her family were left with nothing after a mysterious fire burnt down their seven-roomed house at the beginning of the month. The 55-year-old from Snake Park in Soweto told Daily Sun she had no money to start over. Rose said she had no idea what started the fire just after midnight. “My husband was restless that night. He smelled some smoke and went to check. He came back to bed when he didn’t see anything, but the smell became stronger. When he went to check again, one of the rooms was on fire. He woke us all up and we ran out.” Rose said they called the firefighters at about 12.30am, but they took an hour and 40 minutes to arrive. She said when they arrived, they didn’t have enough water. “Firefighters from Florida stepped in and finished the job, but everything was gone by that time,” she said. Rose’s son Andile (23) said if the firefighters had arrived sooner, some of their belongings could have been saved. He said they renovated the house last year after his dad got his retirement money. He said he and his parents were asleep in a back room that was not affected. “We’re grateful to our church for helping with donations,” he said. Joburg EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said sometimes delays were caused by vehicles not being immediately available. “We will look into the case and contact the family,” he said.
