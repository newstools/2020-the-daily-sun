THE Mzansi Traditional and Cultural Music Awards are the first of their kind. Founded by Nomdakazana Dlamini from Enyandeni in the Eastern Cape, the awards were launched at Le’Shakeng Lounge in Ferreirasdorp, Joburg, on Saturday. Traditional food and drinks such as umqombothi, umngqusho, dumplings and umleqwa were served. The event was attended by artists including Tau Sebata, Mmabore Mogashoa and Mirriam Kekana. Nomdakazana told Daily Sun: “The idea behind this concept is to honour all the artists that put so much effort into uplifting our culture and tradition through music, but receive less acknowledgement. “It encourages artists to have confidence and pride in their work.” She said the awards were unique as they celebrated unsung heroes.
