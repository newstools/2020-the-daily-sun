LACE up and hit the roads, it’s about going back to basics. The Coronavirus is threatening to hold you back on your goal of losing weight, improve your muscle strength, boost your endurance, reclaim delivery of that oxygen that has been replaced by carbon monoxide, thus losing nutrients to your tissues. Leave nothing to chance and stay in your lane during this complete shutdown forced by the pandemic and carry on working it out like you are in the gym to improve your cardiovascular system. The annual races – Two Oceans Marathon, Comrades Marathon, the Spar Women’s 10km, and many other track events – have been cancelled, leaving elite and casual runners with nothing to drive them. Many gyms have opted to shut their doors amid the state of national disaster, but you cannot afford to lose track of your goals. Members of the Elite Under Armour Run Crew – Sibusiso Madikizela from Khayalitsha, Cape Town and Nobukhosi Tshuma from Joburg – shared their take on training during the Coronavirus pandemic. The elite athletes have explained ways on how to adjust your training schedule, by skipping the gym and bringing it back down to basics. NOBUKHOSI TSHUMA Training program during these times? During the second month I’m going to start introducing faster speed sessions, to improve my times and be race ready. How do these motivate themselves during these times with no races? SIBUSISO MADIKIZELA Training program during these times? “As an athlete we are used to training for months without racing, so it isn’t hard as it seems, the difference is we don’t have a timeline as to when the next race will be, which is challenging. We must put our health first and then train, so that when competitions do happen, we are ready to go. I advise everyone who is looking for a way to keep healthy to lace up and hit the road during this time.
