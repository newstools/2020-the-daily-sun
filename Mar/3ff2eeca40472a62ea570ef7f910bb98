EMPLOYEES at the Gamtoos Irrigation Board said they’d stay away from work until their safety was guaranteed. This comes after 150 angry workers and contractors of the Working for Water Programme in Joubertina, North West, shut down the offices on Wednesday. Workers of the programme in the Kou-Kamma Local Municipality, which appointed 68 contractors in November to remove alien plants, have not been paid since December. They said they worked in January and February without pay. The programme is funded by the environmental affairs department. Contractor Natasha Umtwa said she was owed R65 000. “Each contractor has 14 workers. At first, the project was supposed to start in July last year and end in July this year, but it was changed to six months with no explanation. Due to delays in payments, we have lost workers. They want their money,” she said. She said the board had favourites as only 29 contractors were affected. “We want our money and the Koukamma Municipality to take over the projet.” Pamela Goni, another contractor, said the board’s officials were getting rich at their expense. Mayor Samuel Vuso said he will meet Environmental Affairs Minister Barbara Creecy next week to discuss workers’ grievances. Mphikeleli Ndlela from the minister’s office said the department would look into the matter. Irrigation board CEO Rienette Colesky said they did not pay claims because they were scared to go to work.
