VICTOR Wiwi says the coronavirus has hit taxi owners hard. The chairman of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association said some taxis were getting fewer than half their usual loads per day.

Wiwi said the number of commuters using their taxis had gone down dramatically in the past two weeks, as the virus continued to cripple the country. Jonathan Murray (45), who drives a taxi between Belville and Cape Town, said things had been hard. “I have been having an average of three loads because now I have to wait longer for the taxi to get full. Normally in the morning, I would not even wait five minutes to fill up my taxi, but now I must wait longer because there are fewer passengers,” he said. Mfuleni taxi owner Luthando Gijima (63) told Daily Sun he had parked two of his six taxis because he was not making money.

I believe this virus is passing and we will go back to our normal lives and business will boom again,” he said. Wiwi said the taxi industry was supporting all the measures put in place by the government and the industry itself to fight the virus.
