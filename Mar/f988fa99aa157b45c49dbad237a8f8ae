She told Daily Sun the sangoma gave her muthi to boil and bath in, and powder to wash her punani. “I was excited about the punani muthi and hoped it would bring sparks in bed. Little did I know the muthi would bring bad luck to our relationship,” she said. Sibongile from Codesa 2 in Mangaung said after she had been using the muthi for two weeks, Mandla lost interest in sleeping with her and dumped her in January. She said she recently tried to get her money back from the sangoma only to find her consulting room had closed down. Sibongile said she paid the sangoma R1 000. READ: PASTOR POKES MUM AND DAUGHTER!

She might get back with her boyfriend after the curse is removed,” said the sangoma.
