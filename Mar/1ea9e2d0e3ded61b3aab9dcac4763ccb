The Daily Show host, Trevor Noah announced on Monday that they would be cancelling the filming of the show in the studio where there is an audience due to the corona virus. However, today, he has informed the public that the show will continue, corona virus or not. The show will be done indoors while everyone self-quarantines. In a video shared on Youtube Trevor said they will try and produce the Daily Show from homes. He said the producers, writers, directors and every one involved were going to chill at home and use the technology they have to try and make the show. Trevor said a lot of people said they still wanted to watch a show and that’s why they decided to try this. “Our topic today will be corona virus on what we will call the Daily Social Distancing Show,” he said. He then began to do the show which many viewers find amusing. Trevor, a South African comedian, succeeded long-time host Jon Stewart on the show. Last year, he became the first African comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden, one of the world's most renowned venues. There have only ever been nine other comedians who managed to pull off this impressive feat including the likes of Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, and Kevin Hart.
