Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize on Thursday said the department has started seeing recoveries of Covid-19 positive patients. In a statement, he said they were in the process of conducting further confirmation tests and medical examinations. “We will formally inform the public on the number of recoveries. At this stage, most of the patients are recovering well,” Mkhize said. However, a few positive cases were confirmed which did not have relevant patient information. Mkhize said some contact details were not added to the laboratory form, resulting in a few cases the department were unable to investigate. “This, therefore, puts more pressure on the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and provinces to track down the private doctor the patient consulted, in order to obtain the patient’s details.” He said he had consulted with private laboratories and compelled doctors to complete patient forms comprehensively, so that patient information was available immediately. “This will assist in ensuring that the confirmed results are also analysed in terms of geo mapping, to facilitate urgent tracing of contacts of the patient.” Quarantine of staff Mkhize said he had spoken to Western Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo after she announced she had come into contact with the French Consul General who had tested positive. “She informed me that she, together with her ministry staff, had gone into self-quarantine as a precaution,” Mkhize said. “The MEC is feeling strong and has not exhibited any symptoms. She is now waiting to receive her results that will determine her way forward,” he said.
