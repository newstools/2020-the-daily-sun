FORMER SuperSport United midfielder Letladi Madubanya has finally hung up his boots. The 36-year-old is now coaching Olifansfontein Primary School Under-10 boys. Madubanya last played for Baroka last season. But this season, Madubanya, who have played professional football for 12 years struggled to find a team after he parted ways with Baroka. “I have called it quits,” said Madubanya. “I have enjoyed playing football and I am thankful to everyone who contributed to my career. “But I sat down and thought hard, I felt it was time to retire and do other things. Age was no longer on my side. I am having a good time coaching the youngsters. It feels good to give back to kids.” Madubanya started his playing career in the PSL with Thembisa Classics in 2005. He then joined Bay United where he spent a season before joining Matsatsantsa a Pitori. Madubanya won two Absa Premiership titles at United with coach Gavin Hunt at helm. The Alexandra born player left the Tshwane based side and signed with Bloemfontein Celtic and won the Telkom Knockout Cup with Phunya Sele Sele in 2012. Madubanya also played for Platinum Stars before he joined Bakgaga in 2017. Madubanya added another Knockout trophy to his CV with Baroka last season. “It’s good to retire with medals to show,” said the proud Madubanya.”I am pleased with what I have achieved. I have no regrets in my career. I have a good life because of football and I cannot complain at all. It was a good ride.” Asked if he has plans to coach in the PSL one day, Madubanya yesterday told SunSport:”I am just taking it one step at time. Now I am having a good time coaching youngsters. Let’s wait and see if that will happen in the future. Time will tell.”
