PATIENTS visiting a doctor’s surgery on Monday left in more pain than they were in when they arrived. This was because thugs robbed them of their cellphones, watches, cash and other valuables. Even the doctor at the affected surgery in Vosloorus extension 25, Ekurhuleni, wasn’t spared. The robbers made off with his Tata sedan. Staff members told the SunTeam one of the thugs entered the surgery pretending to be a patient. “We saw him fiddling with his phone. We now suspect he was informing his accomplices to enter the surgery. Two armed thugs then entered and told everyone to keep quiet,” said a staff member. “They ordered us to the doctor’s room at the back and forced us to lie down before taking our valuables.” One of the patients said: “They took my watch, which was a present from my kids. It was a Nixon wristwatch that cost more than R2 000.” Another patient said they took R800 from his wallet, which he was going to use to buy his diabetes medication. Surgery owner Dr Owen Ngobeni told Daily Sun: “We’re here to serve the community but the very same community is turning against us. We don’t know whether to stay or leave. We can’t be serving the community in fear. “Right now, my staff is traumatised. I had to take them for counselling because they were too afraid to work.” Captain Piet Rossouw of Vosloorus Police Station said cops had launched a manhunt for the suspects.
