A retired police officer convicted with former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli, pleaded for leniency in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday. Mthembeni Mthunzi and Mdluli were convicted last year of assaulting and kidnapping Mdluli's former lover Tshidi Buthelezi, her husband Oupa Ramogibe and friend Alice Manana in 1998. Mthunzi and Mdluli were colleagues at the time of the incident. Both Buthelezi and Ramogibe have since died. Buthelezi died from an illness while Ramogibe was gunned down in 1999. Mthunzi's lawyer, Sabelo Nobangule, asked Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng for a non-custodial sentence for his client. Nobangule said it appeared that from the facts before Mokgoatlheng, Mthunzi got involved in the matter when he was asked by Mdluli to assist him with a marital issue. "There was no material gain to accrue for Mthunzi. He is a first-time offender but has previous convictions that are more than 30 years old and have expired,"Â Nobangule said. "I am not sure why those [30-year-old] records still show on the SAPS record. He must be considered as a first-time offender.  "On this matter there is an absence of the prescribed minimum sentence and retribution must take precedence over other means of punishment."          "A non-custodial sentence is an appropriate form of sentence. Direct imprisonment will serve one purpose from what the State has said - revenge."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ex-cop-convicted-with-richard-mdluli-pleads-for-leniency-at-sentencing-hearing-20200312
