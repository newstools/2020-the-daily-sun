Veteran rapper Selwyn Ngwenya, popularly known as Mr Selwyn, is hosting character-building seminars for celebrities. The 42-year-old Shake hitmaker said the talks could be the threshold to entertainers molding careers, which are sustainable and prominent for a long time. “The ideal was inspired by my observation that celebrities or public figures are often consumed by the pressure of expectation. So, we find ourselves focusing on the gift and neglecting the man,” he said. He added that the previous seminar was held in Joburg last year in December, and the next one is set to be this month. Daily Sun previous reported that the talented rapper had switched the mic for the pulpit.
