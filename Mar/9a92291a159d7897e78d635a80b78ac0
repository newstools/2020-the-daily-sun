TAVERN owners are not happy with the call for drinking spots to close earlier than usual. This comes after government announced that bars, clubs, shebeens and restaurants that sell liquor must close at 6pm on weekdays and Saturdays and at 1pm on Sundays and public holidays. This also applies to all liquor stores. But tavern owners from Soweto told Daily Sun this would badly affect their pockets. Themba Khuzwayo (70) from Mofolo North said his business made a lot of money between Friday and Sunday. “I open from 10am to 9pm on weekdays and close at 10pm on weekends. Three to four hours of closure will definitely cripple my pockets. “I will make sure my customers are safe and provide them with hand sanitisers. I will make sure they don’t sit in after 6pm but buy and go,” said Themba. Sihle Khumalo (57), a regular at Themba’s spot, said he wasn’t scared as he washed his hands regularly and used a hand sanitiser. “I believe government knows what they are doing but that won’t stop us from drinking,” he said. Diogo Mahitse (55) said his customers would not be happy.“I guess we don’t have a choice but to listen to government before we have to deal with the police,” he said. Patron Sivukile Tantsi (33) said: “They should have given us a chance to have an input before making decisions that will affect people’s livelihoods. They should be focusing on travel bans and leave us to drink in peace.”
