A NUMBER of refugees were bust after a standoff with police yesterday. The refugees, who were removed from the Cape Town CBD on Sunday, tried to illegally occupy land near the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in District Six. Jeaner Kamombo (44) said she came to Mzansi in 2004 with her husband Pierre, but he was killed during a robbery in the Cape Flats four years ago. “I don’t have anywhere to go. That’s why I’m here with my two children,” she said. Farai Mukuena (33) from Zimbabwe said he was an asylum seeker and had escaped political persecution. “I want to go back home now but I don’t have money. If they gave us somewhere to live for now, I could work. If they choose to arrest me, it’s okay because there’s food in jail,” he said. ALSO READ:COPS BUST 3 'FONG KONG COPS!' Meanwhile, hawkers in Green Market Square said they were relieved the refugees were removed as they could get their businesses back on track. Mamadou Nangur from Cameroon said: “We thank the City of Cape Town for cleaning the place as it smelled of urine and was too dirty.” The city yesterday called on traders to return to the area so things could get back to normal. Safety and Security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said during operations on Sunday and yesterday, some refugees were bust and charged with assault, contravention of a court order and resisting arrest. “This is an extremely volatile situation which the city is trying to manage as best as possible. We appeal to everyone concerned to please allow our staff to execute their duties, in line with the court order.” Refugees’ spokesman Patrick Ngandu said: “They’re chasing us like dogs. We expected to be given time to prepare but they just kicked us out. That’s inhuman.”
