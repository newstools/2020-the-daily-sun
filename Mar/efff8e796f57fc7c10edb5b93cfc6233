JOMO Cosmos boss and former Bafana Bafana coach Jomo Sono says those who say he must fire himself as the coach have no understanding of the game. "You see them on the bench that they are just thinking and calculating their monthly bills and waiting for pay day," said Sono. "They say I must adapt to modern and new ways of football and that I am old school. There’ no new trends in football, it’ still the old same 4-4-2, nothing has changed, There’s no 4-4-7 or 5-4-1 or whatever, it’ still the same. Mostly it’s 50% about fitness, 30% tactics and 20% luck. Look at the recent Soweto derby, who was the luckiest, Kaizer Chiefs were lucky – and still you cannot tell me that the coach is not good," he added. Said Sono: "Some coaches have taken teams to the First Division and some of those clubs have died. Those coaches are now coaching in the PSL, they took teams to the NFD and those teams are dead now. Like the same coach who dropped Moroka Swallows to the NFD, the same with African Wanderers and AmaZulu. Don’t forget AmaZulu bought a status after going all the way down. I have managed to keep this and club and have managed to produce players." "I am criticised every time by people who do not understand or know the situation, every season, one or two players from Cosmos get contracts in the PSL, and even to the national team. I am losing players to big clubs because I cannot compete when it comes to paying salaries. I had Sansui and Bonitas when I was in the PSL, and I could pay good salaries then." Mjomana says that he is happy with his current squad. "I am happy of my team squad, we are playing well and focusing on gaining promotion at the end of next season. There are some fantastic players here. We are going to come right. We have a plan for next season."
