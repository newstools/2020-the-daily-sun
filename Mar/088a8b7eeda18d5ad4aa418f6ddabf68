Jailbirds who took videos of themselves drinking and partying will soon face a different kind of music. Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola announced the inmates from Mdantsane Prison in the Eastern Cape, whose video went viral this week, appeared before a disciplinary committee on Wednesday. Lamola said the inmates would be transferred to a maximum security prison and their chances of getting parole were harmed. “They will also undergo behaviour modification programmes. “We are working on increasing our security capacity to reduce the smuggling of contrabrand into our facilities, including cellphones.” Department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said after officials were made aware of the video, they conducted a search and confiscated cellphones.  He said a full-scale investigation was launched to find out how the inmates managed to access cellphones and civilian clothes.  Twitter users said the disciplinary action taken was not enough.
