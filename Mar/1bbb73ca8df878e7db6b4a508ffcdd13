THE family of a 24-year-old who died after giving birth wants her body to be exhumed and buried at home. Her mum Sebueng Pitso wants answers from Leratong Hospital in Mogale City. The 43-year-old from Swaneville in Krugersdorp told Daily Sun her daughter Refilwe was buried in Bloemfontein on Saturday.  Refilwe died in hospital last month. She left behind a two-month-old son, who lives with his dad. She said: “She gave birth through C-section and had complications. She was discharged but we took her back to hospital. I was just in pain whenever I saw her on the bed, helpless.” After Refilwe died, Sebueng had problems with the documents the undertaker needed. When she finally fetched the body it was gone. She was told family members had taken it to Bloemfontein. “I was angry. I emphasised many times no one must take my baby without permission, but they let them take her,” she said. Refilwe’s gogo Mpho (65) said all she wanted was for her granddaughter to be buried where she grew up. “The relatives who took her disrespected us. They don’t care how we feel.  “The worst part is that the hospital let them take her while her mum is here and alive. “Why would they even allow that? We need answers from Leratong Hospital and we need the family to bring back our child.” Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana was not aware of the matter. She said she would talk to the hospital and contact the family.
