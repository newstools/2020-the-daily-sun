COMMUTERS are saying the taxis are too slow to take them home.   Some of them feel that they should have added more taxis so that when the lockdown starts they will be home with families.   The other commuters said this was tough times so they have to be with families so that when something bad happens, they’ll will be closer to them.   SunTeam spoke to a few long distance commuters at Bosman Taxi Rank in Tshwane on Thursday about whether transport was better on the eve of the 21-day lockdown.   Daniel Ndou (48) who was travelling to Makhado in Limpopo said the taxis were slow and felt the lockdown will find him still on his way home.   "I was hoping to be at home before 6pm because it’s a bit far. I want to be at home during this time because most of my family members are there," he said.   Delphine Magano (37) who was travelling to Venda said that during the lockdown she wanted to spend the three weeks with his father.   She said that she was hoping to be at home before midnight.   Caroline Malinga (25) said she was travelling to Polokwane to be with family and will make sure she will stay indoors when she gets home.   Bosman Taxi Rank manager Daniel Mashao said taxis will stop operating until 17 April.   "We are owing these cars. Will the government give us subsidy? And we don't even know what the banks will say after 21 days," he said.   Mashao said that they want the virus to end and added that people should stay safe and not forget to wash their hands.   National Taxi Alliance (NTA) spokesman, Theo Malele, said they were not happy with the government’s failure to get commercial banks to commit to a three months blanket payment holiday.   “Because like any other business our revenue streams will be negatively affected,” he said.
