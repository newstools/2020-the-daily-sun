BAROKA youngster Evidence “Tower” Makgopa believes his dream of representing South African at an international level is still alive. The 19-year-old striker was speaking following the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games due to the coronavirus pandemic. This announcement was made on Tuesday by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) together with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The SA Under-23 coach David Notoane announced his preliminary squad early this month, included overage players in February. Notoane was due to cut his squad to 22 players before the Games which was due to start on 24 July. Now Tokyo will host the Games next year July and Makgopa is optimistic that he will make the squad if Notoane made some changes. “I feel sorry for the players who were selected hoping to make the 22 squad,” said Makgopa, who was not part of the team because he was just promoted to Baroka first team from their MultiChoice Diski team last month by the Ga-Mphahlele based side coach Dylan Kerr. “It’s every youngster’s dream to represent his country in the Olympic Games. One of my dream is to go to the Games. I will work hard and hopefully the coach Notoane will select me too next year.” Makgopa has played only four games for Baroka since promoted to the first team and impressed many football lovers including Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki who watched him in the Limpopo against Black Leopards where he scored a brace in an Absa Premiership match played at Peter Mokaba Stadium on 7 March. Even Kerr has predicted a bright future for Makgopa as long as he keeps working hard.
