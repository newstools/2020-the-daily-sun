An emotional grieving mother looked at her children coffins as all three of them lined up with pictures of their little faces next to them. Aydin Mitchell (7), Lashay (11) and Learyn Godall(12) died in a car crash on their way to school.Â On Saturday family and friends gathered in a somber mood to pay their last respect.The children were laid to rest at Eldorado Park, south of Joburg. "What a sad day for people of Eldorado Park. I can't begin to imagine a pain of a mother who lost all her children at the same time," said a mourner with tears rolling down a face. The pastor who conducted the funeral, urged mourners to appreciate time. He said the children died so we could learn the most important lesson. "Their lives were cut short but they have fulfilled their mission and returned to the father in heaven." "One would ask what mission when they were taken so early. I strongly believe they came to this world to teach us to appreciate the now. To be grateful to our parents, children and people around us because we don't know when is our time to pass away from this life. This very moment remind us that whatever we moved to do it another day, we might not have time to do so because this might be our last moment," he said. The family spokesman and a uncle, Noel Maart said the mother wanted to read out the obituary but she was too emotional. "She is in great pain. She was very close to her children. The siblings were traveling in a Avanza when they collided with a taxi on the R533 Golden highway on the 11 of March. The accident claimed 12 lives," he said. Noel said the family was grateful for all the support, prayers and the love the country has shown to them in such a difficult time.Among those the family thanked was Vuyo Funeral Services which offered their service without any fee to the family.
