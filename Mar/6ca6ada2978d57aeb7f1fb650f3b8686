LESEDI Kapinga is unlikely to suffer the same fate as his teammates at Black Leopards. According to coach Alan Clark, Kapinga remains committed to the cause to help the team survive potential relegation from the money-spinning Absa Premiership and into the lower GladAfrica Championship. The star midfielder is understood to have signed a pre-contract with Mamelodi Sundowns and could be leaving for Tshwane in June. But his mission in Thohoyandou is certainly not done. “To be honest those matters are not things that I focus on. As a tactician it’s important that I focus on the tactics, the opponents, what I can do in the game and how we can get the result to match the performance we speak about,” said Clark. “The players that are rumoured to have moved (moving) and left, if you see the performances they put out on the pitch, you can see they are playing for the badge. Otherwise they wouldn’t be on the pitch. So, for me that is not the problem. Many teams, including Leopards frown upon players who sign pre-contracts elsewhere, as recently seen with former players, Marks Munyai and Phathutshedzo Nange as well as Rodney Ramagalela, who was sidelined at Polokwane City. However, Clark has insisted he needs all hands on deck as the team makes a strong push to avoid the dreaded chop. “If they are Black Leopards players until the end of the season and they have given their all, I have no problem with that, hopefully they can leave Black Leopards in a good position in the league, we shake hands and we wish them well. But its important that they stay focused for the six games we have left.” Leopards are staring relegation in the face, bottom of the log with 20 points, following their 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits on Tuesday. They take a break from their league struggles when they tackle Baroka in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals on Saturday.
