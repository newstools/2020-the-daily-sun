Fast bowler Thando Ntini, son of former Proteas speedster Makhaya, is swapping Cape Town for Pretoria. Ntini, educated at Wynberg Boys High, will leave the Cape Cobras to further his career at the Titans in the 2020/21 season.

The Cobras finished at the bottom of the six-team standings despite Ntini’s 14 wickets in nine matches.The 19-year-old right-armer was part of the Paarl Rocks’ squad for the 2019 Mzansi Super League, but didn’t play a match.
