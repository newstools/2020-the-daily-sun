Rapper Gigi Lamayne raised eyebrows after she posted a photo on Instagram on Sunday. She wore red and white beads around her wrist and an ancestral cloth that symbolised she was undergoing training to become a sangoma. She captioned the photo “Thokoza” with an emoji of a bottle of champagne. The rapper, who recently bagged a presenting gig on Soweto TV’s upcoming show Hair Jury, was all smiles in the photo. Although she posted the photo to social media, she kept mum about it and details of when she started her training. Called for comment, she said: “Not my calling. That’s something intimate for me.” Shortly after posting the photo, industry colleagues such as TV and radio presenter Luthando Sosha, rapper Nomuzi Mabena and choreographer Bontle Modiselle congratulated her on her new journey.
