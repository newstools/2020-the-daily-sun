AT the last launch of some of Peugeot’s cars last year, its new managing director for South Africa, Xavier Gobille, said the brand would make a mark in the market. And true to his words, the brand has begun this year on a high note, thanks to the awards it’s won. For the third year in a row, the Peugeot 5008 SUV 1.2 PureTech 130 Allure has won the Large SUV award at the 2020 What Car? Car of the Year Awards, one of the most prestigious awards in the British automotive industry. The 5008 SUV beat segment rivals including the Mazda CX-5 and Audi Q5. And after taking it on a brief road test, we agree the seven–seater – with an interior that looks and feels like that of an aeroplane – is fit for the title. While it looks quite big and long, all that space works for well when it comes to the comfort of its passengers. Lest we forget, JD Power honoured Peugeot with the Most Reliable Brand title last year. Accolades roll in if you do the right things for motorists. The 5008 SUV GT Line is a strong contender as a finalist in this year’s AutoTrader South Africa Car of Year competition. It’s due to announce the winner next month. I think its top-notch interior features play a huge role in the success of this beautiful SUV. The third row can be folded down, as well as fully removed. The second-row seats are all adjustable and benefit from ISOFIX fittings, while the front passenger seat also folds flat to accommodate long items. Its cabin i-Cockpit technology is fitting and helps drivers stay safe on the road with its compact, multi-function steering wheel, 12.3-inch head-up display and 8.0-inch colour touchscreen with Mirrorscreen. Also included is Autonomous Emergency Braking and Active Blind Spot Detection (available as standard from the Allure trim level upwards). Add to this a five-year 100 000km warranty and service plan, the 5008 SUV is a great car Mzansi will love for a long time.
