AFTER days without water, they were happy to see it gushing out of a burst tap. But when they opened their taps at home, black water smelling of kak oozed out. Residents of Madibeng in North West said even animals would not drink it. Those with money bought water while the poor drank from dirty wells and rivers. Margaret Tlhapi (34) said after opening her tap she had to open all her windows to get rid of the smell.  “No one in their right mind would drink the water Madibeng wants us to drink. “It’s as if they’re deliberately trying to infect us. You can’t do anything with it. “I tried to boil it but it made no difference. The more I boiled it the smellier it became.” Mpina Kgosinkwe (73) said most municipal staff lived in Gauteng. “They don’t care because they don’t have to drink this kak. “We must take it to their offices so they can demonstrate how you drink it.  “If the president doesn’t intervene, diseases will break out. They don’t even tell us why the water is black.” Mpina said: “I’m sure unskilled comrades or officials’ friends were hired to handle our water.” Municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala promised to investigate.
