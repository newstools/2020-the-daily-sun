SOCIAL media came to a standstill when Sjava broke his silence on the rape allegations against him. While the Eweni hitmaker made it clear it was not his plan to speak out, he felt he had to. This is after Sunday Sun reported a rape case had been opened against him by a 33-year-old woman with whom he had a relationship. On Monday, Cape Town International Jazz Festival organisers announced they had removed him from the line-up. On Tuesday, Sjava released a statement about the interactions he had with Lady Zamar. “I choose to follow the legal process, but it’s now become impossible to remain quiet. I’m only going to share information that’s necessary due to the latest news reports. It’s not my intention to stand trial by social media,” he said. Sjava recorded dates from October, which he said sparked his and Lady Zamar’s current standing. He claimed the problem began then, when she accused him of abusing her on Twitter after his One Night With Sjava show on 27 October. “On 1 November, we sent a letter of demand to Lady Zamar’s manager informing them to retract the accusations as they were not true.” He said they asked for an address on 11 November and on 13 November, served summons for a case of defamation of character to her Tshwane lawyers. He said the rape case was reported on 14 November in Tshwane and on 5 December, he met two cops from Thohoyandou cop shop. “I gave my statement including that of witnesses who were with us during that trip.” Kim Seneke of The Alore Group, said the singer gave permission for her name to be used. Speaking on behalf of Lady Zamar she said: “If Sjava chooses to give a statement that’s on him, but we won’t be commenting.” Ambitiouz Entertainment business manager, Bongani Mdakane said: “This is a criminal matter and we won’t be commenting outside of his statement.”
