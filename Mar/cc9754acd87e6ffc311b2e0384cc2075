Minister Bheki Cele has laid down the law with regards to purchasing alcohol
during the imminent lockdown saying there will be no sale of alcohol from any
outlet. Cele
addressing the inter-ministerial security cluster in Pretoria on Wednesday late
afternoon said in addition to no sale of alcohol there will also be no movement
of alcohol from one place to the other. “That
means what you have now is what you will drink in the next 21 days. The first
measures we were saying you can buy alcohol up to a certain time, now we are
saying there is no sale of alcohol at all. “You
will have to stay sober in the next 21 days,” Cele said. He
announced that restaurants, night clubs, pubs, taverns, and shebeens will be
closed. Also, community centers, recreational centers, hotels, lodges,
B&Bs, private lodges, and parks will be closed. However, in a case where
there are still tourists some of the lodges will remain open. Health
Ministers Dr. Zweli Mkhize in explaining the total ban on alcohol said the real
reason was the behavior because lockdown alone was not enough. He added it took
one person to infect many. “The
real battle starts now,” said Mkhize.
