NOT much was heard of Nolo Phiri after she left e.tv’s Rhythm City in 2018. This is because she has been working behind the scenes, focusing on her multimedia production company, Redefine. In 2018, Nolo joined SABC2’s Muvhango as associate producer and also partnered with Word Of Mouth Productions on projects. She told Daily Sun: “I started working behind the scenes before being on screen and have a strong passion for creativity. I enjoy the responsibility of being creative for my work and other people. I am more into producing, and the business side.” But fans will soon see Nolo back on their screens. She announced she will be joining Mzansi Magic’s Isibaya. The 33-year-old from Nancefield in Limpopo will star as Nombumelelo Gumede, Saddam’s ex-wife. “Nombumelelo is a street-smart Tshwane lady who is funny, and I will be exploring comedy through her. Viewers will enjoy her.” She said her new role is a woman you would love to hate. “She’s a con artist who left her ex-husband for a blesser, but is back on a mission. She manipulates people for survival.” People will also remember Nolo’s collaboration with Apples and Oranges under Nolo Phiri Projects, which empowers young entrepreneurs. She will be on Isibaya next Friday.
