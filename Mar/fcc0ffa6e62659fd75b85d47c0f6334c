AFTER crashing out of the Caf Champions League quarter-finals, Mamelodi Sundowns will shift their focus back to the Absa Premiership title race. The Brazilians’ dreams of winning a quadruple were ended by African team of the Century Al Ahly on Saturday. But despite their painful exit from Africa’s premium club competition, there is still a lot to play for locally for Mosimane and his charges. Absa Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs' shock 1-0 loss to relegation haunted AmaZulu at the FNB Stadium on Saturday night, blew the title race wide open again as it boosted Downs chances of catching up with them at the top. On Wednesday night (7.30pm), the Tshwane-based giants will begin their league catch up programme away to PSL rookies Stellenbosch at Athlone Stadium in Cape Town. The defending league champions are seven points behind Chiefs. Downs are second with 41 points with two games in hand. If they win their two matches in hand, they will slash Amakhosi’s lead to just one point with eight games remaining in their league campaign. A visibly dejected Mosimane said his team will dust themselves off and continue their fight on the domestic front after losing out to most successful team in the Champions League. “What can I do? Asked Mosimane. “We lost to a good team and we have to move on with our lives. I can’t fix the world. I can’t fix the Caf Champions league, these deliberate time-wasting tactics are frustrating, but it’s the nature of the Champions League in Africa. You never see these things in Europe. I guarantee you it will happen again next year.” But their dream of winning a domestic treble lives on. They are still in contention to win the Nedbank Cup after they were drawn against Highlands Park in the quarter-finals at the Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday.
