Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane wants to stay at the Tshwane giants. Mosimane’s contract is set to expire at the end of the season. But Downs are yet to confirm if they will renew his contract or not. The club and Mosimane did not agree on their terms of renewing his contract for months. But Mosimane said he has now compiled with what the club want from him and he would like to stay beyond the end of the season. Mosimane says the ball is in the Brazilians court when it comes to his contract renewal. Speaking after the Brazilians were eliminated from the CAF Champions League quarterfinal by Al Ahly 3-1 on aggregate at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Tshwane, he reiterated his desire to stay. “The ball is in Sundowns court. It’s entirely up to them to keep me or let go of me" "I’ve compiled with whatever they wanted from our negotiations and I’m ready to stay.”  Said Mosimane. The Brazilians African safari ended after they drew 1-1 in the second leg in Tshwane. But the damage was done in their 2-0 loss in Cairo in the first leg. “We will try again next year. We fought and did our best.”
