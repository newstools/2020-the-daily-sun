THE four kids who were allegedly murdered by their father were buried yesterday. Hundreds of mourners gathered at Phasha Selatole Village, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, to say goodbye to Katlego (9), Joyce (7), Tshepo (5) and Adelle Monyela (2).  They died over a week ago following a fight between their dad and mum Sylvia (30). On the day of the murder, Sylvia escaped and the man apparently picked the kids up from school. It was reported Sylvia went to Mecklenburg cop shop to apply for a protection order but was referred to Praktiseer, 50km away. The children’s schoolmates at Manku Primary wore uniforms at the funeral service. Lucas Phasha (50) abandoned his bail bid and was expected to appear in court on 28 May. Sylvia’s uncle Kenny Monyela said: “I live in Rustenburg, and she was a regular visitor. We tried to intervene but she wouldn’t listen. He’s a sweet-talker.” Community Safety MEC Dickson Masemola said he had asked commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba to investigate claims that Sylvia was turned away at Mecklenburg Police Station. Principal Irene Mphahlele said: “Seeing their empty chairs has left us with trauma.”
