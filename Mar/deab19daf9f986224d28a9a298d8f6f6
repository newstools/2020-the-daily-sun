Dr Jennifer Landam, a specialist in hormone therapy, suggested that masturbation might be what you need to strengthen your immune system. With the coronavirus spreading rapidly, body contact is one of the things that we are advised to avoid as this spreads the virus and this includes engaging in sexual intercourse and self-pleasuring is advised. Masturbation is known toÂ raise the white blood cell count which plays a big role in fighting infections in the body and Landam advises that instead of having sexual intercourse, rather masturbate. This view is also reflected in a small study carried out by the Department of Medical Psychology at the University Clinic of Essen in Germany, which closely looked at the effects of orgasm through masturbation on white blood cell count. Remember, masturbation also helps you sleep better, so go ahead and pleasure yourself.
