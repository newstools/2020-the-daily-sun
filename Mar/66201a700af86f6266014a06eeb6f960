STELLENBOSCH star player Lelethu Skelem had a great outing against Mamelodi Sundowns on Wednesday night but he just failed to live up to his surname, by stealing point off the Brazilians. Skelem, a hard working midfielder-cum-forward, was buzzing in Cape Town when the Stellies lost narrowly to Sundowns, who are chasing log-leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Stellies coach Steve Barker has even suggested that Skelem deserves to be in David Notoane's SA-Under 23 2020 Tokyo Olympic squad. Well, if you have been following the player since the start of the season, you can vouch that Skelem may just steal a place in the Tokyo-bound squad.
