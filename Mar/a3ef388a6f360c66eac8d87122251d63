Hey MizzB I’M an 18-year-old who has matric but I am not sure which field of study to pursue. I’m passionate about helping the poor, but my results don’t allow me to go to university. What can I do as I don’t want to feel like I wasted my parents’ money in not becoming something special or getting a good job? -Man Hey Man Your success is in your hands! As people, we each have different destinations and this means we will not travel the same road. What if your route is not the conventional one that everyone else has taken?
