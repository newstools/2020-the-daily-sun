SuperSport United head coach Kaitano Tembo looks almost certain to have his contract with the club extended after receiving glowing praise from CEO Stan Matthews. Matsatsantsa began the weekend fourth in the Absa Premiership standings and steered the club the MTN8 title earlier this season. With his contract set to expire this season, unless the extension clause is triggered, there was some speculation about his future. However, Matthews moved to rubbish any rumours on that front and indicated Tembo would be remaining with SuperSport for the foreseeable future. "Kaitano has a two-year extension clause in his contract. There is no question in our minds that he deserves an extension whatever happens," Matthews says. "He won us a trophy and we are sitting okay in the league. He brought through three young players. He is a club man. "I am not sure where this media nonsense comes from around his contract. Kaitano's job is not under threat. He will be with us next season no matter what." Tembo was appointed as SuperSport's full-time head coach in August 2018 after seven months in charge as the interim head coach following the departure of Eric Tinkler.  SOURCE:Â SPORT24
