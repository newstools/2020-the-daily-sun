EMBATTLED South African National Boxing Organisation (Sanabo) have elected an interim structure to carry on with organisational activities after the mass resignation of the executive last week. The entire Sanabo executive committee, under president Andile Mofu, resigned last week. This comes after the organisation failed to send the SA boxing team to the African qualifiers for the Japan 2020 Olympics in Dakar, last month. The amateur regulatory body has been rocked by allegations of poor governance. A five member team who will take over the reins of the amateur governing body are Siyabulela Mkhwalo (interim chairperson), Hazert Hlope (vice chairperson), Liwa Mlokoti (secretary) Onalenna Tsae (deputy secretary) Mandla Ndlovu (treasurer). The new structure is expected finish of the term of previous office barriers who resigned a year before the end of their term. Their first assignment is to set-up a special general meeting that will endorse the new interim executive committee and also draft a calendar of activities for the dysfunctional Sanabo. Mkhwalo said they have to get the ball rolling on planning activities including making sure that the SA boxing team is ready for the World qualifiers to be held in France in May. “One of our duties is to normalise Sanabo’s operations including organising tournaments to keep amateur boxers busy,” said Mkhwalo. According to Mkhwalo as an organisation they took full responsibility for the failures of Sanabo. He believes that the new structure will take amateur boxing to greater heights. “Our young boxers missed the African qualifiers event, but we don’t blame the previous office bearers. We take full ownership of the short falls because we were there as affiliates when everything happened. However, the boxers have a final chance to book their place for the 2020 Olympic Games via the World qualifiers,” he said.
