DINO Ndlovu is one goal shy from recording a century. The Zhejiang Greentown striker is continuing to redefine the craft of his goal-scoring and is about to pocket his 100th club goal since he started playing professionally in 2009. Ndlovu is currently in the country taking a break from football in China due to the Coronavirus outbreak that has threatened all football leagues globally, forcing all leagues to be stopped immediately to avoid the spread of the contagious virus. But it is understood that his club coach Zheng Xiong wants his star striker back in the country despite the deadly virus, but he is defiant of his risking his life money. Back to his historic moment, the former SuperSport United and Mamelodi Sundowns striker is excited that he went on twitter to express delight on his achievement. "Without perseverance, failures and dedication, this wouldnâ€™t be possible. One (1) goal away from reaching my 100th club goals," the 30-year-old from Klerksdorp wrote on his Twitter account.  He has been scoring goals of note for his China outfit where he has netted 35 in 49 outings. In a radio interview recently, Ndlovu told the SABC that he is "not going to put my life at risk just because I have a contract to honour, they put money before health" He was referring to calls by his Chinese club to return to the troubled Asian country, but Ndlovu is sticking by his guns that he will honour President Cyril Ramaphosa's order for South Africans to stay home and not risk traveling overseas during this state of national disaster declared on Sunday. Now Ndlovu faces a huge challenge on where he will get his one goal to complete the century, with leagues suspended and him being paid while in a another country. Zhejiang Greentown are sixth on the Chinese log with 51 points from 30 matches. You can expect a more in-depth interview with Dino Ndlovu soon
