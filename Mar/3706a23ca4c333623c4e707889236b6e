Mabuza urged municipalities to use the law to block people from erecting shacks illegally.

Incitement of violence and lawlessness is an antithesis of what we stand for as a constitutional state,” he said. Mabuza said government’s implementing an orderly land reform that is in line with the Constitution. “This approach has no room for chaos and anarchy perpetrated under the guise of land reform,” he said.

It’s supposedly linked to the EFF. It seems like part of an organised crime,” he said. “In this case, the land is owned by the Gauteng Housing Department, and these invaders are trying to circumvent the housing list,” he said. EFF MP Mmabatho Mokause didn’t take the dig lightly and asked NCOP deputy chairwoman Sylvia Lucas to order Ryder to withdraw, which he did.
