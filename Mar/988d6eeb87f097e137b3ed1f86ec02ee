PASTOR Elliot Matawela claims he’s being haunted by his late wife Mapula. The 62-year-old pastor at Christian Apostolic Church in Zion City in Winterveldt, Tshwane, said he dreaded going to sleep because his wife visits him and demands justice for their murdered son. Elliot told Daily Sun his son Sello was shot four times in the tummy and spine in June 2018. “The doctor told us his kidneys were badly injured, and a week later he passed on. No one was arrested,” he said. Sello died on 6 July and his wife a day later. “What hurt the most was that my wife died of a broken heart,” he said. The pastor said when his wife first started haunting him, he believed it was just his mind playing tricks on him.  She even appeared to him while he was preaching. Elliot said the suspect was out on bail and threatening his family.  Sangoma Majoko Hlongwane (69) said: “The pastor must take a white candle, light it on the grave of his wife and talk to her about things that are bothering her,” she said. Captain Mavela Masondo said the cops had not received a complaint about the family or witnesses being threatened. “We urge them to inform the investigating officer. He said the suspect was due in court yesterday.
