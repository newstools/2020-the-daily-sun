While the country is gearing for a complete shutdown as ordered by President Cyril Ramaphosa, some people have nothing to do. One such person is rapper LTDO, who has taken to social media to ask for nudes, as he is bored and sick. He wrote: "I am feeling a lil bit sick pls send nudes if you care." The national shutdown as ordered by President Cyril Ramaphosa is in full swing as of tomorrow in a bid to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
