HE THOUGHT his coffin pain was gone for good. But now that his two attackers have been released on parole, Victor Mlotshwa (32) lives in fear. The two farmers who shoved Victor into a coffin will be walking freely, and he doesn’t know what to expect should they cross paths. Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson were arrested in Middelburg, Mpumalanga in August 2016 after a video clip went viral on social media showing them forcing the crying Victor into a coffin, and threatening to pour petrol over him to set him alight. This after they accused him of stealing copper cables. Victor said he still has flashbacks of the incident. In 2017, the high court in Middelburg sentenced the duo to 16 and 11 years behind bars after they were found guilty of assault, kidnapping, attempted murder, intimidation and defeating the ends of justice. But the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the attempted murder convictions in December last year. After the men spent two years behind bars, Correctional Supervision and the Parole Board placed Oosthuizen and Jackson on parole last month. In 2018, Daily Sun published Victor’s story. At the time, he had said that he thought his pain was gone after a cleansing ceremony. Victor told the paper he felt like a new person and was ready to move on with his life. “The news of the release of the pair has worsened my mum’s health problems,” said Victor. “I am traumatised and still in shock. “I feel like the justice system has failed me. “This horrific incident will be in my mind until I die.” Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said they had made arrangements with Victor to formally inform him about the pair being placed on parole.
