SUNSPORT has reliably informed that Bidvest Wits have parted ways with Scottish striker Simon Murray, who has returned to the United Kingdom three months earlier than expected. Murray was always unlikely to stay beyond the expiry of his contract at the end of the current Premier Soccer League season, but according to SunSport sources the player has negotiated for an early exit and went back to Scotland. The informant told SunSport: "The player has left South Africa. Remember he sustained a long term injury at the beginning of the season. Now with the coronavirus pandemic having placed South Africa in lockdown and the re-start of the league uncertain, Murray decided to make an early exit". Wits had been helping him with his rehabilitation from a serious knee injury picked up in the third game of the current campaign against Stellenbosch FC, and he is still some way away from full fitness. However, when Wits official Goerge Mogotsi was contacted by the SunSport team regarding Murray he denied the rumor. Mogotsi said: "Murray is my boy, I would be the first person to know if he leaves. He is still with the club I last saw him last Thursday and he is recovering well." Murray scored eight goals in 29 appearances in South African football since arriving from Dundee at the start of the 2018/19 campaign.
