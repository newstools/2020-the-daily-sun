Maritzburg United recorded a narrow 1-0 win over Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership match at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg on Friday night. The victory took the Team of Choice to the fourth spot in the league standings, while Rise and Shine remained 13th on the log. The Team of Choice did most of the attacking in the opening stages of the game, with Thabiso Kutumela causing havoc with his pace. However, the Rise and Shine defence was solid and compact and the hosts could not seriously test Mwenya Chibwe in the Polokwane goal-posts. The visitors were forced to make a change after Chibwe went down due to flu and he was replaced by George Chigova. Zimbabwe international Chigova was then called into action just before halftime and he produced a great save from Keagan Buchanan's deflected free-kick. Polokwane did have a chance to break the deadlock, but Puleng Tlolane's curling effort was well-saved by Maritzburg goalkeeper Richard Ofori. The score was 0-0 at the halftime break following a first half which was dominated by the hosts. The Team of Choice continued to launch attacks after the restart as they looked to break the deadlock. Chigova had to produce a magnificent save to deny Kutumela after the former Orlando Pirates striker had connected well with Buchanan's corner-kick. The attack-minded duo of Gabriel Nyoni and Judas Moseamedi were introduced by Maritzburg coach Eric Tinkler as the hosts searched for a goal. The hosts upped the tempo in the closing stages of the encounter and they deservedly grabbed a late winning goal in the 82nd minute. Daniel Morgan's curling corner-kick was headed home by Daylon Claasen at the far post to seal Maritzburg's 1-0 victory over Polokwane.
