THE deadly Cronavirus has been a menace to society. The sporting world has been impacted as much as everything else with major sporting events around the world suspended until further notice. This has left sports fanatics around the world twiddling their thumbs with no action to look forward to. The athletes themselves have also been left with more time on their hands than they perhaps know what to do with it. But the bigger picture remains – the good health of everyone across the world takes high priority. And famous sports people have made their duty to raise awareness about the deadly virus to help stop the spread. They have been sharing messages of awareness, support and encouragement on social media. Maritzburg United midfielder Miguel Timm is one the players who have taken to social media to spread positive messages. “I would like to encourage everyone to follow protocol in this time of uncertainty,” said Timm. “Take the necessary precautions to play your part in slowing down the spread and getting rid of this virus, for the safety of our country."  His teammates, Richard Ofori and Keagan Buchanan have also shared messages of their own. “Lovely people let us all fight and win this battle against the pandemic that is the Coronavirus,” said Ofori in a video he posted on social media. “Protect yourself and others, stay home. May the good Lord protect us all. Peace.” Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Buchanan’s advice in these trying times is “Be safe. Stay in the house. Take selfies. In that order.”   Other players have shared bible scriptures to encourage people to keep faith in the most high in these tough times. Mark Mayambela wrote: “Issiah 26:20. Go, my people, enter your rooms shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.” Chiefs star Lebogang Manyama wrote: “Lord we put everything in your hands for you have always been with us on bad days as much as you have always been with us good days.”
