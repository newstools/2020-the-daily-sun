THE family of Christopher Donsta was left devastated after he was brutally murdered by robbers on Tuesday while waiting for his wife. Family member Ntombelanga Mlilwana (52) told Daily Sun Christopher, from Luzuko in Cape Town, was fetching his wife from work at the bus stop. While he was waiting in the car, four suspects approached him and ordered him out. However, Christopher couldn’t answer as he was deaf. “It is painful. Maybe the suspects thought he was refusing but he couldn’t understand them or talk,” she said. Ntombelanga said as Christopher’s wife approached the car, he signalled at her to go back. “He was clever because they would have killed her, too. His wife is also deaf and can’t speak,” she said. Provincial director of DeafSA Jabbar Mohamed said Christopher’s death had left a void in the organisation. “He was our acting provincial chairman and deaf teacher. “This does not only affect his family but everyone who worked with him,” he said. “We have lost an unbelievable leader. He was always taking part in DeafSA activities. He was not supposed to die like that. The robbers could have just taken what they wanted and let him live.” Police spokesman Sergeant Mihlali Majikela said the case was being investigated. He said the suspects fled the scene in the victim’s vehicle. Cases of murder, attempted murder and hijacking were opened but no arrests have been made.
