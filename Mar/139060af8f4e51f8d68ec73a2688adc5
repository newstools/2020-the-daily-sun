THE DA says Mabopane Railway Station is an example of another failed ANC project. Tshwane portfolio committee on roads and transport member Sandy Mbuvha recently said the station had become a den for thugs and drug users. “The delay in the refurbishment of the station in Mabopane has been a cause for controversy due to allegations of corruption by Prasa,” she said. “The delay has resulted in the station housing drugs and thugs. It has turned into their haven of crime.” The DA said the delay of the project was a huge concern. Mbuvha said the station was supposed to be completed next year at a cost of R1,1 billion, but she didn’t see that happening. She said the delay affected thousands of hawkers and millions of commuters. “The station has been under construction for almost 10 years now. After the DA took over the City of Tshwane in 2016, many complaints were lodged with Prasa but no one responded.” “Nyaope boys and drug dealers have turned the place into a hub for drug dealing. Security has been compromised and we need guards.” Mbuvha said the station was dirty and people threw rubbish near it. “We also blame the local councillor for failing to report the matter to the municipality,” she said. Prasa administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo said a lot of effort was being put into fixing services. He said 63% of railway power stations and 52% of railway line had been vandalised. Mpondo said limited train services could start on the Mabopane line in September and full service next April. “It’s difficult to operate under such conditions. We want to get an interim solution while we are still busy with construction,” Mpondo said.
