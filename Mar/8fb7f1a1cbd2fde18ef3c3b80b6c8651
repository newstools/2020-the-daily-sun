FOR students and pupils to get the right skills for the fourth industrial revolution, companies should take them in and expose them to relevant technical opportunities. Sureswipe is leading the way and steering Mzansi’s young people towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) careers. Recently, the organisation announced an internship programme in partnership with WeThinkCode, a non-profit organisation that aims to close the digital skills gap in Africa. By placing two interns in the organisation at the Sureswipe Joburg and Cape Town offices, the aim is to enable students to gain more hands-on experience. Students get to work on meaningful projects and seeing the impact of their work on the business. Said Richard Flack, managing director at Sureswipe: “We celebrated our 10th anniversary in 2018 and decided to look at ways to give back to communities. We’re passionate about independent retailers and the success of their businesses, why not focus on young talent?” The company has always believed in the power of partnerships. Dylan Richts, head of Partnerships at WeThinkCode, said they trained youth with no prior coding experience. “This is only possible with the continued support of forward-thinking companies such as Sureswipe that doesn’t only fund the education of these youngsters but also invests time in the process of upskilling them,” he said. According to Richard, it is important to foster a love for STEM studies among future technology and business leaders. He said this would ultimately create a stronger and happier nation in the future.
