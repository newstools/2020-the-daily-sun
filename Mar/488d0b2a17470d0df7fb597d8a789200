HIGHLANDS Park coach Owen da Gama has slammed his players for a lacklustre performance as they went down 2-0 to SuperSport United in their league match at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday. A livid Da Gama lamented the absence of the “three soldiers”, who were not available for selection. Highlands will have to show more grit, if they are to really dominate matches at home.First half goals from Aubrey Modiba and Bradley Grobler ensured United their sixth win out of 12 league matches away. But questions will be asked of Highlands’ insipid performance at home as they dropped yet another league points to Matsatsantsa this season, not to mention the top-eight final loss. Guily Manziba repaid the faith Kaitano Tembo showed in him, providing the cross for Modiba, who finished off to put United ahead in the 20th minute. The man-of-the-match award winner started his second game for United and soon had Tembo nodding in approval as he contributed his second assist in two matches. The Congolese has fitted like a hand to glove, just as Thatayaone Ditlhokwe, who partnered Clayton Daniels in the heart of defence.Although Highlands created more chance, United dominated the scoreline, with Bradley Grobler adding the second on the stroke of halftime. Without common injury setbacks this season, Bafana Bafana international has contributed more to the cause for United, as seen when he headed in his 12 goals of the season from a corner kick. On the other hand, Peter Shalulile huffed and puffed running short of supply.Shalulile has been the king of the jungle at Makhulong, but yesterday watched like as ageing “Mufasa” as Manziba displayed the energy of Simba. Highlands could still qualify for the top-eight spot come the end of the season.But such result could well cost them that lucrative spot. “We have to take stock and see where we are. This is poor,” a seething Owen Da Gama said afterwards.
