A MAN was rescued by Reaction Unit South Africa security guards on Saturday. The 34-year-old was about to be attacked by angry residents of Waterloo in Verulam, north of Durban. He allegedly raped two young girls over the past two weeks. Spokesman Prem Balrum said the man was accused of raping his 11-year-old stepsister and her friend (8). He said the suspect visited his stepfather’s house while the parents were at a wedding. “The child informed a neighbour she did not want to be left alone with her stepbrother. She believed he wanted to rape her again.” The suspect had on several occasions allegedly fondled and raped his stepsister and the friend who lives a few houses away. He said the neighbour then spoke to the friend’s mum, who admitted the child had been complaining of pain in her punani for almost two weeks. She had thought the child injured herself while playing. “When they questioned the eight-year-old, she claimed the suspect came to her friend’s home two weeks ago while they were playing,” said Balrum. “She said he led them to the back of the property, where he undressed them and began kissing them before he asked them to face the wall and raped them behind a tree. “She claimed he penetrated them on three different occasions.” News of the rape spread throughout the kasi and a mob gathered outside the house. “The suspect, a dad of three, locked himself inside. Guards entered the house and placed him under arrest.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Twe rape cases involving kids aged eight and 11 were opened and a 34-year-old suspect was bust. He will appear in court today.”
