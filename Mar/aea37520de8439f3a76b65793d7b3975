 An 85-year-old woman was found murdered in her rondavel in
Vininda Village, Dutywa, in the Eastern Cape on Saturday morning. According to provincial police spokesperson Brigadier
Tembinkosi Kinana, a preliminary investigation revealed that the woman was
asleep alone in her hut on Friday when she was shot in the upper body. Her body was found the following morning by relatives who

established. However, the provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General
