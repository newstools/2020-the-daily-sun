PLEASE, bring back my baby! These were the words of devastated mum Dipuo Nyambiri after her three-month-old son Tshegofatso was stolen from her on Friday. The 35-year-old said she made a big mistake when she trusted a stranger at Mamelodi Clinic in Tshwane to hold her baby. She said she was waiting for Tshegofatso’s monthly immunisation when a woman sitting next to her offered to hold him. Dipuo said the woman seemed like a nice person and they were talking. But load shedding then hit the clinic. “It became dark for a moment and when the lights came back on, another woman came to me and told me they were stealing my baby,” she said. Dipuo said at first, she thought it was a joke but when she looked around, the woman and her baby had disappeared. “I ran outside to find her but she was gone. I told the nurses and the security guards to help me look for her,” she said. Struggling to hold back her tears, Dipuo told the SunTeam she had been unable to sleep or eat since Tshegofatso was taken. “I want to hold and feed him. He must be crying wherever he is. I don’t know if the woman is feeding him or changing his nappies,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the Sotho speaking suspect was aged about 30, short in height, with short hair. She was wearing a grey top, orange leggings and grey and white takkies. Masondo said a case of kidnapping was opened and anyone with information should contact the police on 012 812 9062/3/4 or 08600 10111.
