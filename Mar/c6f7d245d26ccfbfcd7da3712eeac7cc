South Africans stuck on the wrong side of flight cancellations – amid a massive decline in air traffic due to the Covid-19 outbreak and related travel bans – are on their own for the time being. So far no decision has been taken to repatriate South African citizens from other parts of the world, a spokesperson for the department of international relations and cooperation (Dirco) told Business Insider South Africa on Sunday.Via missions abroad, the government is "interacting with authorities of the countries" where citizens are stuck, though, and information is being fed to SA's National Command Council, which is expected to announce new measures around the novel coronavirus after a meeting on Sunday. A special flight was arranged to evacuated South African citizens from Wuhan, China, during the lockdown in that city.
