KZN government has promised to send more water tankers to informal settlements and rural areas curb the spread of coronavirus. This was announced by premier Sihle Zikalala at a media briefing on Friday in Durban. He said they have received complaints of shortage of water in some parts of the province mainly in the informal settlements and rural areas. Zikalala also issued a strong warning to sheebeen owners who were said to have taken an opportunity to make money during the lockdown. He said there are people who decided to take an advantage that people will be at their homes and won't be able to access liquorÂ  as bottle stores are closed. He said those people including tavern owners stocked liquor in big numbers and decided to open back doors for people to buy. "We are coming to those areas with police so we appeal to people to stop that because when police come they are the ones who will cry," said Zikalala.
