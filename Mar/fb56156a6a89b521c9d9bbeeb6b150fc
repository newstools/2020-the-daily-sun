MANY potential partners have been shown the door since Zahara broke up with her partner about a year ago. But wedding bells may soon be ringing because the Queen of Afro pop may have found her Prince Charming.  Rumours said the man who may have captured her heart is a pastor and there will be no sex before the ceremony. A source close to the Loliwe hitmaker told Daily Sun she may even get married before the end of the year, but there won’t be a lot of hype as Zahara wanted to keep the event low key. READ: SJAVA ANGERS FANS! “She wants it to be a perfect wedding with only a few invited guests,” said the source. “Ever since she broke up with her ex, different men have come forward to express their feelings for her. “I think this time she has found someone who matches her requirements.” In November last year, Zahara told Daily Sun she was open to love. She said she didn’t care about looks, as long as he feared God. The source could not say whether Mr Zahara was a pastor or not. She said he’s a churchgoer and makes her happy. Zahara, who was in Cape Town after a weekend performance, spoke to Daily Sun over telephone. “Where did you get this now?” she said, laughing. “Well, yes. I might get married soon. Maybe before the end of the year. But I can’t reveal who it is.” Asked if she was really abstaining from sex until after the wedding, she said: “I haven’t had sex since I broke up with my ex. Sex is the last thing on my mind. I think, yes, I’m now saving myself for marriage.” READ: I HATE LOBOLA! Zahara said her life was too busy for sex anyway. Said Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana: “I’m busy preparing for the launch of the partnership between myself and Emperors Palace on 25 April.

I really don’t want to talk much about my relationship for now.”
