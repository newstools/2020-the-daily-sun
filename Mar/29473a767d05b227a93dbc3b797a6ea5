Kairo is following in the footsteps of her mom, and it's the cutest thing. The 4-year-old showed off her DJing skills, pretending to work a turntable while her mother, DJ Zinhle, filmed her. With headphones on and music blasting in the background, Kairo moves to the beat, toggles a few knobs, and raises her hand in the air the way Zinhle does while DJing. "DJ school," the post is captioned on Instagram. So does Kairo have a future as a DJ? Everyone in the comments seems to think so, and we agree. CHECK OUT DJ KAIRO HERE:  DJ school ??
