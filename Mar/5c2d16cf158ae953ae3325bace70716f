FOR the past week, a 19-year-old pupil has been scared to attend lessons. He claims one of the directors at a private school in Makapanstad assaulted him last Tuesday. The teenager from Makapanstad, North West, said he had a gun pointed at him and was threatened with death for arriving late at school. “I arrived late at school with three other pupils and the security guards said we must go to the office to report ourselves,” he said.

I fell and he pushed me towards the school gate. “I ran and climbed over the gate. I told him I would report him to the police,” he said. The pupil said he walked to the taxi rank, but the director followed him in his car with a gun and said he would kill him. “A taxi came and he drove away. I haven’t been to school since then. I’m scared he will kill me,” he said. The pupil’s 59-year-old father said he was not happy with how his son was treated.

The father said although he wanted his son to do well at school, he didn’t want him to be murdered. Police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said cases of pointing a firearm and assault were opened. “No arrests have been made yet, and the police are still investigating,” she said.
