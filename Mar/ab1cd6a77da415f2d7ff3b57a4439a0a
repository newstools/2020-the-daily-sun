SUPERMARKETS have appealed to shoppers to stop panic buying. After President Cyril Ramaphosa declared coronavirus a national disaster on Sunday evening, toilet paper and hand sanitiser started flying off the shelves. As a result, a number of retail chains have appealed to customers to be considerate towards others who might still have to do their shopping. Massmart, Clicks and the Shoprite group experienced large numbers of customers buying in bulk. Shoprite CEO Pieter Engelbrecht said: “We have new stock arriving regularly and we are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked.” In order to avoid overcrowding and long queues, Engelbrecht advised customers to shop online. “We understand consumers’ concerns but appeal to them to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the items they need,” he said. Boxer Superstores spokesman Jason McCall said their shops were operating normally. However, Pick n Pay had to start restricting the number of certain items each customer was allowed to buy at a time. “We have set a limit of six units per customer on a small number of products,” said the store. Shopper Themba Shabalala (44) told Daily Sun people were overreacting. “When people rush to supermarkets like that, they risk catching the disease they are afraid of,” he said. Tshidiso Koena (33) said: I struggled to get toilet paper yesterday so from now on, I will buy in bulk.” Intercape bus supervisor France Ramoganyaka said commuters with a temperature of over 38 degrees would not be allowed on buses but would be refunded.
