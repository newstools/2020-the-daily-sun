MZANSI’S power utility
has announced that it will be implementing stage 4 loadshedding this afternoon. The utility says this
is due to the Koeberg unit 1 which tripped. “The unit has been discontinued
from the grid due to a fault on the turbine side, however the nuclear reactor
remains safe,” the utility said. Eskom says as the
ageing fleet is currently constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable, they advise
South Africans that the stage of loadshedding may change at short notice should
there be any unexpected change in the generation system performance.
