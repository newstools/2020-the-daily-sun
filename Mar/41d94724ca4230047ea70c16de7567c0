Hard work has finally paid off for muso Mvzzle after scoring a major deal with Warner Music SA. He collaborated with DJ Zinhle on her record breaking song Umlilo. It's only fitting then that DJ Zinhle was one of the first people to congratulate the star on his achievement. "We’re incredibly excited to welcome @MVZZLESA to the Warner Music South Africa family."Mvzzle is currently in studio putting the finishing touches on his first major label release. Watch this space," the company wrote on its social media pages.  Last week at the DSTVMVAs, the pair stole the show when they performed their hit song Umlilo.
