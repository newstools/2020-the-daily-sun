Lungi Ngidi's 6/58 stole the show in the second ODI against Australia in Bloemfontein on Wednesday as the Proteas cruised to a six-wicket victory that gave them a valuable series win. Ngidi shared man-of-the-match with Janneman Malan, who carded a superb 129* (139) to see the hsts over the line. As Ngidi Tweeted on Thursday: "Yesterday was a good day for South African cricket." It has been a long road back to full fitness for the 23-year-old Ngidi, who reached another significant milestone on Wednesday when he became the fastest South African to 50 wickets in ODI cricket. It took Ngidi just 26 ODIs to reach that milestone, getting there one match quicker than left-arm seamer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who took 27 matches. The achievement drew a response on social media from Proteas speedster Kagiso Rabada, who is currently out injured. "What a star," Rabada Tweeted. Ngidi, who has also played 5 Tests and 13 T20s for South Africa, has been included in the ODI squad for a three-match tour of India later this month. -Sport
