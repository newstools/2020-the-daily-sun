ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini wants to have a serious talk with President Cyril Ramaphosa. He wants the president to cancel the new sex education curriculum expected to be taught at schools. Zwelithini was speaking at the official opening of the KZN legislature at the Pietermaritzburg Royal Show Grounds yesterday. The king invited parents and civic organisations to accompany him when he meets the president to show their disapproval of the comprehensive sexuality education programme. He was shocked that the government had failed to consult with him or with parents before approving it. Zwelithini said talking to kids about sex was the responsibility of parents. “As a custodian of culture, I find it disturbing that while I’m discouraging young girls from engaging in sex through the reed dance, the government is doing the opposite by teaching our daughters how to engage in sex,” he said. “I want to warn the government that this will encourage sexual engagement among kids at schools because they want to experiment with what they have been taught in theory.” Premier Sihle Zikalala said he would pass the king’s message to the national government.
