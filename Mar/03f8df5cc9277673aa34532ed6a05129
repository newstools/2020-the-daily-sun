The Gauteng Department of Education says more than 97 Grade 4 to 7 learners from Soshangaan Primary School in Tshwane, were rushed to hospital on Thursday morning after eating fat cakes from a local vendor. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the school was alerted after the learners started complaining of stomach cramps. “Preliminary investigations reveal that the affected learners bought fat cakes from a local vendor on route to school (on Thursday) morning,” Mabona said. "The learners then complained of stomach cramps, whereby the school issued an EMS and outbreak alert. Learners were then swiftly transported to clinics where they were attended to and later discharged,” he added. Mabona further said samples of the fat cakes were taken to a lab for testing. “The Psycho-Social Team was dispatched to the school for necessary support. Furthermore, fat cake samples were taken by Environmental Health Practitioners for lab analysis,” he said.
