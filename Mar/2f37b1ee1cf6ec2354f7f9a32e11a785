REAL Kings coach Michael Lukhubeni has promised to inflict a lot of pain on PSL outfit Bidvest Wits when they clash in the quarter-finals of the Nedbank Cup at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium tomorrow (8pm). It was a dream come true for the Kings new coach when they drew the 2010 winners of the Ke Yona Cup at home. Lukhubeni is excited because he believes he can create a major upset and make history for Kings. Lukhubeni was disappointed with the draw in the first two rounds of the cup, when his side were paired against clubs from the lower leagues. He badly wanted to play against a top PSL side. Lukhubeni has promised Gavin Hunt’s Clever Boys will suffer. “A PSL team is always easy to plan against because they don’t want contact, they don’t want man-marking,” said Lukhubeni. “So when you play against them they are not difficult. Against a Motsepe League or Championship side, they are always willing to run 90 minutes.” Lukhubeni left Championship rivals Steenberg United last month to bring glory to the KwaZulu-Natal outfit and to satisfy club owner and prominent Durban businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize’s lofty ambitions for her club. Lukhubeni believes the Ke Yona Cup is a perfect vehicle for him to put the KZN club in the spotlight. He is looking forward to meeting the high riding Students: “When I’m playing at home, I believe that you can’t beat me in my house, they will suffer. “I have to protect my house. I need to stand up. So Wits are coming to our house, they must feel the pain,” said Lukhubeni. This will be Kings’ first home tie in the Ke Yona competition. Kings reached the quarter-finals after defeating ABC Motsepe League side Passion FC 3-2 in the first round. In the Last-16, they defeated Championship side Mbombela United 2-1. Meanwhile, Wits come into this cup tie on the back of a 1-0 league win over bottom side Black Leopards at the Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday night.
