KAIZER Chiefs and Zambian legend Collins “Ntofontofo” Mbesuma says it’s tough to predict who will finish this season’s Absa Premiership as the leading goal-scorer. Orlando Pirates striker Gabadinho Mhango is leading the pack with 14 goals, followed by Bradley Grobler (SuperSport United), Peter Shalulile (Highlands Park) and Bongi Ntuli (AmaZulu), on 12 goals each. But 36-year-old Mbesuma yesterday told SunSport it wasn’t easy to tell who’d win the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot. The University of Pretoria striker said all the leading strikers have been inconsistent. “The problem with our strikers is they can score in two or three consecutive matches, but go for four matches without a goal,” said Mbesuma, who has also played for all of Mzansi’s big three PSL teams. “Look, when last did Mhango score a goal? I think he has now gone three matches without a goal. So that is why I’m saying it is not easy to say who will finish as leading scorer. “A striker needs to be consistent. If you look at European leagues, those guys score goals. But let’s wait and see when the season resumes after the coronavirus problem.” Mbesuma predicts the winner will report 16 goals, a number already scored by Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda to win Golden Boot in the past season. “I am enjoying playing like when I was 21,” said the old horse who refuses to hang up his boots. “My legs can carry me for more seasons. All I have to do is to take care of myself and work hard.” Mbesuma felt sorry for Musonda, a shadow of his former self in the past season, who’s only managed five goals and his club are facing the axe at the foot of the log. “Pressure got to him to repeat his form of last season and it does not work like that,” said the 2005 PSL Player of the Season. “The combination Musonda had with his teammates of last season isn’t there anymore. Leopards keep changing its team, which is their downfall. It’s difficult for Musonda. I am sure he will bounce back.”
