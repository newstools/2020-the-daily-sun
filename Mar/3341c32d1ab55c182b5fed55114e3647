PRESIDENT
Cyril Ramaphosa announced a nationwide lockdown on Monday. The lockdown
will restrict Mzansi citizens from going around except for when they go to the
supermarkets to buy food, medication and banking services. The shutdown
means that only health workers, the police, emergency services and soldiers
will be allowed to go to work.
