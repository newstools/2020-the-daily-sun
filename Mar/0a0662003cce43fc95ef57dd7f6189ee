Africa’s popular annual Joburg International Comedy Festival has been postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The festival was due to take place at Joburg Theatre from 15-18 April. The announcement follows President Cyril Ramaphosa declaring Mzansi a national state of disaster recently, which also restricts international and domestic travel over the next 30 days. The festival board and its partners decided to postpone the festival until further notice in the best interests of ticket holders and fans. “In light of the president’s recent address, we’ve had to make the difficult but yet most sensible decision to postpone the festival to a later date. Bigger than comedy, our primary concern is the health and welfare of our artists, staff and audiences. With that said, we now join the rest of the country in combating the spread of Covid-19. We thank everyone that’s supported us thus far and look forward to putting together a great festival in the not so distant future.” said Takunda Bimha, the festival's founder and director. More information and new festival dates will be made available in due course. Ticket holders can retain their tickets for future dates, alternatively for refunds, please contact www.webtickets.co.za , www.joburgtheatre.com or by calling 0861 670 670. The board, together with its sponsors and partners, said they were committed to ensuring a world-class celebration of comedy for all involved and fanscould expect a jam-packed comedy experience showcasing international, continental and local comedy stars at a later stage.
