THE governing system in municipalities has failed. Speaking at a Salga lekgotla in Polokwane, association president Thembi Nkadimeng said the high number of interventions showed that the system needed to be changed. About 41 municipalities have been placed under administration for failure to deliver. “Out of the 41, 16 are coming back to section 139 repeatedly,” said Nkadimeng. “Immediately after you remove the administrator, the municipality collapses. “National and provincial government need to monitor and support local government to ensure problems are detected and required support is given when they can’t perform.” Most of the problems were due to political instability. Chairman of the co-operative governance select committee, China Dodovu, said most of the municipalities under administration had been opposed to intervention in the first place. “We must understand intervention signifies there are serious challenges we are facing and is necessary,” said Dodovu.
