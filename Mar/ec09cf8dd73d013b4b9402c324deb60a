A 35-year-old truck driver was killed last night after a
load of steel beams he was transporting shifted and crushed the driver’s cab. The incident happened on General Hertzog Street, Three Rivers, just outside Vereeniging. The ER24 spokesperson, Ross Campbell said paramedics along with the Fire Department arrived on scene at 7:34 pm to find that an entire truck-load of 6-meter steel beams had ripped through the back head of the trailer and landed on top of the cab. “One person was found to be entrapped and unresponsive. The Fire Department was unable to extract the patient before a crane was brought in to lift the beams. The rescue operation took around four hours. Unfortunately, the driver showed no signs of life and was declared dead on the scene. The South African Police Services were on the scene for further investigations,” said Campbell.
