With most people being in self-isolation, it seems the elephants in China are having the time of their life. This comes after a Reddit user shared a photo of two elephants passed out in a garden after eating corn wine. "While humans carry out social distancing, a group of 14 elephants broke into a village in Yunnan province looking for corn or food. They ended up drinking 30kg of corn wine and got so drunk that they fell asleep in a nearby tea garden." the post said. The post then made it to Twitter but was later verified to be fake. According to Daily Mail, The local authorities in Menghai County, Yunnan, deny rumours that a herd of elephants drank 30kg liquor to The Paper. They actually didn't pass out in a tea garden due to liquor but they went downhill and intruded into villagers homes. The elephants even caused damages to the houses and there are several images for proof. Check tweet:
