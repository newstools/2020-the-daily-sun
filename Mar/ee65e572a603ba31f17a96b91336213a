Fashion designer Gavin Rajah was this week moved to tears by his employees. This after they decided to make masks out of some left-over fabrics. The internationally acclaimed designer took to his Facebook to share an emotional message to them. He wrote: â€œI am so touched by my staff who have taken leftover fabrics from the studio and made these masks for free distribution I could not be any prouder of these angels."  Although many people offered to buy a few from the designer, Gavin made it clear that the masks were strictly for the needy and homeless people who could not afford medical care during this shut down.
