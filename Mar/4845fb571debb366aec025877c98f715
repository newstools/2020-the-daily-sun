THE deadly coronavirus will not only be hurtful to players, but clubs will be forced to fork out more money. The remainder of the seven Absa Premiership matches will be a bit tricky for players who have already committed to moves to new clubs by having signed pre-contracts. They face the risk of either forfeiting money or not getting their players. To make matters worse, their current clubs could be forced to pay their new clubs’ holding on fees for using their players for the remainder of the season, as their contract would have lapsed. Player managers are also left red-faced quarantined without making any moves, and well-known player agent Jazzman Mahlakgane, who among others manages Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Themba Zwane, said his players’ plans are on hold. “If the league stopped, it pushes everything forward,” he explained. “It’s like everything is on holiday, you can’t move if the league said we cannot proceed. Even if you signed a pre-contract stating that you start on 1 July, it can be 1 October, nobody knows what will happen.” Mahlakgane said engaging teams about contracts will add more stress to management. Mike Makaab, who has Andile Jali and former Kaizer Chiefs striker Knowledge Musona under his stable, is also in the dark. “To move the season forward means automatically the players’ contracts have also been extended. I don’t think it’s a difficult situation, it’s just that the calendar has been moved forward by a month.” But Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi, who manages Orlando Pirates defender Justice Chabalala, who is currently on loan to Bloemfontein Celtic, said players hold the key when their contract expires. “It’s a player’s choice whether to stay or go to his new club. He can also show loyalty to his current employers by staying with them until the season is over.”
