A WOMAN said she always warned her teenage daughter to stay away from gangsters. The 37-year-old mum spoke out after members of the IJP gang in Thabong in Welkom, Free State, accused her 15-year-old of being in love with a member of the rival Al-Qaeda gang and tried to kidnap her. This led to the girl’s gogo (69) being stabbed to death in her bed over the weekend. The mum said she blamed her daughter for the gogo’s death. “It was about 1am when the gang broke into our house and tried to take my daughter away. They were armed with steel rods and pangas,” she said. “My daughter was with my mother in her bedroom and they grabbed her. “The gang accused my daughter of being a whore for being in a relationship with a member of a rival gang. She said her mum died because she was trying to stop them from taking her daughter. “My daughter was also stabbed in her hands and I was stabbed in the arm when I tried to stop them.” The mum said her daughter was no longer going to school and they were staying with relatives. Councillor Tlake Khoarai said after the post mortem had been finalised, plans would be made to take the gogo’s body to her hometown in the Eastern Cape for burial. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said four of the suspects appeared in the Welkom Magistrates Court on a charge of murder and would appear again next week. He said they were believed to be IJP members. Two more suspects, allegedly also from IJP, would be appearing soon while seven Al-Qaeda members were charged with arson, malicious damage to property and possession of a dangerous weapon.
