The usual Joburg rush with high traffic volume and taxis hooting had gone quite. There were no street vendors, stores closed and fewer cars driving by. Instead voices and loud music could be heard coming from residential buildings. Many were chilling at their balconies overlooking the streets.On Friday afternoon, police visibility remained high as the lockdown have come into effect. The Joburg Metro police officers and Saps were patrolling the streets of Braamfontein, Hillbrow and the inner city.  They randomly stopped pedestrians and vehicles to find out where they were going. This was after a number of people tried to break the lockdown rules early in the morning. Most streets in Braamfontein were empty with security guards spotted exercising their duties. In the CBD and Hillbrow a number of people were spotted making their way to different destination and lining up at grocery stores to buy food. Thulani Nkosi (37), lives in Braamficher, Soweto and works at a supermarket in the CBD.  He said: “It’s strange to walk around town when there are fewer people. But people are ignorant and still take chances like life is normal. Coronavirus is not a joke and they should stay home.” Another retail worker, Nthabiseng Komane (32) said: “I feel that the police haven’t been doing much. We still see people roaming around without any valid reason. We were expecting to see soldiers and police in every corner. We have to be at work and they are endangering our lives by being outside for nothing.” However, outside Brea taxi rank, there was a large number of commuters, very close to each other, with very little healthy measures being practised.
