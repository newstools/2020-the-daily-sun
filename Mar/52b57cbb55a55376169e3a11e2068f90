FOR years, the PAC has claimed Human Rights Day as its holiday. The holiday commemorates the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 where 69 peaceful protesters were gunned down in the Vaal kasi by apartheid cops. The SunTeam sat down with PAC secretary-general Apa Pooe so he could explain why the day was associated with the party.  He said on 21 March 1960, the party called on South Africans to stand up against pass laws. “Robert Sobukwe made that call. Before 1960, there had been protests but no mass protests. “Marches were held throughout the country but two became known worldwide, those in Sharpeville and Langa. “As a result of the response to these protests, apartheid was declared a crime against humanity,” Pooe said. “Our people were killed during this protest and 32 card-carrying members were shot and killed.”  Pooe said the PAC would commemorate the day at Phelindaba Cemetery in Sharpeville tomorrow, as it did every year, but it would be scaled back to make sure there were fewer than 100 people. “Before democracy, the PAC was the only party commemorating this day. Nelson Mandela never even declared it a public holiday. The PAC had to fight for it to be made a holiday. It only happened in 1996,” he said. When asked why there were always two events on the commemoration day, Pooe said the ANC had hijacked the PAC’s day to divide people and even excluded some families. “We do not want to be associated with a political party that divides the people,” he said.
