ON SATURDAY night, Mzansi’s favourite celebrities were honoured. Warren Masemola shone at the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards at the Ticketpro Dome in Joburg when he was named Favourite Actor. He couldn’t hold back his excitement while on stage and even swore at times. In his speech, he thanked his mum, his colleague on The River Presley Chweneyagae and his fans who voted for him. He said: “I love you, South Africa. You got me stupid, like a mother f**ker.” Speaking to the SunTeam at the event, he said he didn’t take the country’s support for granted. Eyebrows were raised when dancer and amapiano artist Kamo Mphela stormed off stage during her performance, but it later came out it was because her trousers had torn. She said she had no idea how bad the tear was and chose to walk off out of respect for the audience. “I did a full wardrobe check but as a performer, especially a dancer, one can never know when and where an incident such as this will happen,” she said. Sindi Dlathu took home the Favourite Actress Award for her role as the villain Lindiwe on The River. She thanked her husband, family and colleagues. Ukhozi FM’s Kathide “Tshatha” Ngobe won the Favourite Radio Personality and Ultimate Viewers’ Choice awards. He said: “I’m so grateful to my listeners, who always inspire me to be my best.” Producer and songwriter Lebo M won the Legend Award and performed his song Circle of Life. Other winners included DJ Kabza De Small, Moshe Ndiki and Bonang Matheba. Minnie Dlamini-Jones was the host.
