Have you ever heard the statement "vagina smells like fish!" That is how a lot of people describe the smell of the vagina, however, there are some men that love that "fishy smell". The natural smell of the vagina might not be appealing to other men but it surely does turn some on. Most men understand that the smell of the vagina is normal and find it to be arousing. The truth of the matter is that men want women to be ready for them during sex the same way women want men to be ready for them. Oral sex can be a source of insecurity for women. It seems everyone has their own idea of how the vagina must smell. As much as some men find the natural smell of a vagina arousing, there are other men that find it unappealing. We have to understand that everyone is different and what works for someone might not work for the other. The best way to go about this is to find out what your man likes. If he does not like the natural smell of your punani, do not feel offended. The most important thing that women must know is that as long as you have no medical issues going on down there, then the smell of your punani is absolutely fine. Some men have described the punani smell as a mixture of sweets and sweat, some say it smells of tomatoes and urine but whatever the smell is, punani will always smell like punani and everyone must understand that.
