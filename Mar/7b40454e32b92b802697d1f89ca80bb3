A British tourist has been slammed for
flying to a tourist hot spot shortly after being diagnosed with coronavirus
despite being told to self-isolate. According to Mail Online, the woman, 36, who had been in Australia
less than a week, tested positive for the illness in Sydney before travelling
to Hamilton Island on Friday, in Queensland's Whitsundays. NSW health authorities contacted their
counterparts in Queensland, who tracked the woman down on a beach on Sunday,
the Courier Mail reports. She spent the night in isolation on the
island before being taken by boat to Mackay, where she is currently in
hospital. The UK national is understood to have
told health authorities that she did not understand their instruction to self
isolate upon receiving her results. Hamilton Island spokeswoman confirmed in
a statement that an international visitor had tested positive for COVID-19. 'Hamilton Island would like to stress
that the safety and wellbeing of our guests and staff on the island is of
utmost priority,' it read. 'We would like to remind anyone
travelling to the island about the importance of strictly following the advice
of the government and health authorities during this uncertain time.' The spokeswoman said Queensland Health
advised there would be no need to close the island as the incident was a 'very
low risk'.
