Linda Zwane’s BMW e30 will keep up with many modern-day performance vehicles and it even klaps the A45 AMG in a drag race. This is a story of two twin brothers who are passionate about fast cars that have timeless appeal. Linda and his brother, Lindo, both own e30s, but the one we’ll be taking a special focus on is the Gusheshe that had social media in a craze when it killed a Mercedes-Benz A45 AMG. Thanks to the legendary Lexus modified 1JZ engine, this e30 beast is as good as a cheetah on a straight line. Now, being able to compete with modern cars that are equipped with launch control and still beat them wasn’t going to be an easy task – but Linda had an ace up his sleeve.  Knowing that the 1JZ had plenty of modification power potential, he knew that he had to use a gearbox that would be able to handle all the horses and lay them on the ground. He began with a stock standard 1JZ motor and added a precision 6262 turbo with dump valves and wastegate was done by Turbonetics. Following that he added an e36 M3 gearbox with an LSD that was built by Fulrace Engineering. The management system and wiring was done by his friend Thando Mtshali.  After the car was finished, it delivers 272,18 kW and 433 Nm to the wheels – he says he built the car specifically for racing. Linda says he had a choice to spin or race, and he chose racing because he loves speed. According to Linda race cars last longer than spinning cars. The beast obliterates the Mercedes-Benz C63 in the quarter-mile which is (400m), but in the 800m it loses to the C63, as the Merc edges it. The man from Dundee bought the stock standard e30 in 2018 and drove it for a while before he got bored with it – which led to him throwing R250k into the project so far.
