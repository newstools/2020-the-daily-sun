A Warrant of arrest is out for National Assembly speaker, Thandi Modise. She is said to have failed to appear in the Potchefstroom Regional Court on charges of animal abuse against her earlier today. Modise’s court case dates back to 2014 when the National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) obtained a warrant to inspect animals on a farm in the North West belonging to her. The organization received a tip off that animals on the property had been abandoned. In her defence at the time, Modise said her farm manager had left to attend to a family emergency. This follows AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit’s announcement last year that it would be privately prosecuting Modise on behalf of the National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA). A warrant for her arrest was issued pending her appearance in court on 31 March 2020. Modise’s legal representative argued that she was asked by President Cyril Ramaphosa to help manage the COVID-19-pandemic. Head Investigator at Afriforum’s private prosecution unit, Andrew Leask said the Magistrate wanted reasons, however, why Modise could not delegate her duties or communicate to the President that she had to appear in court on serious charges. “Modise will have to explain on 31 March why she had been absent, after which the prosecution can hopefully commence. It is unacceptable for Modise not appearing in court today, and simply arguing that the reason for her absence is her office,” he said. He said no one is above the law, not even the Speaker of the National Assembly. “AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit is looking forward to the commencement of the hearing. Modise will eventually have to answer for this cruel case of animal abuse,” said Leask.
