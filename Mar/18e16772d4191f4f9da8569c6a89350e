FORMER SACP general secretary Chris Hani’s killer, Janusz Walus, was denied parole. This was announced by the Department of Justice and Correctional Service yesterday. The minister, Ronald Lamola, was ordered by the Gauteng North High Court in October last year to reconsider within 60 days the decision taken in January last year by former Minister Michael Masutha to refuse granting Walus parole.

It stated that even positive factors attributed to the offender were considered. “Placing offender Walus on parole would negate the severity that the court sought when sentencing him,” said Lamola. “With this premise and balancing both negative and positive factors, the placement on parole of offender Walus is not approved at this stage.” The department said the minister considered negative factors such as the nature and seriousness of the cold-blooded political assassination committed by Walus, and the fact that the court sought to impose the severest punishment the law permits. Walus is serving a life sentence at Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Tshwane for assassinating Hani in 1993. During his parole hearing last year, SACP secretary general Blade Nzimande said Walus needed to tell the truth on who ordered him to kill Hani.
