WHEN radio and TV personality Relebogile Mabotja announced last year that she had scored a major gig as deputy chairperson of the South African Music Rights Organisation (Samro), she was hailed as the youngest woman to ever clinch such a job. But the Metro FM presenter is no longer with Samro. Her name and profile has also been removed from Samro’s board of directors on the website. Insiders at the organisation claim her exit from the company was kept under wraps. Claimed an insider: “We started seeing her not coming to work, as it was usual for us to see her report for duty. “No one has said anything about her exit from the company,” claimed an insider. Another informant said it was strange that her departure wasn’t announced. Said a second mole: “Usually people, who depart from the organisation are either announced on the website or the company newsletter, but it wasn’t the case with Relebogile. “Remember, this opportunity opened doors for her, but suddenly she is no longer there.” A third source said Relebogile was too excited about the job because it happened at a time when she was demoted at Metro FM. “This was a golden opportunity for Relebogile because she had something positive to focus on while everyone else was talking about her Metro FM demotion. “Getting this job made her happy. She was always smiling here at the office,” said the source. Relebogile was not available for comment but her publicist, Sheila Afari, told the SunTeam: “She resigned last year, so this is not a new thing.” Samro could not be reached for comment.
