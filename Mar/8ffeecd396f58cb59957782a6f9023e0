MOZAMBIQUE POLICE are probing the deaths of two young men found beheaded in a northern province prone to jihadist attacks. Attacks blamed on Islamists have hit the gas-rich Cabo Delgado province for two-and-a-half years, claiming more than 700 lives. At least 100 000 people have been displaced by the violence, according to the United Nations and humanitarian agencies. The two headless corpses were found last Sunday in a road in Pemba, the capital of Cabo Delgado, a resident said. “Two young men were shot and beheaded near the jail where people accused of being insurgents are being held,” he said. “From the way they were murdered, we think it is an al-Shabaab job,” he said, referring to jihadists. Cops confirmed the two deaths.– NEWS24
