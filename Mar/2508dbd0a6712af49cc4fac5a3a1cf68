MPs and religious leaders gathered in parliament to discuss ways to deal with harmful religious practices. The South African Institute of Professional Pastors, Reverends, Evangelists and Ministers said organised religion needed to regulate itself and flush out those abusing believers. They were responding to the recommendations of the CRL Commission that investigated the commercialisation of people’s beliefs by church leaders. Grant Classen of the institute said: “We need to look at the conduct of the ministers. Are they competent for the job?” He said his organisation didn’t tolerate clergymen who didn’t abide by the Bible’s principles. “If a guy says if you drink my bath water God will heal you, that’s not faith. That’s insanity,” he said. ACDP MP Wayne Thring said religious freedom should never be tampered with. He also opposed the final recommendation of the CRL Commission. “We believe it infringes on the religious freedom of the church that’s enshrined in the Constitution. Religious freedom should be free from interference by the state,” said Thring.
