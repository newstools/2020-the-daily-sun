THE Premier Soccer League have slapped Bidvest Wits duo, Ricardo Goss and Sameehg Doutie  with hefty ban after the players were found guilty by the League Disciplinary Committee on Tuesday night. The goalkeeper and midfielder were charged with assault following an altercation with referee Masixole Bambiso in their 2-0 defeat against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium in January this year. Goss was subsequently shown a yellow card, while Doutie walked away free from the scene. On Wednesday PSL released a statement which said: "The Premier Soccer League (PSL) Disciplinary Committee last night found Bidvest Wits FC players Ricardo Goss and Sameehg Doutie guilty of abusing match official Mr Masixole Bambiso during the Absa Premiership fixture between Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City on 18 January 2020 at Cape Town Stadium."
