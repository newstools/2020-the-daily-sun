We published the article “NO MARRIAGE FOR SHENGE” on 08
October 2019.  The article dealt with a picture of Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi that was posted on a Facebook group called Ladies House. In the picture
Chief Buthelezi is “talking closely to a woman, identified as the granddaughter
of ANC Youth League founding president Anton Lembede”. The angle of the article
involved Princess Phumzile lashing out about claims of her father planning to
get married again. A complaint was lodged against Daily Sun at the Press Council of
South Africa. We apologise to Chief Buthelezi for infringing on his privacy and
dignity with regard to reproducing denigratory
remarks from the Facebook post referring to his age and sexual
ability. Visit www.presscouncil.org.za
for the full finding.
