THEIR mission was planned with military precision and expertise. And they were about to get into their four cars to commit crime. However, the unsuspecting six suspects’ plans were dashed when Ekurhuleni Metro police and cops pounced on Monday. Inside the suspect’s cars, cops found nine rifles, including two AK-47s, three high calibre firearms, explosives and ammunition. Captain Mavela Masondo said all the vehicles were suspected to be stolen. “Two cars, which are both Mercedes-Benz have been positively identified as hijacked,” said Masondo. He said the two Mercs were CLA and AMG models and the other cars were a silver-grey Ford Kuga and cream VW Polo. Masondo said cops received the tip-off and rushed to a house in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni and found six suspects gathered there. “We appreciate people tipping off the police and wish our communities worked with us to fight the crime,” said Masondo. He said the suspects would appear in court soon on charges of illegal possession of rifles and guns, ammunition and explosives.
