 Former EFF
secretary-general Godrich Gardee, now the head of international relations, has
resigned from his role as a member of Parliament. National Assembly
Speaker Thandi Modise's office confirmed that Gardee had submitted his
resignation. Gardee refused to
comment when asked about the development. The senior EFF member
recently qualified as a lawyer â€“ and last week the party's president, Julius
Malema, tweeted that Gardee had started working as a candidate attorney. 'Can't be there full
time' The former
secretary-general had been lambasted for being divisive by some party members
in the lead-up to the EFF's second elective conference. Some expected Gardee
to leave the party after he was not re-elected as a leader. However, he was
given the task of helping to establish the party's footprint outside of the
country, hence his role as head of international relations. EFF national
spokesperson Vuyani Pambo said Gardee was now working full time as a candidate
attorney at Mabuza Attorneys. "It wouldn't be
proper for him to be paid if he can't be there full time." Pambo said Gardee
remained a member of the EFF's central command team, the highest
decision-making body. SOURCE: NEWS24
