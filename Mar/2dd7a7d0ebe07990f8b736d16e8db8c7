AS SHE was crossing the road with her two cousins yesterday morning, the 13-year-old schoolgirl was killed instantly. Sesi Mathe and the two others were going to Botsikana–Milentle High School in Ga Mashashane, Limpopo, when a maroon BMW struck her. The cousins escaped the crash without injury and were later treated for shock at the scene. The driver sped off. Lucky Mathe (30), their nephew who works at the school, told Daily Sun Sesi’s cousins came running to him to report she had been knocked down. “I rushed there and Sesi was just lying there. I touched her and called her name but she didn’t respond. There was blood coming from her ears, nose and mouth. “The cousins said they tried to pull each other out of the way but when Sesi turned her back, she went towards the car.” Lucky said he sent Sesi to a nearby spaza shop to buy a phone and would see her at school later but that never happened. Sesi’s father, Piet Sethole (40), broke down when speaking to the SunTeam. Family members were heard crying in the other room. The grade 8 pupil was described as a respectful, smiling child. Councillor Baker Ledwaba said the community lost an ambitious young person who was going to achieve a lot in life. He said they would ask Polokwane Municipality to erect speed humps and road signs to show motorists it was a pedestrian crossing. “It’s not the first time we’ve had a fatal accident on this road At least one ambulance should be placed at Mashashane Clinic.” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they were investigating a case of culpable homicide after a pupil was knocked down.
