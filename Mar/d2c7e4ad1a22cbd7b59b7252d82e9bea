SIX suspects are on the run after they blew up an ATM with explosives early yesterday morning. The thugs, who were apparently wearing balaclavas, approached workers at Vahlave Global filling station in Rolle Trust, near Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, and minutes later a loud bang was heard. A 29-year-old petrol attendant told the SunTeam they had to run for cover after they saw armed men coming towards them. “The suspects had balaclavas on and we had to run for our lives after noticing they had guns. “In a short space of time we heard a loud bang. When we went to investigate, we found cash scattered everywhere and the thugs were gone,” he said. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops have launched a manhunt after an ATM was bombed. He said they received information about a group of armed men who stormed the petrol station and bombed the machine before fleeing the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. “Police are investigating a case of ATM bombing and we appeal to people who have information to come forward. “They should contact Mhala police so we can bring those responsible to book,” he said. Anyone with infomation should call 072 624 5133.
