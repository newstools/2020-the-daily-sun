ONE person dropped dead in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. But was not a victim of Covid19, but allegedly died at the hands of the police. Four kids, two of them hospitalised, were also caught in the crossfire. Sibusiso Amos (41) from Zulu section in Vosloorus was allegedly shot and killed by EMPD cops enforcing lockdown restrictions in the area yesterday. He was shot several times in the upper body. A friend said Sibusiso died in her hands while they waited for the ambulance. “I still can’t believe what happened. It seems like a dream,” she said. “We told the cops we are in the yard, where must we go? Why did he die? What did he do wrong?” She said the officers became angry and started shooting. According to witnesses, the cops were driving two unmarked black VW Golf 7s and two bakkies. They allegedly drove off after the shooting without realising the damage they left behind. A witness told Daily Sun: “We were not even in the street when they fired shots, but inside the yard. “We thought the police must only hassle us when we are outside the yard.” Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa said they’ve received information about death as a result of police action that took place in Vosloorus yesterday. “The incident involves members of Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department. We are also told that there are other victims who are still to be interviewed by us. Due to the fact that it is an ongoing incident and our investigators are still in the vicinity, we are unable to divulge much information which is yet to be verified.” A cop who is not allowed to speak to the media, could only confirm that a murder docket was opened and handed over to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for investigation.
