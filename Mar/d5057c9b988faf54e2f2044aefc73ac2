OFFICIALS are taking measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Madikizela said: “The first thing to ensure is that, as passengers leave, people are standing with sanitisers.” He said the cost of the sanitisers came from Santaco’s own pocket and the provincial government would be buying sanitisers to meet the taxi industry halfway. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently announced visits to offenders would be suspended for 30 days. Nxumalo said: “The department has appointed security experts and professionals to conduct a scenario planning exercise. Containment and treatment measures will be activated if a staff member or inmate contracts the virus.” This weekend, the SunTeam spoke to local and German tourists. Nonkanyiso Dingiswayo (29) was worried tourists could be spreading the virus. Museum CEO Bonke Tyhulu called for calm as measures were put in place for the virus. Spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “We have seven cases, five in Ehlanzeni and two in Gert Sibande District Municipality.” Kruger National Park said it was following World Health Organisation guidelines.
