KAIZER Chiefs have suffered a huge blow ahead of their Absa Premiership clash against AmaZulu at FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). Amakhosi will play without key central midfielder Willard Katsande who sustained a knee ligament injury during the Soweto derby against fierce rivals Orlando Pirates at the same venue at the weekend. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp revealed that the tough as teak player will be out of action until April. If he doesn’t recover on time this means the Zimbabwean born could miss all Chiefs’ remaining seven league games. Said Middendorp: “Willard is out for the games in March, I expect him to be back in the beginning of April.” Middendorp admitted that the 34-year-old will be missed in their battle to win the title race. Kenyan International Anthony Akumu who replaced Katsande when he got injured in the second half, is likely to get the nod on Saturday. “He is one of the core players who contributed week in week out in a very proper way. It doesn’t help to cry now, we should find a solution to replace him. But it’s not really a welcomed scenario, but we can change.” However, the German born mentor breathed a sigh of relief as key strikers Lebogang Manyama and Leonardo Castro have fully recovered from injuries sustained in the derby. “The same as Lebogang Manyama who got a knock on the calf muscle, Castro got a knock on his back. But both players since yesterday have been fully involved in the training session. We gave them a bit more time (to recover) in the beginning of the week, but they are fully available (for selection).
