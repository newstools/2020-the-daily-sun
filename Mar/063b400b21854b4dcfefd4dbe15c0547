 Protea
Hotels has confirmed that one of its hotels in Polokwane, The Ranch Resort,
will be used as a quarantine site under the Department of Health's direction
from Thursday. Paul
Shearer, the general manager of The Ranch Resort, confirmed to News24 that
"under the direction of the Department of Health, The Ranch will not be
operating as a regular hotel with effect from 12th March 2020. "The
property will be used as a quarantine facility under the full direction and
guidance of the local authorities." The Health
ministry has confirmed that the number of positive Covid-19 cases in the
country has risen to 17, with four more cases confirmed on Thursday, 12 March.
This was announced by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Thursday. A total of
122 South Africans, most of whom lived in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the
coronavirus outbreak, are expected to return to South Africa on Friday morning. South
African National Defence Force (SANDF) medics left for Wuhan to fetch them on
Tuesday night. The resort
is a four-star hotel about 25km south of Polokwane. It has 150 bedrooms,
conference venues, three restaurants, a bar lounge, four pools, a gym, a spa, a
golf course and an airstrip and helipad. It is
seemingly secluded within a surrounding game reserve. "We
are currently assisting guests who are booked at the hotel, giving them the
opportunity to rebook at an alternate hotel, cancel or amend their bookings. "Normal
operations will resume under the direction and guidance of the local
authorities," Shearer said. SOURCE:
