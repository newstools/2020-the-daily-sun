MUTEKA Gxanase (43) makes a living by selling imiqolo (fishbone) in the kasi. The mum of eight from Govan Mbeki kasi in Port Elizabeth started selling imiqolo in 2015. “When my daughter was studying safety and security at Port Elizabeth TVET College, I was battling with her taxi fare,” she said. “So I decided to start selling imiqolo. Customers are crazy about them. They lick their fingers and ask me to keep on making them.” Muteka said she buys 10kg of imiqolo for R100 in Uitenhage and makes a profit of R250 - R350 a day. “I get new customers every day. “With imiqolo, I was able to cover all the ceremony expenses when my sons returned from initiation school. “My other son is doing a diploma in electrical engineering in Uitenhage because of the money I make.” She said she uses barbecue spice, Rajah curry powder and bread flour to prepare imiqolo. “My main challenge is shelter. I bake my fish on the side of the road in front of my house,” she said. “I need shelter and a gas stove for the business.” Her imiqolo costs R5. Customer Zukiswa Nyanda (50) said: “I’ve tasted many imiqolo in my life. But hers are the best.” Another customer Nomaxabiso Rolo said: “I make supper for my family with her imiqolo and lunch boxes for my kids.”
