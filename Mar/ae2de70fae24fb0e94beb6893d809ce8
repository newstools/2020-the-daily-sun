AN athlete’s health does matter, that is why the South African 200m-record holder Clarence Munyai is not disappointed about the Tokyo Olympic Games being postponed until next year. “I am not surprised about the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) decision,” said Munyai. “We all knew that due to the current Coronavirus outbreak, it was only a question of time. It is a pity, but for now, it is for the best. “The Olympic Games should be showcasing the world’s best athletes talents. I am not so sure it would have happened in Tokyo. There could have been a real chance of sick athletes competing or athletes getting sick while competing. “A good thing about the IOC decision is that everyone, we as athletes included, only now need to worry about staying healthy.” For Munyai, it is a case of the glass being half full rather than half empty: “I more motivated now as there is more time to prepare to be at my best for next year’s Games. There are certain things in my technique I can still improve on.” Munyai ranks 11th on the World Athletics all-time list after he had clocked a time of 19.69s in the 200 metres in 2018.
