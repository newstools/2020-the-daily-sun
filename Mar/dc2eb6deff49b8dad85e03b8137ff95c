GAUTENG Premier David Makhura and acting social development MEC Panyaza Lesufi went on a mission last week to get homeless people off the streets during the lockdown. Makhura said: “Gauteng will divert resources to the homeless through school infrastructure.” Even though they were grateful, homeless people said government should have acted a long time ago. Gladys Monyane (41) said: “I’m happy to be going to a shelter. It shows that government still has our best interests at heart.” But those housed at Caledonian Stadium in Tshwane claimed the streets were safer, as they now had to share tents and mobile toilets.  Thomas Mabunda said everything there went against what government was trying to do. “We’ve been dumped here. We’re crowded, toilets aren’t clean and we have no sanitisers, masks or gloves.” Sipho Mbhedzu said the place was going to make them sick. “They might as well inject us with the virus. People rob us here. Some are drug addicts and we fear for our safety.” Councillor Godfrey Mulaudzi said people were not happy. He said drug addicts at the shelter couldn’t access their drugs. “We gave them blankets, food and necessities and have medical staff.” Accompanied by Greater Tzaneen Mayor Maripe Mangena and police General Maggie Mathebula, she also visited a local grocery store to ensure social distancing was practised. She said the Tzaneen temporary shelter accommodated 72 people.
