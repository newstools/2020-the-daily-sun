WHEN the clock strikes midnight, they listen for the sound of footsteps and the banging of pots and cutlery being thrown around in the kitchen. Then they know their dead brother is in the house. READ: 64 FOUND DEAD IN A CONTAINER! The family from KwaMancinza, north of Durban in KZN said their brother Lucky Gumede (38) who died in December still hasn’t been buried. Lucky died as a whoonga addict in Phoenix. His body was found next to the road. When his sister Nana Mlotshwa (28) received the message that Lucky was dead, they went to the government mortuary and were told they needed to bring the police to get the body released. She said they met the investigating officer, who told them they wouldn’t release the body before a DNA test was done. “The tests were done but the results haven’t been released. Lucky came again on Sunday and messed up the kitchen,” she said. “When he started coming, our mother saw him but she doesn’t see him anymore.” She said they had spent thousands consulting sangomas, who told them Lucky was angry and they couldn’t prevent him from coming. “We are doing everything we can to get his body released. Our mother is very sick now,” she said. “The sangoma confirmed it was him.” READ: AVOID HAVING SEX DURING SELF-ISOLATION She said the doors didn’t open when he came because he came as a ghost. Chairman of the KZN Traditional Healer’s Association Thandonjani Hlongwane said the family needed someone who had a genuine gift for prayer, so Lucky would stop bothering them. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that due to the decomposition of the body, the family could not identify him. “The investigating officer is waiting for the results of the DNA from Pretoria,” said Mbele.
