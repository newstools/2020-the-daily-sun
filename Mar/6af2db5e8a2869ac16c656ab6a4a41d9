CONTRALESA is planning to hold a meeting with the Thembu royal family soon. This comes after Thembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo allegedly attacked his son, acting king Azenathi Dalindyebo, last Friday. Eastern Cape Contralesa chairman Mwelo Nonkonyana told Daily Sun the organisation was engaging with the family with a view to restoring stability. “We will update you when we finalise the process,” he said. Last Friday King Buyelekhaya stormed the Bumbane Great Palace and allegedly injured Azenathi and his wife, Usikhumbulile. Both were rushed to Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital for treatment. Usikhumbulile was released from hospital the following day. King Buyelekhaya’s spokesman, Mthunzi Ngonyama, insisted the king was still allowed to go to Bumbane. He said the royal family would fight the protection order attained by Azenathi prohibiting Buyelekhaya from entering Bumbane. After the alleged attack, Buyelekhaya was arrested and appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates Court. He was later released on warning. He will be back in court on 1 June. The king was charged with malicious damage to property and assault. Azenathi’s spokesman, Siganeko Dalindyebo, told the media the family were disappointed by King Buyelekhaya’s decision to enter Bumbane to attack the family. “It was clear the king was there to attack Azenathi,” he said. The situation is still tense at the Bumbane Great Palace. In December last year, Buyelekhaya was released on parole after serving four years of a 12-year jail sentence.
