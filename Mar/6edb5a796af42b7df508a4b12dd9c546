A VIDEO has surfaced on social media showing jailbirds at Mdantsane Prison having a time of their lives. They can be seen listening to music, drinking wine and sharing laughs in a prison cell. They flash cellphones, classified as contraband in prisons.  One inmate tells the others not to share pictures online, calling himself an Instagram celebrity. Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said the inmates had been identified. “A search proved successful and cellphones were confiscated,” said Nxumalo.  He said a full-scale investigation was launched uncover details of how inmates accessed cellphones and civilian clothes. Nxumalo said this was a major security breach. Social media users were angry. Mariya Masha Kalashnikova said: “We pay tax for them to live in luxury.” Gary David Fraser said: “Amazing how guys who committed crimes against society are treated better than an innocent child whose only meal is sometimes at school in the morning.”
