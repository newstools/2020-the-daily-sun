THE EFF had to defend one of their own on social media over the weekend. This after Twitter user Lerato Pillay claimed EFF MP Naledi Chirwa was a foreigner. EFF leader Julius Malema came to Naledi’s defence and replied: “Mxm, sies. Naledi Chirwa is us and we will defend her with everything.” EFF’s Veronica Mente also replied: “Seeking relevance is a very obnoxious activity and extremely disgusting when a young intelligentsia is being attacked by a fellow woman. Naledi Chirwa is and will always be a child of South Africa and an African through and through.” Naledi herself also took to Twitter to clear the air: “Dad from Malawi, mom from Zim, and I’m South African. But this was supposed to be picture perfect.” However, the person who ended up being a hero was Duduzane Zuma. He asked for people to stop dragging Naledi’s name. He wrote: “I want to make this clear, just because it was done to me doesn’t mean that I should celebrate when such is done to someone else, even if the person is an EFF member. At all time we must always strive to be the bigger person, that is the kind of leadership I want to provide.”
