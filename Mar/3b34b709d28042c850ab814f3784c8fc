CONTROVERSIAL poet Ntsiki Mazwai has shaken things up with an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa. In the letter, which she posted on her blog on Saturday, Ntsiki detailed, among other things, how Ramaphosa failed to come up with measures to help everyone during the 21-day lockdown. She said measures by the president won’t help as they were solutions best suited for white people and not Africans. Ntsiki wrote: “You’ve planned this quarantine from a place of privilege where you didn’t consider the poverty on the ground. Have you ever been into a squatter camp? “That’s where a lot of your people live because instead of getting us our land back in 94, your ANC comrades sold us for big houses in the north and German cars.” Now her father, anti-apartheid activist and former journalist Thami Mazwai, has expressed his disappointment at how his daughter addressed the president. Thami told Daily Sun he didn’t like the tone of the letter and questioned why Ntsiki would drag the Marikana issue into this situation. “Marikana is sad, yes, but it has got nothing to do with what we’re faced with. We need solutions and less criticism,” he said. A WhatsApp message Thami had written to unknown people, was leaked where he slammed his daughter. “I wrote that message out of disappointment,” he said. Presidency spokeswoman Khusela Diko said the president’s office was aware of the letter, but did not plan to reply. Contacted for comment, Ntsiki asked to be called at noon, but she hadn’t picked up any calls at the time of going to print, nor did she respond to SMSes.
