DAN Malesela is considering taking the vacant Chippa United coaching job following the resignation of Norman Mapeza on Monday. The former TS Galaxy mentor told Sunsport that he is available to help the Chilli Boys improve their position on the Absa Premiership table if Chippa boss Siviwe Mpengesi approaches him. Mapeza stepped down hardly two days after he guided The Chilli Boys to a 1-0 Absa Premiership win over basement side AmaZulu at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. This was Chippa’s first win following a five match winless run.The Port Elizabeth side occupy 11th spot on 25 points from 23 matches.According to an insider at the club, Mapeza was not happy that management interferes with his job. Said the source: “He doesn’t have the power to take charge of the team and technical staff without any interference. "That’s why he wrote a letter to management to address his grievances giving them an ultimatum to step aside it out or he will resign.” However, with seven matches remaining, Malesela says he knows what to do to ensure Chippa retain their PSL status. Said Malesela: “I know what to do to turn the club’s fortune around. I have been with the team before and I know the operations.”
