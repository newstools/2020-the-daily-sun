WHEN it rains it pours and this is the case for the multi-award-winning star, Sjava. His light has been dampened after a case of rape had been filed against him, by his former lover. Now Sjava the Uthando has been pulled out of the forthcoming DStv Mzansi Viewers Choice Awards as a nominee and performer as the award announced. The award ceremony is set to take place next week Saturday at the Ticketpro Dome. Sjava was nominated in two categories, namely: Favourite Music Artist/Group and Favourite Song Of The Year for his single, Umama. Executive Head of Corporate Affairs at MultiChoice South Africa, Reggy Moalusi said: “The DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards has decided to withdraw the nomination of local artist Jabulani Hadebe popularly known as Sjava, from this year’s awards. This as a result of an ongoing investigation into the local performer by the authorities. “The decision to remove Sjava’s eligibility, including canceling his performance at the awards is not one that has been made lightly, but we believe is in the best interest of all parties concerned.” Popular singer Lady Zamar opened a case against Sjava last year November reporting the alleged incident that took place in September 2017 in Thohoyandou, Venda in Limpopo. On Monday, the International Cape Town Jazz Festival announced that they were pulling Sjava off their line-up after the rape allegations were brought forward against him.
