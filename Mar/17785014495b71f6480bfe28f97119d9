Prosecutors have responded to R Kelly’s request to be released from prison and have denied the claims that he made, stating that he is being mistreated. Last week the 53 year old who is in jail currently awaiting trial in two separate criminal cases logged a request to be released from prison due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus. In his request documents, the I believe I Can Fly hitmaker says the conditions in the prison are dangerous given the current circumstances. He further complained about not being able to see his lawyers to build his defense for trial. According to document obtained by The Blast, prosecutors are asking a judge to keep Kelly in prison despite him claiming to fear for his life at the Chicago prison, where he is being kept awaiting trail. “If released, there is a risk that the defendant will flee and that the defendant will obstruct, attempt to obstruct, threaten, intimidate or attempt to threaten or intimidate one or more prospective witnesses.” Furthermore, the prosecutors claim Kelly is getting adequate care in prison at the moment and there is no reason for his release. “The defendant continues to pose both a flight risk and a serious risk of obstruction. His motion for emergency bail… do not overcome the risks he poses if released.”
