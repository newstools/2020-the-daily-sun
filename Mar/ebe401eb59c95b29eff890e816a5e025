THE owner of the company that allegedly facilitated the gift of cattle worth R1,5 million to former president Jacob Zuma has denied the claims, saying he only saw him on TV. Agridelight was appointed by the North West agriculture department as an implementing agent. Owner Derrick Montshwe told the portfolio committee on rural development on Monday allegations he gave cattle meant for emerging farmers to Zuma, as a gift from then premier Supra Mahumapelo, were a lie. He denied buying a McDonald’s franchise for Mahumapelo and paying for former agriculture MEC Manketse Tlhape’s nose job. He said: “I’m a businessperson. There’s a group of people who want to say I’m corrupt and work with corrupt people.” He said company records prove there were no transactions linking him to corruption. He said he was appointed by the department in 2014 and his project ended in October 2017 but was extended to January 2018. His duties included allocating cattle to local chiefs and colleges and performing agricultural work on behalf of the department. He said his company spent R604 million on the project and is fighting a legal battle as the department owes him R331m. Committee chairwoman Bitsa Lenkopane said the committee would follow up on the matter.
