PANIC buying has gripped Mzansi! On Sunday evening President Cyril Ramaphosa declared that the country as a national disaster amid the corona virus outbreak but urged people to remain calm. But since this morning photos have been circulating all over social media of people flocking to shops pushing trolleys full of groceries. Stacks of toilet paper,soap and packaged foods such as rice and pasta seem to be top of the list of most shoppers. Hand sanitising products have been out of stock for nearly two weeks now as globally corona virus infections have hit more than 160 000. Mzansi has recorded 62 infections so far but the panic bulk buying has divided people as some believe it is selfish that groceries are being finished before others can buy them. The Shoprite Group has pleaded with shoppers to buy what they need at this point,reports the Citizen. “The gaps which are now evident on our shelves and those of other supermarkets are because of the unprecedented demand as a result of fear over the effect of the coronavirus, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we are working around the clock to keep shelves stocked,” said Pieter Engelbrecht, CEO of the Shoprite Group.  Current situation - Dainfern Square, Woolies. Yup, panic buying has certainly hit us. #CoronaVirusSA pic.twitter.com/0EOcxfzqQa — MELODY MOLALE (@MelodyMolale) March 16, 2020
