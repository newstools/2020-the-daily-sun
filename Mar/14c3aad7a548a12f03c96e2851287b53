FORMER president Jacob Zuma has not recovered from his illness. He said this on Saturday when he attended a top matric achievers awards ceremony at Bizimali High School in Nkandla, northern KZN. Zuma made his first public appearance since returning from Cuba, where he received treatment. He said he had been advised not to speak at gatherings. However, he said he felt it was important to attend the ceremony. “As you’ve been aware, I’ve been ill so I’m still nursing my illness. “Doctors told me to focus on my treatment but I felt I should come and thank you for what you’ve done,” he said. “You’ve represented Nkandla well and you’ve made it known everywhere. I recently told people in Joburg they must expect three more presidents from Nkandla.” Zuma and other sponsors donated five laptops to the top achievers. On Friday, the Supreme Court of Appeal refused Zuma’s bid to appeal the Pietermartizburg High Court’s dismissal of his permanent stay of prosecution application. Last month, his legal team said Zuma would appeal the high court’s decision all the way to the Constitutional Court.
