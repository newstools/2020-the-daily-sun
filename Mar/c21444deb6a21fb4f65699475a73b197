The  Department of Sports, Arts and Culture held a news briefing this afternoon in light of the current issues faced by creatives in the country due to Covid-19. Minister Nathi Mthethwa announced that his department would be allocating R150 million to provide the much needed relief to practitioners in the sector. Other different sectors affiliated with departments of arts will create programmes that will be streamed live, such as stand-up comedy, poetry sessions, music and so forth. This will be done to keep the people at home entertained, to showcase the work of the creatives, and to also promote local content across all arts genres. They also plan on commissioning service providers in the digital space to curate new programmes in all disciplines to ensure that artists continues to work.
