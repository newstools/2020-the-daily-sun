DRAMA seems to be following Mpumalanga businessman Sam Chabalala. Gunshots were fired in his yard in Bethal, Mpumalanga early on Monday morning. It is reported unknown men fired shots, almost hitting his security guard. According to a source, the guard was about to move something from the garage when the shooting started. “He had to hide as gunshots continued to be fired at the car that was inside the yard. The gunmen later fled.” The 25-year-old Chabalala, who is out on R500 000 bail for his recent corruption case, was escorted by traffic officials on Wednesday last week.  Last month, Middelburg Magistrates Court prosecutor Eric Sihlangu said an affidavit made by a Home Affairs official showed Chabalala’s real name is Gilbert Tachuona, born in Zimbabwe 28 years ago. Sihlangu said Home Affairs revealed Chabalala got his ID through misrepresentation. Captain Thomas Mogadime said a case of attempted murder was opened. “No one was injured but the car had holes. We’re investigating.” Chabalala is expected to appear in the Witbank Magistrates Court on Friday on charges of corruption, fraud and possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition.
