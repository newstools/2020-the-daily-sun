He said his mum (50) deposited R3 000. After getting the money, the kidnappers put him in an Uber to Vosloorus. He said he was at Southgate Mall when he was kidnapped by four men driving a white Corolla Quest. “I was getting out of a taxi when the car stopped in front of me. One of them got out and pointed a gun at me. I was bundled in the car and blindfolded before they drove off with me. “When the car stopped, they removed the cover on my face, and I could see we were in Orange Farm. But the area was isolated.” He said he cried when he saw them take out the weapons and begged them not to kill him.
