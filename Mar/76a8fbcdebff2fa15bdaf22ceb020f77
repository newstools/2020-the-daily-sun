A VIDEO of an 83-year-old gogo being thrown into flames has left the nation shocked. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngcwenya and sangomas have called on people to stop accusing others of being evil and hurting them. “This is wrong and disgusting. Where is ubuntu? What proof do you have that they are really evil? I’m disgusted by this,” said Ngcwenya. It has emerged the victim was Nosayinethi Manundu. She was allegedly assaulted, drowned in a water drum and then her body was thrown in a burning rondavel in Majuba Village, outside Sterkspruit in the Eastern Cape. The video was taken before she died. Several men can be seen calmly pushing her into a burning rondavel. She crawls out and begs for mercy. The person behind the camera can then be heard saying: “Hurry. The fire is going down.” Residents claimed the gogo was responsible for the death of Samkelo Manunu (23). They decided to attack her after his funeral earlier this month. Eastern Cape police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said the gogo’s 23-year-old granddaughter managed to escape after the crowd threw paraffin over their house but failed to burn it. He said the granddaughter was under police protection. Kinana said four men were arrested and charged with assault, arson, murder and attempted murder. National police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said people should never take the law into their own hands. “If they have seen someone doing something wrong, they can open a case of intimidation with the police, who will investigate,” she said
