THE Soweto Derby came and ended with Kaizer Chiefs beating Orlando Pirates 1-0 at FNB Stadium on Saturday. The SunTeam spoke to fans before the game.  One Soweto couple told Daily Sun they supported different teams. The man supports Amakhosi, while the woman supports Amabhakabhaka. They said they agreed on almost everything in the house, but it was war when it came to the derby. However, the couple said they understood the game. “It ends here. If he wins, I will still cook for him. Football can’t come between us,” said Stha Sithole (27). Two friends from Soweto said they also supported different teams. “We do everything together, but we’re enemies here,” said Bhakabhaka fan Joseph Ngubane (36). Some supporters even came from as far as KZN, Mpumalanga and Free State. CHIEFS DOMINATES PIRATES! KZN fans said they left the province in the morning. “We arrived around 1pm. We did not speed because we wanted to arrive alive so we could see the beautiful game,” said one fan who only gave her name as Zinhle. She said this was not their first time driving all the way for the Soweto Derby. Some men from Mpumalanga said they didn’t want to watch the game on TV. “The derby is war. “When it’s war, you need to be there to fight too, not sit at home and hope for those fighting to win,” said Sphamandla Ndlovu (45). After Chiefs won, fans left the stadium singing and dancing together.
