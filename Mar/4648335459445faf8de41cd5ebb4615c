The last two years have been hectic for legendary Maskandi artist, Zibokwakhe 'Phuzekhemisi' Mnyandu. In 2018 he was charged with attempted murder of his band member, Selby Shezi. When Selby died the charge was changed to murder.  "I wouldn't have thought that in my old age I'd face jail time. I was scared and worried about my kids and my family. My music career soon took a downturn as gigs started dwindling. Everything was uncertain but I had to appear strong for the sake of my fans and my family," explained Phuzekhemisi. "But what kept me going was the support of my family and fans. At that time I prayed a lot, I connected with my ancestors and asked for their guidance and protection," he recalled.

Some of the songs, including Ziyangiluma Izinja on this album are directed at my enemies, to all those who were orchestrating my downfall. I've been in the industry for more than 20 years and I'd never experienced anything like this. I thought by now, people would know my character, I thought they’d know what I'm capable of but I was wrong," he said. He went on to say: "There are people whom I thought were my friends but in the end they proved to be my enemies. This is not a bitter or controversial album instead I am addressing issues as they are. Nevertheless, I'm not holding any grudges, it's all in the past except that I'll have to be more careful who I get close to next time." Read: FULL STEAM AHEAD FOR PHUZEKHEMISI
