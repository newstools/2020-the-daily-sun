AMAZULU have slammed their former player, Rhulani Manzini, for “distasteful remarks made towards the club and it’s fan base” in an interview on Power FM last week. Manzini revealed that during his time with the KwaZulu Natal club, he had been a victim of discrimination and tribalism because of his moTsonga background. The club, however, have refuted the claims calling them “unfounded accusations” that have brought the club into disrepute. Usuthu Team Manager, Qedi Dlamini, said the interview came as a surprise to management at the club. “Not once did Rhulani (Manzini) report that he was being harassed, by supporters of the club, for his moTsonga background. It became evident that a large portion of our fans were unhappy with his performances and he became subject to that pressure, however he was not the only one,” said Dlamini in a statement on the club’s website. “It got to the point whereby we had to call meetings with our supporters, asking them to refrain from being negative towards our players, when the team wasn’t doing well. The supporters club even came to training to reassure our squad that they were behind us 100%. We are a multiracial club and it’s been that way since the 70’s.” Dlamini went on to deny claims by Manzini, saying that he was asked to sit out of home games. “I never suggested that he play away games only, how can I do that knowing that I would be interfering with team selection. The season he left, was the season he had many problems with our technical team, which he reported to us but beyond that, he lost his starting position and it was hard for him to accept.” concluded Dlamini.
