THE nine-year-old boy who was killed in a bus accident in Redcliffe in Verulam, north of Durban, on Monday was passionate about school. Owami Msimang was killed instantly when a bus reversed into him after he had slipped into a puddle of rainwater while on his way to Redcliffe Primary School, where he was a grade 3 pupil. His dad, Bheki Mdletshe (42), yesterday told Daily Sun his son loved school so much he wouldn’t miss a day, even when the weather was bad. “Even on the day of the accident, it was raining. But he still wanted to go to school because he loved it so much,” said Bheki.  He said he rushed to the scene soon after he had been told about the tragedy. He said witnesses told him Owami was trying to cross the road when the accident happened. “I was told the bus reversed into him, hitting him so hard that he died on the spot,” said Bheki. “I can’t imagine the pain my son went through in his last moments. It saddens me that he had to die in this manner. I feel miserable.” He said his focus right now was on giving his son a dignified funeral and not on the prosecution of the bus driver who killed him. “The driver is a person I know very well. He’s from the area and we have a friendly relationship as kasi men. “I’m just confused about how exactly I should tackle the situation that I lost my son through his actions,” said Bheki. He said he believed the accident was a mistake, even though it cost his son’s life. KZN police spokeswoman Nqobile Gwala confirmed the accident. She said a case of culpable homicide was opened at Verulam Police Station. No one has been arrested.
