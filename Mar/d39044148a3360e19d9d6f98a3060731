WHEN poor Seshego elders complained their old beds hurt their bodies, their cries didn’t fall on deaf ears. EFF leaders in the province bought 100 new double beds for elders of Polokwane zone 1.  The elders apparently approached the party for help in December. On Saturday night they finally slept on proper beds. Limpopo EFF chairman Jossey Buthane told Daily Sun: “We’re from families with old people, and every time they wake up they complain of body pains. “We have seen their worn-out and broken beds. We are going to strive to make things better for senior citizens. “We’re a young organisation with no money, but the little we have we want to share.” Joseph Makhura (78) said he and wife Emma (74) would sleep comfortably for the first time in years. “Tonight I will take her to bed early and enjoy it because we have been struggling. Thank you, EFF, for bringing back our lives. ”
