DISAPPOINTED Black Leopards coach Allan Clark says his team deserved to lose the Limpopo derby on Sunday. Relegation threatened Leopards were beaten 2-1 buy their province rivals Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership encounter played at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. This is for the second time City beat Leopards this season. "We were poor on Sunday and Polokwane City deserve the three points," said Clark who have been hired to help the Venda based side survive relegation. "We had a bad game. We scored first but we allowed them back in the game. The goals we conceded was from poor defending from us. The players were just sitting. I am disappointed." Leopards who have been enjoying a good run in the Nedbank Cup have not suffered two consecutive league defeats. Clark's team are in the Nedbank Cup last last eight. They are now second from bottom on the log with same 20 points with bottom side AmaZulu. But Clark says his is not worried about the position they are on as he is optimistic that they will move to safer position soon. "We are not looking at the position or what other teams are doing," he said. "Our focus is on our next game which is the other Limpopo derby against Baroka this weekend." Leopards face Bakgaga in their next league match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
