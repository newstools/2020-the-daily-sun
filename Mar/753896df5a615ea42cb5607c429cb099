TSHOLOFELO Lerumo (21) is tired of being haunted by the R5 coins he took from the river. Tsholofelo from Holomisa squatter camp in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun he regrets being greedy. “I told a friend we should collect the coins from the river but he refused. He told me the coins are other people’s bad luck,” he said. “He told me whatever they’re trying to cleanse might come back to me. I laughed at him, but I wish I had listened.” Tsholofelo dedicated his weekends to collecting the coins and on that first weekend he collected R250. “I did it for three weeks and I was so happy. But then I started getting scary dreams,” he said. He had a very clear dream of a group of sangomas but he couldn’t see their faces clearly. “They torture me. They showed me dead animals and people’s body parts,” said Tsholofelo. He was scared and took a weekend off but then he went back again. “I was making extra cash. I just couldn’t stop,” he said. “Then things became worse. I see them even when I take naps during the day. I’m afraid of closing my eyes,” he said. Tsholofelo’s mum, Sofia (48), told Daily Sun she was shocked when he told her about what he was doing. “If this is punishment from the ancestors, then that’s the way it is,” said the mum. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi told Daily Sun collecting those coins was dangerous. “You’re doing nothing but drawing bad luck into your life by taking those coins,” said Dungamanzi. He said Tsholofelo could consult him or any other sangoma for cleansing. “He will be fine.”
