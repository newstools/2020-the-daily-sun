Dear MizzB I’M a 17 -year -old boy and a virgin. I’m afraid to have sex and my friend advised me that I should masturbate so I can please myself. I like the feeling I get when I play with myself, but is it healthy and does it get too much? Dear Curious Masturbation is one of the safest forms of sexual pleasure. I’m glad you are not rushing into being sexually intimate with anyone yet as you still want to discover yourself. Finding ways to please yourself opens up more discoveries that can help identify what works for you. Getting information on masturbation through research will give you a clear picture whether you’re on the right track. Better to be safe rather than sorry.
