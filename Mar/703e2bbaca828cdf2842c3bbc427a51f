UNLIKE many stars, singer Zoe Modiga is not cancelling her trip abroad because of the coronavirus outbreak. Instead, she has asked Mzansi to pray for her as she leaves for Belgium. The singer will perform at the Leuven Jazz Festival in Belgium at the end of the month. Zoe told Daily Sun she trusted God would protect her during her European tour. “It’s not that I’m not scared. There are a lot of lives in danger and it’s a global health problem. “I just feel strongly about the opportunity to commemorate our South African icons and wave the flag. “I’m willing to follow all the necessary precautions to keep myself and everyone interacting with me out of harm’s way.” Zoe said she was confident as she had been in constant communication with her contacts in Belgium. “Belgium and South Africa are not experiencing lockdowns. However, we are keeping our ears to the ground to determine by the minute whether it’s safe to travel. “Rehearsals are still taking place on their end and I’m preparing on mine.” Zoe will be commemorating late local icons such as Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba at the show. “They were celebrated icons who were known to be self-sacrificing. I will not compare their cause to mine, but I feel indebted to the path they were willing to choose for people like me,” she said. “This is me hoping to honour that legacy and the opportunities it has opened for me.” Zoe will perform alongside prominent European band LUCA.
