A sigh of relief and a look of panic was seen
on the faces of two young South African women who were isolated for 55 days in
China after the Coronavirus outbreak. Perseverance
Sepheso and Balekang Sedumedi were welcomed back home in Rustenburg on Monday
by North West premier Job Mokgoro and Social Development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa. Perseverance
said she went to Wuhan in China in 2017 as a foreign manager for a language
training school. She said
the first time she heard about the virus was almost a relaxed sort of emotion
as she did not know what this thing was all about. She said as
time went by, she got to know that this was serious. “It was no
longer a joke, people were dying,” she said. She said
there were instances where people were dragged out because they had it and
taken away from society because that was how fast that thing spread. “All you
need is one infected person. One person can entirely wipe-out the community and
that is why it is important to comply with the lockdown,” she said. Balekani
who went there to study said South Africans must know that at this point it was
just a matter of complying or facing death. “If not, we are looking at messy deaths,” she
said after realising that back here in South Africa people were not complying. She said
she had mixed emotions coming back home. “I am
battling to settle. I am ecstatic to be home,” she said. Her main
concern was that she was stuck in a foreign country. “I was
worried that I might never get a chance to get back home. I wanted to be home
should the unfortunate thing happen,” she said. Her mother
Daisy Sedumedi said she was happy she is back home. “I was most
stressed when she was in China. I am more relieved now that she is back home.
It was also her father’s birthday.” Social
Development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa said she will assist where she can. Premier Job
Mokgoro welcomed them back and said he was happy that they came back home safe.
