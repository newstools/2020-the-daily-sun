Dear MizzB MY partner always asks me for money and blocks me on all social platforms when I don’t give her what she wants. I have to buy her airtime or borrow money to give her so she can speak to me. My friends say she’s a gold digger. Please help! - Frustrated Dear Frustrated People get attracted to others for financial stability, love, company and entertainment. When someone is only interested in material things, it’s not easy to make them change their views. Being open about your expectations of each other at the beginning of every relationship will help to see if you both want similar things. Have an open conversation on what you both want and together decide if your relationship is actually working. Relationship counselling is also something to consider.
