EXPANDED public works programme workers are gatvol of waiting for their salaries. They told Daily Sun yesterday they were waiting for Pikitup bosses to respond to their grievances. They picketed outside the Avalon depot in Soweto and prevented Pikitup trucks and employees from leaving. Jabulani Mhlongo said: “I was paid R100. It won’t last me a day.” Jabulani (31) had been expecting over R3 000 a month. Other workers had not been paid since December. “We have families to look after, and with this amount most of the workers won’t cover their basic needs.” Themba Mnisi (33), another worker, said Joburg residents should prepare themselves for a waste backlog and bins piling up. “Our contracts end next month, and we’re fighting to get our salaries for the past two months. “We demand permanent posts so we can deliver quality services.” Pikitup spokesman Muzi Mkhwanazi told Daily Sun:“Their time sheets were submitted late, and in some cases with not enough information to process payment.” Mkhwanazi said Pikitup was working hard to resolve the matter. “Payments are made according to a work sheet that shows the time worked, and in this instance payments made reflect days and hours submitted. “In respect to the blockage of gates at the depot, Pikitup is working with police to resolve the matter. The workers have been engaged to explain the issue.”
