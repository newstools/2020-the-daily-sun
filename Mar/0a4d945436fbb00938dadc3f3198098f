ALL the funeral arrangements were completed and the family was ready to bury their daughter. But the burial was almost postponed twice as they found that some body parts were missing. Ntombifuthi Mahwayi (34) from Schoemansdaal outside Malalane, Mpumalanga, had reportedly been staying with her boyfriend for three years when she died last month.

One of the family members said Ntombifuthi told her sister on WhatsApp that she was being beaten by her boyfriend. On 28 February, they went to the mortuary to finalise the funeral arrangements but they found she had bruises on her chest, her private parts had been cut and her mouth was glued shut. “We stopped the funeral because the post mortem stated she died of natural causes. But a different doctor told us there was a problem with the corpse, and told us to cancel the funeral,” said Nkosephayo. The funeral was supposed to take place this past Saturday, but the family got another shock. “We found that Ntombifuthi’s tongue was missing and she had a cloth in her mouth. We called the police, who said we mustn’t go ahead with the funeral,” he said. But the family decided on Saturday afternoon to bury Ntombifuthi as it was becoming costly and they didn’t have money to fight legal battles. Alfred Ngwenya, owner of the funeral parlour, told Daily Sun he couldn’t talk about what happened. “The matter is very sensitive,” he said. Colonel Donald Mdluli said an inquest was opened for investigation.
