POLOKWANE City coach Clinton Larsen refuses to advise Rhulani Mokwena not to unpack his bags while still acting Chippa United coach. He welcomed Mokwena back in the coaching hot-seat but refuses to speculate how long his stay will be at Chippa. Larsen was a victim of the trigger-happy Chippa chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi, who sacked him in September last year after five games in charge. Mokwena was appointment as the Chili Boys coach last week until the end of the season, making him the fourth Chippa coach this season while the other three left unceremoniously. On top of Larsen, others are caretaker coach Duran Francis and Norman Mapeza, who resigned from the club. “I often read, ‘don’t unpack your bags or something’,” said Larsen, who lasted nine months with Chippa following his appointment in January last year. He added: “Rhulani just has to believe in himself. He’s a talented young coach and he’s going to have ups and downs in his career. But I’m sure he’s going to bounce back and do well. “As coaches sometimes, like players, you just have to find the right fit,” revealed Larsen, whose departure came after Chippa lost 2-1 to Mokwena’s Orlando Pirates in September. “Maybe Chippa is his fit. Time will tell. I wish him all the best. It is not going to be easy, but all the best to Rhulani.”
