Mahumani
Secondary School in Giyani, Limpopo, has one pit toilet for 659 pupils and
there are 50 pupils in a class, according to a GroundUp report. There used
to be two pit toilets for pupils, but one was closed in 2018 because the
building was cracking. Grade 12
pupils are crammed into Grade 11 classrooms because storm winds blew the roofs
off four Grade 12 classrooms in November, last year. This made
conditions for matric examinations difficult. The roofs have still not been
fixed. The storm
also took the roof off the only toilet for the 24 teachers at the school. 'I have to
urinate outside' Andrew
Chauke, of the school governing body (SGB), said: "The department should
take this seriously." Chief Hosi
Mahumani took GroundUp around the school. There were numerous flies near the
only toilet for pupils and some pupils urinated outside. "How
can 659 learners use one toilet?" asked the chief. A Grade 8
pupil added: "The toilet is dirty, and I cannot walk in. I have to urinate
outside." Sam Makondo
of the Limpopo Department of Education said the situation was being assessed. According
to Zanele Modise from Equal Education, a school that size should have 10
toilets for girls, four for boys, six urinals, one toilet for disabled people,
two for female staff members and one for male staff members. SOURCE:
