WHEN three brothers went to the dam and returned home with lots of fish, their dad told them not to go back there. But they didn’t listen. Siphesihle Nzama (11) from Esikebheni tragically drowned in the Inanda Dam near Durban on Saturday. His dad Sibongiseni (38) told Daily Sun Siphesihle and his brothers, aged 14 and nine, went to the dam on Thursday and came back with fish. He said he told them not to go back as many people had drowned there. “They acted as though they had heard me, but on Saturday afternoon the 14-year-old came home with a man and they told me Siphesihle had drowned,” he said. Sibongiseni rushed to the dam. “On our way he told me Siphesihle had slipped and fallen into the dam,” he said. “He said they tried to pull him out but couldn’t swim. The man managed to pull the other two out.” “When I arrived at the dam, the cops were already there and were searching for Siphesihle.” Sibongiseni said he was hurt that his kids wouldn’t listen and that one of them had died as a result. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket was being opened by Inanda police.
