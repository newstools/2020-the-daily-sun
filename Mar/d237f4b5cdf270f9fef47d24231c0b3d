One of South Africa’s biggest retailers Pick n Pay decided to release a song in a bid to urge people not to stockpile and panic buy. This follows the lock down, that was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. In bid to flatten the curve of the virus, Mzansi was put under strict measures and people have been asked to stay at home. Following this many people were concerned any they started panic buying and shops were left empty. The song titled That Guy features some of South Africa’s talented musicians such as Lira, Zolani from Freshly Ground, Loyiso, Karen Zoid, Majozi and Jack Parrow. "No one likes ‘that guy’. That’s why friends don’t let friends panic buy. Some of SA’s musos hit the studio to remind you to shop responsibly and with your community in mind," the retailer wrote.
