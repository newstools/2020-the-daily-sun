CHIPPA United are known to flirt with relegation. If they are not surviving the dreaded axe through the skin of their teeth, the Chilli Boys are battling it out in the promotion play-offs scrap to preserve their Premiership status. And it is not surprising to hear Chippa Mpengesi admit that the Port Elizabeth-based side could still be flushed down the relegation tube... when the PSL season resumes. Chippa are in 12th spot on 26 points, three points away from the play-offs zone and six from automatic relegation, with six games to go. ”We can be relegated... as much as there is a possibility we might can still qualify for the top-eight,” says Mpengesi. “In football we have seen how tough the last games can be and we can't take anything for granted.” Rhulani Mokwena became the fourth coach to take charge of the Chilli Boys this season, succeeding Norman Mapeza.
