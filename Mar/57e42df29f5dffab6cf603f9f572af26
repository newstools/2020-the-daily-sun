WHAT was supposed to be a night to remember ended up angering fans. Sjava’s concert A Night with Sjava failed to start on time at the Durban ICC on Saturday.  The concert was supposed to start at 6pm but only started at 8.30pm. No explanation or apology was given. The two and half hour delay left the crowd agitated, rowdy and jumping on top of chairs. But Sjava still did not come on stage. Instead artists including the scathamiya group Royal Messengers and maskandi artist Buselaphi Gxowa entertained the crowd. The crowd booed Sjava when, flanked by a group of young Zulu warriors, he finally made his grand entrance. His mum Thandi Nkabinde got up and danced. Sjava got on stage but there was no explanation or apology for the late start. Nosisa Khwinana couldn’t believe she drove all the way from the Eastern Cape to be disrespected. “I like Sjava’s music, but what he’s doing is unacceptable and annoying,” said Nosisa. “I can’t believe I’ve been waiting for more than two hours and he doesn’t even have the audacity to apologise.” Another fan, Zandile Khowa, said: “I didn’t come here to watch all these people but him. “I really love his music but I feel undermined and taken for granted. “At least I should have been informed there’s going to be other artists prior to his performance.” Nicolas Manyike from Ambitiouz Entertainment acknowledged there were delays. “The show was based on Sjava and people got impatient because they were not expecting other artists. “They expected him to be on stage from the word go. We’re also to blame because we started a little bit late and apologise for this.”
