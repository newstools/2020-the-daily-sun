THEY are considered to be fearless, but even taximen seem to be scared of the coronavirus. Two taxi drivers, both wearing masks, told Daily Sun they worked with various people every day. “I don’t know who’s sick and who isn’t,” said Mfundo Sithole (30) from Mzimhlophe in Soweto. He said he’d been a taxi driver for four years and was worried. “I’ve accepted that I may die anytime because of road accidents, but this virus gives me the goosebumps,” said Mfundo. By yesterday, the number of confirmed infection cases had risen to 51. Another taximan, Velaphi Mtungwa (33) from Meadowlands in Soweto, said: “You see how fast this virus is spreading? “I don’t want to be a statistic. Protection is better than cure.” He said he feared the virus because of the way people got it. “It’s too easy. I have a wife and kids,” he said. “I’m in contact with various people every day. “I’ve decided to send my wife and kids home so that if I get ill, I don’t infect them, too.” A passenger from Mzimhlophe Hostel said he was not afraid of the virus because he drank imbiza every day. “Ngiyachatha futhi,” he said, meaning he uses an anema, believed to cure a lot of diseases.
