Station commander Colonel Thapelo Lesoe said: “We have a programme where we visit elderly people to check if they are being victimised or are experiencing crime. We take great pride in taking care of our elderly.” Warrant Officer Lebogang Mokgothu said: “We saw it fit to use our money and make gogo happy on her special day.” Cops said the police station recently had a case of an elderly person who was murdered, so helping the gogo was a nice change.
