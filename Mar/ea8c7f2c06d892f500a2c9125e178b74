Mzukulu has warned people not to fall for a scammer who’s using his name! Mzukulu, whose real name Sanele Zulu and was featured on Sjava’s hit song Eweni, told Daily Sun he learnt someone who looked like him was allegedly scamming people. He said the person had allegedly been going around scamming filling stations in and around Joburg by not paying after filling up. On Wednesday, a woman named Nelile Nelo posted on Facebook accusing Mzukulu of not paying at the Sasol filling station in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Monday. On the post written in Zulu, Nelile claims Mzukulu’s bank card had a problem and he asked to transfer the money later, but didn’t. The real Mzukulu from KwaCeza, KZN, who lives in Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun the scammer looked like him but with dreadlocks. “This is the third time I’ve been accused of this. When I heard about this I was forced to cut off my dreadlocks,” he said. The Dali Wami hitmaker said: “I know people love me and my songs. I have posted my cellphone number on Facebook so people can call me directly when this person scams them.” Daily Sun tried to contact Nelile and the filling station, but without success.
