TWO cars were seen chasing each other on the road on a very high speed. And as they chased each other bullets also flew. But the chase didn't end well as both the cars eventually crashed into a brick fence near a house, almost crashing right into the house. This unfolded at L section KwaMashu north of Durban today (Friday). It is alleged that the chase ensued in Ntuzuma and continued into KwaMashu.  Residents in L section where the cars crashed into said it was like a movie. One of the residents said there were two men in a white Mercedez and one man in a blue Toyota. He said he was at his house when he saw the cars. "I first heard the shooting and went out to see and then I saw the cars crashing into the fence. The two men came out of the Mercedez and they ran away carrying a bag. Then they hijacked a car and escaped with it," he said. He said the man who was alone in the Toyota sustained gun shots and he was rushed to hospital. Another resident said he doesn't know why the cars were chasing each other. "But it looked like the white car was chasing the blue car. We are grateful that during their chase and shooting no resident was injured," he said. The resident said after the two men escaped two residents went into the cars and stole a rifle and ammunition, but cops arrived and arrested them. A woman from the house where the car crashed into the fence said she was not at home when this happened and she doesn't want to talk. Cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the matter. She said case of attempted murder, hi-jacking was opened at Ntuzuma police station. Gwala added that two men were arrested for illegal firearm and ammunition.
