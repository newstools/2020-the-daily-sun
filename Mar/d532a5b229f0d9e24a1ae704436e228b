FROM four-four masihlalisane to just two-two. This is how the set up will be in taxis as operators are forced to comply with the social distancing rule. Though social distancing seemed like a farfetched thing, with slim-to-none chances in the taxi industry, things will work differently during the lockdown. As of Friday, a 15 seater taxi will only be transporting about eight people only as they will be seating two per row. The continuation of taxi services is a great thing for essential workers who are going to be working through the lockdown period, but taxi operators will take a knock during this period. Taxi drivers at Chris Hani Baragwanath Taxi Rank said though they will be able to assist the essential workers, they said that will come at a cost. Given the time restriction of working from 5am to 9am in the morning, some of the drivers might come to the rank and don’t even get any passengers between those times. Driver Thato Malingisa said it will affect them on fuel and money for "check-in". “Our bosses will send us to go and work, and transport those few passengers. “But late in the evening, they will be demanding their money.”  He said he is worried that even his wages are going be affected as there won’t be a lot of people to transport. Sibusiso Mweli Public Relation Officer at Bara City Taxi Association said: “Taxis will operate from 5am and 9am and later they will operate from 4pm to 8pm. Taxis will be sanitised everyday throughout the period of the lockdown.  “MEC Jacob Mamabolo has supplied us with all the material.” He said there will be social distancing in the taxis and there will be spaces between the people for complying purposes.  He said for the empty seat that won’t be occupied, they will sit down and have a meeting around how they're going to deal with that issue. “Somewhere somehow we're going to lose, but as long as we are going to be safe.”
