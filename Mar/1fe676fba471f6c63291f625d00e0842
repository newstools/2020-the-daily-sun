A wife is in self-isolation after her husband contracted the corona virus. She believes he caught the virus while on a trip in the United Kingdom. But she has no idea that her husband actually caught the virus while in Italy with his nyatsi! The Sun newspaper reports that the  the unnamed patient , in his late 30s, confessed to public health coordinators in the north of England how he picked up the serious virus  following a secret trip overseas. He presented himself to a hospital on return with coronavirus symptoms - and tests revealed he has Covid-19. The man, described as "well-heeled and with a high-flying job", told doctors that the affair was with a woman, but has refused to name her. His wife has now self-isolated at their lavish home in the north of England.  A source told The Sun: "This patient is the talk of public health officials.         The country is in lockdown and the Italian authorities have advised against all but essential travel. However there was a glimmer of hope in the worst affected country after China and under lockdown for a week.  It yesterday announced 349 deaths, taking its toll to 2,158, but said the worst-hit region of Lombardy was beginning to show signs of a possible slow down in the spread of the virus.
