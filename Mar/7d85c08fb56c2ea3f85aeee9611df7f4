 TSHEPANG Mokoena is kept awake all night by an evil tokoloshe that dances on his roof! The 45-year-old from Codesa 2 in Mangaung, Free State, said the tokoloshe arrives at 10pm and dances until the early hours of the morning. He said he spent a lot of money on sangomas, but they couldn’t help him get rid of the creature. When the tokoloshe first started visiting him last June, he thought it was a thug. “It starts by jumping on the roof. Then it will start tapping its feet and clapping hands,” he said. “When my girlfriend visits me she doesn’t hear it. We aren’t happy any- more because I’m always too tired to satisfy her in bed,” he said.  His girlfriend, Mamia Leeuw (40), said whenever she visited Tshepang, she fell asleep before 10pm. “The tokoloshe has ruined many special nights. “We no longer have morning glory because Tshepang will say he’s too tired. I can’t be in this kind of relationship,” she said. Tshepang’s cousin said he accompanied him to a sangoma.  “During the consultation, the sangoma could identify his problem but the muthi he gave him hasn’t helped. “My cousin even lost his job because he was falling asleep at work. I don’t know who is so cruel and making Tshepang suffer so much,” he said. Sangoma Ndabazomoya Sotshononda said Tshepang needed a powerful sangoma to chase the tokoloshe away. “Tokoloshes are hard to fight but this problem can be fixed,” he said.
