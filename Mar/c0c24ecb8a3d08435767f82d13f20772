THE burnt bodies of three men who had been stoned were found on Sunday next to a torched truck. Although the scene looked like there had been an incident of mob justice, Limpopo police said they were still investigating. The cops in Dennilton outside Groblersdal have now launched a manhunt for the suspects. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said it looked as if the victims were severely assaulted before they died. He said stones were found on the scene. “Police were informed of the incident by a passerby and went to the scene with emergency medical services,” he said. Cops found the bodies of three men, aged between 20 and 31, burnt beyond recognition with a burnt-out Hyundai truck next to them. Motlafela said that three cases of murder were opened. “The motive for the brutal killings is still being investigated, but a mob attack cannot be ruled out,” Mojapelo told the People’s Paper.
