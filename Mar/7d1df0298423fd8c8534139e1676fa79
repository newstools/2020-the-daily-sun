WHEN load shedding plunged the building into darkness, thugs took the chance to rob the place – and got security guard Sbongakonke Buthelezi fired! Sbongakonke and his colleague were fired last week. The 38-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, said they were charged with negligence. “How were we supposed to see thugs in the dark, when we didn’t have torches?” he said.  Sbongakonke said thugs entered the unfenced Transnet premises at night in October and stole microwaves, an iron and a kettle. He said they saw two thugs run away with the stolen goods and gave chase, but the men disappeared into the nearby Makause squatter camp in Germiston. OLD POWER STATIONS PUT MZANSI IN THE DARK Sbongakonke said his boss told him there was no point for him to work because he’s short-sighted. “I told him people living with albinism are short-sighted, but he told me to bring a medical certificate.” Daily Sun spoke to the owner of the security company. He said there was no way Sbongakonke could have been dismissed because of his eyes or load shedding. He claimed the company provided guards with torches and insisted the hearing was fair. The Department of Employment and Labour advised Sbongakonke to visit his nearest CCMA office.
