Some might have thought it was the prelude to the second coming of Jesus. But it wasn’t – it was a malfunction at the local winery in an Italian town called Castelvetro, Modena. It’s reported that due to a technical fault, wine from the winery found itself into the water supply lines.

The municipality quickly sent technicians to fix the issue, however by the time the technicians arrived residents had bottled as much of the precious liquid as they could.
