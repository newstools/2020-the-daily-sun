ANOTHER day, another cash heist. On Tuesday, bystanders watched in disbelief as a speeding white sedan, apparently driven by a woman, forced a Fidelity cash van off the road outside Hluvukani in Mpumalanga, causing it to overturn. A witness said he realised the Mercedes-Benz driver was a woman after she took off a balaclava and ran to a Ford Focus getaway car when the Mercedes-Benz caught fire. In a split second, a gang of armed men surrounded the cash van and dragged out the two guards trapped inside. “The guards were disarmed and robbers blew up the armoured vehicle with explosives, sending a cloud of countless banknotes flying into the air,” the witnesses said. They collected the cash as it landed, as well as cash boxes scattered on the road. Another witness said villagers almost fell over each other as they helped themselves to some of the cash. The thugs had already fled in a white sedan with no number plates when police arrived. Colonel Brenda Muridili confirmed a cash van was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money along Manyeleti Road between Acornhoek and Hluvukani on Tuesday. She said after the white Mercedes-Benz caught fire, five suspects, two armed with rifles, emerged and shouted at the guards to get out of the van. “After a few minutes, the van was bombed,” she said. “The suspects took an undisclosed amount of money from the van, a rifle, a pistol and fled the scene in a white Ford Focus. “No shots were fired and no injuries were reported.” Anyone with information is asked to call 08600 1000.
