The virus can be defeated and we must increase testing and quarantine those travelling.” Mboweni said his department has put together funds for a national disaster. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said military hospitals would cater for everyone if necessary. “We’ve cancelled all travel within the department and encourage people to self-quarantine if unwell,” she said. Mbalula said: “All airline and ground handling officials carrying out assisted passenger services are required to use masks and gloves.” Labour’s Thulas Nxesi said: “We’ll look at the impact on the labour market and inform workers about safety precautions.” Home Affairs’ Aaron Motsoaledi said of the 72 ports of entry, two seaports would be affected. “We will close 35 land ports.
