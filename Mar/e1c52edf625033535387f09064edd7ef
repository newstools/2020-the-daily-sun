 Gauteng Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo has condemned the killing of four people in incidents believed to be linked to taxi violence. On Friday, Mziwakhe Mbatha, a taxi owner from the Greater Germiston Taxi Association, and two security officers from Vendor Security - Sipho Masondo and Sifiso Mthembu - were shot and killed while travelling near Lambton in Germiston. Police reports indicate 23 AK-47s and 33 9mm cartridges were recovered at the scene. Two rifles and two pistols were found in the victims' vehicle. On Thursday, Derick Mlungisi Kunene from the Nancefield Dube West Taxi Association was fatally shot on Chris Hani Road in Dlamini, Soweto. The police said 20 spent cartridges and four bullets were recovered at the scene. "Just yesterday, I had a meeting with the provincial leadership of the taxi industry in our province where they expressed a deep concern that heinous crimes are being committed against them without any arrests and prosecution. "This creates the impression that their lives are cheap. We remain confident that taxi violence will end soon," Mamabolo said. He added the provincial government had established a commission of inquiry into taxi violence in the province.
