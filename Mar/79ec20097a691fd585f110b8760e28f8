A WOMAN who was raped during an office Christmas party last year says she will not rest until she finds justice. The 26-year-old mum of two from Joburg has since lost her job. She said on the day of the incident a man followed her to the toilet and raped her. “I told him to stop but he didn’t. I screamed but no one helped me.” She said she screamed again after the incident that she had just been raped but, again, no one paid attention. “I guess people took advantage of the fact that we all had a lot to drink,” she said. The woman said when she got to work the following day, her colleagues accused her of screaming and telling people she was raped. “I wrote to management to apologise for my behaviour,” she said. But the following day, a colleague told her someone had confessed to raping her. “I let management know but they did nothing. I was fired a week later and told employees didn’t feel safe around me.” The woman said she opened a case at Parkview Police Station. Daily Sun also spoke to the man who told her about the confession. He said he and the man were discussing the party when he told him he had sex with her. “He was so arrogant. He told me how weak she was and how she couldn’t even move. I was disgusted,” he said. “I’m disappointed by how this whole thing was handled and I hope the law deals with them.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed a case was opened. NPA Gauteng spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said the case would be looked into and contact made with the woman. “We can’t help with the employee disputes, though. She needs to go to the CCMA,” she said.
