SHE stabbed her boyfriend to death and claimed it was a mistake. But social media users would not have it and called for #JusticeForVuyo. They said women should get the same punishment as men for killing their partners. The outrage was sparked by Vuyo Mbena’s death. The 21-year-old from Namibia in Mangaung, Free State, was stabbed by his girlfriend on Sunday. They had allegedly argued over a cellphone.  Vuyo’s family said the girlfriend was proud of killing their son. This after she took to Facebook saying she will always love him. She said people were quick to judge without knowing what happened, but regrets what she did. Vuyo’s mum, Thandiwe (44), said her child was blinded by love and it had him killed. “I last saw my child on Saturday morning. He told his sister he was not coming back. “In the early hours of Sunday, his girlfriend’s uncle told us he was stabbed. We immediately rushed to the scene and found him lying dead with stab wounds on his chest and arm,” said Thandiwe. MARRIAGE MUTHI BACKFIRES Vuyo’s father Papi (47) said: “I will never forget what this woman did to my family. My heart is bleeding.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a case of murder was being investigated by Parkweg police. He said the 22-year-old suspect appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Monday, where she was granted bail. “She’ll appear again on 17 March,” he said.
