IN-DEMAND Black Leopards midfielder Lesedi “TT” Kapinga should follow in Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana’s footsteps if he leaves Lidoda Duvha at the end of this season. This is the advice of Burning Spear Development Academy principal Nsindane Nqobile who found Kapinga at the age of 16 from the dusty grounds of Musina and helped the now 24-year-old develop to the player he is. Nqobile nurtured Kapinga’s talent for five years until he joined GladAfrica Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in 2017. Kapinga signed with Lidoda Duvha in 2018 and helped Leopards gain promotion to the top flight. Kapinga’s contract with the current Absa Premiership bottom side is due to expire at the end of June. And the 24-year-old has been linked with a move south with clubs such as Sundowns, Orlando Pirates, Bidvest Wits, Supersport United and AmaZulu reportedly interested in his services. Kapinga has been in fine form despite Leopards struggles this season and is their leading goal scorer together with striker Mwape Musonda with five goals. Nqobile says Kapinga needs to be careful which team he joins. “To be honest, I think he should look at Kekana’s career,” said Nqobile. “Kekana left Leopards in 2008 when he joined SuperSport United. “Kekana did well at United and grew into a big star. That is why he is the player he is today. It is true, big teams can pay you well, but are you going to play and grow as a player or you are just going there for the money? He added: “I think the team that Kapinga should sign for is SuperSport or Wits. He will grow like Kekana. But that is just my advice. “I have no doubt he will do well at any team. All I want is for him to grow and not rush (into joining a club) for money. He is talented and I see a bright future for him.”
