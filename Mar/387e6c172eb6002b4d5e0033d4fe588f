THIRTY-EIGHT years later and Herman and Connie Mashaba are still in love! The founder of The People’s Dialogue took to Twitter yesterday to share an anniversary message with his wife. “Today we celebrate 38 years of marriage @Connie Mashaba, I owe so much to you. I would have never been the man I am today without your love and support. Here’s to many more years together as we build the South Africa of our dreams.” Mashaba told Daily Sun he first saw Connie at the end of 1978, when he visited Hans Kekana High School, where she was a pupil.  “We were attending a beauty pageant and she won. I started dating her when I was at the University of Turfloop in 1979 and realised she was the girl of my dreams.” He said they tied the knot on 3 March 1982 after two years of dating, and it was the best thing he ever did. “Connie has been more than a wife to me: a friend, protector and business partner. “I hope our relationship can serve as an inspiration to others born in the same circumstances as Connie and I. “We had no material assets but love and respect for each other. I will forever be grateful for the positive role she played in my life.” He said Connie held the family together and took over the businesses while he focused on his political dream. Social media users congratulated them.
