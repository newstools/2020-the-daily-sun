MOLEFI Ntseki has previously refused to be drawn on Bongani Zungu’s disrespectful comments over his omission from the Bafana Bafana team. But the Bafana coach has broken his silence, following yet another comment by the France-based midfielder at the weekend. Zungu was recently left out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers team for back-to-back matches against Sao Tome and Principe. And the former Mamelodi Sundowns star clearly didn’t clearly take kindly to being snubbed, taking to social media to vent his frustration, if not to express his shock. “My manager and my family asked me not to open up about the situation with Bafana Bafana on social media,” Zungu said. “But I can say I’m angry. This issue has made me angry and I’m not okay. I went to the Afcon finals (Egypt) with pain from a knee injury. But still I went and gave my all for the team. “They don’t call me when I’m in my best form. It really hurts.” But Ntseki has expressed his disappointment at Zungu’s comments, saying he didn’t expect such a reaction from a professional. “I have shared with you the reasons we didn’t select him for the camp. Remember, there are a lot of factors we take into consideration when we select the team,” Ntseki said. “He is not the only player we didn’t select, who probably felt the same way. But they have handled themselves in a professional manner. “He might not be aware, but he is putting himself under pressure the next time he is in the team.” Ntseki again explained he left Zungu out for the latter to focus on his club duties, having been injury-free and performing consistently for French Ligue 1 side Amiens AC.
