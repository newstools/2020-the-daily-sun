THE SKY is the limit for Baroka’s new signing Ivan Mahangwahaya. The 30-year-old striker joined Bakgaga in January after being released by Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt. Mahangwahaya spent only six months at Wits after he joined them from Black Leopards. And Mahangwahaya told SunSport yesterday that he is enjoying playing football again. “I have a good relationship with our coach Dylan Kerr from our time at Leopards,” said the Venda-born player. “Even when he left Leopards and went home to England, we have been communicating. Kerr is like a father to me. He knows how to get the best out of me. I just want to continue working hard and helping Baroka do well.” Baroka have shone in the Nedbank Cup. Kerr’s lads are in the Ke Yona semi-final where they face Bloemfontein Celtic. “We are just one game away from the final, and we are confident that we can win it,” explained Mahangwahaya. “Baroka won the Telkom Knockout last season and we want to make more history by winning the Nedbank Cup. “It won’t be easy but we will do our best to please our fans, club chairman Khurishi Mphahlele and our coach.” However, Baroka’s form in the Absa Premiership has been dismal. They are currently in the relegation zone with 23 points the same as their Limpopo rivals Polokwane City and AmaZulu. Baroka, City and AmaZulu are only three points ahead of bottom side Leopards, with six games remaining. But Mahangwahaya is optimistic that the Ga-Mphahlele-based side will not go down. “We have a strong team and the confidence is back after we won two games in a row against Leopards in the league and Nedbank Cup. I’m confident Baroka will still be playing in the top flight next season,” added Mahangwahaya.
