THE countdown to lockdown has begun and Mzansi stores are packed to capacity. Mzansi’s national shutdown as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa is only hours away and people are packed inside supermarkets trying to buy basics they will need. By the look of the queues, people are not even adhering to the 1.5 meter distance from each other. It’s not only the basics that has Mzansi people are waiting in long queues for, but it also seems people don’t want to be in lockdown and sober. There are long queues at bottle stores of people who are stockpiling booze.  31st of December today.

The shop opens at 09:00. Remember no liquor store will be open during the period. #Covid19inSA#SouthAfricaLockdown @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/8hNjwFMgfJ I am so ready for day one of #lockdown .
