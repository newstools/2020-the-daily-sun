THE hunt is on for churchgoers who attended a Free State gathering where foreigners who’ve now tested positive for the coronavirus were in attendance. During a media briefing yesterday, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said the department would soon make public appeals through various platforms for the Divine Restoration Church congregants to come forward so they could be tested.

They’re still in the Free State and one of them has been taken into quarantine,” said Mkhize. They are believed to have arrived in the country between 9 and 11 March and attended the church. This was the church gathering attended by ACDP leader Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, who has since tested for the virus. Meshoe also came into contact with President Cyril Ramaphosa.
