AN OUTBREAK of measles has killed at least 83 people in the conflict-prone Central African Republic. The fatalities have been recorded since the first case was recorded at the end of January. A total of 7 626 suspected cases have been documented, with a large number of cases (72%) being of children below five years old, and 18% of cases were between five and 10 years old. The low vaccination coverage for routine measles vaccine over the past five years, standing at below 60% for the first dose at nine months, and the absence of a second measles vaccine dose in the national immunisation schedule, contribute to the epidemic. There is also inadequate follow-up campaigns that have resulted in a high proportion of people susceptible to measles. All 35 health districts in the country are at risk of more outbreaks. “Without an adequate response, the epidemic could spread through the entire country,” a spokesperson for the UN Children’s Fund said. Measles has escalated in the Central African country despite it being a vaccine-preventable disease. The conflict battering the nation is indirectly to blame for the surge of cases. The security context of the country limits access to set up rapid response measures in affected health districts. There have also been large population movements between vaccinated and unvaccinated areas.
