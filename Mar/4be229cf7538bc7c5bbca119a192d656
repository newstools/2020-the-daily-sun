DURBAN are set to host the senior men’s Cosafa Cup in June. Cosafa general secretary Sue Destombes said they have agreed with the City Council of Durban with the announcement to be made before the World Football Summit (WFS) on the 17-18 this month in Durban. The City of eThekwini acting mayor Mxolisi Kaunda, Cosafa president Philip Chiyangwa and Safa president Danny Jordan met at the weekend to finalise Durban as the venue. But before everything can officially be confirmed, the City of Durban said they’ll investigate what will be the return on investment for the people of eThekwini as they want to host it for the next three years. But said Destombes: “We’ll do a formal launch soon.” Durban staged this event last year where it was played at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium and KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium. The final and third place play-off took place at Moses Mabhida Stadium. The tournament was won by Zambia. This year’s tournament, which will take place from 13-27 June, is set to be hosted at the same venues. Bafana will enter at the quarter-final stage due to their better Fifa world rankings. Safa will again send a second string team, as Bafana will be playing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers (Afcon) in June. The SA Under-23 squad will also not be available as they will be preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan which start in July.
