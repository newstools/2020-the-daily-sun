ON TUESDAY, Free State Health MEC Montseng Tsiu unveiled 50 new ambulances at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein. Tsiu said his department wanted to reduce the shortage of ambulances in the province. The new ambulances would be allocated to different parts of the province to speed up service delivery. The department said 10 of the ambulances were mobile clinic vehicles and 40 were transporters.  “I am happy about these new ambulances as I always get complaints about slow ambulances or a shortage of them. I am glad this will now be a thing of the past,” said Tsiu. “I call on the drivers to ensure ambulances are used for the purpose they were meant for. “Let us make sure we attend to urgent emergency matters as soon as we can.” Rocklands resident Maletsatsi Mofokeng (47) said he was happy about the new ambulances. “We were struggling to get ambulances to take our patients to hospital. “We appeal to the drivers to come as soon as they can when called. We want to avoid babies having to be delivered at home.” Teboho Ralebese (50) thanked the MEC for ensuring they got the new ambulances.
