UNDER pressure Baroka FC coach Dylan Kerr has refused to comment about his future with the struggling Absa Premiership outfit. Kerr’s position intensified following Chippa United coach Norman Mapeza’s resignation on Tuesday due to the Chilli Boys’ poor form while bottom club AmaZulu put their coach Josef Vukusic on “special leave”. Now all eyes are on Kerr ahead of their Limpopo derby against his former team Black Leopards at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). In seven league matches Kerr has been in charge of the Ga-Mphahlele-based club, after he succeeded Wedson Nyirenda in December, he has won two and lost five. Bakgaga come to this showdown without a win in three consecutive Premiership matches, losing to Highlands Park, Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic. But Baroka’s performances under Kerr in the Nedbank Cup have been impressive as they have advanced to Ke Yona Cup quarter-finals. “I don’t want to comment on my future at Baroka,” said Kerr laughing. “I will talk about it when the season ends. My focus now is on the Leopards game.” Baroka are 13th on the log with 20 points, the same as bottom side AmaZulu with only seven matches remaining. Baroka also have the same points as Lidoda Duvha. Both Baroka and Leopards cannot afford to lose or draw in this clash if they want to boost their chances of surviving the relegation axe. “This game is not about Kerr and Leopards,” he said. “This is Leopards against Baroka and it is going to be war. We have to fight for three points in each of our remaining matches.” What makes it more interesting about these two rivals, they will clash twice in two weeks. They face each other this weekend followed by their Nedbank quarter-final showdown next week at the same venue.
