RESIDENTS woke up at the crack of dawn to queue at Home Affairs offices. But they were told to either continue waiting or go back home as the entire building in Umgeni, Durban, didn’t have electricity. And this was caused by an electricity box that blew up on Wednesday. Although the eThekwini Municipality was told about the matter on the same day, it wasn’t fixed. When the SunTeam arrived at the offices, some people were leaving, while others continued to stand in the long queues. Workers could also be seen sitting inside the offices. A security guard said the people were told about the problem and advised they could wait or leave. Resident Nokuphiwa Mthalane (45) said she wanted to apply for her child’s ID. “I came here at 6am because I wanted to be helped early. We waited until the workers came and then we were told there was a problem,” she said. Another resident, Cebisile Ntombela (55), said she also went to the office’s early to apply for her child’s ID. “This is the third time I’m coming here. In January, the computers were offline. They were still offline last month and today, it’s a power outage. “There are always problems at this office. I will go to another one because I can’t take this anymore,” she said. Home Affairs KZN spokesman Cyril Mncwabe said there was an electrical power failure, which should be sorted out by eThekwini Municipality. He said later on the day (Thursday) the office was operational on generator power. The eThekwini municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said a team was sent to attend to the fault on Wednesday night. He said repairs were expected to be completed today.
