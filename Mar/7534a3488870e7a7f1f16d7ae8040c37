Chippa United coach Rulani Mokwena remains convinced that he made the right call to leave Mamelodi Sundowns for Orlando Pirates. The up-and-coming tactician enjoyed a successful spell as Pitso Mosimane's second assistant coach as they collected many pieces of silverware almost three years ago. Mokwena then came in for some criticism when he decided to leave Masandawana to join Micho Sredojevic at Orlando Pirates, but the young coach believes it was a good move. "Some people believe it was a mistake to leave Sundowns for Orlando Pirates but I'm always of the opinion that it was the right decision and I am still of the opinion that it was the right decision," Mokwena told Lesedi FM. "I think Orlando Pirates is a big institution with probably one of the wisest chairmen around apart from all the other things that people talk about and know within the organisation but it's a fantastic organisation to work for, he added. "You learn a lot and sometimes you learn the good and the bad and you are able to grow. "And even with the difficulties and when your job is made difficult, you are able to know that this is preparation and all that makes you grow. It makes you a better person. "If you look at the experience that I have been fortunate to gather at Sundowns and even at Pirates, you can see that the quality of experience is worth more than being an assistant anywhere else or being a head coach in one of the smaller teams in the country because you can't buy that experience - I mean the experience of working with top players." -SPORT24
