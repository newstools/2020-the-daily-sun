WHEN the condom broke, the magosha and her client joked about it. “We said nothing would happen,” said the 37-year-old woman from Benoni, Ekurhuleni. But she was pregnant and now she is the mother of a 15-month-old baby boy and she’s back at work. “Maternity leave ended the day my son was six months old.” She said she met the man three years ago and he became a regular client. She had been a magosha for seven years and she never thought she’d have a baby with a client. “I thought of having an abortion but my client convinced me not to do it,” she said. “My client was there throughout the pregnancy.  To this day, he’s a man of his word. “Every month he sends R4 000 for the baby and R3 500 for groceries, my hair and other needs. I’m a very happy baby mama,” she said. The daddy (52) told Daily Sun he has been married for more than 10 years and when he went to her, he was experiencing marital problems. He said this was his fourth child. “When I heard she was pregnant, I went crazy but I had to handle the situation,” he said. “This child is innocent and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him.” He said he won’t tell his wife yet.  “I love my wife and I don’t want to break her heart. One day when the time is right I will break the news to her,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to magoshas about relationships with clients. A 39-year-old magosha said she has dated three of her clients. She dumped one because he demanded that she stops being a magosha.  “The second one wanted kids but he couldn’t even send me an allowance,” she said “I was happy with the last one. We broke up when he moved to Cape Town for work.” Another magosha said she was in a happy relationship with her client for eights months, but he died in a car accident. “He was the best man I ever had. He never judged me and loved me for who I was. I’m definitely open for any relationship, whether it’s a client or not.”
