A video of a Volkswagen Polo GTI causing an accident has surfaced on social media. In the video, a black Polo GTI can be seen pulling off at the robots while driving on the left lane. It seems like the driver of the Polo was planning on turning left, however, the driver decided otherwise and started indicating right. By the looks of things, the driver didnâ€™t look if other cars were passing but went straight ahead and crossed the road. This is when the GTI and the Nissan 370Z that had a dash cam crashed.
