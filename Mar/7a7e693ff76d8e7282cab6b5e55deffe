There’s a new dating site where size really doesn’t
matter. Dinky One, a new matchmaking website, aims to fight 4-5 size
pressure by helping those with smaller ones to find love.  “Dinky One was created to help guys who are smaller than
average 4-5s,” founder David Minns told The Post. “Smaller guys can use the
site privately and date outside of their usual network. Everyone understands
the situation in advance, allowing couples to focus on getting to know each
other and dating.” Those with a 4-5 smaller than 5.5 inches, the global
average erect penis length, are defined as Dinky Ones and “are eligible to
join,” the site says, boasting that “100% of the men on this site are less than
average.” SMALL 4-5 TORTURE! The site claims it currently has over 27,000 members,
with a ratio of 71 percent male to 27 percent female and 2 percent transgender. “When you’re a smaller man dating is very complicated,”
one anonymous user, aged 36, says in the site’s testimonials. “It’s therefore
far better to date online with strangers and even better on a dedicated site
such as Dinky One as everyone knows in advance.” A second Dinky One fan says she simply prefers smaller
4-5s. I HAVE A SMALL 4-5! “I find sex painful with a man bigger than four inches
and in the past have had to resort to oral but miss that close intimacy of
sex,” says the 28-year-old. The site — which is not available as a mobile app —
doesn’t require users to add photos and explicitly bans sharing nude images on
the platform. Anonymous profiles are allowed, so long as an email address is
given. LEBO’S SCARY 4-5! Dinky One debuts at a unique time for dating apps, with
Tinder recently warning users that the deadly coronavirus is highly contagious
— something to be aware of when trying to find love among strangers.
