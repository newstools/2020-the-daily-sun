KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has taken a subtle swipe at his league title rivals. While Amakhosi appear to be favourites for the championship, Orlando Pirates are unsure about declaring their league ambitions, though they are quietly harbouring hopes of throwing the spanner in the works for their Soweto rivals. Jozef Zinnbauer’s players have clearly made a solemn vow not to publicly declare their title ambitions.But is seems no one is falling for their mind games. “I’m always laughing when other teams are talking that they ‘don’t want the championship’, or they want this,” said Middendorp. “No, no, no. We have a very clear goal. From the beginning on the first of August last year, before we started (the season).“I know (some people) were smiling all over saying, ‘What is this crazy man doing or saying?’ And even I said it (that we are chasing the title). Coaches were looking at me and saying, ‘How can a club pressurise the team in such a way?’Middendorp has been under tremendous pressure leading up to the Soweto derby amid a poor run of results. But he earned some reprieve as pressure eased somewhat, with his change in strategy bearing fruits.“And I said, ‘No, let’s restart. Let’s do stuff differently,” Middendorp said. “If you do something differently, you will probably have different results. If you always do the same, in terms of training, in terms of guiding, putting stuff together, you are not getting results. I’m not quoting Einstein. “But I think this is a very crucial element when we talked to the players, gave them the right guidance and mentoring. “We have our fate in our hands. In fact, we had it for the last seven months. Our target has been the league, and the other one (monthly awards) is okay but it doesn’t bring you anything.”
