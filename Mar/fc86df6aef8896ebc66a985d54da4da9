Furious protestors from Motherwell, Kamvelihle and Wells Estate torched two trucks near Markman Industrial Area in Port Elizabeth on Thursday night. On Friday morning protesters continued to block all the roads leading to Motherwell with burning tyres and rubble leaving commuters stranded as they were unable to board their buses or taxis. They claim that the municipality is not taking them seriously as they fail to meet their demands of sanitation and electricity. A community leader, who identified himself as Zizi, said: "We are tired of MMC of Infrastructure and Engineering, Andile Lungisa and the municipality's empty promises, we were promised service delivery a long time ago but nothing is happening. "The fact that we decide to bring this kasi to a standstill and disrupt everything should mean something to them. Officials from municipality and Lungisa must come and address us instead of sending the police. â€œWe met with them and former mayor Mongameli Bobani last year and gave them a time frame to connect electricity in our shacks and bring water closer to us, we are sick and tired of izinyoka," he said. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said: "A milk delivery truck, without cargo, was set alight on the N2, whilst another truck was stoned and set alight on the M17." Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: "We are aware of the Motherwell protest and were Addo is still affected by protests and road blockage. "Motorists are advised to avoid using Addo Road as it is affected by a protest and roadblock. Police and Metro police are on the scene to monitor the situation," he said.
