NORMAL night shift turned into a night of terror for Daniel Mokgatlha. The 27-year-old allegedly was attacked by cops while at work in the Mogwase industrial area, outside Rustenburg in the North West, last Sunday. He said police accused him of setting fire to a building. “I was coming out of the toilet when I saw a building on fire. I don’t know who did it or how it happened. I explained to cops but they refused to listen to me.” Daniel was handcuffed and taken to a dark area, where five cops allegedly assaulted him. He said two of them electrocuted and hit him with open hands and fists and he was hurt on wrists, tummy and 4-5. “I now urinate blood,” he said. It allegedly happened during a wage protest as angry workers torched five buildings in the industrial area. He said his section wasn’t part of the protest. Colonel Adele Myburgh said Ipid was investigating a case of assault.
