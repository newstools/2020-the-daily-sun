Most people would like to know what leaders are up to
during this self-isolation period due to coronavirus. Well, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius
Malema has tweeted one of his activities. He shared a video of himself babysitting his son. In the video, the firebrand EFF commander in Chief is
seen with his youngest son strapped to his back. The video is captioned: “Self isolation, stay at home
cadres.” Corona virus has so far infected 402 people in South
Africa and president Ramaphosa is expected to chart the way forward this
evening. The message coming from the presidency and other sectors
of the country has, amongst others, been that people should self-isolate.
