Dean Furman says SuperSport United are doing everything in their power to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The 31-year-old explained in a statement on the club's official website that in order to beat the virus, we must stand together. He said: "We are trying to remain upbeat, however, we realise there is a very real global pandemic that has taken over the world and is affecting all of us in some form. "We are taking all measures to ensure the safety of everyone." He added: "During times like these, football, unfortunately, becomes insignificant. There are people all over the world who are falling ill and losing their lives. “Our health is the only thing that is important. We hope in the coming weeks and months, we witness a global improvement and can begin to focus on football again! "We await announcements from SAFA and the PSL board to tell us when the league will resume again."
