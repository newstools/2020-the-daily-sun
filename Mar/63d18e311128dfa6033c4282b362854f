THE Khoisan king, King Khoisan SA says he’s not going anywhere! The king and his people have been camping outside the Union Buildings since November 2018. The Khoisan Seven went to the Union Buildings to request a meeting with the president and vowed not to leave until they got what they wanted. With Mzansi in the national coronavirus lockdown since midnight, the king said they would isolate themselves at the Union Buildings. He said they had nowhere to go and had made the Union Buildings their home.  He said they were not afraid of the deadly virus, but starvation would kill them. “Yes, the virus is dangerous but we eat herbs to boast our immune system,” he said. They appealed for food donations, saying the 21 days would be long. Khoisan SA said they took precautions, like washing hands and sanitising. “We are not even shaking people’s hands or hugging. “We keep a safe distance from each other,” he said. Almost 45 mine workers arrived two weeks ago from Kuruman, Northern Cape, and erected a tent next to the Khoisan. One of the miners, Phokojane Ratshere (74), said they would go back home but will come back after the lockdown. “We want to be with our families,’ he said. “But we will be back after three weeks, to demand to be paid the money owed to us by the mine.”
