ARSENAL are reportedly one of the clubs considering a move for Barcelona midfielder Philippe Coutinho at the end of the season. The Brazilian ace is currently on loan at German giants Bayern Munich but it looks as though he will not stay there on a permanent basis once the season-long deal comes to an end. Coutinho has done well during his time at the Allianz Arena, but not well enough to convince Bayern to fork out the £100 million (about R2 billion) that Barcelona will be looking for to make the deal permanent. Barca are looking to cash in to fund transfer moves of their own with Neymar and Lautaro Martinez on the radar, and if Bayern will not meet the asking price, they will push the player towards the Premier League. There is said to be no shortage of interest in England and Arsenal are not the only club to be mentioned in the Sunday tabloids. Arch rivals Tottenham, along with Manchester United and Chelsea have also been mentioned, so the competition for his signature is likely to be fierce. It remains to be seen whether the Gunners would be willing to pay as much as £100 million for Coutinho as it would mean having to break their transfer record to get him on board. Boss Mikel Arteta is hoping for a squad revamp though and this kind of marquee signing would excite the fans and be a huge statement of intent.
