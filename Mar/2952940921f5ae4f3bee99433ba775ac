BAD boy Masibusane Zongo is back to his old ways. The 29-year-old dribbling wizard has gone awol... again. His club, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, have revealed that Zongo has not reported for training since Friday 28 February. The Venda outfit, which plays in the GladAfrica Championship, had given Zongo a lifeline by offering him a short term deal in January this year. But it seems Zongo has not learnt his lesson. "Masibusane Zongo has not reported back to work after our game against Cape Umoya United on Friday, the 28th February," read a statement from the club. "Zongo asked to go home to see his child after the game. The team made arrangements for him o fly back on Sunday instead of travelling back with the team on Friday night. "Currently, nobody knows his whereabouts but it is too early to conclude the player has gone back to his old infamous ways of disappearing without notifying the club. "All we can say now is that Zongo did not report for work when training resumed on Tuesday, March 3 and we will wait for him to return before we can further discuss. We are anxious to hear from anyone who may know his whereabouts as his phone is switched off. Zongo is considered to be one of the most talented players Mzansi has ever produced. However, he never reached his full potential as a result of his off-field antics.
