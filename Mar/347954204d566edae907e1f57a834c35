MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is aware of the danger posed by zestful Highlands Park players. The two teams will clash in a Nedbank Cup quarterfinal showdown at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday evening (6pm). Highlands’ who eliminated Kaizer Chiefs in the last-16 of the competition will be looking at continuing with their exploits at the intimidating venue. Mosimane said his side would need the energy to overcome Highlands. "It's a cup game, it has its tempo, momentum and emotions,” Mosimane said at the press conference on Thursday. "It is a difficult place to go, who wants to go to Makhulong guys? We will be in trouble, I can tell you now” “But I hope that the game finishes in 90 minutes, whether we win or lose." “It should not go to extra-time because it will affect our league game against Orlando Pirates on Tuesday,” Mosimane added. "You need energy at Makhulong, more than tactics. You need player availability, which is what we are struggling with because of injuries" "And you also need the mental strength because they don't pull out of tackles" It has been a week of non-stop football for Sundowns which has not only drained them physical but emotionally as well. They were eliminated in the CAF Champions League quarter-finals by Al Ahly 3-1 on aggregate on Saturday. On Tuesday they traveled to Cape Town for their Absa Premiership clash against Stellenbosch FC where they managed to grind a 1-0 victory to close the gap to four points between them and Kaizer Chiefs at the top of the table. “We are playing well-rested teams. If you were not aware of what happened against Stellenbosch before Tebogo Langerman went out to leave us with 10 men for about 15 to 20 minutes including optional time on the pitch, we were already slowing down. "They are strong, and they mark man to man - they go with you wherever you go. But fortunately, we have mental strength."
