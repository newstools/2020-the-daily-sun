The fourth-generation model of the Corolla was released in March 1979 in Japan and of course by the time it made it to our shores we slapped it with a nickname. The KE70 is popularly known in Mzansi as the Baby Cressida and is loved by most drag-racing enthusiasts. In a video that has gone viral on social media, a baby blue Baby Cres can be seen laying rubber to the ground and spinning. By the looks of things, it is not using a stock standard Corolla engine.  Many of the drag-racing owners usually swap the original engine for a Lexus V8 engine which supplies tons of power to the little car.
