Twitter is calling Rihanna for president after the singer donated yet again to fighting the coronavirus pandemic. Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, tweeted on Thursday sharing that the 32-year-old has donated personal protective equipment to the state of New York, which prompted Terisa Siagatonu on Twitter to share everything the singer has actually done so far to help battle Covid-19.  According to CNN, the Love On The Brain singer's foundation, the Clara Lionel Foundation, also announced a donation on $5 million (R87.5 million) on Saturday saying in a statement, "When we first began this year, never could we have imagined how (the coronavirus) would so dramatically alter our lives. "It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from, this pandemic will affect us all. And for the world's most vulnerable, the worst may be yet to come." The money was donated to Direct Relief, Feeding America, Partners in Health, The World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and the International Rescue Committee, to name just a few. And this, after the Prime Minister of Barbados, Rihanna's home country, announced the singer had offered to purchase ventilators worth a total $700 000 (R12 million). Twitter responded to 'President Rihanna's' contribution with one fan writing, "Nothing but respect for my President." Another said, "I stan a queen." - Channel24
