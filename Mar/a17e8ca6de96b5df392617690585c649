Mpumalanga community safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala has pleaded with traffic officials to ensure that the law is enforced during the lockdown period. Shabalala said this while she was distributing protective gear in Mbombela on Wednesday. The protective gear is expected to be distributed in all the regions in the province. She said the officers must not use the opportunity of being essential services to go around taverns and buying booze. "I have seen clips of people saying they won't abide by the regulations implemented. They say they won't wash hands and will continue going out to buy booze, let them be ignorant, we are going to enforce the law upon them. We are going to enforce the law and let that law not be enforced on you," she said. Shabalala said Covid-19 is a serious matter around the world and it is important for the department to provide its officials with all necessary equipment. "This is a very serious thing, you cannot go around without protecting yourselves. We want to be safe. Safety measures must be applied, don't say I won't use gloves or whatsoever, when you are exposed as an individual you are bound to infect a bigger number, " she said. Shabalala said the province had to make sure that they bind themselves in what the president had said. "If you guys are at risk we will be at risk with you. So let's ensure that we prioritise our safety first, "she said. She said the province is expected to receive members of the SANDF in the province and will be placed in the province. A traffic officer, Thando Nkambule said they were overwhelmed by the MEC's means to come and educate them about the virus and also encouraging them to continue working during such difficult conditions. "We appreciate the MEC's efforts by giving us equipment to protect ourselves during these times," he said.
