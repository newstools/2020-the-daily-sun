A woman was left frightened after a taxi driver smashed her car windscreen in a road rage incident, last week. The incident, which was captured on camera, took place in Montana north of Pretoria. The taxi driver used what looked like a rod to smash the womanâ€™s window. On Monday the picture of the driver being arrested was shared on social media.
