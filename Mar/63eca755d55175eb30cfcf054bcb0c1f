KAYA FM’s afternoon host and Idols SA judge Unathi Msengana’s valuables have been violated. Her Porsche Panamera valued at more than R2 million was scratched at a parking lot. The 40-year-old showbiz all-rounder told cops she suffered damages worth R30 000. This when she opened a case of malicious damage to property at the Linden Police Station in November. A statement seen by the SunTeam revealed the incident happened while she was getting in shape at a Virgin Active in Randburg, Jozi. Read her statement, in part: “The complainant alleged that on 4 November at about 7.40pm she parked her white Porsche (sic) Panamera (registration number withheld, at the parking lot of Virgin Active. “ . . . On the same day at about 7.50pm when she returned to her vehicle she discovered that her vehicle was scratched with a sharp object on the drivers door. “Estimated value of the damages is plus-minus R30 000, insured with ABSA Indirect Insurance. “There’s CCTV footage that shows a black female crouching next to her car.” Unathi had sent tongues wagging when she split with her long-time husband and Metro FM presenter, Thomas Msengana. Virgin Active’s Head of Corporate and Media Communications, Carla White, said: “We’re aware of Ms Msengana’s claim that her car was damaged. In conversation with our club manager, she was not sure where the damaged occurred, and indicated she suspected it may have been on location at Idols, which had taken place the previous night. “To be of assistance, we reviewed CCTV footage, which doesn’t show activity to prove the damage occurred in the parking lot.” Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said:  the matter was closed as undetected.“The case was closed as undected (sic) there was not arrest. The case can be reopened as soon as new evidence arises. “Anyone with information is asked to call the nearest police station or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.” Unathi refused to comment.
