Three suspects accused of murdering Isaac Mdaka and Qoli Mathebula pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and murder charges. Accused Clinton Twala (29), Advice Ubisi (32) and Joshua Mkhonto (37) made an appearance before magistrate Robert Mokone at Mkhuhlu Magistrate's Court near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Thursday. The trio allegedly poured petrol and killed Isaac Mdaka (36) and Qoli Mathebula (33) after they accused them of stealing alcohol on the 1st of March. The court heard that Mdaka died on the same day in hospital while his friend passed away last week Saturday due to head injuries and burnt wounds. Investigating officer Captain Thabo Ndlovu opposed the bail against the accused and told the court their lives might be in danger as community members are still fuming after the alleged crime committed by the three. "The accused are a flight risk and if they remained in jail, state witnesses will be safe and we have a strong case as they have implicated each other in this matter,” the court heard. “I also want this court to know that these suspects refused to follow police order when they were taken to the police station,” he said. The father of Isaac, Elmon Mdaka (61), said he was happy after hearing the trio was arrested. “They must not get bail until they are sentenced. My son died like a dog and his death will haunt me forever. I wish to see them being punished severely even though I have lost hope with the law enforcement agencies.” Shocked Miyelani Mathebula (30) said his brother Qoli died last Saturday at Themba Hospital after he was allegedly set alight by the accused. “We want them to be denied bail and we are hurt as the family because now we are busy with funeral arrangements to lay my brother to rest this weekend,” he said. Magistrate Robert Mokone postponed the case until 24 March for further bail hearing and the accused remain in police custody.
