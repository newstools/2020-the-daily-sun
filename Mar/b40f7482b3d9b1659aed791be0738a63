EBUHLENI Nazareth Baptist Church leader inkosi Mduduzi Shembe has distanced himself from a voice clip where a member talks about a coronavirus vaccine. The clip, which started circulating on social media yesterday, calls on faction members to pray over milk and drink it to avoid the virus. In the clip, just over a minute long, the speaker claims a vaccine has been approved by the leader and people should spread the news to non-members to save lives. Church spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe called for an investigation into the clip and for those circulating false messages associated with the leader to be disciplined. “We are shocked and disturbed that there are people still taking this issue as a joke. At no stage has the leader announced that milk is a vaccine. It’s all nonsense,” he said. Together with other factions, the church is believed to have around five million members and Mncwabe said the clip could have a serious impact if its spread was not stopped. He said it was important for church leaders to warn people not to take the clip seriously.Mncwabe appealed to anyone who had received the clip not to share it and to delete it. He said there was another clip where a woman member of the church could be heard telling people that the leader had prophesied that a big war was coming. He said this was also not true. The government has warned people not to spread fake news and to take the virus seriously. KZN health spokeswoman Noluthando Nkosi condemned the action and said government regarded it as the way to con the vulnerable poor of their money. She said any form of communication regarding coronavirus will be done by health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize.
