Transport services continued working under strict measures on Friday morning. As Mzansi began its first day of the lockdown, Soweto was not spared as cops went around enforcing the law. During the lockdown, taxies are only allowed to operate from 05h00 to 09h00 and again from 16h00 to 20h00. Taxi drivers from Orlando West learned a lesson when Metro cops forced passengers off their taxies as the operational time had passed. On Wednesday, the minister of transport, Fikile Mbalula said taxis would be allowed to transport essential services workers and those allowed to make the necessary permitted movements. “Operators should put measures in place to adhere to social distancing to curb the spread of the virus,” he said in statement. Meanwhile, queues for shopping at various malls in Soweto were overcrowded as people scrambled to purchase groceries during the lockdown.  A shopper, Sindi Mthembu (43) told Daily Sun that she woke up as early as 05h00 to go and buy groceries. "I don't want to run out of food during the lockdown because we don't know what is going to happen going forward," she said.
