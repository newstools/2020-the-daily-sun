THE PSL has suspended Absa Premiership matches this week, in
light of the global Coronavirus outbreak. This effectively means the league showdown between Mamelodi
Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, scheduled for Loftus Stadium on Tuesday, has been
called off. Kaizer Chiefs were due to face Bidvest Wits at FNB Stadium on Wednesday and will now have to wait for another date.  PSL chairman’s Irvin Khoza explained the League were heeding
the call from national government after state President Cyril Ramaphosa
declared a national disaster. “We have decided to suspended the matches this week until
further notice, following the executive board meeting. The BoG will meet on
Thursday on the way forward,” said Khoza. “This is a national disaster and we need to err on the side
of caution.”
