A QUARTER of Africa’s most populous country believe they are immune to the coronavirus. According to a poll, this belief is held by slightly more than 50 million of Nigeria’s estimated population of 200 million. They base this belief on their faith and religion. Nigeria is predominantly Christian and Muslim. NOIPolls conducted the research last week. A majority of those who claimed immunity perceived their so-called genetic makeup made them resistant. Others believed the Nigerian weather was too hot for the virus to survive. Other Nigerians maintained their personal herbal remedy would protect them from the virus, while others said Covid-19 was not an African disease. On panic level, 63% of Nigerians said they were concerned they might contract the virus. Another issue that was of grave concern for the researchers was that 50% of Nigerians didn’t have information on preventive measures. “This implies that about 100 million Nigerians are at risk of being infected,” the poll warned. However, an overwhelming majority of Nigerians (97%) said they would be willing to report and be tested if they showed any sign of Covid-19. They were also willing to be quarantined if they were at risk of spreading it. Nigeria recorded its first case of Covid-19 on 25 February. It has since recorded seven more cases. – CAJ NEWS
