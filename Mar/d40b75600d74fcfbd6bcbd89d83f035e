SHE was allegedly raped by her cop boyfriend. But the man is still walking the streets of Chris Hani in Mangaung. The 39-year-old woman said the ordeal started in December. She told Daily Sun: “I was with friends at the car wash when we saw an Audi A4. “I commented on how beautiful the car was and that it was my favourite car. “My boyfriend called me over and I thought we were going to have a chat. But he started beating me up. “He asked me why I was looking at the driver of the Audi like that. I was shocked.” She said he then took her away in his car and raped her. “He took me to his house, where he continued to rape me. I told him to stop because I was on my period.” She sustained head and leg injuries and reported it at Kopanong cop shop, where a rape and assault case was opened. “He still goes to work. Police are protecting him.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the case was transferred to Ipid. Spokesman Sontaga Seisa said: “The suspect has still not been arrested as we have to gather all evidence.” He said details would be addressed once they had finalised the case.
