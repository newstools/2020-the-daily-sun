THE ANC in KZN has again postponed its four regional conferences for next month in eThekwini, Moses Mabhida, General Gizenga Mpanza and Lower South Coast regions. The conferences were postponed for two months due to the coronavirus outbreak. At a media briefing in Durban yesterday, provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said they had no option but to heed the call by President Cyril Ramaphosa not to allow gatherings of more than 100 people.  This is the second postponement after the conferences were scheduled for March earlier this year. The party also announced the disbanding of the Josiah Gumede regional leadership, which includes Ladysmith, Bergville and Estcourt. Ntuli said the region had failed to give direction in the municipalities the ANC had taken over from the IFP. Ntuli also announced the party had charged 19 councillors in Umzimkhulu with misconduct. The councillors, including Mayor Mphuthumi Mpabanga and Harry Gwala deputy mayor Nthuseng Duma, are accused of refusing to support the appointment of three councillors to the executive committee. Ntuli said they didn’t attend a council meeting, leading to it not having a quorum and being cancelled. All charged councillors are expected to appear before the party disciplinary committee soon.  The councillors are part of the faction that didn’t support Harry Gwala regional chairman, Zamo Nxumalo.
