ON MONDAY, 25 people died in Centane when a bus travelling to Butterworth in Eastern Cape fell down an embankment. Samson Canca (52) from Chebe Village told Daily Sun yesterday he lost his uncle. “My wife Nombeko Ndeleni was on the bus. She phoned me to say it overturned on the way to Butterworth. “She told me to rush to Tafalofefe Hospital. She had cement on her leg.” He said the hospital told him his uncle, Nkosiyedwa Ntshebe (85), had died. “I’m very hurt. He was very helpful in the village. Most of the people who died were from my village. “That road was supposed to have guard rails where the bus overturned.” Denes Mzayifani (63), who’s also from Chebe Village, lost his wife Nozukile (50). “I got a call from my sister telling me the bus had overturned. I walked to Tafalofefe Hospital to look for my wife. “I asked for a list of people who died. I was shocked to see my wife’s name. She was a social worker in Butterworth.” Co-operative governance MEC Xolile Nqata said: “We are very sorry families experienced this pain. “We’re going to help with funeral arrangements. Social Development sent social workers to comfort families.” Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula told mourners: “We are here to give support. The number of dead has increased to 29. “We are going to investigate this accident. People are dying on roads. Enough is enough.”
