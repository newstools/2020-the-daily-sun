SPORTS Minister Nathi Mthethwa has given the green light for the resumption of the PSL matches. The League executive committee had resolved to suspend all PSL fixtures, including the pick-of-the-midweek matches between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared the coronavirus outbreak a national disaster. Gatherings of more than 100 people have been banned, a directive which led the decision by the PSL canning the games indefinitely. But Mthethwa holds a different view. "We have said that, firstly we need them, the chairman and others in the leadership of sport to raise their voices against this pandemic," said Mthethwa. "Therefore they will continue with their matches, but without the spectators. And they will finish the season. The most important thing for us, as they do that, is they will be spreading the message to fight against this pandemic. "So, there is no confusion. Even if we are going to reach a point where there are no matches, that will be gradually phased in. But as we speak, they can have their matches tomorrow, with nospectators. "However, even if they do that, there is an obligation, one of which is that they follow to the latter the coronavirus protocol." The PSL Board of Governors (BoG) is set to meet today to a map forward with regard to the fixtures, in both the National First Division and the PSL.
