THE amazing transformation of Kanana Early Childhood Development Centre near Orkney in the North West, was launched on Thursday. Daily Sun was told that in March 2015 during TB Day, President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the place when he went on a walk-about in the community after unveiling the government’s largest TB screening programme. And at that time, the pre-school experienced high rates of TB infections, cramped conditions and poor ventilation inside the classrooms increasing the chances of TB infections among the children. Living in the shadows of gold mining dunes and disused open cast mines, Kanana has the highest TB prevalence rates, according to the National Department of Health. But on Thursday, Dr Tshepo Motsepe, South Africa’s First Lady, couldn’t have been met by a more contrasting atmosphere at the centre.  It can now be regarded as a model centre from a shack crèche. It boasts furnished classrooms, an ablution block with running water, a fully equipped kitchen, a stocked storeroom, an administration office, a sick bay, as well as an expansive playground with jungle gyms and more. Dr Motsepe and her guests were welcomed with song and dance by the children at the centre. The children, as well as their parents and other community members, could barely contain their excitement at the newly built school. Aspen Pharmacare, which adopted the centre, played a significant role of transformation, including rebuilding and equipping it. The local community, along with the Adopt-a-School Foundation and the North West Department of Social Development, Aspen made that project a reality. “The foundation phase of a child’s education is critical for their development. This is where the quality of early childhood development plays an important role in shaping their future,” Dr Motsepe said. She added that the transformation of Kanana ECD Centre was an inspiration and lauded the three social partners for restoring the dignity of the children.
