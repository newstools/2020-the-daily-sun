A Shoprite
store in Khayelitsha, Cape Town went up in flames on Tuesday morning as South
Africans went shopping for essentials ahead of the national lockdown President
Cyril Ramaphosa announced to the nation on Monday night. It is
understood that the fire started before 08:00 when the store was still closed. City of
Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse told News24
the fire crew was already hard at work. "They
are going to be there for a very long time," he said. The
national lockdown kicks off at midnight on Thursday. ANC
councillor for Ward 95, Patrick Mngxunyeni, said he did not think the store
would open soon, judging by what he could see at the scene. "It's
quite huge damage." He added:
"The morale is completely down. "They
are more worried about their state of health going forward. Coronavirus becomes
very serious when it is colder. So people are extremely worried about how this
will affect their health towards winter."      SOURCE:
