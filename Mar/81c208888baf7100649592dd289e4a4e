IT is a matter of when, and not if, Alan Clark will be shown the door at Black Leopards. The interim coach wore the look of a dead man, walking on the touchline as Leopards sunk to a 1-0 league defeat to Bidvest Wits at Bidvest Stadium last night. Bottom on the log with 24 points, time is ticking for the Limpopo side and for Clark. In fact, Clark’s side, not sure how long they will be referred to as such, have only won once in 10 matches, having picked up only 20 points from a possible 72 so far this season. Terrence Dzvukamanja’s first half goal ultimately lifted Wits to sixth spot and send Leopards into the depth of despair at the bottom of the log. Lidoda Dhuva were left to lick wounds already raw following Saturday’s Limpopo derby loss to Baroka. They considered themselves unfortunate to lose 2-0 to Baroka, but to lose four consecutive league matches speaks of a lack of commitment. Clark will have to draw on all his experience, although not much considering he is fairly a rookie in the hot seat, motivational qualities to lift spirits in the Leopards camp. They will feel they should have done much better. They were denied by Wits goalkeeper Brandon Petersen on two occasions, first Thabo Matlaba and then Mwape Musonda. They even had a penalty shout, a legitimate looking claim as Eva Nga touched the ball with his hand inside the box. But the Students were full value for points, although they weren’t their usual vibrant selves. They created enough chances with substitutes Hashim Domingo and Elias Pelembe striking the crossbar towards the end. Themba Ndlovu and Musonda came close to finding the equaliser for the visitors.But Petersen was simply impregnable on the night. Yet Wits coach Gavin Hunt will berate his players for the missed chances.
