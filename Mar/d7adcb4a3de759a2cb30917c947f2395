Exciting young Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Bontle Molefe has been tipped to become one of the best keepers in the country. The 16-year-old, who was promoted to the senior squad last year, has impressed a lot of people at the club. Amakhosi mentor Ernst Middendorp is one of those people, describing Molefe as a bright young talent. And in a club that has produced some of the country’s best goalkeepers like Rowen Fernandez, Brian Baloyi and Itumelng Khune, Molefe is in good hands. Khune himself has tipped Molefe to be his long term successor not only at Chiefs, but Bafana Bafana as well. “Bontle is ready and probably 2022 he might be representing Kaizer Chiefs, and also Bafana Bafana at the World Cup,” Khune said. “He has got good height, age is on his side and he is a very great goalkeeper.” The SA Under-20 international seemingly has the word at his feet. SunSport looks at why youngster nicknamed ‘Big Man’ is so highly regarded. • At just 16 years of age, he already stands at 1,90 m in height, making him an imposing figure and that is always an advantage for a goalkeeper. • He has raw talent, something that can’t be taught; hence he caught the eye on his first training session with the senior team. • He has strong character and is very vocal for a young keeper in an environment such as Chiefs, he is confident and bold, hardly shying away from anything, a good trait for any good keeper. • He is just as good with his feet as he is with his hands and in the modern era where teams like playing out from the back, he fits the bill. • He is keen to learn from those around him and in Khune, Daniel Akpeyi and Bruce Bvuma, Molefe has three international keepers from whom to learn.
