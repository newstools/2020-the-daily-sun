SANGOMA Skhunisivuthemanzini Mkhize said an arrest was about to take place in the Senzo Meyiwa case. Mkhize from Meadowlands, Soweto, told Daily Sun in November the truth would come out. Senzo and his dad had reunited on the other side and were fighting for justice.  Their spirits would make those responsible for his murder talk. He said they’d start fighting among each other and spill the beans. “They’ll say things that will implicate them. They won’t know what they’re saying will sell them out. “They will face difficulties in life. They won’t know what’s wrong with them. They will wish they were dead.” Mkhize approached the SunTeam last week and said an arrest was going to take place soon. “My bones tell me people will be arrested soon. Someone will confess.” The sangoma said he first saw it in his dreams and then threw the bones. “The bones agreed. I saw someone being taken to jail and Senzo and his dad celebrating,” he said. Mkhize said police should not stop digging as the end of the case was near. The Meyiwas recently turned to AfriForum for help, five years after the former Orlando Pirates goalie was murdered at the home of his lover Kelly Khumalo in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. Senzo’s brother Sfiso said the family didn’t want to comment. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said investigations were continuing.
