TENNIS’ Big Three are at the centre of the civil war that has broken out because of the Covid-19 crisis. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have sporting and financial reasons to join the chorus of fury greeting the French Open’s unilateral decision to move the event to the autumn. The new dates for Roland Garros, 20 September to 4 October, clash directly with the fourth edition of the Laver Cup, the invitation team event devised by Federer and in which he holds a financial stake. Tickets for the Ryder Cup-style contest, scheduled for Boston’s TD Garden from 15 to 27 September are already sold out. The Laver Cup responded with a carefully-controlled but powerful volley of a statement, saying: “This announcement came as a surprise to us and our partners - Tennis Australia, the USTA and the ATP. “It raises many questions and we are assessing the situation.“At this time, we want our fans, sponsors, broadcasters, staff, volunteerism players and the great city of Boston to know that we intend to hold Laver Cup 2020 as currently scheduled.” Federer was going to miss the French Open, if it had gone ahead in May, as he recovered from knee surgery. In the event of this new clash, he would undoubtedly prioritise the Laver Cup. But the row has put Nadal, the 12-time Roland Garros champion but also a keen participant in the Laver Cup, in a difficult position.
