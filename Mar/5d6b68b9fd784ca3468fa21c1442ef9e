THE siblings say they’re paying the price for their mum’s wrongdoing and now have no home. Residents recently destroyed the shack in Phantsi Kocingo squatter camp in Browns Farm in Philippi, Cape Town. Their mum allegedly killed her former lover. One of the siblings (19) said: “The community destroyed our shack even though we don’t live with our mother. “We told them we didn’t have anywhere else to go, but they continued to destroy our shack.” She said residents knew their mum lived in Marikana with her new lover. “They said the rule is that when someone commits a crime they must leave the area,” she said. The siblings now live with friends. “We’re homeless even though we never committed a crime,” she said. “We never sent our mother to kill that man, but we’re paying the price.” Committee member Nofoto Ndulula told Daily Sun destroying the shack of anyone who commits a crime in the area was their rule. “Yes, the situation is different. But we can’t change the rules. We feel sorry for the kids, but we have to do this,” said Nofoto. She said some residents had begged them not to destroy the shack but were told to get back, or else . . . Spokesman Joshua Chigome said the social development department was investigating and officials would assess the situation and decide what was best for the children. Captain Frederick van Wyk said a suspect appeared in court on 3 March and the case was withdrawn due to insufficient evidence.
