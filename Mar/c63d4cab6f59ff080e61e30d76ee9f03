WHEN Tshepiso Senne from Botswana saw a Facebook post with colourful pictures of wedding cakes, her eyes became stuck on the images while her heart started beating faster. It was an advert posted by Sinah Lesejane from Mabopane, Tshwane. Sinah is the founder and creative director at Sinah Exquisite Cakes. “I was impressed when I first saw pictures of wedding cakes on Facebook some time last year. I later discovered there was an opportunity for short course training in baking,” she said. “So, this year I travelled from Botswana to do a five-day course. I’m now done and happy with the skills I’ve acquired. My aim now is to start my business back home.” Zanele Mbonani from Soshanguve said: “I currently work for a government department and am not happy with my income. I’ve decided to learn how to bake so I can open my own business. “Today I’m happy because I no longer have to spend a lot on bread daily. I’ve also managed to save money to use later to buy an oven I would use to bake birthday and wedding cakes.” The cake producing company doesn’t only sell its products to local communities, but has been training women across Mzansi and neighbouring countries. Sinah has been in the cake business for six years. In 2017 she started training local women and today some of her students come as far as Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Our beginners’ course costs R2 000. The starter-pack is R3 500 and the wedding cake course is R5 000,” Sinah said. “Courses take three to five days and after completion we hand out certificates to all the graduates. “So far, I’ve trained over a 1 000 women and my future plan is to open a baking academy.”
