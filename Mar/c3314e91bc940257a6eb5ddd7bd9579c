Singer and actress Busisiwe “Cici” Twala is back with a banging single titled Inyanga. She said the song was inspired by a couple in a long-distance relationship for a year and finding it hard to see each other. “Personally, I can never be in a long-distance relationship. This song was inspired by other people’s experiences,” she said. The Iqiniso hitmaker, who’s pregnant with her first child, said she was ready to grab the bull by its horns and make her presence felt. “Being a mum-to-be will not get in the way of the things I want to achieve. “And even when the baby is born I will not slow down. “I have a lot of family members waiting to help me.” Cici said she’s also working on releasing her second album later this year. “Most of the work is done. We just need to do a few finishing touches,” she said. The KZN-born entertainer said she was gearing up to take her career to the next level. She said she had just finished shooting the drama series Kings of Joburg, produced by Ferguson Films. Last year she landed a role in thriller Red Room, alongside Khanyi Mbau in the lead. She’s had roles in various soapies such as Rhythm City and Generations: The Legacy.
