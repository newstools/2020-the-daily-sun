Julius Malema and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi’s assault case was postponed to 23 and 24 June by the Randburg Magistrates Court yesterday. The EFF leaders stand accused of allegedly assaulting a police colonel during Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral in 2018. READ: PASTOR POKES MUM AND DAUGHTER! AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel told Daily Sun: “It is unfortunate the court proceedings had to be postponed because the legal team representing Malema and Ndlozi wasn’t ready to handle their defence. Although they succeeded in delaying the legal process today, they won’t be able to escape justice in the long run. AfriForum will see to it they get their day in court.” In July, the organisation announced it would approach the court with an application to force the NPA into making a decision about the prosecution of Malema regarding this case and two other hanging cases against him. The officer in the assault case laid a complaint with cops, but the case received no attention until AfriForum’s private prosecution unit made an inquiry last January. During their court appearance in November, Malema denied he and Ndlozi assaulted the officer.  “If I had laid a hand on him, I would have panelbeated him. It would have been worse than what you saw. I don’t play when I lay hands,” said Malema at the time. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane confirmed the postponement. At the time of going to print, EFF spokesman Vuyani Pambo hadn’t responded to inquiries sent to him.
