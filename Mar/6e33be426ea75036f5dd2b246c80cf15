TYSON FURY has revealed that he has two more fights left in him before he "sails into the sunset" and retires from boxing. The 31-year-old defeated Deontay Wilder 11 days ago to become the WBC heavyweight champion of the world. According to The Sun website, a unification bout with Anthony Joshua is on the horizon for Fury - but not until he has dealt with Wilder again later this year.The Bronze Bomber has confirmed that he will exercise his rematch clause, meaning that there will be a summer trilogy fight. After his third clash with Wilder, a blockbuster unification fight with Anthony Joshua will follow... but then that will be it for the Gypsy King. After his wife Paris called for him to call it a day on This Morning, Fury said: "I've got two more fights left, then we're going to really think about what we do from there. "How long does a piece of string go on? I'm undefeated in 31 professional fights and this is my 12th year as a professional.He said: "It's almost an anti-climax. "You elevate yourself in mind and body to go and box at his level and nothing means anything apart from the fight. "Then you win and it's like, 'Oh well, I've done that' and I slide down the other side. "But I feel fine, I've learned over the years to maintain the mental health problems and to train on a daily basis and keep a routine. "It takes me about two weeks to get back to normal after a massive fight.
