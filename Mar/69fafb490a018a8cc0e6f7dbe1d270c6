ZULU section residents in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni are recovering from rubber bullet shots after cops allegedly shot at them on Sunday. The cops were looking for people roaming the streets. All hell broke loose when they got to Gama Street. People ran to Simphiwe Binca’s yard, who was in his house when the shooting started. MAN KILLED IN LOCKDOWN SHOOTING! “People at the corner ran through our yard. There were five of us in the house and when cops got here, they didn’t want to hear anything.” Simphiwe said they beat them with sjamboks. “They asked who lived in the yard and who didn’t. They pushed those who don’t live here and shot at them while they ran. Some guy pointed a gun at me. I didn’t think he was going to shoot me, but he did,” he said. Simphiwe said cops suspected booze was being sold at his house. “We do sell liquor, but there wasn’t any left.” The 45-year-old never thought they would be attacked in their homes during the lockdown. “I hope those cops get arrested because they clearly abused their power.” MINISTER COMMITS SUICIDE OVER CORONAVIRUS WORRIES!
