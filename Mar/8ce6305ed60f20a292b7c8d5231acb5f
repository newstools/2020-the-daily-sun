MASKANDI artists have teamed up to warn Mzansi how serious the coronavirus pandemic is. Khuzani Mpungose, Phumlani “Ngiga” Ndlovu, Ali Mgube, Mzovukile “Jaiva Zimnike” Khanyeza and Abafana BakaMgqumeni (Sakhiseni and Nelisani Mseleku) will tomorrow release a single titled Corona. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ngiga said they noticed that people in Mzansi weren’t taking the virus as seriously as they should. “Since coronavirus became an issue, people in South Africa have been making jokes about it. They also think that black people are immune to it and that is why they are making a joke out of it. “So the message in the song is that it is real and can ruin the human race. We also tell people how to keep safe,” he said. Ngiga said as singers, they felt it was their duty to help. “My verse is specifically about telling people to respect government’s rules. People must stay at home and be safe. We hope people will hear the messages better if they are said in music. As musicians, we must help people understand things,” he said.  Ali said they would not sell the single, as they didn’t want to benefit from it.  “The single is not to make money. It is for the people to learn about this and take it seriously. We will send it to radio stations and shoot a video. “We want people who don’t have TVs to also hear the song on radio. That way they’ll know what to do and how to protect themselves. We hope radio and TV stations will work with us in spreading this message.”
