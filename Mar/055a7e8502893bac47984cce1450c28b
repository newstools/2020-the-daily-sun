GAUTENG Co-operative Governance MEC Lebogang Maile has announced a team of administrators to take over the running of the City of Tshwane. Former West Rand mayor Mpho Nawa was announced as head of administration. The municipality was placed under administration over the weekend by the National Council of Provinces and Co-Operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Speaking at the municipal offices yesterday, Maile announced the administrators, despite the DA having applied for an urgent court interdict. He said the many challenges affecting the city and the failure of the council to fulfil its obligations led to the decision. Maile said the decision to dissolve the council was not made lightly. “It was based on flagrant disregard for the Public Finance Management Act, especially regarding the procurement processes which eroded good governance in the city. “Unauthorised, irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure were flagged by the auditor-general. There was poor service delivery and non-establishment of ward committees after the 2016 local government elections.” He said the matter was due to be heard in court today. “The decision will be defended and we have assembled a credible legal team led by Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. We will abide by any outcome of the court.” Maile said the team he was announcing should be aware that the people of Tshwane had high expectations. “They should not disappoint in executing their mandate. Their performance individually and collectively will be measured on the success of the implementation of their mandate. “We will not shy away from recalling anyone for non-performance or incompetence.”
