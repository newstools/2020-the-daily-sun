It’s disgusting to hear an old man who sleeps with young girls bragging about having many girlfriends. Sometimes you hear the very same man complaining about teenage pregnancy and how young mums use social grant money to gamble and party. We can’t keep putting the blame on girls when we know they are enticed and impregnated by older men who are supposed to be their fathers or mentors. Blessers are grown men who should be helping young people pursue their dreams. They must stop giving them money and buying them expensive gifts in exchange for sex. This behaviour is totally wrong and unacceptable!
