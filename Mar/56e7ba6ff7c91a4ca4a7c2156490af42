FORMER Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Innocent “Ayobayoba” Mayoba is armed and dangerous - and fighting Coronavirus on a different front.  “Ayobayoba” is armed to the teeth with his keti (sling-shot) and marble balls and is chasing people away on the streets so that they stay at home in the fight against Covid-19 virus. Mayoyo, a Pirates legend and a darling of the Buccaneers in the late 1980s, says people in his street fear his sling-shot and as a result, they are staying indoors. “This is helping the community. In my street, my neighbours are not roaming around because they understand the message I am sending across,” said Mayoyo. He added: “We are community leaders on the ground and if we do not act, no one will assist and this virus will kill us all. My weapon has also assisted in maintaining social distance at the shopping centre next to my house as you can see in the pictures. I just came back from the shopping centre and am happy to say there’s order and social distancing.” “I have received good messages from the community who say that I am doing a good and saving the community from this dangerous virus. Stay home or deal with my keti,” declares Mayoyo.
