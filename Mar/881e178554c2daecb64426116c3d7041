We all want to be successful in life, but if we are not careful, success may isolate us from relatives and true friends. Some of us often forget who was there for us when we were struggling. We turn our backs on family, friends and even neighbours who gave us support. No matter how successful we may become in life, we need to socialise with family and friends. Our success may have made us attract new friends who have plenty like us, but that does not make our old friends worthless. I have come to realise that the people we hang around with when everything goes well are not the same people we turn to when we have problems. There are people who stick around when things are going well but disappear when we need their support. That is when we go back to our relatives and old friends to seek help. But becomes difficult for them to forgive and accept us back into their lives. It is better to stick around and enjoy your success with the people who supported you throughout your journey. They know you better and can lift your spirit when you are feeling low. Bochum
