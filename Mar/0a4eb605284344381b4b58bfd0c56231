THE number of people in Mzansi infected with the coronavirus passed the 400 mark yesterday. Since the first case was reported two weeks ago, the number has shot up to 402, with two recoveries so far. Businesses on Soweto’s famous Vilakazi Street were already wounded by load shedding, but have become worse since the pandemic hit, as many relied on tourists. Governments across the world have implemented travel bans, bringing the tourism industry to its knees. Yesterday, staff at the Mandela Museum told the SunTeam they had shut their doors. They were told to clean up and go home. Sifiso Mthethwa, manager of Nexdor restaurant, said business was very bad. “At about 1pm it’s usually busy here. There would be three tour buses, but not a single tourist has been here today.” Staff constantly checked the expiry date on stored food and threw most of it out. “This situation is going to force us to close and jobs will be lost,” he said. At Sakhumzi Restaurant next door, HR manager Chris Joko said customer numbers started dropping the day after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster. He said the ban on alcohol sales after 6pm was also hitting the business hard. General manager Fores Jumo said: “We are a 420-seater restaurant. Look around: we only have two customers.” Out on the street, hawkers were getting desperate. Abdul Ramahan (35) moved from Malawi to Mzansi for greener pastures, but the coronavirus was killing business. “We don’t make any money because tourists are not coming,” he said. Gift Njezi (23) said all they could do was wait for the situation to improve.
