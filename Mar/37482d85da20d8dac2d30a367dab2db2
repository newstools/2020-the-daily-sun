The Premier Soccer League (PSL) will hold an "urgent meeting" with its executive committee following the coronavirus outbreak in the country as the President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Sunday evening. A press statement released by the PSL late on Sunday evening read: "The Premier Soccer League, the largest event organiser in South Africa, in its response to the State President's announcement that gatherings of more than 100 people be prohibited, will be holding an urgent meeting of its Executive Committee on Monday, 16 March 2020 at 12:00 after which a press conference will be held to announce the details of its programme going forward." Ramaphosa declared the virus outbreak as a "national disaster" and implemented the closure of South Africa's borders to all foreign nationals as of Wednesday, 18 March. The number of confirmed cases increased over the weekend to 61 individuals testing positive for Covid-19, Ramaphosa revealed in his nationwide address. Europe's top five leagues - the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 - have already suspended all matches until April where continued deliberation will be ongoing. The Uefa Champions League and Europa League have also been postponed, with Uefa in discussions to reschedule the upcoming Euro 2020 spectacle set for June and July. It is expected that the PSL will follow suit and suspend all matches, including Cup games to curb the spread of the deadly virus. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
