Four men were caught red-handed on Strandfontein beach on
Tuesday morning with the bodies of three men who had been shot and stabbed,
City of Cape Town authorities say. The City's Law Enforcement Marine Unit was patrolling along
Lukannon Drive at about 07:00, when a vehicle on the beach in the Bay View area
opposite Nautilus Road caught their eye during the coronavirus lockdown. After monitoring the vehicle, they decided to approach and
found three bodies covered in blankets. They suspect that the men were planning to dump the bodies
in the sea. Law Enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said that stretch
of the coastline was well known for body dumping. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said officers
had spotted the light silver delivery vehicle parked on the Strandfontein beach
dunes. Strandfontein is a stretch of coastline in False Bay,
between Fish Hoek and Somerset West, and would be mostly deserted during the
lockdown. Potelwa said the bodies, wrapped in the blankets had gunshot
and stab wounds. The four men in the vehicle - aged between 26 and 54 - were
arrested. Police have also set up a second scene for investigators at
a house in Da Gama Street, in Forest Glade, Eerste River, following information
that that this was where the men may have been murdered. "Police are still following further information linked
to the discovery of the bodies," said Potelwa. "The motive for the murders will be determined as the
triple murder investigation unfolds." Dyason said that another body of a man in his late 30s was
found in the water at Monwabisi three days ago on Saturday. His hands and feet
were tied, and he had numerous open stab wounds. SOURCE: NEWS24
