Radio and TV personality LootLove is leaving the Absolut Hip-Hop show on Metro FM after four years. This is after she posted a lengthy caption on her Instagram page saying farewell to her colleague DJ Speedsta whom she was hosting the show with. Their journey on Metro started in 2016 and since then LootLove and Speedsta played a vital role in the SA hip-hop community, and they bagged an award last year at the South African Hip-Hop Awards (SAHHA) for the best hip-hop radio show. It was her last show this past Saturday, and she assured her  fans that they will still hear  her voice on the radio, even though she didn’t specify which show or radio station she will be joining. Her post reads: “The A-Team! Started 1 April 2016, and now bowing out gracefully on 28 March 2020. I remember exactly where I was when I heard we’d be teaming up, more blown away by the fact that I had mentioned to someone in passing, that if I had to team up with anyone when it came to radio, it would be you. You were at Y-FM at the time, little did I know that God was listening and it would all unfold in less than a month. I’ve enjoyed building this show with you, getting it right, sometimes wrong, agreeing and disagreeing. The DJ Jaws pulled through and we won our first radio award.” Her post further expressed how she will miss being on the show, and that every new beginning has an ending. Speedsta also wished her well on the new show and thanked LootLove for the amazing show. Such news does not come as a shock, as per norm, every year during this time radio stations announced their new line-up changes. The A Team! Started April 1 2016 and now, bowing out gracefully, 28 March 2020. I remember exactly where I was when I heard we’d be teaming up, more blown away by the fact that I had mentioned to someone in passing, that if I had to team up with anyone when it came to radio, it would be you. You were at Y at the time, little did I know that God was listening and it would all unfold in less than a month. I’ve enjoyed building this show with you, getting it right, sometimes wrong, agreeing and disagreeing... Then @Djjawz pulled through and we won our first radio award. (Also s/o Fav: @zeetakesnicepictures)! I’ll miss Saturday nights on air ?? To great work done... ?? To double clutches... and to memories... we built something dope and we will both continue to do so. On and Upwards. Every end is a beginning & I can’t wait to see what the next chapter brings! #MyLastAbsokuteHipHopRadioShow #DontWorryYallImStillOnAir #ANewBeginningAwaits #ToTheTopTop #AbsoluteHipHop Forever.
