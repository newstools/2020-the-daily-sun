When DJ Lesh is not on the decks, he is deep within the community of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, giving talks to the youth at local schools. The internationally recognised DJ, whose real name's Thulani Nyambi, tells Daily Sun these youth talks were inspired by his personal upbringing in Tembisa. He does the talks through his foundation. “Growing up in the hood was very challenging as there are a lot of negative things happening in the hood and there are less opportunities as well. This makes it difficult for kids in the hood to believe in their dreams and make sure they achieve them,” he said. “I chose to invest my influence in the youth because I’m also young and I know all the challenges we are facing as the young of this country," said the 27-year-old Ndoda hitmaker. “As a person with influence and the power to create change, it is within my right to ensure our future leaders are fully equipped! If our future leaders are equipped, the future of the country is in good hands,” he said. The DJ also told Daily Sun that since he started these motivational talks, he has seen a lot of changes and there are many success stories, which make him happy. “We’ve seen so much changes as we also have some of the members that we once facilitated in a motivational drive coming to join the foundation and helping kids to reach their potential.” DJ Lesh plans to do more impactful things within the country through his foundation. He says he is releasing a new song titled Mandlovu. It features various artists and people should be on the lookout for it.
