RESIDENTS of Intersite squatter camp were horrified after an unborn baby was found in a rubbish bag on Tuesday. City of Cape Town workers made the discovery as they were collecting rubbish bags in Langa. Ward committee member Sindy Ketana (48) said workers called them to the scene. She said the incident left the whole community shocked. “We will have a meeting where we will talk about this. We can’t have women dumping their kids like this because it’s evil.” Zukhanye Cekiso (38) said the culprit would only be caught if older women checked all the girls in the area. “In the villages, when something like this happens, all the girls in the area are gathered in one place and elders will look at their breasts,” she said. Malibongwe Kilana (40) said incidents like this should not happen. He said it was the first time something like this had happened in the community. “Although this is something that needs women to be in the front, men won’t sit back while people do evil things like this. That baby had a right to live,” he said. Residents said people had the right to do whatever they wanted with their own bodies but they couldn’t abuse others. They said if the culprit was not ready to have a child, they should have handled it through the proper channels. Captain Frederick van Wyk said a case of concealment of birth was registered at Langa Police Station. “Our detectives are following up on all leads. The investigation continues,” he said.
