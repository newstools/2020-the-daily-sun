Dance group Soweto’s Finest believes their recent hit single, Tikoloshi, is big in Mzansi by God’s grace. The group, made up of Tom London, Samson Cakes, Njabz and Bash released the single featuring Kaygee and Bizizi last month. Now it has become a favourite throughout Mzansi. Tom told SunBuzz he believed the success of the song was God’s work. “Kaygee was part of Soweto’s Finest back in the years but we had a bad fall-out. “But I recently heard one of his songs and liked it, so I approached him and we buried the hatchet. “We’ve worked with a lot of people but we’ve never come up with a song like this,” said Tom. “We worked with someone with whom we had bad blood but we made a hit that everyone loves. “This is why I say it couldn’t have been us. It was all God’s doing.” Tom said Tikoloshi was a follow-up their EP, Akvele Kbhujwe,  which was released last year. “When we went to studio, we didn’t know this song would be this big. “Our focus was that people should get new music from us. We didn’t want to wait for long before releasing new music.” Tom said he thought the single became popular because of the music video they shot for the song. “When we released the song, we also released the music video and people went crazy over the dance,” said Tom. “The chorus also adds to the hype, but we think it’s thanks to the dance that this is a hit.” He said the group was planning to release their debut album later this year.
