THE Gauteng RET President Zuma Support Group is suing Justice Minister Ronald Lamola for slander. The group confirmed papers were filed in the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg yesterday in relation to comments Lamola made where he referred to the group as thieves who’d stolen cash. Lamola made the comments after the group held a press conference last month to mobilise support for Zuma ahead of his corruption trial. In a statement released by Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association spokesman Carl Niehaus, the group alleged the minister made the statements at a political gathering in Joburg and they were repeated on SABC and Ukhozi FM news bulletins. The group said Lamola had since denied making the statements. “None of the panel at our press conference, who represented the organisations that make up the Gauteng RET President Zuma Support Group, had ever been charged with, not even to speak of having been found guilty of, any such crimes,” Niehaus wrote. “In having made such a baseless claim, the minister flaunted the basic constitutional principle that every citizen is deemed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law.” Lamola’s spokesman Chrispin Phiri told Daily Sun: “The minister’s not aware of any intention to sue him.” According to the court papers dated 16 March, there were seven applicants and Lamola was the only respondent. Niehaus is cited as the first applicant in the matter. The group argued that by publicly labelling members as thieves, Lamola denied them the right to a free trial as he has judged and found them guilty of a crime.
