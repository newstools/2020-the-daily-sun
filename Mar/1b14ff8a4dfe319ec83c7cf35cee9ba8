RHULANI Mokwena's uncle Jomo Sono has passed on some advise to his nephew who was appointed new Chippa United coach. Mjomana says that Chippa Mpengesi phoned him to find out if he could take Rhulani. Said Jomo: "I said take him, he is okay, he is a dedicated boy and he loves the game, and he has got an IQ for the game. One day Rhulani came to visit me and we were sitting, I told him one thing about going to Pirates is that it’ not an easy team, it’ too big." "I told him that since he did not play football, he must not go there and be arrogant. He must just be like Jose Mourinho – he never played football at the highest, only lower leagues but he is one of the best coaches whether we like it or not," added Jomo. Jomo says that Rhulani will do well because he has passion that some other coaches do not possess. "You see them on the bench that they are just thinking and calculating their monthly bills and waiting for pay day. Rhulani will succeed if he does not change things drastically because you’re the new guy in charge."
