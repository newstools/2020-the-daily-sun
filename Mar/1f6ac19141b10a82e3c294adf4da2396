With SA finally on lockdown, there will be a treat for those who enjoy playing solo as a premium porn site, PornHub, has landed a helping hand to adults across the world. PornHub has decided to temporarily change its name to StayhomeHub and is offering its premium service free around the world to encourage people across the globe to stay at home. "With nearly one billion people in lockdown across the world because of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s important that we lend a hand and provide them with an enjoyable way to pass the time," PornHub's Corey Price told The Sun. "We hope by expanding our offer of free PornHub Premium worldwide, people have an extra incentive to stay home and flatten the curve." The premium package offers no ads, faster streaming, high-speed downloads and better video quality as well as “discreet billing” and anytime cancellation.
