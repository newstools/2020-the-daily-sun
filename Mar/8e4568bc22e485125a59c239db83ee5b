As 151 South Africans possibly infected with coronavirus prepare to come back home, the country’s medical waste service providers are on high alert. This comes after Mzansi’s ministerial committee announced on Sunday that citizens based in Wuhan City, would be repatriated back in the country. As a result, Compass Medical Waste Services said they would ensure that hazardous medical waste from affected patients, if and when it surfaces in the country, is not spread through contaminated waste. Compass spokesperson, Tenley Cummings said high risk was generated from infectious swabs, bandages, cotton and possibly anatomical waste like blood and body fluids. Cummings said they were not taking any chances. “Since news of the first cases in Wuhan, Compass has refocused on strict operating procedures required to treat such waste. Its staff across the country, who could soon be at the coalface of a coronavirus outbreak here, have been taken through urgent refresher courses,” he said. Compass operations director, Graham du Randt said if waste from a patient infected with the coronavirus is not correctly handled, it may lead to further spread of the virus. “It’s essential that all healthcare facilities and any facility, including a hotel, resort, hostel or business, that may be at risk of housing an infected person, get their operations and procedures in order,” du Randt.
