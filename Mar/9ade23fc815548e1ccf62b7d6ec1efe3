While the world has been battling to contain the spread of Covid-19, more than 120 million people have been engaging in porn, according to recent stats by Pornhub. With many countries globally introducing travel bans and self-quarantine methods, some have taken this time to catch up on some steamy blue movies. Pornhub’s statisticians first looked at how the daily level of traffic has changed since the outbreak of coronavirus. Comparisons were made to an average traffic period in early February. Because traffic varies depending on the day of the week, each day was compared to the same day during the average period. It became evident that as people were spending more time at home, either self-isolating or working at home, that traffic to Pornhub had risen. Worldwide traffic to Pornhub was up 11.6% on March 17th.  Stats further confirmed that Italy, the hardest hit country in terms of coronavirus deaths shows a sharp rise in porn views as the whole country has been under lockdown.  The drastic increase of 57% on March 12 came after Pornhub offered a free Premium service to all of Italy, an offer that was clearly well-received by home-bound Italians.  Traffic  March 17th was up all over the world, but we can easily see what times had the most significant changes when compared to an average day. The largest increase of 31.5% happened in the early morning around 3am, while the gain at 7am was a nominal 1.4%. We can surmise that people stayed up later because they didn’t need to go to work in the morning and also slept in a little longer. Traffic at 1pm was 26.4% higher than normal when people may otherwise be at work.  It's pretty clear that as we're about to go on an official shutdown in South Africa on Thursday for 21 days, it is highly likely that some will take this time to stream some explicit content.
