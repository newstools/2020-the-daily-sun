THEY watched with joy as the foundation was being built. The Baloyis from Orlando East in Soweto had lost hope of ever getting their home rebuilt. Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings Ministries kept his promise. “I was deeply touched by the conditions the family was living in. There was no way I was going to turn a blind eye after reading about it in Daily Sun.” He said it took time for the plans to be approved, but he was now building the house. Gogo Johana Baloyi (67) said it felt like a dream as she had adjusted to life in a shack. She said she was grateful to Mboro and everyone who helped to restore her family’s dignity. “My family was the laughing stock of the kasi for a long time. God bless all those who contributed in their own way.” Daily Sun previously reported on the Baloyi house, which had no kitchen after it was destroyed by rain four years ago. The family had to cook and eat in full view of the public. Mboro offered to not only fix the kitchen, but to build them a brand-new house. Anna Baloyi (60) told the SunTeam she was happy their home was being rebuilt. “My sister is sick. I’m happy she’ll live comfortably and not in a small shack. “I’ll be able to take better care of her. Thanks to Mboro for restoring our dignity. May God bless him so he may help others.”
