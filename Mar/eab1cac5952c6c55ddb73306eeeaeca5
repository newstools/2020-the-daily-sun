It would be "premature" to postpone the Tokyo Olympic Games scheduled for July-August, despite the coronavirus pandemic, said President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, in an interview with the New York Times. "For us, it would not be responsible today and it would be premature to go into speculation and make a decision," said Bach. According to him, "we do not know what the situation will be. Of course we are examining several scenarios". The Games are expected to open on July 24 until August 9. The IOC has dedicated a working group to this issue. And for now, "we have no recommendation" from him. "Therefore it would not be responsible, in any way, to set a date or make a decision right away, which would be based on speculation about future events," said Bach. The IOC has been strongly criticized by many athletes who are hostile to the idea of ??competing this summer, and to the idea that they are recommended to "train as best as possible". Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi denounced the "danger" of Games in the midst of a pandemic. But Bach said that everyone's health will come "first." "The IOC's decision will not be determined by any financial interest," he said. The Olympic flame arrived in Japan on Friday, where the planned ceremony has been reduced to its simplest expression due to the pandemic.
