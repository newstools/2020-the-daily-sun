THE
ANC has paid homage to the country’s sanusi Credo Muthwa who passed away at the
age of 98. “Africa
has lost one of its finest sons whose contribution to our country and continent
remains immeasurable. He devoted most of his energy towards preserving African
culture, and challenging the tendency to relegate African practices and beliefs
to myths and superstitions,” the governing party said in a statement. Ntate
Mutwa is credited with predicting some of the country’s major events, including
June 1976 uprisings and assassination of SACP general secretary Chris Hani. In
an interview with Daily Sun in 2012, he warned of bloodshed and days later the
Marikana massacre shocked the nation. In
another interview with Daily Sun, Mutwa complained bitterly about being used,
largely by Westerners for using his materials and knowledge for financial gains
and never compensated him. The
ANC hailed the vibrant storyteller for advocating for the use of traditional
medicines and discovering the origins of humankind. “The
people of our country will treasure his memory as one of our most distinguished
sons who consciously chose to place his spiritual gifts at the disposal of his
nation. “The
ANC extends its heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Baba Credo
Mutwa as they navigate through this difficult period. May the soul of this
African giant rest in eternal peace,” it said.
