OVER 151 South Africans will be back home from Wuhan, China, in seven to 10 days. Yesterday, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize made the announcement while addressing the media at an inter-ministerial briefing at Southern Sun Hotel near OR Tambo Airport in Ekurhuleni. This came after President Cyril Ramaphosa gave instructions for South Africans to be evacuated from the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. Citizens approached government, begging for help to return home. Mkhize said: “Within seven to 10 days, we should have completed the task. We will not give specifics.” After their return, the citizens will be sent to a quarantined area for 21 days. However, Mkhize said the returning South Africans did not have the virus and the quarantine period was just to be on the safe side. “A quarantine facility that meets all the requirements has been identified. There will be a perimeter line that will be guarded by the military. Within that perimeter, the area will be declared a no- entry zone and a no-flight zone,” he said. The minister said those under quarantine would not be allowed to leave the area, but could move freely inside it. “I must reiterate that no family members, friends or associates of those under quarantine may visit the zone,” he said. The coronavirus, which is thought to come from Wuhan, has spread to other parts of the world. Africa has three reported cases in Egypt, Nigeria and Algeria. Mkhize said at the moment, government was only focused on evacuating South Africans in Wuhan. Those in other Chinese provinces who want to be evacuated need to contact the centre co-ordinating the process. Since the outbreak, government has issued daily statements with situational updates for South Africa. So far, 121 people have been tested for the virus and were negative.
