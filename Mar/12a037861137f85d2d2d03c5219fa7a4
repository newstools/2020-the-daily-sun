POLOKWANE City coach Clinton Larsen has vowed that they are going to fight tooth and nail to come out alive at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night. Rise and Shine travels to Maritzburg today, for their much-awaited clash against Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium the Team of Choice have turned it into a slaughterhouse on Friday’s night. The encounter is scheduled to kick-off at 8pm. Rise and Shine are heading to this game enjoying a two-match winning run against Cape Town City (3-2) and Black Leopards (2-1) in the Absa Premiership to move to 13th spot on the log. They are three points ahead of Baroka, Leopards and AmaZulu who are currently in position 14, 15 and 16 respectively with 20 points each team. “We are aware of the danger Maritzburg pose when they are playing at home,” Larsen acknowledged. “Going there we want to do something other teams have been struggling to do recently coming out with all the points. Teams have been there tried with no success, but we want to do it.” Larsen added: “Winning the past two games has given us the confidence which we needed. And as we go there we are underdogs, I like games where no one is expecting us to win.” City will have to dig deep to dodge the axe as they still have to face title-chasing Kaizer Chiefs, SuperSport United, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits lined up for them. Larsen says they will not be playing teams based on their names. He stated: “We don’t look at the name of the team we are playing against. "We just have to fight to keep on getting those three points. "We are still not safe yet, I will never be relieved until the final game is played and the team is safe. We are not out of the relegation zone yet." Rise and Shine will be without injured Walter Musona and suspended Kabelo Mahlasela for this clash.
