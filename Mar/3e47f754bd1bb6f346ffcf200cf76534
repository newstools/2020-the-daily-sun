On Sunday Prophet
Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng lived up to his words. Each church member was sanitised before entering the
church. Young and old congregants lined up to be sanitised. Also, the number of people coming to the services were
closely monitored not to exceed 100. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a
national state of disaster, following the coronavirus outbreak. Last week, Mboro who is the leader of Incredible
Happenings Ministries in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, called in exterminators to
sanitise his whole church. Chairs were also rearranged, leaving enough space
between them. He said he was preparing his church to pray for an end to
the coronavirus. Mboro said those who wish to join their prayers can be a
part of the service by watching from their social media platforms. He urged other Men of God to take safety measures in
protecting church members against the virus. He said: “We will continue to preach the gospel of God
because we need God's divine intervention against coronavirus. We won’t stop
praying as well as taking precautions given to us to avoid the spread.” Mboro added:
“During our prayer, we ensured that we manage the numbers and not exceed the
number which was given by the President.
