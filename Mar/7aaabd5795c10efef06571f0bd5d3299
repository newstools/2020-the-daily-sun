 WE are not yet done! So say the Springboks as
they prepare to resume their 2019 World Cup trophy tour. This follows the outcry from
the fans after the world champions couldnâ€™t make stops at several towns in November. Together with Boks
assistant coach Mzwandile Stick, captain Siya Kolisi will lead a delegation of
RWC 2019 squad members that will also include Bongi Mbonambi to Port Elizabeth
and Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday and Thursday, in what will be
the second instalment of trophy visits across the country. Among other cities to be included
in the itinerary is Richards Bay, Bloemfontein and Welkom as well as
Stellenbosch. The SA Rugby (Saru) are
currently finalising plans to add even more stops across the country for
similar visits. Saru has encouraged the members
of the public to come and meet their World Cup heroes and view the famous Webb
Ellis Cup on display during the various planned visits.
