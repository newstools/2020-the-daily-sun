THE dad who allegedly killed his four kids is back in the police cells. This after Lucas Phasha (50) went to hospital after he was allegedly moered by inmates. But his family claimed he was tortured by cops and seriously injured his leg. His brother Nkwana (47) said they didn’t know why he was beaten as he co-operated with the police. He said they were now seeking legal advice to take lawful steps against the police involved in his ill-treatment. “I went to the cells on Monday to check on him. He suffered injuries to his feet. Lucas started giving the police information before he was arrested. “He ran away from the village on the day he killed the children, fearing a mob would attack him. He’s the one who called and gave the cops the exact place where he dumped his children’s bodies,” said Nkwana. Katlego (9), Tshepo (5), Joyce (7) and Adele (2) were allegedly killed two weeks ago by their dad after he had a heated argument with their mother, Sylvia Monyela (30). Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they knew nothing about the claims of police attacking the suspect. “In fact, we’re shocked because he co-operated. The complainant has all the rights to open a case with Ipid.” Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa said they hadn’t received a complaint from the suspect. “He is welcome to open a case at any police station for us to conduct investigations,” he said.
