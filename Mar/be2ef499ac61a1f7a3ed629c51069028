 In one of her tweets, she stated how much she has cried and that she is thankful to God for His mercy. My husband and I have parted ways. I know this will come as a shock to many and I ask that you continue to believe in love and family. The battles we have met have been difficult to overcome together and I ask that you respect us by not sensationalizing our separation. ? pic.twitter.com/hLtDAHEldX She also gave thanks to women who have prayed for her. "For every woman that has wished me well, thank you. For those I have had the honour to meet face to face and those who I have not, thank you," she said. "Basadi, your prayer transforms darkness into light. You're God personified," she added. Mzansi showered her with good wishes and love.
