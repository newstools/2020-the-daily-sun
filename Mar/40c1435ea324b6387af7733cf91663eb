RESIDENTS believe that if they could use an old method of finding out when a girl was suspected of being pregnant, they would find out who dumped a foetus in a sewerage pipe. The method is to squeeze the breast to see if milk comes out. Residents from Ntuzuma H section, north of Durban, made a shocking discovery on Monday when a foetus came out of a sewerage pipe that had been blocked for two days. The residents have vowed to do a breast check on all the girls in the area to find out who dumped the foetus. One of the residents, Ntombenhle Dlamini (54), told Daily Sun residents were certain they would find the woman through this method. “There are many ways women can prevent getting pregnant,” she said. Another resident, Thulani Shandu (37), said there were many blocked drains in their area and they believed this was one of them. He said they were shocked when they discovered this was caused by a dumped a foetus. They usually found blankets. Councillor Thandanani Mabanga said women were not well-informed about ways of safe termination of pregnancy. He said there needed to be awareness campaigns to educate women on the different options to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. “We have a problem of small sewerage pipes in Ntuzuma due to the increased number of residents in the area. “But we’ve also discovered that people throw a lot of things into the sewerage and that leads to blockages.” Mabanga appealed to anyone who might have information about the incident to contact the cops. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of concealment of birth was opened at Ntuzuma cop shop.
