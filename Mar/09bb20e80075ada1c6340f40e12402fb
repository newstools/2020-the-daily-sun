DURBAN businessman Lucky Gumbi said an imposter had been scamming people using his name. Known for his lavish lifestyle and fancy sports cars, Lucky made his wealth in mining and construction. He said his Twitter and Instagram accounts were hacked in September and unsuspecting followers asked to trade and invest for bigger returns. Lucky told Daily Sun the tsotsi told people to invest between R700 and R1 400 and promised them over R60 000 returns in less than a week. “Because of my wealth, people gave away money as they believed they, too, could become rich. He asked them to send it using eWallet.” Lucky, who had more than 60 000 followers at the time, said people called him to verify if he was trading. He said through his own investigations he was able to get the tsotsi’s contacts. Daily Sun has seen screenshots of WhatsApp conversations between Lucky and the alleged tsotsi. Lucky demands he give back his Instagram page, but the imposter says the page has been sold to someone else for R1 500. “Why did you sell my page”? asks Lucky. “I’m desperate. . . exchange it with your wife’s as she doesn’t use it,” says the imposter. Lucky said his reputation was getting ruined. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A case of fraud is being investigated after his social media accounts were hacked.”
