 A man who was arrested for the murder of a Tulbagh boy is a
convicted criminal who was out on parole. The body of Reagan Gertse, 8, was found on Sunday after he
had gone missing earlier that day. Following leads and information handed to the detectives, a
53-year-old man was subsequently arrested for the murder of the child, police
spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said on Sunday. According to eNCA, the man who was arrested was a family
member who'd recently been released from prison. President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the emotional family of
slain Tazne van Wyk on Tuesday afternoon. The 8-year-old's body was found in a
stormwater drain near the N1 just outside Worcester Gertse was reportedly last seen on Saturday morning walking
with the man. An 11-year-old friend of Gertse's identified the man on
Sunday morning, shortly before his body was found by his father, according to
the report. The man seen with Gertse was staying with Reagan's father,
Ricardo Davids' parents, just three doors away Reagan's mother Louisa Gertse told TimesLive her son was a
well-respected boy who always dreamt of wearing the green and gold. "His dream was always to play for the Springboks. We
will forever remember him for who he was," she reportedly said. Gertse's body was found on the same day as Tazne van Wyk,
whose body was found last Wednesday outside Worcester Her neighbour, Moyhdian Pangarker, allegedly pointed out the
location of her decomposing remains in a stormwater drain. Pangarker, the Van Wyk family's neighbour, has been charged
with her murder and appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court on Friday. His criminal record dates to the 1980s and he absconded from
parole a year ago. SOURCE: NEWS24
