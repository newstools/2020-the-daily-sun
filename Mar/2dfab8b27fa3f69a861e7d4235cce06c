KZN PREMIER Sihle Zikalala has embarked on a crackdown on fake municipal managers. Delivering his State of the Province Address yesterday, Zikalala said his government was concerned that municipalities were collapsing as they were run by officials with fake qualifications. READ: KEKANA TO LEAVE DOWNS? He said a skills audit had already taken place in nine of the more than 50 municipalities in the province. Last year, Daily Sun published a story of municipal managers with fake qualifications. In his report last year, Auditor- General Kimi Makwetu said many municipalities were failing to manage their finances properly. Zikalala also announced SAA would reopen its routes to Durban. The move came after the provincial government had approached Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the business rescue practitioners to urge them to reconsider the decision to cancel the routes.  Gordhan had earlier in the day announced some of the cancelled routes would be reopened soon. At the opening of the legislature on Tuesday, King Goodwill Zwelithini said the route cancellations were a disaster. Responding to Zikalala’s speech, IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa said the premier did not tell the people how his government would ensure school safety. EFF leader Vusi Khoza said the ANC would not act on the findings of the skills audit, as many of the managers were political deployees. He said municipalities employed unqualified people and then hired consultants for the job. READ: PRINCIPAL BUST FOR FRAUD! The DA’s Mbali Ntuli said it was disappointing Zikalala failed to say what action would be taken against municipal managers with fake qualifications. Former president Jacob Zuma missed both the king’s official opening of the legislature on Tuesday and the premier’s address yesterday. In his apology read by the premier, Zuma said he had health problems. It was the third event he missed in the province since he arrived back in Mzansi last month.
