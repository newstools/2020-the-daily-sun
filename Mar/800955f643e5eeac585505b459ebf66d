“WE’VE got one!” These were the first words a kidnapped student (20) heard on regaining consciousness. Her ordeal started on Wednesday while she was hitch-hiking outside Ekurhuleni TVET College in Katlehong. She was picked up by two women, who later offered her a sealed bottle of water to drink. Speaking about the first words she heard after coming to her senses, the young woman said: “When I heard those words I thought I was being trafficked.” The student said she and two male students were hitch-hiking. The kidnappers, who were driving a grey Audi A3, told the boys to get lost. She didn’t suspect anything as they were both women. When they arrived at her destination and she asked to get out, the women kept on driving. She passed out. On Thursday morning she woke up in what looked like an empty dining room inside a house in Magagula Heights in Katlehong. She heard the two women kidnappers speaking to two others. She was dizzy and weak but managed to sneak out and escape. Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed a case of kidnapping had been opened. He said investigations were ongoing.
