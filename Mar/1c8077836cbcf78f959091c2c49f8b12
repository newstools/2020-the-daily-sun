Coronavirus porn is growing in popularity on Pornhub as videos show porn stars poking in hazmat suits and masks. Hazmat suits are worn in prevention of the deadly coronavirus. ‘VIRUS MAY HIT SA SOON’ But porn stars are taking it a step further. Not even the deaths of more than 3,000 people due to the virus could stop the adult website from posting dozens of the sick videos. The movies include such titles as "TSA Agent Detains Woman Suspected of Coronavirus" and "Deserted Wuhan." The Chinese city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak, and most of the deaths have taken place in China. "I think people are attracted to the COVID-19 themed porn the same way people who are scared of their shadow are attached to horror movies," Spicy, half of the Spicy x Rice porn duo, told Vice. "We are all searching for things that make us come alive. "COVID-19 is something that brings fear and mystery to pretty much everyone in the world right now." Spicy added that "you need to be able to feel something, and what better way to make you feel something than the global crisis we are all in right now." Spicy x Rice have starred in some of the coronavirus videos. The couple's work has been censored even though they are doing it to raise awareness of the deadly virus, according to Spicy. "We thought we would use our porn as an avenue to get some legitimate information out with some comic relief included to get people interested and reduce our chances of being banned," Spicy told Vice. "This sparked the idea, knowing every current event ends up as a porn eventually, we knew people would be searching for it on less censored platforms like Pornhub." He admitted that the coronavirus was impacting people "in tragic ways." SEE PICTURES BELOW:
