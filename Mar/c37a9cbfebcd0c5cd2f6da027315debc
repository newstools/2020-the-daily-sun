Marketing manager for Kaizer Chiefs, Jessica Motaung, has revealed the club are currently in discussions regarding the future of George Maluleka. Maluleka stunned Amakhosi when it was revealed he had signed a pre-contract agreement with rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. The midfielder had entered the last six months of his contract and was therefore free to discuss terms with other clubs. It also means 31-year-old will leave Chiefs for free when his contract expires at the end of the season. "The future of George with the club is being addressed with the coach and the technical team and in due course, it will be very clear," she said. "George made his decision on his own. The conclusion of whether he stays or not for the last six months and timelines of it is what we have to look at, but he has made his decision and we wish him well with Sundowns." However, she also revealed the issue of Maluleka's future was not their top priority as they continue to deal with the escalating fallout from the coronavirus that has seen various sporting events cancelled around the world, including all football in South Africa. "I can't even focus on George. Right now, our focus is making sure that everyone is safe and fit; that is the most important thing for us right now," she added. "The issue right now is that we are dealing with this coronavirus thing for the whole team and the staff. For now, we have just moved on at such speed with this abnormal situation of coronavirus and the George scenario has been reduced in terms of amplification." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
