A
47-year-old man is expected to appear at the Alexandra Regional Court. This after
he allegedly made bomb threats. “The
suspect who is a former employee of a consulting firm was arrested on Sunday following
a year-long investigation by the Gauteng Serious Organised Crime
Investigation,” Police spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said. Mogale said
the man reportedly made three bomb threats in 2018 and 2019 respectively which forced
evacuations and loss revenue to two companies. “Another
respectable financial company which is a tenant in the same building was also
heavily affected,” Mogale said in a statement.
