JANE Simelane’s family says Rob Ferreira Hospital will be at fault if gogo dies. The family from Barberton, Mpumalanga, said gogo was moved to the hospital in Mbombela to get medical attention but nothing has been done and her health is getting worse. Gogo’s daughter Dudu Sibanda (50) told Daily Sun her mum fell and broke her left hip and arm in December. “We took her to the clinic. But she was sent to Barberton Hospital, which transferred her to Rob Ferreira on 7 February after it said it couldn’t assist her.” She said gogo (85) suffered a stroke and claimed doctors didn’t even know. “My mother is lying there helplessly. She can’t talk properly and is in pain. It seems no doctor wants to help her. It’s like they’re waiting for her to die. “The staff are rude and don’t bother to discuss her condition with us. We’re told gogo is too old.” They were shocked to learn gogo was given medication for epileptic patients, yet no one would say why. “This is causing problems in the family. Gogo has a right to health, just like any citizen, and we fail to understand why she isn’t being helped.” Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said gogo had a stroke and ended up with seizures. He said medical treatment had no age restriction. “Gogo isn’t fit to go to theatre until she recovers from the stroke,” he said. “An evaluation will be done to see if she’s fit for theatre. “She will continue getting all the care she needs.”
