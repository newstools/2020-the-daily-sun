THEY have been robbed four times in the past two years. The cops didn’t have any luck, so they dealt with the thugs in another way. Lerato Mabusela’s friend introduced her to an inyanga in Lesotho, who put a bottle of muthi at the corner of her house. The inyanga told them thugs won’t leave with their belongings even if they were able to break into their house. It appears he was right. The family trapped a tsotsi with the muthi. And not only was he found sleeping in bed, but with some of the items he wanted to steal. Lerato said she was glad she didn’t pay the inyanga for nothing. “What happened on Saturday showed us the inyanga’s muthi works and will protect us,” she said. The 34-year-old from Hostel 1 in Mangaung, Free State, said she and her sisters were sleeping in one room. When she went to relieve herself in the early hours of Sunday morning, a few items in the kitchen were missing. “I was shocked and woke my siblings up. We checked in the spare room and found a man sleeping with our stolen items.” Lerato said the man looked surprised, as if he had just woken up from a dream. “When we asked him what he was doing in our bedroom, he apologised and said he didn’t know how he ended up in my house. “The stolen kettle and microwave were on top of the bed. It looked as if he was going to leave through the window, but the muthi stopped him. “We gave him a beating with a sjambok and broomsticks before we let him go.” She said the thug might had gained access into the house through a window which doesn’t close properly. She said they didn’t know the thug, but he told them he lived in another section. Thato Lethoko (45) said: “I was sleeping. I heard Lerato scream for help. I rushed to their home and found the dumb thug sleeping on the bed with the stolen items. “I want to consult Lerato’s sangoma. We’re tired of thugs who behave like they own our homes. Lerato felt sorry for the thug.” Lerato said she did not open a case and believes the thug learnt his lesson.
