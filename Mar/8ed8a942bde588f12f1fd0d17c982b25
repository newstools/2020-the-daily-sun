The head of South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa, has spoken. Among some of the things he pronounced on as he declared a state of disaster was that schools should remain closed for a month, as of Wednesday. This shows just how serious this virus is. The reality is that South Africa has unique social and economic problems that will make it even more difficult for us to minimise the spread of the virus. My biggest fear is of people who share and drink from the same beer bottle in taverns around the country. People in townships also tend to share and smoke the same cigarette. The coronavirus is real and we all need to take it seriously. Let us abstain from such things while we can. The government should also move quickly to inform people about such behaviour. We should make sure that the various messages aimed at prevention target all kinds of people in this country.
