A special team will be deployed at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). This after the incident that took place on Wednesday at Edgewood College campus where the auditorium and lecture rooms were set alight. Vice-chancellor and Principal, Professor Nana Poku said the university leadership is outraged at the torching of the building. She vowed that no stone will be left unturned to bring the perpetrators to book. “The Premier of KZN, Sihle Zikalala, offered to assist us with a specialist forensic team and additional police and investigative resources to root out the parasitic criminal elements within our midst,” said Poku. He said the university is more determined to end criminality on campus and weed out those responsible even though the incident didn’t result in any injuries or fatalities. He expressed his shock over the incident. “There have been no disruptions or protests in recent weeks and the protest that we had, though highly hyperbolic and destructive, was mercifully short-lived but this violence was neither random nor pointless,” said Poku. He said they recognise that this cowardly attack on the infrastructure of the university is intended to intimidate them. “The university leadership will continue to root out the destructive culture of those who want to drain its resources with impunity. My management is undiminished in the face of this appalling provocation. "The actions of the perpetrators can never be justified against the ideals of this university. We will continue the vital work of ensuring that the life of the university, the safety of our students and staff, and the quality of the work we do together continues to go from strength to strength,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident that took place on Wednesday at Edgewood College campus where the auditorium and lecture rooms were allegedly set alight by unknown people. “A case of arson has been opened at Pinetown police station,” said Mbele.
