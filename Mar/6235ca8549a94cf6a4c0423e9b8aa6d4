Taking videos and pictures of the SANDF will not be
tolerated. According to them, this is not a television show and they
are not playing! All those who were seen doing such were given free exercise
lessons to teach them a lesson. One of the members said they were avoiding the spread of
fake news about them. "People tend to treat law enforcement as the bad guys
without being sure why we are punishing people," he said. He said people behaved like journalists, yet they are not
even qualified as such. "They take their one-sided videos and turn people
against us. We are not here to harass them, but we want to make sure that they
are safe at home." After doing their frog jump exercises the seven men promised
not to do it again and said they were just excited to see the men in green.  Another one who was seen said he wanted to prove to his
friends that the military was in his kasi. "I wasn't going to lie, I just wanted to brag to my
friends when the schools reopen, I won't do it again," he said.
