MPUMALANGA cops have launched a manhunt after two shops owned by foreigners were robbed and set alight. The incident happened outside the Thulamahashe Plaza near Bushbuckridge. The robbers allegedly entered one of the shops and pointed guns at staff before fleeing with an undisclosed amount of cash. At another shop a fire broke out, leaving customers terrified and shop owners running around trying to save their stock. One of the shop owners, Safras Malik, said it was not the first time they were robbed. “We believe an evil person petrol bombed the store. We’re thankful to the community who braved the fire and helped to remove the stock in our other shop,” he said. Resident Andrew Mathebula (32) said he saw the shop covered in a huge cloud of smoke. Firefighter Reckson Silinda said they responded to the call and put out the fire. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “The store was robbed of an undisclosed amount of cash, cellphones and groceries worth R90 000. The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle with the registration numbers FLK 565 MP.” He said a case of armed robbery was opened.
