NIGERIAN pastor Timothy Omotoso completely denies the testimony of Andisiwe Dike (30), the first witness to testify against him. This was according to Omotoso’s defence lawyer, Peter Daubermann. READ: KHATHAZA SET TO RETURN TO UZALO He told the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth yesterday the alleged sexual offences and human trafficking allegation mentioned did not happen. “My clients deny touching, playing with the girls in the house, lifting their dresses and touching their breasts.” But Dike was adamant. She told the court she would be called to massage Omotoso’s feet, and sometimes it would happen in front of the other girls. “All the girls in the mission house knew we had to go for an appointment with Omotoso,” she said. “And when you were summoned to his room for an appointment, it meant you had to please Omotoso sexually,” she said. Omotoso and co-accused Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho are on trial for rape and human trafficking. READ: I HATE LOBOLA! The accused have pleaded not guilty to 97 charges. Daubermann said: “I received instructions that the mission house was a legitimate mission house established for spiritual purposes. “The real reason people didn’t leave the house, the church, or report the rape you mention in this court and to police, is because it didn’t take place.” The trial continues.
