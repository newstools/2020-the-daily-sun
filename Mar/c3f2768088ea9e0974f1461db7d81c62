RAPPER Cassper Nyovest accused hotel staff of stealing his PlayStation. On Wednesday, he took to social media to speak about how he lost his gaming console at Protea Hotel by Marriot Willow Lake in Bloemfontein, Free State. Cassper wrote: “Lost my PlayStation on Friday in Bloemfontein. “Only noticing now. I know I won’t get it back because the staff would have reported it by now. “Since they haven’t, I must just forget. That’s why I prefer to rent houses and not hotels. Such heartbreak.” When another Twitter user said Cassper should have reported the matter to the hotel, Cassper said he did. “I did call. They said they didn’t have anything reported at lost and found. Meaning they shayad it.” But Cassper yesterday responded to a tweet from Nadia Nakai, saying he had found the gaming console. Hotel spokeswoman Nelisa Mpofana said they were making arrangements to return it. “We can confirm the guest reported the loss of his PlayStation after his departure from the Protea Hotel by Marriott Willow Lake. The PlayStation was found and recorded. But we did not have any contact details for the guest at the time. “We have now made contact and are making arrangements for him to have it collected from the hotel,” she said. When called for comment, Cassper’s manager Tshepo “Spike” Seone, said: “Cassper doesn’t want to talk about it and I don’t know anything about it.”
