TAXIMEN are living in fear after three of their colleagues were killed in a space of three weeks. The latest victim, Dan Masango (69), was killed on Tuesday in Tsakane extension 11, Ekurhuleni. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said the suspects cornered Masango at an Engen petrol station just before 2pm. He was filling up when a man came out of nowhere and opened fire.  Mngomezulu said the suspects fled in a silver car. “The victim was identified as the newly appointed chairman of the Greater Brakpan Taxi Association,” she said. She said the motive for the killing was unknown, and no arrests had been made yet and cops were investigating. Last Thursday, Lucky Skosana (41), the association’s new public relations officer, was shot dead outside his house in Tokyo, also in Tsakane. “The victim was leaving his house when two men in a silver grey Toyota Etios opened fire on him,” Mngomezulu said. Sdumo Ngwenya (50), another taxi man, was shot dead and his body was found lying in the street in KwaThema two weeks ago.  Cops said the suspects fled in a red car. Police have called on residents who might have information about the murders to call 011 363 5300 or CrimeStop on 0800 10111.
