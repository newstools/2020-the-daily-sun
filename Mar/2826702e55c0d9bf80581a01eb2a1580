Kaizer Chiefs have received a welcome injury boost with the news that Lebo Manyama and Leonardo Castro should both be fit for Saturday’s home Absa Premiership clash with AmaZulu. Both were injured in last weekend’s 1-0 Soweto Derby victory over Orlando Pirates, but coach Ernst Middendorp reveals he expects them to be fit to face Usuthu. "Lebo Manyama, who got a knock on the calf muscle, and Leonardo Castro, who got a knock to his back, there were certain issues and challenges, but both have been since Wednesday fully in the training sessions and are fully available," Middendorp said. But the coach cautioned that midfielder Willard Katsande is likely to be out until April at least with his knee injury sustained in the same game. “Willard is out, I think, for the games at least in March. I expect him to be back in the beginning of April. “That’s a big loss. How he put himself with the dominance in the middle of the park, I would say he is definitely one of the core players who contributed week-in, week-out in a very proper way. “But it is not about crying now, we have to find a solution and we have to replace him, and it is not really a welcomed scenario, but we can’t change it.”
