Rumour and misinformation around COVID-19 have spread faster than the virus itself. Dr Lize Barclay, Senior Lecturer in Futures Studies said this has led to various levels of government, business and individual responding in widely divergent ways. “The World Health Organisation called for a ‘Whole of Society’ approach, which includes social distancing, as expressed in quarantine measures and the cancellation of events in affected areas. Countries are debating lockdown, as in the case with Italy,” said Dr Barclay. She said the technology that enables this reality already exist and are used by businesses and individuals all over the world. “In reaction to COVID-19, many companies and education facilities have moved their day-to-day operations onto technology platforms. Many of the conferences cancelled their physical on-site programmes and then moved the presentations and discussions to digital platforms,” said Dr Barclay. Dr Barclay further stated that the barrier to adoption of these technologies is largely due to personal and interpersonal considerations as managers want to maintain oversight of their workers. “Additionally, agreed-upon productivity metrics for teleconferencing are still developing and a general fear of change prevails. People want to socialise with co-workers and do not trust their ability to stay focused while working remotely. This highlights the importance for companies to maintain flexibility in the face of unexpected challenges, which can even include infrastructure limitations, such as load shedding,” she says. “Disasters and reactions to these should not only prompt resilience, but individuals and organisations should embrace anti-fragility, become more innovative, create better systems for themselves and the environment and leverage technology accordingly.”
