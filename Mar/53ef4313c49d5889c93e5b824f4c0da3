THEY thought they’d hit the jackpot after bombing an ATM. So they drove about 5km away from the scene to count the money. But their silly mistake got them bust as cops found them in the act of counting. And now the four suspects face charges of ATM bombing and theft. The ATM was bombed at Pinky Shop in Mandela Park in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, over the weekend. Residents said they were grateful for the cops’ swift response. They said the ATM was bombed at about 3am and the noise was deafening. They told Daily Sun the ATM wasn’t the first to be bombed in the area. “These people have been getting away with murder for a long time. We’re happy they were finally bust,” said Charles Dlamini (60). Joyce Ntuli (57) said she wished the machine could be taken somewhere else. “We live in fear and are afraid our houses will one day collapse on us as these people use heavy explosives,” she said. George Motsamai (45) said: “It looks as if these people are professionals and have been bombing ATMs for some time.” Sergeant Khensani Mathebula of Etwatwa Police Station said cops went to the scene and found the stand-alone ATM had been bombed. She said they searched for the suspects, who were found on Holfontein Road, not far from Mandela Park. “One suspect ran away but police managed to arrest four suspects,” said Mathebula. Investigations were carried out to see if the suspects could be linked to previous ATM bombings in the area. “The suspects were found with R88 000, which was dyed with green ink. They were also found with detonator clamping and explosive samples.” Mathebula said the suspects were due to appear in court soon.
