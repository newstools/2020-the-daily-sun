TV AND radio personality Thando Thabethe has resigned from 5FM. News of her exit as the host of the SABC radio station’s afternoon drive show broke this afternoon. Speaking to Daily Sun, Thando said she wanted to focus on new things like her acting career. “I resigned today and I hope I paved the way for up-and-coming radio stars. I hope I have set a good example for whoever comes after me,” she said. Thando, who had been with the show for five years, said she wanted to focus on things she couldn’t do while being a full-time radio host. “I want to revive my acting career. The last time I acted was on a Mzansi Magic production. I want to do more TV work,” she said. Thando’s departure comes at the time of year when the SABC gears up for the annual radio line-up shake-up. “Radio takes time to perfect and I want those coming after me to realise that. I hope my time on radio has served the country well and the listeners of 5FM,” the 29-year-old said. I’ll miss radio because I’ve been doing it for 11 years and it’s been quite fulfilling but it’s time for change and to spend the time doing the things I have always wanted to do.”
