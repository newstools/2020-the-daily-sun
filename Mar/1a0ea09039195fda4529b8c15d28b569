Stellenbosch FC midfielder Nathan Sinkala says that the Absa Premiership is a 'more competitive league' than the DRC top-flight since joining in January. Sinkala arrived at the winelands outfit with great pedigree with many amazed at how Stellies had managed to pull off such a coup. Sinkala is a 2012 Africa Cup of Nations winner with his native Zambia and a CAF Champions League and CAF Confederations Cup winner with previous club TP Mazembe. And the 28-year-old Chipololo midfielder says he is enjoying life at Stellies and described the differences between the South African and Congolese leagues. "So far so good, Cape Town has been great. The move to (Stellenbosch) was a surprise to me also because my agent was the one who was talking to Stellenbosch. He told me in the last minute that look I have a team for you, so yeah,” said Sinkala. "Look there is not much difference between Mazembe and Stellenbosch, although TP Mazembe is a bigger club than Stellies, but the leagues are different. Here it is more competitive than in Congo. In Congo you have about 3 or 4 teams which are big teams, but here every team is strong and competitive." And the 29-year-old has revealed that the reason he left TP Mazembe was because he felt he needed a new challenge. "First of all, when I was leaving TP Mazembe, I just decided on myself that I needed a new challenge, which I am here now," said Sinkala. "Stellenbosch is a new team in the PSL, our target is to stay in the PSL and then next season that is when we can start competing and challenging to win the League and go play Champions League football. But for now, our main focus is to stay in the PSL."  SOURCE: SPORT24
