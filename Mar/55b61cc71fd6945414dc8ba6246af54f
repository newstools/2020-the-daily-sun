HIS car is not only beautiful, it’s reliable too. Kelmo “Mamosha” Ntuli from eKurhuleni drives a Toyota Corolla 1.8i. Q: Is it your first car? A: It’s my second. Q: Why do you love it so much? A: It’s the pride of the family. Not only is it reliable and easy to fix, the replacement parts are also cheaper. Q: What do you like about this car? A: It’s easy on fuel and easy to drive. I’ve never slept on the side of the road with this beauty. Q: Is it your dream car? A: Not really, but I love it and it’s fully paid. I don’t owe anyone. Q: Would you allow another person to drive it? A: Of course, yes. My closest friends Thobile Mashinini and Glory Raphaka can drive my car. Not because they’re my friends but because they’re good drivers too. Q: Have you driven any long distances in it yet? A: I haven’t, but if the need arises it’d definitely take me wherever I want to go. It’s powerful and strong. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour. A: When I go out to buy a car I don’t just pick any car because I want it. I’m also attracted by the colour. White is my favourite colour. Not only does it bring out the best in me, it’s also not expensive and is easy to maintain. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I have only one ticket so far, for not wearing my seat belt. The cop who slapped me with the ticket and I have not been on good terms since that incident. Q: What do you think of other drivers? A: Drivers are different. All we need to do is to keep our eyes wide opened while behind the wheel. We shouldn’t drink and drive because that is against the law. Many people lose their lives on the road because we don’t follow the rules of the road.
