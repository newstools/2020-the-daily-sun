THE owner went to her house to see why her tenants weren’t paying rent for four months – and made a horror discovery that will haunt her for the rest of her life! Although the house looked like any other from outside, on the inside it had been turned into an illegal abortion clinic with traditional consultation rooms. A baboon skull, candles, bottles, oils and animal skins were some of the items found inside the house in Ormonde, Joburg on Sunday. But the two brother who were tenants were nowhere to be found. The 37-year-old owner told Daily Sun she was scared to move back into her own house. “How do I go back there?”  She said she feared for her safety as people might come looking for the tenants. A neighbour (41) said: “The people were friendly to me. But I never went into the yard because they always stopped me at the gate when I came to see them.” Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said people could open cases against fake sangomas who scammed people. Given the description of the fake indumba, sangoma Dungamanzi said these were people looking to scam people. A real indumba has ancestral stuff including ibhayi and different muthi and isiwasho.
