This follows the ban of gatherings of more than 100 people announced by president Cyril Ramaphosa to curb the spread of the virus. So far there has been 201 confirmed cases in Mzansi, and Lehoko said he was playing things by ear. “I am taking it easy man, going what is recommended for the moment but I am taking things as they come.
