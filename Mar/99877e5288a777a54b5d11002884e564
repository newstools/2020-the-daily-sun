ANC sub-regional secretary Mzoli Ndobe said the party leadership in the municipality felt Magaqa’s name was being imposed by regional leaders because he was in their faction before he was killed in 2017. Speaking to Daily Sun on Monday, Ndobe said there were many struggle stalwarts in the municipality who contributed to changing people’s lives but Magaqa’s name was elevated because of the faction he belonged to. He said many branches would be against the proposal. “We’re not against comrade Magaqa, but we don’t understand his elevation above older comrades who did a lot for the people. We suspect regional leaders want to settle a score against us because we didn’t support them during the conference in 2018,” he said.

At the time of his death, Magaqa was a councillor. He was vocal about suspected corruption in the construction of Umzimkhulu Memorial Hall.
