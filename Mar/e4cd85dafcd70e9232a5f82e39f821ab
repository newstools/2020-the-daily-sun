SHE couldn’t stand seeing her son terrorising the community. So the no-nonsense mum called the police to deal with him. The cops refused to arrest him and Mavis Radebe’s son was beaten to death, allegedly by angry residents. The mum from Zonkizizwe squatter camp in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she believed that had cops kept her son Thabang Langa in jail, he’d still be alive. “I wanted him in jail so he could be rehabilitated. I went to the police several times but they told me they needed evidence,” she said. Mavis said two weeks ago, residents of Roodekop grabbed Thabang and moered him. He died of his injuries in hospital last Monday. “I was shocked when I went to the area where this happened,” she said. “I was told he was taken to hospital in an ambulance, but no one could tell me which hospital.” Mavis said after searching for days, she found him at Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus. He had head injuries and burn wounds. “It was obvious he was burnt on the head with boiling water after being assaulted. “I know my son was a thug. All I wanted was for him to pay for his sins in jail. “I want the people who assaulted my son like this to tell me what he did to deserve such punishment.” Sergeant Rufus Tema said the matter was under investigation and no arrests had been made.
