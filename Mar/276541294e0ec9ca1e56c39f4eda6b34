CAPE Town marathon race organizers will give runners their money back, if the IAAF gold label status accredited marathon is unable to continue. The race is scheduled to take place on 18 October in the Mother City. But given the current situation facing the world due to the outbreak of Coronavirus, there are no guarantees that the popular race will go ahead as planned. The Old mutual Two Oceans marathon that was scheduled to take place during the Easter holidays, was cancelled because of this pandemic. The non-refundable clause by the Two Oceans organizers angered runners, who felt that their hard-earned monies that was used to play for race entries, transport and accommodation went down the drain. But while Cape Town marathon newly appointed race director Renee Jordaan is hopeful that the popular marathon will still take place this year, the organizing team has left a room for disappointment: “While we acknowledge the far-reaching effects of this global pandemic, we are also hopeful that the Marathon date puts us safely outside of the critical window,” The runners will receive their full refund of the money that they used to pay for race entries. For the sake of the safety and health of the runners, the organizing team said that they will keep on monitoring the situation and decide closer to the event if it will take place or not.
