Dynamic duo Sphectacula and Naves are celebrating a decade in the entertainment industry. To celebrate their musical journey, they released a single titled Okokoko last month. Speaking to SunBuzz, Sphectacula said the single is an oath he and Naves are making to their fans. Said Sphectacula: “Oko okois a Xhosa word for always, which means we’ll always be here to entertain the people. “People have relied on us for their entertainment for the past 10 years, and we’ve never disappointed them. “From music to radio and TV, we’ve always been great at being entertainers. “So this is to say we’ll continue to be the guys that people depend on to have fun for many more years to come.” He said they started working on the song in 2016 but didn’t release it. “We didn’t release the song as we felt something was missing. So Spirit Banger, Bruce Sebitlo and Mondli Ngcobo helped with the song and it became a banger. “Then Unathi came along with her part and the song just took another turn and became even greater.” To celebrate their occasion, they’ll be hosting concerts around Mzansi. “These tours will start in spring. The parties will have all the artists we’ve featured in our songs. So it will be epic. We’re still discussing the nitty-gritties of the concerts and people will know about the venues and dates soon.” He also said they were trying to get back on TV. “We’re pitching our ideas for shows to different channels. We’re hoping that will be a success as we want to return to the TV space.” The music video for Okokoko will be released today on their YouTube page.
