THE country is in lockdown – but student funding will continue! Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande reassured students funded by NSFAS that their funding will not be interrupted. He was pleased with the report from the scheme’s administrator, Randall Carolissen, on contingency plans and disbursements of student bursaries during the lockdown period. He said the scheme has processed almost all the applications received to date, including the TVET and university walk-ins received during the first quarter of the year. He said it has made provisional funding available to almost 500 000 university students for the year. “The total upfront payments made to institutions to date is R4,2 billion. This includes the second upfront payment of R677 million paid to assist with transport and accommodation during the registration period.” Nzimande also said institutions were advised to pay the allowances to all the scheme’s funded and registered students, including funds based on registration data from institutions. “NSFAS and institutions must work together during the lockdown to ensure complete reconciliation of registration data. Out of the 131 000 TVET walk-in applications received, 94 000 applications are financially eligible, although 16 000 students have incomplete documents. This will be followed up by the NSFAS contact centre.”
