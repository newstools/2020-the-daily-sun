EIGHT patients transferred from Life Esidimeni in 2016 are still missing, despite the Gauteng Health Department’s efforts to find them. This was revealed by MEC Bandile Masuku in the Gauteng legislature on Tuesday. DA spokesman on health Jack Bloom said it had been nearly four years since the patients were moved to illegal NGOs. “I fear the fate of the remaining eight patients may never be known,” said Bloom. “It is highly possible these NGOs may have covered up some deaths. We may never know the true Esidimeni death toll if the fate of the missing patients remains a mystery.” Bloom said patients were sent to ill-equipped and unlicensed NGOs when the department cancelled its contract with Life Esidimeni. “Only one patient has been found since last August and is at the Waverley Care Centre,” he said. The centre is in Germiston, Ekurhuleni. Health spokesman Kwara Kekena said interventions were made to find missing patients: home visits and talking to Home Affairs. “Life Esidimeni’s head office assisted with four files of mental healthcare users. Four out of eight don’t have files. A case with regards to the missing patients has been opened with the police.” The department was continuously checking for patients at all facilities.
