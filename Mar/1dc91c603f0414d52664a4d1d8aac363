Soon after the episode, the Nokuthula challenge was made into a remix of DJ Maphorisa's popular song, Phoyisa. The  DJ announcedhe is going to release a remix of the trending song, featuring Busiswa, Kabza De Small and Cassper Nyovest. He said he'd give Nokuthula's family money, depending on the number of retweets he gets. He said one retweet will be equal to R1. Read: HEARTBREAK OVER NOMZAMO'S EXIT!
