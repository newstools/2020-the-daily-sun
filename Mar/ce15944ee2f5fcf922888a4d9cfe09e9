ORLANDO Pirates' quest to challenge to challenge for the league title is fading away after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Golden Arrows at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday night. In their last two matches, the Buccaneers managed to register one point out of a possible six, and the games are running out for Josef Zinnbauer's players. Pirates are now on 40 points after 23 matches while Arrows sit on 32 with seven games to go in their timetable. Golden Arrows will feel a little hard done by the referee after what seemed like a legitimate penalty for Arrows was disallowed late in the second half - this was after an Arrows player was clipped inside the box by a Pirates defender, leaving the home side players fuming and charging at the referee. Pirates have 10 days to prepare for their massive game against Mamelodi Sundowns who were knocked out of the CAF Champions League by Al Ahly earlier in the day. Arrows in the meantime, have a longer break and they will face Stellenbosch FC in the league on 22 March,
