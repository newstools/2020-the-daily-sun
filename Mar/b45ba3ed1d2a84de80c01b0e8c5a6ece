THE devastated mum wants answers after her son was shot dead, allegedly by a cop. Mboni Mbatha (42) told Daily Sun a cop shot eight-year-old Simphiwe on Tuesday. Simphiwe’s death came after residents of Inanda, north of Durban, went on the rampage and beat up a shop owner they accused of shooting Thobani Msomi. A resident said Thobani took expired maize meal back to the shop on Tuesday and demanded his money back. “Instead, the shop owner drew a gun and shot him dead. Residents beat the shop owner,” said the resident. Cops arrived and saved the man. “Cops tried to stop them but they wouldn’t listen. They were angry,” said the resident. “One of the cops opened fire and the bullet hit Simphiwe, who stood next to the shop, in the head.” Another resident said none of the residents were armed, so there was no reason for the cop to shoot. Mboni said she wanted the cop to explain to her why he shot her son. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was being investigated. “During a scuffle between residents and police, a shot went off and struck a boy in the forehead. “An inquest docket was opened. Four suspects aged between 25 and 34 were arrested for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition, as well as murder.” She said a 9mm pistol was recovered. Acting Ipid national spokesman Sontaga Seisa said he knew about the case, but no arrests had been made.
