LERATO Sengadi is still fighting to be recognised as Jabulani “HHP” Tsambo’s wife, 18 months after his death.  Speaking to Daily Sun, Lerato said it was sad that many black widows were mistreated by their husbands’ families. Lerato’s status as HHP’s wife was questioned by the rapper’s family immediately after his death in October 2018. She approached the South Gauteng High Court after the family tried to deny her rights as customary wife but won. But HHP’s family brought an application against Lerato last March and the court reserved judgment. It’s believed the court will make its decision soon. “I’m no longer fighting this battle for myself but for all the widows out there. For years, black widows have been treated in the most awful and inhumane way,” she said. “Ask anyone, they will tell you of a black widow who’s gone through this. That’s why I feel this conversation is important. We must say enough is enough.” She said husbands should write wills to protect their wives. “But that still won’t ensure their wives will not be mistreated. It’s beyond their control. I think we just need to talk about this until families learn a widow needs their protection.” She said she didn’t want her daughter to experience the same thing one day. When asked about HHP, Lerato said: “I miss all the small things he used to do for me. He’d massage my feet. He brought me joy when I was down.” HHP committed suicide in 2018 after suffering from depression. Tsambo family spokesman, Nkululeko Ncana, said they had no doubt the court would give a fair judgment. On the issue of widows being abused by in-laws, he said the Tsambo family was not abusing anyone but all they wanted was respect for HHP. “If Lerato feels abused, she should sue those abusing her.”
