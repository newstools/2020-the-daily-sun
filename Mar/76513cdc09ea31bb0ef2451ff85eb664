NOKUZOLA Kakaza (24) has not let disability stand in her way. The model from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, was born with scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs during the growth spurt just before puberty. Despite her disability, brave Nokuzola didn’t stop believing in her dreams. “Disability is no excuse to go to sleep on your dreams. You have to keep working hard,” she said. She told Daily Sun people should feel confident about themselves and show their capabilities to the world, and not be ashamed of their physical appearance. “Being in a wheelchair has not made me question life. I believe everything happens for a reason. I’m living testimony of that,” she said. Nokuzola said she found the strength to be brave and strong after her mother died in 2006. But she only started taking modelling seriously last year. “I’ve always wanted to do something different from a young age. That’s why I chose to be a model living with a disability,” said Nokuzola. “I don’t let my disability limit me and neither should anyone else be limited by it.” She said she wanted to motivate the youth to follow their dreams as no one else would do it for them. She is a finalist for the Face of Gauteng Radio in which she’s contesting with 60 able-bodied models. She’s also a brand ambassador for Madiba Media Production. During her spare time, she goes to public places and schools to donate sanitary pads for young girls. “I’m the founder of African Proverb Unlimited Icon, through which we donate sanitary pads to disadvantaged girls. “Our aim is to promote menstrual health. This is one of the key driving forces that allow women to take up their places in business, corporates and the government,” she said.
