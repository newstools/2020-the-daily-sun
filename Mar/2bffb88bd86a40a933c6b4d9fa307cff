SIBONGAKONKE Mbatha was once tipped to be the next big thing to ever come out of South Africa. However, the now 22-year-old talented midfielder is yet to reach his pinnacle. The midfielder's promising career from the youth levels has not gone the way many would have predicted. Currently, he is plying his trade in the GladAfrica Championship with Mpumalanga based side TS Sporting. Before joining Sporting Mbatha had short stints with clubs such as Bidvest Wits, now-defunct Platinum Stars and Atlético de Kolkata in an Indian Super League. One of South Africa’s one most sough-after youth coaches, Thabo Senong, who happened to work with Mbatha in the junior national teams reckons the Ulundi born player will shine. Talking to SunSport, Senong said: “He is very disciplined and works very hard during training and matches" “He is only 22, I’m sure he will be at his best when he turns 24" “Most of the South African players are late developers so I do not doubt that he will soon be one of the best players in the country. "Mbatha was a star for South Africa in two Junior Fifa World Cups with Under-17 in 2015 and Under-20 in 2017. “Sbonga (Mbatha) is still one of the talents we have in the country, he is fortunate to have been developed at the school of excellence.  He is a very versatile player, he can function effectively in any role within the midfield department.” Senong added.“I’m grateful that TS sporting has given Sbonga a platform to further his career. “He has a small profile and maybe this might be the reason many coaches can doubt his effect on the field of play. He is technically gifted. Senong added: “He is very disciplined and works very hard during training and matches.”
