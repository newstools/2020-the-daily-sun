FORMER world champion Thulani “Tulz Evolution” Mbenge and Mardochee Kuvesa Katembo took trash talk in local boxing scene to another level when they traded harsh verbal sparring at yesterday’s media briefing at the Joburg Stadium. The two African welterweight kingpins will face off for the first time since their ABU welterweight showdown was announced. Mbenge and Katembo will headline TLB Promotions’ Human Rights commemoration tournament at the Riviera In Vaal Hotel on 28 March. Their media briefing was well attended by boxing scribes and it did not disappoint, resembling that of Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder who called each other names as they build for the fight that was won by the latter in a seventh round knockout. Mbenge, who will be returning to the ring after a long lay-off, threw the first stone at his opponent. Immediately after grabbing the microphone, Mbenge started shouting his arch-rival’s famous slogan. His first verbal punches were delivered to Katembo’s manager, Patrick Bonyeme. “Patrick, I want to give you an opportunity to say whatever you have been saying about me on social media straight in my face. “I have noticed that you have a lot of airtime on social media platform,” he said. “I was excited to meet that Patrick character. I was happy to see him choking and it gave me goosebumps and excitement because he talked a lot of trash about me. “I don’t like talking too and I prefer to do the talking inside the ring. I’m not a big talker but when the opponent faces me, he will know who I am. I hope his charge can be able to back all the trash talking with performance.” Before Mbenge finished talking on the podium, Bonyeme jumped in and interrupted by saying: “Now I can feel that the fight starts today. We stick to our words. We will send the former champion to retirement. Mbenge has not faced an opponent as strong as Katembo. I stand by my words. We are not just talking, we always deliver in the ring as well.”
