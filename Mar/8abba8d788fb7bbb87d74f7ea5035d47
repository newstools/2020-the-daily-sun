THE
number of people that tested positive for Covid-19 has reached 402 in South Africa. As
there is no cure for the respiratory disease to date, scientists across the
world are working hard to find the cure. According
to an article from The Guardian, about one in six people, become seriously ill,
while about 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case. Some
people experience a mild case that is about as serious as a regular cold â€“ and
recover without needing any special treatment. However,
old people with basic medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
problems, diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of
serious illness from Covid-19.
