Media personality Somizi helped a street vendor finish her stock. Somgaga posted a video of himself on Instagram saying he was in Braamfontein in Johannesburg wanted to buy everything on a vendor's table. "I am encouraging people to help vendors because the country will be on lockdown for 21 days... I'm doing my part and I am encouraging everyone to do their part. Go to the streets and vendors first and support them. Buy whatever you can." He said supermarkets sill survive the lockdown because they will be open but vendors won't. He then asked to buy everything on the table, asking the vendor whose face we couldn't see to count how much the stock is. Read: BENJAMIN DUBE: TAKE STOCK OF YOUR LIFE!
