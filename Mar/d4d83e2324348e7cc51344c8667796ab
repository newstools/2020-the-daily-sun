She said they were the only government hospital in Gauteng that took part in the programme. “We’re creating awareness around obesity, illness and lifestyle so people know how to take care of themselves when they are obese, or how to avoid being obese,” she said. Lengton said the hospital’s bariatric surgery unit was recently accredited to perform metabolic and bariatric (weight loss) surgeries , making it the first public hospital in Gauteng to do so. “The performance of bariatric and metabolic surgery represents an important advance in healthcare delivery in South Africa, because it gives access to those who are poor, but also in need of this life-changing surgery.” Lengton said there were free health assessment services on the day such as Body Mass Index, blood pressure and sugar tests. “These tests will help identify those who are at risk of contracting obesity-related illnesses, and will also identify what should be done about the diagnoses.” The university’s Dr Eric Pule said they had a responsibility as a health sciences institution to take the lead in raising awareness and educating communities.

I weighed 135kg and now weigh 80kg. “I feel so good and can climb the stairs without a problem,” she said.
