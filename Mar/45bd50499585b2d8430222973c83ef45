NO work... no pay! The deadly Coronavirus is set to hit many South African athletes in the pocket and local referees also face dark days without money due to the suspension of all sporting activity in Mzansi including the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship. Referees in South Africa are not permanently employed by the SA Football Association and rely on call-ups to officiate in PSL games. With no games currently, PSL refs will only get paid for matches they officiated before the leagues were suspended. State President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday announced the country would go into a 21 day lockdown starting from midnight tomorrow. Citizens have been warned to stay indoors and not spread the deadly virus. This means that not just referees, soccer players, athletes but the majority of the Mzansi work force will be sitting at home until the virus is contained. Safa acting CEO Gay Mokoena said he was sad about the refs plight but there’s nothing Safa can do to help them. He added that referees are paid on a game by game basis but luckily some of them have permanent employment away from football. “If there are no games then it means there’s no money,” said Mokoena. “But what is a bit of relief is some referees are employed. Some of them are teachers and policemen. Some of them do other things, so they do have other sources of income. But there are a few who don’t have other sources of income.” However, world football governing body, Fifa, is set to provide some relief. Fifa have come up with ways to help referees, players and clubs who cannot pay their players during this period when leagues worldwide have been suspended due to Coronavirus. Added Mokoena: “ I’m aware that Fifa is trying to come up with some sort of solution to this problem. But it is very early days. I don’t know what could come of that. “Having said all that, this virus has an impact on everyone’s lives. It is tough times for everyone in South Africa. There’s no normal working environment.”
