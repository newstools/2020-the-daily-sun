They are going to continue monitoring her," she said.

The hospital has been identified as one of the three facilities for coronavirus patients. The other two are Charlotte Maxeke and Tembisa. Briefing the premier and MEC at the designated isolation ward, the head of infectious diseases at Steve Biko Academic Hospital, Professor Anton Stoltz, said they used negative pressure inside the ward and that it was safe. "When we come in here, we are fully dressed up," he added. Stoltz said they also tried to move the number of particles inside the room and that there was enough air entering the room. "It's negative pressure (inside the ward). Nothing goes to the hospital when we see the patients here if we think they're ill. [For example,] over the weekend I admitted a patient. She tested negative but still she had to stay in here until I have proven that and then she can go out," the professor said.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-gauteng-woman-discharged-from-hospital-isolated-at-home-20200311
