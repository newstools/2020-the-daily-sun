MAMELODI Sundowns versus Bidvest Wits will headline the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup. The two giants were pitted against each other in the draw that took place yesterday. Baroka FC will host Bloemfontein Celtic in the other semi-final. Celtic put their name in the draw by beating GladAfrica Championship side TS Sporting 3-2 on penalties in their quarter-final clash played at KaNyamazane Stadium yesterday following a 1-1 draw after extra time. Interestingly, only PSL clubs are left in the competition after the last of the non top flight teams, Sporting, were dumped out by Siwelele. This also means outgoing champions, TS Galaxy, will remain the only team from Mzansiâ€™s second division to clinch the Ke Yona Cup. Celtic, who have not had the best of times in this competition in the past, will be hoping that this is their year. They eliminated both KwaZulu-Natal outfits, AmaZulu and Maritzburg United in the previous rounds. Sporting on the other hand, were hoping to pull off a giant killing act as the only team from outside the top flight. The Mpumalanga outfit headed into the clash with nothing to lose against their more fancied opponents Celtic. Sporting knocked out GladAfrica Championship leaders Ajax Cape Town in the first round before edging ABC Motsepe League side Happy Wanderers in the round of 16 Abantu Bemthetho are currently struggling in the GladAfrica Championship, languishing third bottom - just two points above the relegation zone, with seven matches remaining. Their struggles did not show though in the Ke Yona as they gave Celtic a run for their money with the match decided on penalty shootouts. Celtic opened the scoring in the second half through Victor Letsoalo only for Sporting to level matters late in the match through Chico Muchanga.
