THE lead prosecutor in the case against Nigerian Pastor Timonty Omotoso and his two co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho has been removed from the case. Prosecutor Nceba Ntelwa did not appear in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday in the case against the trio. State prosecutor Ishmet Cerfontein appeared for the State instead. She informed the court that a new council has been appointed in the trial for the state and will be ready to continue with the trial on April 14 as he still needs to familiarize himself with the case. NPA provincial spokesman Luxolo Tyali said that Ntelwa had been moved from the Omotoso trial so that he can focus on organised crime cases in East London. Advocate Marius Stander will take over from him. Omotoso and the two co-accused are facing charges of rape and human trafficking among others. Judge Irma Schoeman is also expected to deliver her ruling on the state's application to amend the indictment. Last year, Judge Irma Schoeman was appointed to preside over the Omotoso trial after Judge Mandela Makaula recused himself.
