EASTERN Cape’s boxing trainer Mzamo “Chief” Njekanye is hoping that the “hometown” decision won’t raise its ugly head when they travel to Gauteng for the South African lightweight championship on Sunday. Njekanye’s charge Siphosethu “Let it Rain” Mvula will square up against Tshifhiwa “Atomic Spider” Munyai for the vacant SA lightweight crown at Blairgowrie Recreation Centre, Randburg. The Duncan Village-based camp in East London are wary of the culture of so-called hometown decisions ahead of this clash. “I have never been on the wrong side of such a decision but the situation does not favour us at all. We are fighting Munyai in his backyard on his terms and the promotion has his best interests. “In such situations it is not easy as a visiting fighter to win a points decision. All we are asking for is fairness from the officials,” said Njekanye. “If they level the playing field there will be no excuse on our side. We are coming to Gauteng to fight and hoping our opponent is ready for a real war.” The rival boxing trainers, Njekanye and Alan Toweel will be on the opposite corners for the third time and the Eastern Cape mentor has come out victorious on previous occasions. However, Toweel has assured his counterpart of justice and fairness: “There is no reason for him to worry, in all of our tournaments officials have been judging fairly,” he said. “This is going to be a scientific contest, we are up against a good opponent and a counter-puncher. It is going to be a tough one that is why Munyai has put in the hard work for this fight, he is desperate to be on top again. We are going into this fight as underdogs because people think my boxer is finished but he is ready to put up his best performance,” said Toweel.
