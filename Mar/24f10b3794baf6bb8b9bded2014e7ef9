FIVE traffic officials, three administration clerks, four driving test jockeys, two examiners and two driving school instructors are expected in court today. They were bust by the Hawks in Bethlehem and Harrismith on Wednesday and yesterday. The suspects are facing charges of corruption after they were nabbed in a combined operation mounted by various police organisations to crack down on the alleged issuing of fake drivers licences and roadworthy certificates. The Harrismith and Bethlehem driver’s licence testing centres have been under investigation since 2018 after information surfaced of rampant corruption by groups allegedly organising the issuing of driver’s licences for payment. Allegedly, applicants were introduced by the driving school instructors to certain examiners and all the involved parties would get a share. In some cases, everything was arranged with the instructor, who acted as a middleman. In a potentially deadly development, code 14 truck licences were issued to individuals who didn’t do the test themselves but would instead use someone called a “jockey”, who does the driving test on behalf of the applicant. Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation head Lieutenant- General Godfrey Lebeya praised cops for their multi-disciplinary approach. “The arrest of these individuals will indirectly contribute to the reduction of fatalities on our roads,” he said. Anybody who participated or got their licences in this way in the Free State is urged to come forward. A verification process will be held to see if the licence is legal.
