KAIZER Chiefs’ biggest challenge in their remaining Absa Premiership matches is how to deal with bottom clubs – Polokwane City, Chippa United, Baroka Polokwane City, Chippa United and Baroka. The run-away log leaders-mentor Ernst Middendorp is worried about how they will conduct themselves against such teams fighting for survival. Surprisingly, the German coach is not concerned about their fellow title contenders as he believes some will fall off along the way. But his main concern is collecting points from teams fighting to retain their Premier Soccer League status. Fresh from claiming the Soweto derby bragging rights, courtesy of a 1-0 victory over their arch-rivals Orlando Pirates at the FNB Stadium at the weekend, Amakhosi host relegation haunted AmaZulu at the same venue on Saturday night (8.15pm). Middendorp believes their duel against Usuthu will be harder than that of Pirates, especially now that they have suspended coach Jozef Vukusic. “I’m not worried about the other title rivals as they will still play each other and cancel each other out. But my biggest worry is the game against AmaZulu who are fighting for their lives,” he said. “I think that game against AmaZulu will be more harder than the one against Pirates.” Middendorp said they will treat their game against Usuthu with caution since they know collecting three points against the Kwa-Zulu Natal-based outfit will take them closer to the league title. Fact that Chiefs defeated Usuthu 2-0 in the first round in Durban does not mean they will beat them again. “It’s all about the mentality of the players in the remaining nine matches. We have to be mentally strong to get over the line,” he said.
