RESIDENTS were left horrified after a burnt crocodile was found near their homes. The crocodile was found by a passerby in Orchards, Tshwane, on Wednesday morning. The man said it seemed as if the animal had been killed the night before. He said someone had obviously set it alight as the smell of petrol was everywhere. Most people said it was a mystery how the crocodile got there while others said they believed it was a monitor lizard. Many people said it was not right to have killed it. They said there was a dam in the area and people probably invaded its home. Karabo Bapela wrote on Facebook: “The area is wild. Developers are increasingly building houses on top of wild animals’ homes.” Fentse Kgoadi also wrote: “Crocodiles don’t bite or eat people, unless threatened. “I understand we fear these things and feel threatened, but they aren’t aware as their intention is not to threaten us. They should have called people who deal with them.” SPCA general manager Dewald Wahlstrand said: “They should call the SPCA or Wildlife, who will be able to assist. If they try to kill the animal, they could put themselves in danger or get into trouble.” Asked about the alleged crocodile, he couldn’t confirm anything as the matter was being investigated.
