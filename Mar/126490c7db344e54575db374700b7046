Eskom will implement stage 1 load shedding today. Eskom said it regrets to inform the country that starting
from 9:00 today, they will implement stage 1 load shedding until 23:00. “It is envisaged load shedding may continue to be
implemented until Thursday,” Eskom said. The power utility says this is due to a number of units
still on unplanned breakdowns, which will return only during the course of the
week. “This will also help Eskom to build emergency reserves
that were depleted as we drove to keep the lights on during the high equipment
breakdowns we experienced towards the end of last week. “Load shedding will put Eskom in a better position to
meet the rising demand during the week. Work is also continuing to return to
service some of the unplanned breakdowns we experienced,” said Eskom. Eskom said the system is currently constrained,
unpredictable and vulnerable and that demand has also risen since January,
putting pressure on the ageing fleet. “We urge every South African to co-operate in managing
electricity consumption with care to help us minimize load shedding,” Eskom
said. Customers are requested to continue to use electricity
sparingly and to assist Eskom to reduce demand:  Customers are urged to revisit their loadshedding
schedules on the Eskom website, (https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local
municipal websites
