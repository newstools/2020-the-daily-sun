TWO of Mzansi’s biggest rappers are beefing it up again. AKA has been hurling insults at Cassper Nyovest since Wednesday. AKA, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, insulted Cassper while trying to push him into signing a contract for a boxing match between them. AKA tweeted he was tired of always being made fun of by Cassper and he wanted to resolve their beef in the boxing ring. He wrote on his Twitter page: “Tag short pan. Let him know his management don’t care about him letting him do this fight. “I already beat him on wax. Now it’s time to break his nose. “Somebody please tell and tag Tsibip that his father is a deadbeat dad for allowing him to drop out of high school. And his mother is just as bad for allowing it. #signthecontract ... immediately.” AKA managed to insult Cassper, his parents and his manager Tlee Moiloa. Tlee wrote on Twitter: “If I ever went classless on this app for likability, it would directly disrespect everything my mom and sisters taught me. “I’m from Thaba Nchu, don’t catch bait from small, misguided and angry desperate kids.” When the SunTeam contacted AKA’s management team, they didn’t want to comment. Tshepo Seone, another of Cassper’s managers, said he was not interested and hung up. Cassper wrote on his social media and took a swipe at AKA. “Stay humble, keep a strong will, a strong mind and stay fly.”
