HIS house is covered in rubbish, but Tseko Kokota (40) has done nothing to sort out the problem. Neighbours complain about rats infesting his yard and the unbearable smell coming from there. Tseko from Dark City in Mangaung has been recycling bottles since he lost his job in 2016, but his recycling has turned his yard into a rubbish dump! Resident Jabu Hati (50) said: “The rubbish flies around the street and into our yards. We can’t live like this. We’ve been raising our concerns with our councillor for years but nothing has happened.” Tseko’s neighbour, Sindiswa (22), said her yard was surrounded by rubbish and she had a six-month-old child. “For years we’ve been breathing this smell. We understand he’s trying to make a living, but it’s bad for us. Tseko said recycling helped him put food on the table and no one would tell him what to do in his yard. “My neighbours are jealous of me because I make money,” he said. “I collect waste all over Mangaung to make a living. I have kids to feed.” Tseko’s mum Maria Kokota (66) said she didn’t approve of what her son was doing to their neighbours. “I told him to sell the rubbish. I don’t want to fight with my neighbours,” she said. Ward councillor Khosi Mogapi said he spoke to Tseko to clean the place. “He said he didn’t like working with rubbish, but it was the only way he could make money. I will talk to him again to clean up the place.”
