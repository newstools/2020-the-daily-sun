  Saudi
Arabia on Sunday made the biggest cut in its prices. This after
talks between OPEC and its allies broke down and they didn’t reach an agreement
to cut oil production on Friday. AFP
reported that Russia reportedly refused to cut its supplies. On Monday,
this had a catastrophic result on the share price of South African oil and
chemicals company Sasol. It’s share
price dropped by 45%. “Oil cannot
stay this low. This fall is the worst day since 1991. Saudi needs 80 Russia
needs 65 USA shale needs 55. Saudi has the lowest actual production costs, but
the highest fiscal needs. Saudi has
the capacity to pump more but extra volume will not make up for price fall,”
Said Wayne McCurrie from First National Bank Wealth and Investments. On Twitter
McCurrie further said that the price of petrol could drop by R2. “Therefore,
oil volumes will collapse from non-Saudi producers. If oil stays at current
price, could see a R2 drop in pump price. USA shale production will plummet,”
McCurrie said on his Twitter account.
