 THEMBINKOSI Lorch is
expected to be included in Bafana Bafana team to be announced today. The Orlando Pirates
midfielder was missing from the last camp through fitness, but coach Molefi
Ntseki will be roping him back into the squad for the back-to-back 2021 Africa
Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sao Tome and Principe on 27 and 31 March. Cape Town City midfielder
is out of the squad Thato Mokeke while Mamelodi Sundowns Andile Jali is also
expected to be drafted back into the national team for the firs time in two
years. England-based Kamohelo
Mokotjo drops out due to injury while Thapelo Morena is also not in the list. The overseas-based legion
is expected to be part of the team, though the likes of Lebo Mothiba have been
under-performing for their teams. Mothiba has been battling
for form in front of goal, yet to score for his France side Strasbourg since
December. Bafana are second on three
points behind Ghana, having collected three points from the two matches. They lost 2-0 to Ghana in
the opening match away but bounced back with a 1-0 win against Sudan at home. “We should all agree that
we got talented players in this country, but the most important thing for me is
the right attitude,” said Ntseki. “Because at the
international level, you should have fighters, you should have people who will
wear the jersey and die for the jersey.” “Talent alone is not
enough. I have seen it when we play against the likes of Nigeria, the likes of
Egypt, and Ghana,” added Ntseki. “It is very interesting to
hear all the players saying, ‘I must also be counted’, which is a healthy
headache for us. But there you need soldiers. You need players who can go out
there work very hard.”
