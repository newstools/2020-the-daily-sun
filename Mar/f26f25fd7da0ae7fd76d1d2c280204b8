Nosibulelo said she met the woman at Lamontville Clinic the previous week. “She told me she plaits people’s hair for a living and offered to do mine for free. We exchanged numbers and arranged to meet,” she said.  Nosibulelo told the SunTeam she was confused when she met the woman at a salon in Montclair but had to pay someone else to do her hair. “She sat on the sofa with Sisipho,” she said.
