THEY can’t bath or eat because of a blocked sewerage pipe next to their centre. The smell even chased away some homeless people from the NGO Participate and Power Nature in Sunnyside, Tshwane. According to residents, the pipe has been spilling kak water into the stream since 27 February. Centre manager, Katleho Ncaphe, told Daily Sun they reported the matter to the municipality on 27 February. “They came and opened the manhole cover and left us with a bad smell. They should’ve left it closed as more kak was coming out. The smell is terrible and we can’t open windows.” Ncaphe said he felt sorry for people who bathed in the stream. He said he feared they would be contaminated with diseases. He said he was concerned about their health as they ate at the centre on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. “The municipality’s service delivery is very poor. I want the municipality to respond to the matter because it’s a health hazard,” he said. Cynthia Fica (32) works at the centre and said: “We can’t work. The smell’s very bad.” City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said: “The sewage spillage was reported to the relevant department and will be attended to by the end of the week.”
