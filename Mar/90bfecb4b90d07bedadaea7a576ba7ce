THE top of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge could not be tighter with only one point separating the top three teams. Current leaders Bidvest Wits, Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates are in a three-horse race for the Diski title which will come with a 10 day overseas tour. Wits are leading the pack with 58 points, the same as Sundowns who are second on goal difference. However, Downs have a match in hand. Pirates are third with 57 points. This weekend, Sisa Dukashe Stadium in East London will host the two day MDC Massive Festival where teams will be chasing their targets. Wits are heading to the weekend with hopes of maintaining their top spot. They host struggling Black Leopards in a top versus bottom clash on Sunday at Bidvest Stadium (10am). With four remaining matches before the curtain goes down, a lot could still happen. The Students remain hopeful of keeping the number one spot until end of the season. Wits coach Dillon Sheppard admitted that being at the top has put them under pressure. He said: “Being top of the log at the moment is nice but it is not comfortable as Mamelodi Sundowns have a game in hand, and Orlando Pirates are just a point behind us. It’s very difficult. We still have a chance to win the Diski Challenge, so we have to just keep the pressure up.” Wits’ top players such as Rowan Human and Sinenjongo Mkiva will continue to carry the club’s hopes as they try to lift the title. Pirates mentor Glen Salmon is waiting for any slip-ups from the top two sides. “We have focused on keeping in touch with the log leaders and we have achieved that,” Salmon said. “Now we have to make sure we maintain the winning streak in the last four games and then we will see where we end up.” Pirates will be pinning their hopes in the Bophela twins –Simiso and Simo – who have been outstanding this season.
