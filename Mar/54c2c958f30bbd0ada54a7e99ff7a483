OFFICIALS yesterday shared their plans to deal with the coronavirus crisis. On Saturdays and Sundays, bottle stores would operate normally but taverns would close at midnight.  People will have to notify their nearest police stations if they’re organising a wedding, funeral or any other public event. Also, ensure that there are no more than 100 people. You do not need permission, but notify the police in your area. Metro cops and CPF members will monitor those hosting gatherings to see if they don’t have over 100 people. Makhura said Gauteng was at high risk of the virus spreading as people lived close together and millions used public transport every day. Most international flights also come into OR Tambo International Airport.  He discouraged people from visiting municipal customer care walk-in centres unless absolutely necessary. He said the public transport system would be disinfected. The grade 10 pupil at Curro Heuwelkruin attended classes on Monday. The next day, the school sent parents a letter that the pupil had gone into self-quarantine and was being tested. Approached for comment, school management said the letter was not fake.  The parent of a grade 11 pupil from Mankweng said: “This has left my daughter panicking. I hope the pupil tests negative.” The 114 people quarantined at The Ranch Hotel after evacuation from Wuhan in China have tested negative. Premier Stanley Mathabatha said more than 300 tracers would trace everyone in the province who had been in contact with those who tested positive.
