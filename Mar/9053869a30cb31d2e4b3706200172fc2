KOKETSO Mashigo (24) had good eyesight. But he couldn’t see a thing one morning when he woke up. “It was so sudden,” said Koketso from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. “I had never had eye problems before. “Over 10 traditional healers told me I was bewitched. None of them helped me. “We’ve spent over R50 000 on traditional healers. “I believe I would have been better off had I had invested the money in my rehabilitation.” “I wish I could see again because eyes are the first physical feature the brain communicates with.” Koketso was in matric when he lost his eyesight. He stayed at home for three years because he was ashamed and afraid of the public. “That is why I use sunglasses to cover my eyes,” he said. But his mum Lerato Mashigo introduced him to Optima College in Tshwane. “The mobility trainer there said I shouldn’t worry about what people said,” said Koketso. “Being blind is not a choice. Blindness is a disability that can happen to any one.” He has found a way to embrace his disability. He can walk and do things that sighted people do. “This boosted my confidence. I’m ready to face the world. “I’m doing matric so that I can study business management at UJ. “I want to empower myself with the right skill so that I can work in the real estate world.”
