  POLOKWANE City’s
hopes to stave off relegation received a welcome boost yesterday. This after they
beat fellow relegation candidates Black Leopards 2-1 at the Peter Mokaba
Stadium. They had to
come from behind to earn the crucial win and grab the bragging rights in the
Limpopo derby. But Clinton
Larsen’s men would have been pleased to walk away with maximum points more than
anything. Rise and Shine
appear to be picking up momentum at the right time as they bagged their second
consecutive win. They edged Cape
Town City 3-2 last time out. For their win
over Lidoda Duvha, they had Charlton Mashumba and Sibusiso Hlubi to thank as
they scored the goals. They fought
back after Leopards took the lead in the 59th minute through an own
goal by defender Ayanda Nkili. He could not
sort his feet out in time to clear Mogakolodi Ngele’s dangerous cross, stabbing
it into his own net instead. But when it
looked like it would be another frustrating day at the office for Rise and
Shine, they pulled off a stunning turnaround. Mashumba scored
the equaliser in the 62nd minute. Smelling blood,
Rise and Shine went for the kill and they got the winning goal through Hlubi. It was a goal
worthy of winning any match as he struck a powerful shot past a hapless Tyson
Muleka in the Leopards goal. For Lidoda
Duvha, the defeat was their second in as many league matches after their heart-breaking
defeat to Orlando Pirates last time out. They remain in
the danger zone, second from bottom with 20 points from 22 matches. Rise and Shine,
on the other hand, are out of the drop zone. They occupy 13th spot
with 23 points from as many matches. Larsen’s
charges next face on form Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday
while City face Baroka in another Limpopo derby. In the other
match, Bleomfontein Celtic beat Baroka 2-1 at Dr Moemela Stadium.
