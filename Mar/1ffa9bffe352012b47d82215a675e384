GladAfrica Championship
side Uthongathi FC have fired coach Johnny Ferreira with immediate effect. The club has since
appointed Pitso Dladla, who was Ferreira’s assistant, as coach until the end of
the season. Dladla will be assisted by
Olivier Kouadio. “Uthongathi Football Club
has parted ways with coach Johnny Ferreira. We worked with a marvelous coach
who has huge experience, but results were not coming. In football results are
so important. “We’ll miss Johnny for his
contribution in the club and we wish him everything of the best in his future
endeavours,” the club said the statement. Ferreira joined the club
in July 2018 when he replaced Sammy Troughton. Ferreira’s departure
doesn’t come as a surprise. He was put on a special leave late last year after being
accused of favouritism, which compromised the results. He was later restored back
to the position, but things couldn’t quite work out for him. Results have not been forthcoming
for the team. Thus far in 2020, they
have won only once, lost three and drawn five in nine games. This is despite the fact
the club signed experienced players such as Siyabonga Nomvethe, Thanduyise
Khuboni, Siyanda Zwane and Sandile Zuke in January. The club is now third on
the Championship table with 40 points from 23 games, one behind Swallows FC,
who are second and six behind leaders Ajax. “The Cane Cutters will
never give up in fighting for the top position in the league,” the club further
said.
