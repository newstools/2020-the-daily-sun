 The
business rescue practitioners for struggling airline SA Express have written a
letter to staff to say that salaries will not be paid on time for March. SA Express
is a state-owned, regional airline that operated domestic routes as well as
flights to Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and the DRC. It was placed under
business rescue by order of the courts in early February. The BRPs
for the regional airline issued a letter to its employees on Tuesday, stating
that "adverse operational challenges" and the impact of Covid-19 on
passenger demand has affected the airline's ability to generate
"adequate" cash to fund "critical operational expenses". It said it
would not be able to pay staff salaries as scheduled on March 25, and advised
employees to contact their banks. SA Express
has confirmed the authenticity of the letter. The
practitioners said the airline has requested emergency funding from the
Department of Public Enterprises to pay for "critical and immediate
operational expenses" this includes staff salaries. This comes
after the airline last week announced it would suspend operations, which
further "amplified" its liquidity crunch. SOURCE:
