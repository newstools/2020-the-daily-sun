Netball South Africa President, Cecilia Molokwane has tested positive for COVID-19 after her business travels between the United Kingdom and Scotland respectively. Molokwane had travelled to the United Kingdom for meetings with the International Netball Federation (INF) where she serves as a board member in March. These meetings took place as South Africa is gearing to host the 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town. “I found out this morning (Tuesda) that I have tested positive for the Corona Virus," a statement read from the netball federation. "I did these tests following my return from the UK where I was in March. I would also like to mention that when we returned from the UK, we were screened at the airport (ORT) and everything went well. "I would like to take this moment to alert the general public that I am currently in quarantine and taking all the necessary precautions to make sure that I recover fully from the virus. I am not showing any symptoms, however, I will still take precautions to protect everyone around me and myself. “Please take all necessary precautions, wash your hands with soap or sanitiser for at least 20 seconds, keep the required two metre social distance. This virus is real, and we need to treat it as such. If you test positive please make sure that you quarantine for the required 14 days.” The federation is urging the general public not to panic as they are doing everything to safeguard and protecting the lives of others. "Netball South Africa also requests that we allow the President to quarantine during this period. The offices of Netball South Africa will remain closed until 17 April,' added the statement.
