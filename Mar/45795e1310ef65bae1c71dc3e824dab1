FORMER radio and TV presenter Criselda has gone back to using her maiden surname, Kananda. This after she revealed she and her husband, Siyolo Dudumashe, had separated and were in the process of getting a divorce. She didn’t want to get into more detail. “I wouldn’t like to talk much about what’s happening with my relationship, but people should know that I’m in the process of divorce,” she said. She received a lot of backlash from people after she dropped the assault charges against Dudumashe. Criselda said her family was supportive and comfortable with her situation and journey to rebuilding her life. She wished to go back to radio full time. The former Metro FM presenter told Daily Sun she missed broadcasting. “I miss the stories and content when I’m the one breaking it for the first time and having a platform to share pain and joy.” Criselda is featured on Emfuleni Wothando on Umhlobo Wenene FM. “It’s adult content about pain brought on by love and relationships. “I’m contributing to healthy relationships. “The show gives me the opportunity to contribute positively to healing the family structure and encouraging a healthy society.”
