FORMER Bafana Bafana defender Matthew Booth knows the impact on society of going into a lockdown. But he said the measures were necessary if the spread of the coronavirus was to be stopped. South Africans will be confined to their homes for a 21-day period from tomorrow, with only limited visits to the shops, pharmacies or to seek medical care. There’s no doubt many will be inconvenienced, but Booth says drastic times call for drastic measures. “It’s unprecedented. We’ve not seen anything like this on a global scale since the Spanish flu outbreak (in 1918). “It’s complete eye-opener, and I think it exposes how vulnerable we are to new viruses. It’s scary, but there are also lessons that we can learn from this. “It’s going to be a massive blow for our economy, but it (the lockdown) is an absolute necessity and a brave decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the South African government.” Booth retired six years ago after an illustrious career in the South African top flight and in Russia, which also saw him play for Bafana and take his place in the squad for the 2010 Fifa World Cup.
