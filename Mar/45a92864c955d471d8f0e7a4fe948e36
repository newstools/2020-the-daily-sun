POLICE Minister Bheki Cele visited the house in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, where seven people were shot dead in the early hours of Sunday morning. Seven others were injured and one suspect (32) was bust in connection with the shooting. A tavern operated from the house but was closed down as it didn’t have a licence.

Cele yesterday said a big source of crime, especially murder, was alcohol. “We have made a call to try to strengthen laws that deal with alcohol. “At the moment, all provinces have laws when it comes to trading alcohol,” said Cele. He said police needed a single national law as it was proven that booze was the cause of many problems.  “The national law will help because we are all going to deal with the problem using one approach,” he said. Cele said he believed there was a motive behind the shooting. “At the moment, the police have several clues they are following and the investigation is ongoing,” he said. Cele said cops were sent to the area and they should work with people running shebeens and taverns. READ: WATCH: ZCC MEMBERS' CORONAVIRUS SONG! But residents didn’t believe the minister’s visit would make a difference. Nandipha Nkuhlu (40) said: “No one would just shoot people. It’s a shame that innocent people were also affected.” Simlindile Gwiba (30) said the police needed to be more visible. “Criminals will think before committing a crime if the police are more visible,” said Simlindile.
