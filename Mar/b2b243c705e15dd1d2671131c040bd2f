Black Leopards star Lesedi Kapinga is said to be on his way to Chloorkop. Kapinga has reportedly signed a pre-contract with Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns, SunSport insiders have revealed. Kapinga is one of Lidoda Duvha’s top performers this season. He has scored six goals and provided the same number of assists in his 26 appearances for Leopards in all competitions this season. As a result, Kapinga has caught the eye of big Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs. It appears Sundowns have won the race to capture the exciting 24-year-old’s signature. "He is on his way to Sundowns," said the insider. "There were a lot of big teams interested in his services, but he has chosen Sundowns." Another source also confirmed that Kapinga will be a Sundowns player next season. "Yes, it is true that he is on his way to Sundowns," said the source. "He will join at the end of the season when his contract with Leopards expires." The talented dribbling wizard, however, has denied putting pen to paper for Downs. "I don't know anything about that," said Kapinga when contacted for comment. "I have no idea where that comes from. As far as i know, i am a Black Leopards player and that's it." Asked whether he will be on the move at the end of the season, Kapinga said he could not reveal anything at the moment. "Im a Black Leopards player. That's where my focus is at right now. "I am in camp as we speak so i can't talk."
