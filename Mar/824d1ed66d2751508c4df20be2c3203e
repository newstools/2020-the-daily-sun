Mamelodi Sundowns boss Pitso Mosimane insists that the club are still on the right track in their quest for continental domination despite their CAF Champions League quarter-final elimination. Sundowns were knocked out at the last eight by Egyptian giants and 'Team of the Century' Al Ahly 3-1 on aggregate after the second leg finished 1-1 at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. This means that all four sides in the semi-finals are from North Africa, namely Al Ahly, Zamalek, Wydad Casablanca and Raja Casablanca. Some would argue that the Brazilians have gone backwards on the continent since their 2016/2017 triumph. A group stage exit followed by a semi-final and quarter-final exit in the three years following gives credence to this. But Mosimane is confident that with the continued backing of his board to bring in quality signings that his charges will prove stiffer competition next year. "We go again next year, we try. Maybe after five years we will have two teams from South Africa in the semifinals. But you have to get rid of TP Mazembe. How do you get rid of Mazembe? It’s not easy but we are coming slowly," the Masandawana mentor said. "We have made signings. It’s just that you don’t know. We don’t say. We made signings that I have recommended, and the club have gone with them. We have strength in the team for next year. "Maybe better than what you see. We have added three more, but we can't talk. That will be a better team than this one on the Champions League. I am happy that the club has gone with them, so we are okay. We try again next year." SOURCE: SPORT24
