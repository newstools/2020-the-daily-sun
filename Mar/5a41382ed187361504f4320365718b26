GOBELA Zinhle Mngomezulu is on a mission to change the music scene with a sangoma flavour. Zinhle has been practising as a sangoma for 17 years, but what most people don’t know about her is she sings and composes sangoma songs. The gobela now is busy in studio recording her debut album titled Inkathazo Yedlozi. She will be known as Ubumbano LukaNzwakele on the music scene. Nzwakele was her great grandfather, from whom she inherited her calling of being a traditional healer. Zinhle said her music teaches people about the lives of the sangomas. She said her album would make sangomas proud of their calling. The 33-year-old from Umbumbulu south of Durban, KZN said her ancestors always told her the songs to sing in her dreams when she performed graduation ceremonies for her thwasas. Zinhle said she graduated as a sangoma at the age of 16. She now also teaches her thwasas how to sing her songs and to dance to their rhythms. Her coming album is a mixture of sangoma music and maskandi and will be out after the national Covid-19 lockdown. “In my dream, I always see my great-grandfather singing sangoma songs. “He also sings new songs for me and holds a guitar and other music instruments. “The album has new songs composed by him and two well-known sangoma songs, Asemsamo Amavulandlela and Webaba Ngiyabonga.” Zinhle said she hoped her music would change the way people view sangomas. Zinhle said she chose the title of the album to show others that you don’t just become a sangoma by choice, but you are forced to become one. “When the ancestors choose you to be a sangoma, you can’t run away. “This is a nice calling because we help people with their problems. “People must know we are also people and we can do what they do. “Our ancestors give us powers to heal and help the nation. We must be proud of that and do it thankfully,” she said.
