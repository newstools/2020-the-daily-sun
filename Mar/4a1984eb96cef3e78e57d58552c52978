 Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has confirmed that South
Africa's first suspected case of Covid-19 has tested positive. Mkhize released a statement on Thursday confirming that the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NCID) confirmed a positive test. "The patient is a 38-year-old male who travelled to
Italy with his wife. They were part of a group of 10 people and they arrived
back in South Africa on 1 March," Mkhize said in the statement. "The patient consulted a private general practitioner
on 3 March with symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, a sore throat and a
cough." The practice nurse then took swabs and delivered it to the
laboratory. The patient has been self-isolating since 3 March. "The couple also has two children. The Emergency
Operating Centre (EOC) has identified the contacts by interviewing the patient
and doctor. The tracer team has been deployed to KwaZulu-Natal with
epidemiologists and clinicians from the NICD." Mkhize said the doctor has been self-isolated as well. "This media briefing is to ensure that the public is
immediately kept abreast. A press briefing will be held later after the
Parliamentary debate this evening to shed more light on this issue." SOURCE: NEWS24
