SABC radio station, Ukhozi FM plays its part to help the class of 2020 during the lockdown. With the country shutdown, schools are closed, meaning pupils aren't learning. Ukhozi is coming through for the grade 12 learners and giving them lessons. The station with 7.7 million listeners initially had one slot for the lessons. Now, they have three slots, from 9am to 9:30am, 3pm to 3:30pm and 9pm to 9:30pm.
