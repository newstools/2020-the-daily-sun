Neymar has fled Paris and headed to Brazil to self-isolate amid the coronavirus outbreak, according to reports. The 28-year-old jetted back to his homeland alongside Paris Saint-Germain teammate and fellow Brazilian international Thiago Silva. Neymar has “exiled himself” in Brazil as the deadly pandemic spreads across Europe, according to ESPN and French newspaper Le Parisien. The outbreak has caused almost all major football on the Continent to be suspended with France's Ligue 1 on hold indefinitely. Neymar is said to have left earlier this week – just before the country went into lockdown – in the face of the “anxiety-inducing” situation brought on by Covid-19. - The Sun
