TV and radio presenter Pabi Moloi has secured a big date. This with a magistrate in Midrand, Jozi. The host of SABC3 talk show, Trending SA, was arrested on Thursday evening for drunken driving in Midrand. Driving a Jaguar, Pabi was stopped by the JMPD. According to a police statement, the host of Power FM’s Power Weekend Breakfast show failed to stop at a red traffic light on New Road. Unaware there was a stationary JMPD vehicle on the other side, Pabi allegedly observed and drove off. The police followed her before stopping her. She allegedly told one of the officers she was on her way home and was scared to stop. This because of that area’s high crime rate. According to the information, the police realised she smelled like alcohol after stopping her. Said a police officer, who wished to remain anonymous: “They asked her if she was drinking and how much she’s had that night.” The officer said the JMPD officers took Pabi to the district surgeon in Hillbrow, Jozi, to have her blood taken and sent to the lab. After returning from Hillbrow, Pabi was released on a R1 000 bail in the wee hours of Friday morning. She’ll appear in the Midrand Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Pabi said in a statement:  she was “truly gutted about this.”“I had an incident this week that I want to step up and take responsibility for. I had drinks and decided to drive myself home on Thursday night. It was a bad decision for which I take full responsibility. I was subsequently arrested for drinking and driving. I understand the gravity of the potential damage I could have done and am so sorry.” Police spokesperson Lieutenant Kay Makhubele promised to respond to our inquiry but hadn’t done so at the time of going to print
