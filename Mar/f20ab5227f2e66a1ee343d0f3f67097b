LADYSMITH in the KZN Midlands is fully operational again. Premier Sihle Zikalala has ordered Alfred Duma Mayor Vincent Madlala to go on voluntary sick leave for two months. The premier said a forensic investigation will be launched to test the allegations levelled at Madlala. Residents agreed to stop protesting on Friday after Zikalala removed the mayor. Chairman of Ubumbano Lokuthula Andile Hlatshwayo said: “We believe that even the investigating team will be able to do its work. “We know the leave is temporary, but we believe that after the investigation Madlala will be sent packing.” Municipal worker Simo Ndimande (23), who had previously vowed to never set foot in the office if the mayor was not removed, is back at work. Residents embarked on a protest in early February, accusing Madlala of corruption and blocking development and service delivery in Ladysmith. Residents stepped up the protest after the provincial government announced Madlala was not going anywhere. At a meeting with residents, Zikalala urged those making allegations against Madlala to make submissions to the investigating team. Madlala couldn’t be reached for comment at the time of going to print.
