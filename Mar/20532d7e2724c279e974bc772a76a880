WHEN three boys hid in the toilets to avoid class, they had no clue they were inviting a beating. Now a video of a teacher at Thotagauta Secondary School in Welkom, Free State, beating the bunking pupils has gone viral. In the video, the male teacher can be seen hitting the boys with a rubber pipe for allegedly bunking his class for two days in a row. A pupil said: “The teacher is notorious for taking no nonsense. He uses a short rubber pipe to beat pupils who don’t complete their homework or bunk class. “The three boys were forced to stand in front of class. We’re all afraid of the teacher, and pupils who got hit decided to stay away because they didn’t do their homework. “This is wrong and there are other methods to enforce discipline. “The video was taken by a classmate to show parents how the teacher deals with pupils. “We’ve been complaining about this teacher and our concerns fall on deaf ears. This video was made for the department to intervene.” A parent said the teacher should be removed as corporal punishment had been illegal for years. “How can pupils learn if they’re in pain after a beating? “I know most pupils don’t listen, but a better option would be to call parents to intervene instead of beating our kids up.” Free State education spokesman Howard Ndaba was not aware corporal punishment was practised at the school. “We will investigate, and depending on the outcome, the teacher will be dealt with. We condemn corporal punishment.”
