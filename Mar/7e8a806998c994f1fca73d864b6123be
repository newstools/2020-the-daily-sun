ORLANDO Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer has set his sights on playing in Africa next season. The German-born mentor, who took charge of Bucs in December, is determined to secure a top three finish now that all hopes of the club winning the Absa Premiership title have evaporated. Zinnbauer said he’ll relish competing in one of the Caf competitions next season. “In this season? If it is possible you give me a place in the first three then I take it,” said Zinnbauer. The champions and runners up will compete in the Caf Champions League while the side finishing third will qualify for the Caf Confederation Cup. Competing in Africa will be a new experience for the German coach. Pirates won the Champions Cup (now League) in 1995 and Super Cup a year later. They came close to add a second Champions League triumph in 2013 but they lost in the final. Bucs reached the Confed Cup final in 2015. Bucs are fourth on the table with 40 points from 23 games. The share that spot with third placed SuperSport United who have the same number of points but better goal difference. Pirates have a match in hand over United. They are one point behind second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns and eight shy of leaders Kaizer Chiefs with seven games to go. Admitted Zinnbauer: “We are a lot of points behind.” Pirates visit Sundowns at Loftus Stadium next Tuesday. They are hoping to do the double over Pitso Mosimane’s men after defeating them 1-0 on 15 January in what was Zinnbauer’s fourth game in charge of the team.
