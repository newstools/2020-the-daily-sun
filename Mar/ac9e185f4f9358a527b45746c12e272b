Road accidents continue to claim lives in Mzansi. On Tuesday morning two people were killed after a taxi rolled over on the M1 North at the Glenhove off-ramp in Melrose Estate, Johannesburg. Reports from the scene indicate that the driver of a mini-bus taxi lost control resulting in a rollover. Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said several occupants had been ejected during the rollover.“An adult male and an adult female were assessed however found to have no signs of life,” Herbst said. In another incident, seven people were left injured last night following a head-on collision on the corners of Witkoppen and Cedar Road in Sandton. Herbst said the patients were treated on scene and once stabilised were transported to the hospital for further treatment. In Durban, on Monday afternoon a woman was left critical after a taxi crashed into the back of a truck. The collision took place on the N3 outbound near the Tollgate Bridge. Herbst said multiple people had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. “One occupant of the taxi, an adult female sustained critical injuries and required Advanced Life Support intervention to stabilise her,” he said. In Potchefstroom, a 45-year-old man suffered serious injuries after losing control of his vehicle and rolling it on the corner of Louw and Paul streets. ER24 Spokesperson Ross Campbell said their paramedics found the man trapped in the vehicle. “The doors were able to be opened from the inside by smashing the side window. Once out, the man was treated with Advanced Life Support interventions before being transported to Mediclinic Potchefstroom for further care,” Campbell said.
