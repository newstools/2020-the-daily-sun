The 2020 SA Music Awards are postponed until further notice, according to a press release by the organisers released on Friday, the first day of the nation's 21-day lockdown. The event that honours local music talent has taken a cue from the announcements by the State President Cyril Ramaphosa as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Back in January, the award ceremony announced some changes to this year's event, adding Best Produced Music Video category amongst other things.It is unclear if those changes will still be enacted when the twenty-sixth edition of the event takes place. In the statement, the organisers said: "New dates for the nominee's announcement and the award ceremony will be made public depending on the advice from the government regarding the pandemic and when the situation in the country and the world improves." The announcement then went on to wish all those affected by the virus well and to urge people to stay indoors according to the latest ordinances. - Channel24
