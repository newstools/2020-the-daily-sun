GOSPEL star Dumi Mkokstad is warning event organisers and churches not to fall for a scammer using his name. The Ziphozenkosi singer told Daily Sun he had learnt someone was taking bookings on his behalf. Dumi said the person claimed to be his manager and was asking people to deposit money into his personal account. READ: MEET THE 2ND PERSON TO BE CURED OF HIV! He said he discovered this on Friday when he received a call from a Durban church asking if he was ready for a conference he had been booked for. Dumi said he was confused as he had been booked to perform at a wedding. “He told me they booked me through this person claiming to be my manager. “He said they paid a deposit of R25 000 and later paid another R25 000 for me to perform at their church conference,” he said. Dumi said he asked for a meeting with the church management to find out who was behind the booking. Dumi said he discovered the person taking bookings in his name was a former colleague he stopped working with two years ago. “I tried to reach him but all my attempts failed as he has changed his contact details. I tried to get hold of him with the email address the church used but he didn’t respond,” he said. Dumi advised the person to refund all the money he had taken.
