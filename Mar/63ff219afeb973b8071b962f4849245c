Hyundai has recently unleashed a possible Golf R killer locally with the launch of the i30N. This hotty is Hyundai’s first mass-produced high-performance car and it aims to thrill. Its sporty nature is enhanced by the car’s sound from the dual muffler exhaust, featuring the variable exhaust valve system, while the cockpit of the i30N shows key performance parameters through the new instrument cluster and the eight-inch free-floating screen’s modes such as the G-Force meter for live tracking of performance. The i30N certainly looks the racing part and also has stylish 19-inch wheels with Pirelli high-performance tyres and red brake callipers featuring the N-logo. Aggressive bumpers with larger air intakes and a red character line, an aerodynamic rear spoiler with a triangular brake light, and a dual muffler exhaust complete the sleek, sporty look. Designed to deliver pure driving enjoyment, Hyundai says the i30N will send your heartbeats racing. It boasts a top speed of 250km/h and goes from 0-100km/h in just 6.1 seconds. All thanks to the powerful 2,0L turbo-charged engine it develops 202kW of power and generates a mammoth 353Nm torque from 1 500-4 700r/min, reaching a maximum of 378Nm for a brief period when in overboost. Inside the i30N the latest connectivity technology combines with performance analysing software. Entertainment features include smart-device synching through Apple CarPlay and Android Auto to the eight-inch infotainment system.  It’s also packed with all the bells and whistles. The i30N is now on sale at 14 selected Hyundai dealerships in Mzansi. It comes with a seven-year/ 200 000km warranty, roadside assistance for seven years or 150 000km, and five-year/75 000km service plan. ) Price: R679 900
