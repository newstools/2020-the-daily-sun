SOCIAL distancing seemed to be a foreign language to most people during the first day of lockdown. Many were spotted by the SunTeam going about their normal way of life in the streets and malls this morning. In one mall at Verulam, north of Durban, people were in long queues to do shopping. They were close to each other as though theyâ€™ve never heard of social distancing. People didn't stick to the 2m apart from each other rule, as laid down by government to prevent the coronavirus spread. One of the people in the queue said they heard that they mustn't be close to each other but that was impossible as they all want to buy groceries before shops close. She said it was security guards who said they must form the queue because the shop was allowing only 30 customers to shop before others should come to minimise close contact. Another one said the reason why there are so many people was because of the lockdown started when people got paid so they had run out of food at their homes. Spar Supermarket manager Kevin Ramasamy said his staff pleaded with customers to keep 2m apart but they didn't listen. He said the queue outside was caused by only allowing 30 people inside the shop and everyone has to be sanitised before entering the shop.
