THE future of Andile Mbenyane at Chippa United is up in the air. Mbenyane, the longest-serving member, has been slammed by club boss Chippa Mpengesi for abusing his long association with the Chilli Boys. According to reports, Mbenyane is on the list of  five senior players, who have been shown the door. Mpengesi would not confirm that the players, who include Thabo Rakhale and Kurt Lentjies, were on their way out, explaining he was not aware of latest developments as he was in Joburg attending the PSL Board of Governors meeting. But he has blasted Mbenyane for ill-discipline, saying he hasn't done a lot for the club.“He has been with us for 10 years, but he has not even reached 130 games. If you count 30 games times 10 he was supposed to be on at least 300 games,” said Mpengesi. “He has abused the fact that he has been with us for many years. As I said we’ve done a lot for him and he has not done a lot for us.“As much as we love him, the truth must be told that his behaviour is disappointing.” Mpengesi added, however, that the decision wasn’t final and that he was going to engage coach Rhulani Mokwena. “I’m going to engage the coach and perhaps say to him ‘let’s wait until the end of the season’. Im sure he can sit down with the coach and talk,” Mpengesi said. “I don’t think it’s something that can’t be resolved. But if his behaviour is not changing, there is nothing much we can do. "What we are hearing is that there are days like Monday when he doesn’t come to training. "I’m sure these are some of things the coach is not happy with. He has already identified deadwood players. But it is about time Andile pulled up his socks.”
