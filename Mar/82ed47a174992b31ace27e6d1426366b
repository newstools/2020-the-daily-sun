WHEN her uncle promised his 17-year-old niece a job at his carpentry workshop, she didn’t know what lay ahead. When the girl went to her uncle’s workshop in Sibasa near Thohoyandou in Limpopo earlier this month, he allegedly started raping her every night. On Sunday, she reported it to the police. She went to the workshop with Warrant Officer Thinandavha Modau (53) to fetch her belongings, not knowing the horror was about to get worse.
