THE Toyota Corolla sedan has finally landed in Mzansi and it’s set to ruffle a few feathers in the segment. Toyota has officially listed the 12th generation sedan on its website, with all new updated modern styling. I played around with the colour configuration on the site and must say I was impressed with the Crimson Metallic, but knowing South African consumers the glacier and pearl metallic white might become the favorite.

Taste it!: Toyota Yaris GRMN Toyota is known for ecologically-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. But the Japanese manufacturer can do things differently, too. The Yaris GRMN aims to bring the thrills of the rally to performance fans. This Yaris may be small, it packs a wallop. There are currently three versions that are on offer, mainly the 1.8 XS CVT, 2.0 XR and the range topper 2.0 XR CVT. The 1.8 XS CVT come with LED headlights, push-start, cruise control, auto climate control, reverse camera and Toyota’s multi-information display. In order to appeal to the younger generation there’s voice command as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.  The top of the range 2.0 XR CVT comes with all the bells and the whistles, and is powered by the new TNGA 2.0-litre petrol engine. The 2.0-litre petrol engine is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox or the 10-speed continuously variable transmission (CVT) gearbox.
