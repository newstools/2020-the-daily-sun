Last night the third edition of the DStv’s Viewers Choice Awards, hosted by seasoned presenter Minnie Dlamini, took place at the Ticketpro Dome in Joburg. The best highlight of the night must be Warren Masemola’s acceptance speech that left fans tongues waggling. The talented actor began his speech by thanking and acknowledging fellow The River actor Presely Chweneyagae, who was nominated in the same category as him. “You are a star, son,” he exclaimed. The excited star, who has won this award before, went on further to thank everyone who voted for him, his mother who is in hospital and everyone who's in the same ward with his mother at the George Mukhari Academic Hospital.

Speaking to Daily Sun, the amapiano star revealed that she had no idea how much the damage was and chose to leave the stage in respect of the audience at home and industry peers. Furthermore, the star told us a proper wardrobe check was done but as a dancer "you can never know when such incident will happen". “I did a full wardrobe check, but as a performer especially a dancer one can never know when and where an incident as such will happen especially when an outfit is from a trusted designer,” she said. The Suka Emabhozeni hitmaker revealed that she has moved on from last night's incident and she was grateful for those who tweeted and showed some empathy. "As a performer, I have already moved on from last night’s incident and I am in Swaziland for another gig where I delivered an epic performance. Also, I am grateful for the support and I have learned that the show must go on regardless,” she said.
