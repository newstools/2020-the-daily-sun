A WOMAN believes her life is at risk and that she has nowhere to hide. She has been looking over her shoulder since October and all she wants is peace. This is because her addict son has moved from stealing from her and her neighbours to raping dogs. Her neighbours are now gatvol and have threatened to burn down her house. The 49-year-old mum from Fochville, west of Joburg, said four people have so far complained and threatened her. She said her son sometimes disappeared for months. “How am I going to discipline him? They don’t even want to listen to me when I tell them that he’s hardly home. “I hate how my son has turned my own community against me. I don’t know how to handle this.” She said she would sell her house if she had a choice. “I’m tired and too old to be stressing about this child,” she said. She said her son started stealing from her when he was 16. He’s now 20 and things are worse. “I’m scared a mob will one day attack him. I tried disciplining him a long time ago, but I now have no idea what to do.” A 43-year-old resident told Daily Sun she didn’t open a case as she believed the mum could discipline her son. “I’ve known her for years and I felt involving the police was a bit extreme,” said the resident. Constable Elsie Tshonte advised the mum and those whose dogs were raped to open a case.
