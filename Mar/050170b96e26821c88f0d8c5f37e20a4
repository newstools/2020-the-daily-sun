SEXUALLY active young people should have access to condoms for protection from sexually transmitted infections. Teenage pregnancy remains a serious health and social problem in Mzansi. Not only does it pose a health risk to both mother and child, it also has social implications such as continuing the cycle of school drop-outs. A 10,9% of recorded births were to mothers aged 10 to 19 in Mzansi, and 45% of maternal deaths during childbirth were teenagers. Condoms are the only contraceptive method that can protect against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. They are also most effective in preventing HIV transmission, when used during vaginal, oral or anal sex. The most effective results occur when condoms are used consistently. The risk of pregnancy or contracting sexually transmitted infections is greatest when condoms are not used correctly with every sexual act. Consistency and the correct use of condoms ensures 98% effectiveness in preventing pregnancy and prevents 80% to 95% of HIV transmission that would have occurred without condoms. While condoms are not fool-proof, theyâ€™re effective, cheap, easy to use and freely available from public health clinics and hospitals. Although not having any sex is the best way to remain safe, condoms by far offer the best protection for anyone who is sexually active and wants to practise safe sex. Clearly, it is time for South Africans to get over any condom phobia and start taking advantage of the health benefits of this deterrent to HIV/Aids and other common human immuno deficiency-related and sexually transmitted diseases.
