PRASA has bailed out cash-strapped bus company Autopax. Prasa administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo said he had already instructed the release of the much-needed funds to the rail agency’s subsidiary. This comes after the bus company was only able to pay its employees a quarter of their February salaries. “The process to transfer the funds to Autopax and to the employees’ bank accounts is under way,” Prasa spokesman Makhosini Mgitywa said yesterday. This means Autopax employees can expect the balance of their February salaries within a week. Mgitywa said Prasa would make an effort to ensure Autopax employees’ salaries were paid in full, and on the contractually agreed date. “Autopax revenues have dropped sharply as a result of most of the company’s bus fleet falling into a state of disrepair.” He said Prasa was talking to the transport department to have some of its capital expenditure budget changed to operational expenditure. “This will enable Prasa to make outstanding payments to its creditors and suppliers, and to continue providing services to the millions of commuters who depend on it for affordable transportation,” said Mgitywa.
