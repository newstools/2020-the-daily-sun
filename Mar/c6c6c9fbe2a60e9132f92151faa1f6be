Residents of Justicia B Village near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga were on Saturday left shocked after they witnessed two snakes poking. According to residents, the female was facing down while the male was on top.It took the rescue team almost two hours to separate the two snakes that were so tied to each other. Some suspected the poking scene was related to witchcraft as they have never seen such a in their village. But when the rescue team from Bushbuckridge Fire and Rescue arrived, they assured them this was a season for snakes to poke and that they shouldn’t be surprised when they witness such scenes. One of the residents Solon Ndlovu (40) told Daily Sun that everyone in the village was shocked because they haven’t seen such in their village. “At first we suspected witchcraft after we caught the snakes in the early hours of the morning poking. We just stood there and watched until the two snakes moved towards the tree to hide and continued to be tied to each other,” said Ndlovu. “We have previously read about Cockroach Mdluli on Daily Sun rescuing snakes and that’s when we decided to call him.” Cockroach Mdluli and his team arrived and rescued the snakes but it was not an easy job to separate the two. Mdluli said they received a call about the two snakes, and they rushed to attend the situation.“We found them hiding under the mango tree and they were so tied together. It was difficult to separate them, and it took us almost two hours to do so. We had to explain to residents that it was the season for snakes poke and that they shouldn’t be shocked,” he said. “Both snakes were 2 meters long and we took them to the Kruger National Park. We appeal to residents to always contact us when they spot snakes and avoid risking their lives by attempting to kill them as they might get hurt,” Mdluli said.
