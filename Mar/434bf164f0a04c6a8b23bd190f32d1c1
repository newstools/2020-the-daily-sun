Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, has confirmed that a meeting with South African Football Association (SAFA) president Danny Jordaan and Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairperson Irvin Khoza was held to resolve "outstanding issues". Despite the deadly coronavirus outbreak, Mthethwa had given the green light for the PSL to resume behind closed doors. However, prior to the minister's thumbs-up, Jordaan had already issued a statement confirming that matches were suspended indefinitely. There were media reports of animosity between Jordaan and Khoza after a meeting between the two association heads scheduled for Tuesday, 17 March was cancelled by the latter. But Jordaan revealed that despite Mthethwa issuing a go ahead for matches to resume, the final decision had already been made by SAFA. Khoza addressed the same issue by stating that the PSL and SAFA were on the same page and to clear the air, Mthethwa held a meeting with the two association heads on Tuesday, 24 March. "Today I called the meeting between the President of the South African Football Association (Safa) Dr Danny Jordaan and the Chairman of the South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) Dr Irvin Khoza to resolve outstanding issues which have been of great importance recently," said Mthethwa via his official Twitter account. "I sought a commitment from them to work cohesively in unison and I'm pleased that they have committed to addressing matters together before reaching out to government and other stakeholders. Furthermore, they reiterated their resolve to fight the coronavirus pandemic."
