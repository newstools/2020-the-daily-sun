 PITSO Mosimane often frowns
upon those who get emotional. But the Mamelodi Sundowns couldn’t
help but burst with excitement as Keletso Makgalwa netted the winner as they
bundled Highlands Park out of the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal at Makhulong Stadium
on Saturday. The Downs coach ran onto the pitch, joining his players to embrace the youngster. “Ja, you get emotional
when a youngster comes in and scores,” said Mosimane. “I don't run like that to
your Sirinos and them. But I mean Keletso… he’s unbelievable. He’s got that,
you don't give him a chance in the box to face the goals. He can finish. “Highlands is tough hey.
We’re coming back here again in a few days' time. Ja this man-to-man of theirs,
they mark hey. You really have to play out of your skin here. That is why Vila (Sibusiso
Vilakazi) has been playing all the games. I just saw that he must come off,
because I'm saving him for Tuesday.” With one eye on the
Tuesday league showdown with Orlando Pirates, Mosimane rested his key players: Andile
Jali, Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino. And he admitted it was frustrating
watching Highlands take the Brazilians the distance, before they could see them off 1-0 in extra time. He added: “We were just
frustrated because we're spoiled, we always have our combination play, our
movements. But we don't have 'Mshishi' (Zwane), we don't have Sirino and Vila
is loaded with a lot of games. That is what causes the frustrations. “But you’ve got be patient.
We were patient with the team. We knew that we had to be patient and that the
goal would come. We always score you know. I was just praying that we keep zero
behind and the goal would come. “It’s a cup game, who
cares? You just have to move on.”
