Corona virus doesn’t select whether a person is rich or have a higher status in the society and politians are aware of that. Various  MPs including the  Speaker of Parliament Thandi Modise had to queue at the Parliament where they were screening of COVID-19. Speaking to Daily Sun Modise said: “ We have started a campaign of scanning the members, parliament has seven entry points and this is going to be done in all entry points for both the members and the staff of Parliament. We are taking everything are taking every precaution we can to make sure that we contain or avoid and were it is found that any of us has been affected, then that person will be isolated as quickly as possible.”  A group of MPs and staff queue at the entrance of the National Assembly and in Marks building, another screening was taking place. Familiar faces of the people who were on the queue includes ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodine and Cedric Florick. Modise said all members are expected to abide to the screening because it is a national cause. “ It has nothing to do with whether I like it or not, we are taking every precaution,” she added. Modise said Parliament has cancelled all international trips and has discouraged delegations from visiting Parliament.  On Tuesday morning, Modise said they convened a meeting with chief whips from various parties and agreed that they will convene an emergency sitting on Wednesday to pass the Division of Revenue Bill. “ The country needs us to pass the Division of Revenue to get the money to deal with the pandemic, that is what we will do tomorrow as quickly as possible and we will be out of here,” she said. Meanwhile the DA’s chief whip Natasha Mazzone said the DA will be party of the Wednesday meeting but on a reduced capacity. DA leader John Steenhuisen said Parliament should be closed entirely and use technology that allows MPs to work from their constituencies.
