Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela has likened Golden Arrows defender Nkosinathi Sibisi to Italian great Fabio Cannavaro after his man-of-the-match performance against Orlando Pirates. Pirates became the most recent side to find the going tough at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium this season after they were held to a 0-0 draw by Steve Komphela's side. Sibisi is just 1.72 metre tall but like Cannavaro did, makes up for his lack of height with superb anticipation, a fantastic leap and excellent defensive technique, leading Komphela to compare the 24-year-old with the Italian legend. Cannavaro is the last defender to have won the Ballon d'Or (2005) and only one of four defenders in history after Germans Lothar Matthaus, Franz Beckenbauer and Mathias Sammer. "We never saw 'Bhodlela', myself and members of this estate included, we should've long identified this guy," Komphela said in his post-match interview. "This guy is a monster. Sibisi has got all the attributes of a top modern defender. If you are looking for Cannavaro, I'm not exaggerating because one two three, someone is going say he is 1.8 metre, 8.2m, 8.4m or 8.5m. "Okay with that height, the guy has got an unbelievable anticipation, he's got all the mental requirements, personality and character, the right level of stubbornness and he's got unbelievable technique. "He can play with calmness in chaos, and I only hope things work well and that he stays injury-free. South Africa has an asset in this kid. He is something special and he comes from Arrows' MDC. "You know we played a match where there was high pressure [against Pirates] and he just touched the ball. "Where have you seen a defender under pressure not clearing the ball like Steve Komphela and going out like Lucas Radebe, passing the ball to a teammate to come out? "That's top class and you don't find that in young kids. This guy is something special." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
