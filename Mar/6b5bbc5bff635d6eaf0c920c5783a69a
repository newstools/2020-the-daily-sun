ARTISTS are demanding Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa to go to Sars and pay them according to their scale. This comes after Mthethwa announced that a sum of R150 million was set aside to subsidise artists during the lockd own. But the announcement was met with anger by the industry. The artists claimed the minister was not honest about the allocation and, as a result, believe the money won’t go into the right hands. Musician Sbongile Mngoma said: “There is no clarity on how we are going to apply for these funds.” Actress and director Xolile Tshabalala told Daily Sun: “He failed to give a detailed criteria for these funds. “As a result, most artists will not get this money. If these funds are to be allocated fairly and equally, the minister must go to Sars and get a list of all the artists and pay us according to our scales. Otherwise he must pay all artists a standard rate.” Playwright and director Edmund Mhlongo said the minister failed the industry. “I say this because the funds are only for the events that were in partnership with government. It has nothing to do with the rest of the artists,” said Edmund. President of Cultural and Creative Industries Federation of South Africa Joy Mbewana said: “We welcome the minister’s announcement. “We understand not everyone will be happy. “We need to be realistic that not everyone is going to get money. “Our priority should be up-andcoming artists.” Arts and culture said the money is for producers, organisers, projects and department beneficiaries.
