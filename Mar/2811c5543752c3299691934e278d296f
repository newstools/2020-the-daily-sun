MARITZBURG United could lose influential midfielder Tebogo Tlolane when his short-term contract expires at the end of Absa Premiership season. Tlolane played a key role to help the KwaZulu-Natal side occupy fifth spot on the league table since he joined them on a six month loan deal from Orlando Pirates in January. He has been present in Eric Tinkler’s starting line-up, contributing in goals, with his latest coming in their 3-0 trashing of rookies Stellenbosch FC in a league game on 28 February. But his chances of getting regular game-time at Bucs were slim, having played a mere nine minutes in their 1-0 win over struggling AmaZulu prior to his departure to Maritzburg. According to a reliable source, United boss Farook Kadodia and Pirates management have been locked in a series of meetings in a bid to sign the 25-year-old player on a permanent basis. Said the source: “Maritzburg want to exercise the buying clause on Tlolane’s contract since he has played a key role to help swing matches in their favour. But for the move to materialise, Pirates want their first choice goalkeeper Richard Ofori and central defender Rushine De Reuck, plus they have also offered them cash.” But Kadodia has rubbished this by insisting they won’t lose their key players to any club in the PSL. He went on: “There is no talks about any player leaving and not talks about signing players. It’s only false stories created in the public.” Whether Kadodia will abide by his utterances remains to be seen, as he made a U-turn on two occasions. In the 2017-18 season, he said nobody will leave the club, only to release striker Evans Rusike to join SuperSport in January 2018. After the club retained their PSL status via the promotion/relegation play-offs last season, Kadodia made a similar statement, but he sold his midfield duo of Fortune Makaringe and Siphesihle Ndlovu to Pirates.
