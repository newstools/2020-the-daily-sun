Members of the Blitzboks will be tested for the coronavirus after it was feared that they might have been exposed while at the Los Angeles and Vancouver Sevens tournaments. The decision to test members of the team was as a result of the fact that two members of the Australian Sevens team had tested positive for the virus. South Africa won the Los Angeles round of the Sevens World Series and finished fourth in Canada. Rugby, like all sport around the globe has been severely hit by the pandemic. On Saturday, SANZAAR announced that the 2020 Super Rugby tournament would be suspended "for the foreseeable future" following the conclusion of all the matches in Round 7. "The safety and welfare of the public, our players and other stakeholders is paramount and as previously stated we were always going to abide by government and health authority instructions on the issue of Covid-19 containment," commented SANZAR CEO Andy Marinos. On Sunday, it was announced that all Varsity Cup matches for this week have been postponed while various Easter school rugby festivals around the country have also been cancelled.
