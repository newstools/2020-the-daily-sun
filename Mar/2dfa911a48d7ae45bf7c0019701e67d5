Simon Phihlela (43) went down in a hail of bullets in Seshego, in front of commuters, on Wednesday. Selby’s widow Thabitha (41) told Daily Sun two armed men broke into their home. “I woke Selby up and he went to check. “Immediately after he opened our bedroom door, it started raining bullets. “In a split second Selby was lying dead in the doorway, in a pool of blood. “They were there to kill him. The last shots were in his head.” She said they shot him four times! Simon’s nephew Chuene Phihlela (27), a taximan, said there were nine holes on the windscreen of his taxi. “He was a quiet person who would not start a fight with anyone,” he said. “I’m scared and don’t think I’ll return to work anytime soon.” Association chairman Solly Ledwaba was not sure if the murders were related. “We condemn the killings,” he said. “We’re conducting internal investigations to find out what really happened.” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said two murder cases were being investigated. “The suspects in both cases are still at large.” Police had launched a manhunt and believed they’d make arrests soon.
