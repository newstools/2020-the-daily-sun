Lately it seems as if Netflix has found a market in Africa. After debuting last year on Netflix Agent, a 13-part South African drama series, is about to make another debut but this time on our small screens on SABC1. Agent sees former Uzalo actor Kay Sibiya taking on the role of Slindile "Blaze" Magoba. He's a former professional football player whose career ended prematurely after an injury. He then became a football agent who is passionate about his clients. The excited actor took to his Instagram page to share the news that he will be back on TV after his departure from SABC1’s popular soapie Uzalo. Catch the star-studded drama series which features Pamela Nomvete, Sisanda Henna, Zweli Dube and Lesego Moleko every Sunday on SABC1 9.30pm starting from the 8th of March.
