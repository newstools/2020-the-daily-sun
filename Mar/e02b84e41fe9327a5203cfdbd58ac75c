AMAKHANKATHA and iingcibi are furious with the Eastern Cape government’s decision to suspend circumcision and imgidi. The suspension comes in the wake of the Eastern Cape registering its first case of Covid-19, a woman who had travelled to Germany. Mike Kopisani of the Kampala initiation school in St Albans, near Port Elizabeth, said he was shocked and angry at the move. “We were never consulted. We were not even told how to fight this virus at initiation schools. “This past weekend I had seven appointments with parents of boys who want to be circumcised in June,” he said. Pula Lenako, chairman of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Ulwaluko Forum, said: “There’s no time for consultation when death has arrived. Lives are at risk here and we should all heed the call. “The House of Traditional Leaders, the government and our forums will meet on Monday (today) to discuss a way forward on how to deal with the coronavirus.” Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana said he was also shocked. “We were all shocked but relieved after a meeting with Traditional Affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha. He said the suspension only applied to March and April circumcisions. “We’ll sit down with the MEC to monitor this virus. We’ll ask for circumcisions to resume in winter.” Nonkonyana said there were already reported cases of illegal initiation schools this season. “We’ve sent teams to Chris Hani, Komani, OR Tambo and Port St John’s to rescue boys after we received reports there were illegal circumcision schools in those districts,” he said.
