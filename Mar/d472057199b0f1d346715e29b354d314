THE suspension of leagues around the world till further notice due to the Coronavirus means athletes and sports fanatics have a lot of time on their hands. And will they do with all that time?Well, some players have been spending a lot of it exercising in the comfort of their own homes and sharing the videos on social media. Some have even gotten involved in a social media challenge, the #StayAtHomeChallenge. Players record themselves juggling a toilet paper roll and then share the videos on their social media pages. They then challenge another player to do the same. Itumeleng Khune, Khama Billiat, Siphelele Mkhulise and many more soccer players have taken part. Football fanatics around the world have also taken part in the challenge.  #StayAtHomeChallenge Thereâ€™s a tissue challenge doing rounds and I was challenged by @khamabilliat and I did it???? ended it with #Distribution101 ????????
