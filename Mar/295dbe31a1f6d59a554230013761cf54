The season for shifts and movements in the Mzansi radio space is upon us. In the next few weeks, various radio stations, particularly commercial ones, will announce major changes to their line-ups. A number of radio personalities have already left their slots. These include Thando Thabethe, who quit her 5FM job two weeks ago, and Umhlobo Wenene FM’s Siphiwo “Spitch” Nzawumbi, who resigned last week. However, last week the SABC announced it had decided not to make any changes to the line-ups of many of its radio stations this year. The stations that will not be affected by changes are Ukhozi FM, Thobela FM, RSG, Umhlobo Wenene FM, Lotus FM and Phalaphala FM. SABC group executive of radio Nada Wotshela said the decision was informed by “healthy gains in listenership figures”. “This also serves as an indication that the strategies that have been put in place continue to ensure that SABC Radio remains the crest of the airwaves,” Wotshela said. “We’re also confident that the stability of some of our radio stations will yield positive results.” South Africa’s most-listened to radio station, Ukhozi FM, boasts more than 7, 6 million listeners. According to Wotshela, further announcements regarding the SABC’s other radio stations will be made during the course of next week.
