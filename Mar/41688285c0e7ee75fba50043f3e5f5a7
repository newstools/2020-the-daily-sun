YOU usually hear kids reading out loud in school corridors. But at Joe Slovo Primary School in New Kwadwesi, Nelson Mandela Bay, the sound of bleating goats drowns everything out. Since last Monday, gatvol parents have been preventing the school from operating, demanding a fence. READ: I HATE LOBOLA! Although the education department has condemned the protest, parents became more angry on Sunday when a body was found on the premises. Parents have asked community leaders to intervene in the matter.   They’ve vowed not to allow kids back to school until it’s made safe. Parent and ward committee member Ncedile Soxujwa told Daily Sun: “We visited the Uitenhage district education offices on Monday. The officials told us they were scared to come last week because the R75 Uitenhage Road was closed by protesters. “They promised they’d organise a meeting this week with the district director and inform him of our school’s needs.” He said they didn’t feel good about closing the school.
