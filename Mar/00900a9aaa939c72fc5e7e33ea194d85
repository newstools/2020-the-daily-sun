A MAN has lodged a court application opposing the establishment of a medical facility to quarantine people with coronavirus. In the application filed in the high court, Roger Stringer, a resident of Mt Pleasant suburb in Harare, protested against the renovation and upgrading of Rock Foundation Medical Facility. According to media reports, the facility is being turned into an isolation centre for admitting and managing people suffering from the virus. Stringer, who lives near the facility, is fearful he’s being exposed to a greater risk of contracting the Covid-19, should the facility admit patients. He argues that his right to an environment that is not harmful to his health or well-being is about to be violated. He believes no measures were put in place to protect residents. Stringer said the government could make use of some established facilities for infectious diseases, such as Wilkins Hospital and Beatrice Road Infectious Diseases Hospital. Zimbabwe will embark on a 21-day lockdown effective today. The country has confirmed seven cases of the virus and one death. – CAJ NEWS
