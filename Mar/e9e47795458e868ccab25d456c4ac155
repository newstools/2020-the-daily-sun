The Minister of Social Development, Lindiwe Zulu has been slammed for making light of coronavirus. This comes after the minister took to Instagram on Saturday to post that she was struggling to stay at home and that the coronavirus must go away. As a result, the Democratic Alliance has since called for President Ramaphosa to reprimand Minister Zulu for the reckless video. The DA’s Shadow Minister of Social Development, Bridget Masango said it would not be fair if the minister’s comments go unpunished. “The minister’s comments contradicted the measures and recommendations that her department announced for the collection of social grants,” she said. “The department has discouraged grant recipients from collecting their grants on the first day of payment and will ensure that no more than 100 people are served at a time at SASSA and Post Offices,” Masango added. Masango said the minister’s comments were wholly irresponsible and reckless. “South Africa is gripped in a crisis due to the outbreak of coronavirus in our country. As such, we require responsible leadership, especially from those in public office,” she said. The minister’s comments come after President Cyril Ramaphosa asked the country to practice social distancing in a bid curb the widespread of the disease. Minister Zulu took to the same platform to apologise for her actions. In a statement, Zulu said she was frustrated by the effect the virus has on the economy. “I hereby wish to apologise to South Africa for this video’s content. As the President and my Ministerial colleagues have said, we should not panic but take precaution and understand the severity of the situation,” she said. She reiterated her commitment to the recent safety precautions announced by the president. "My statement does not in any way seek to undermine the severity of the virus,” she added.
