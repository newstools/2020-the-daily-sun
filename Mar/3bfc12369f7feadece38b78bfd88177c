HER baby died at Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, after birth. But Zandile Nzolo (21) from Duduza didn’t get the chance to give her a dignified funeral. The baby’s body was allegedly burnt in the hospital furnace along with medical waste. READ: CASH VAN IN MY YARD! Daily Sun published the story on 6 February. At the time Zandile told the People’s Paper she wasn’t convinced her baby’s body was really burnt. She said nurses had apologised and told her the baby was mistakenly wrapped along with soiled material during cleaning time and thrown into the furnace to burn. Yesterday, Tsakane residents marched to the hospital demanding justice for Zandile and her baby. “We want the hospital to be held accountable for what happened. “It should pay,” said resident Nonkululeko Dlame (40). Another resident said what the hospital did was horrible. “If they’re not held accountable for this, it means they’ll continue doing it. They must face the music,” said the resident. Zandile said she was not coping well since her loss. “I’m always sick. This has taken a toll on me. Worse of all, we’re not getting any help from the hospital,” she said. “I’m struggling. I can’t even eat. This will kill me, too.” READ: I HATE LOBOLA! Her mum Tonono (59) said it was still hard for the family to come to terms with her grandchild’s death.
