SCATHAMIYA group Thee Legacy are eyeing the world stage. The group apparently has been spotted by international producer Mitch Goldstein, who manages Ladysmith Black Mambazo. He told Daily Sun he would like to work with them. “I know Thee Legacy and I’ve listened to their songs. “I’ve briefly met group leader Jabulani Mthembu and we spoke. Nothing is official as yet. All I can say is that I love their music, and it would be an honour to work with them.” Jabulani said that there had been unofficial talks with Mitch. “We do talk, especially when Ladysmith Black Mambazo is having performances or tours. “We often open their shows or perform alongside them. “I can’t confirm that Mitch wants to work with Thee Legacy. I guess it would be too soon to comment about that.” He said the group would be very happy to work with Mitch. “It would be a blessing to work with Mitch. “He has an ear for good music and his work is known across the globe. “Working with him would also put us on an international level, which has always been our dream. “We’re young and vibrant and appeal to the youth, so we’d really like to reach the international level. In the meantime, we shall concentrate on our work.”
