JOZEF Vukusic’s future with AmaZulu will rely heavily on results. The Usuthu coach was suspended on 3 March by management for internal matters they could not reveal to the public. His assistant Ayanda Dlamini has been at the helm on an interim basis. He proved his worth when he guided the club to cause a major upset when they beat Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match a fort night ago. Sunsport has reliably learnt that if Dlamini continues to yield results then management will negotiate a settlement with Vukusic at the end of season. But if Dlamini fails to get the much needed three points in their next league game when the season resumes then Vukusic’s suspension will be lifted and he will be reinstated. According to an insider, Vukusic’s huge salary estimated at R250 000 a month is allegedly the main stumbling block to terminate his contract. Said the Source: “AmaZulu management could have negotiated his settlement and given him a six month’ salary in advance a per contract agreement. But the main problem is that Vukusic want to be paid the remainder of his three-year deal. Therefore, management doesn’t have a choice but to pay him his monthly salary while thinking about an amicable solution as he is still on special leave.”
