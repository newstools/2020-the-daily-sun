Coronavirus has been detected in more than 30 countries around the world. I believe this is a serious disease that is not been given enough attention by the world in general. All the countries should rise and unite against this virus. The Chinese are a very smart nation, but they haven’t found the cure or a vaccine for this deadly virus. Robust measures should be put in place by all countries. We need to seal all the borders of countries with confirmed cases. Yes, the economy will suffer, but we might end up with no economy at all. This virus is real and is spreading like wildfire. Viruses are relatively hard to cure, and they can hibernate on a host for some time before detection. Africa cannot afford to control the virus. It’s time to quarantine the sick and seal the borders, or it’s the end of the world as we know it today.
