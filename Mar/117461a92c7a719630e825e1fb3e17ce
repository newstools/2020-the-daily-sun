WHEN the diphiri were fazed out in their village in 2013, many families refused to pay the R100 annual fee that was instituted. The Kekae family was one of the families at Dikgokgopeng Village in Bakenburg outside Mokopane, Limpopo, who wouldn’t pay. And when their son Isaac (59) died a month ago, they buried him in their own backyard. They believed it was against their tradition to hire individuals to dig graves instead of traditional grave diggers. The family was told to either pay a R1 000 fine or they’d won’t be allowed to bury him at the local cemetery. As a result, Isaac spent three weeks in the mortuary as his family begged traditional leaders to allow them to bury him. Isaac’s father Pitrus Kekae (80) said fazing out culture was undermining the forefathers. “We never paid to bury anybody,” he said. Isaac’s mother Desia Kekae (76) said: “It’s a shame. We have other family members who were buried in the same graveyard where Isaac was supposed to be laid to rest.” Raizer Baloyi (59) said he was forced to pay a R500 fine in 2015 to bury his wife Martha. Anna Minisi also paid a R500 fine in 2015 to bury her mkhulu, and a further R1 000 fine to bury her son last year. Chief Malesela Dikgale, chairman of the provincial House of Traditional Leaders, said in 2015 he went to the village to try and help them resolve their issues, but the two groups were not willing to compromise. Local headman Dan Rakumako refused to comment.
