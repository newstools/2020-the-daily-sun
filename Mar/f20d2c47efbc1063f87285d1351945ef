  FOR years feminist Bomi Shinga has been vocal about her hatred of the lobola practice. Last week she spoke about her point of view on Moja Love TV’s Umphakathi, sparking heated debate on social media. Speaking to Daily Sun in Midrand in Joburg yesterday, she said: “I hate lobola. A woman is reduced to nothing but merchandise that makes babies. “A husband has the right to ask for a refund if you have a factory fault such as inability to bear children.” The feminist said African culture practises human trafficking. “There’s money involved and a whole human being is treated like property. She is expected to do certain duties based on the fact that she was paid for,” she said. But cultural expert Nonkosi Khabazela said Bomi has misunderstood the practice. “It’s a way for the groom’s family to thank the bride’s family for giving them a makoti,” he said. On the Daily Sun website, some people agreed with Bomi while others disagreed.
