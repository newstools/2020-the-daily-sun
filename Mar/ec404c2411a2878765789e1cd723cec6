IT WAS an order from the South African Military Generals that there Ranch Hotel in Polokwane will be used as quarantine spot for the 121 South Africans who will be repatriated from China. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said that they had no influence over the decision making of the hotel in Limpopo to be used as quarantine site. It is an instruction from the soldiers that this hotel in Polokwane is a perfect site for the isolation of people who are coming from China. I knew about this on Saturday where a report was sent to me from the Military. The Premier Stan Mathabatha was also told about this on Monday. "We allowed the army space to deal with the planning because they are the ones running this show. We didn't know of other plans until they informed us that they are ready to deal with the matter. He said.  Mkhize who led the Inter-Ministerial Committee was addressing the Media on their state of readiness at the hotel ahead of the arrival of the repatriates. Security at the hotel is also tight as soldiers and police have been deployed to patrol the area. Starting from today (Thursday) no one will be allowed to come in or go outside the hotel only, the workers who volunteered to work during the 21 days of quarantine period will be making the movements. Minister Mkhize has urged people in Limpopo not to panic because the 121 South Africans from China are not sick or infected of the Coronavirus but brought here for quarantine period.They are expected to land in Polokwane tomorrow (Friday). Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma the Minister for Cooperative Governance Human Settlement and Traditional Affairs said that there is a Life Cover Policy from Momentum that all workers volunteered during this period will be covered. We are glad that during our meeting with them today they understood that working at the hotel during this period isnt compulsory and happy to be part of the team that will be taking care of our people. she said.
