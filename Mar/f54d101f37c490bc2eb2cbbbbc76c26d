For the past few days, actor Sibonile Ngubane has been hinting that he might return to Uzalo. This follows his abrupt departure late last year from the SABC1 popular soapie, in which he played the character of Khathaza, a psychotic serial killer who was after Nkunzi (Masoja Msiza). In response to fans asking for the return of Khathaza, Sibonile took to Instagram and shared a video that revealed that the “ghost” is coming. “The ghost you've all been begging for will be on your screens. Nyweee Nyweee 'Sibonile Ngubane is fired from Uzalo' my foot,” he wrote. In the video the actor can be seen with on-screen enemy Masoja, who exclaims "Asikaqedi!" when telling fans about the return of Khathaza. This can be loosely translated to: "We're not done". Sibonile is set to appear on the 6th season of the show. Speaking to Daily Sun, the soapie’s public relations officer Nomfundo Zondi was not forthcoming about whether the character will make a return to the show or not. “I cannot confirm or deny whether he will be making a return to the show,” she said.
