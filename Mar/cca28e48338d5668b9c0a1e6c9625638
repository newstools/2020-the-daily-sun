Tripoli, Libya ~ THERE is alarm over the 600 migrants that have been declared missing in a Libyan detention centre following their rescue from the Mediterranean Sea since earlier this year. The migrants were returned from the sea to a Tripoli facility. The International Organisation for Migration expressed concern at the whereabouts of the migrants reportedly missing from the facility run by the government through the Ministry of Interior. “We’ve received no response from Libyan authorities who were asked to clarify the fate of those reported missing,” the organisation said. It renewed its call to the international community to establish a clear and quick disembarkation mechanism to end the return and detention of vulnerable people . Libya’s coast guard has returned over 2 500 people this year. – CAJ NEWS
