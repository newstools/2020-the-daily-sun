GOSPEL heavyweight Sipho “Big Fish” Makhabane has been praying for the end of road carnage. This has for many years formed part of hispre-Easter Weekend Prayer sessions. But he got a rude awakening when he was involved in a car accident himself on Friday morning in Houghton, north of Jozi. Big Fish said he was on his way to a meeting in Rosebank for the preparation of this year’s show, scheduled for 4 April in Mbombela stadium. According to the gospel music icon, his car got bumped into while he was waiting for traffic light to turn green. Said Big Fish: “I was behind another car when I realised through my rear-view mirror that the car that was coming behind me was speeding. “And at the rate it was coming, there was no way he was going stop.” Big Fish said he pulled his hand break. He told the SunTeam the car hit him from the back and that resulted in his car hitting the car in front. “Luckily, no one was hurt in the chaos. I tried to talk to the guy who bumped into my car and he was so nervous,” he said. “Imagine, this accident happened only four weeks before the big prayer in Mbombela stadium. This is the kind of accident that made us to start the pre-Easter weekend prayer in the first place, to help end road accidents, and this happens to me,” he said. This is not the first time Makhabane has been involved in a car accident. In 2014, he was involved in a near-fatal accident in Mpumalanga and had to be hospitalised for more than three months. This time around, he escaped unharmed. “The devil is a liar,” he said. “We’re going ahead with the preparations.” This year’sline-up includes Sbu Noah, Thobekile, Israel Mosehle, Takie Ndou, Shongwe, Khuphuka and a guest appearance by Bishop I Makamu.
