STEVE Lekoelea was a darling of the Orlando Pirates die-hard supporters in the 10 years that he spent at the Buccaneers. He was such a favourite because he was tiny but full of dribbling tricks...supporters even composed songs about him. He is now 41 years old. He was 15 years when he made his professional debut for Moroka Swallows in 1995, playing under the name of Steve Motsiri at the time, before Pirates pounced on his signature. Besides his amazing, silky dribbling skills and step-overs, Lekoelea was known for his dangerous, curling free-kicks that left many goalkeepers catching thin air. He was also part of the famous AmaGlug-Glug squad that defeated Brazil at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. He even scored the winning goal in that match. After a tiff with the Pirates bosses, he left and joined Maritzburg United and later Platinum Stars, and that's how his once-blossoming career came to an end.
