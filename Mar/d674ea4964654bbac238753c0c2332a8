 Limpopo
police in Dennilton outside Groblersdal have launched a manhunt for unknown
attackers after the discovery of three bodies burnt beyond recognition on
Sunday. According
to provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, police
suspected that the deceased were severely assaulted in the bush around Naganeng
village before they were burnt. He said several stones were found around the
scene. Police were
informed about the incident by a passer-by and went to the scene with the
emergency medical services. Upon
arrival, they discovered the bodies of three men aged 20 to 31 burnt beyond
recognition and a burnt-out Hyundai truck next to them. The motive
for the brutal killings is still being investigated but a mob attack cannot be
ruled out, said Mojapelo. The
deceased were identified as Owen Ncube, 31, Salos Sithole, 23, and Lovemore
Basera, 20. "Police
are now investigating three counts of murder," said Mojapelo. Limpopo
police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has strongly condemned the
incident and has instructed police to hunt down the killers and bring them to
book. SOURCE:
