Bidvest Wits head coach Gavin Hunt admits his criticism of defender Sifiso Hlanti was unfair and too harsh. The Clever Boys boss slammed the left-back after the 2-0 defeat to SuperSport United at the end of February, claiming that his performances had not been up to the required standard. However, Hunt has since cooled down and admits he was wrong to be so aggressive in his criticism and will not react like that again. "Maybe I shouldn't have reacted the way I reacted but sometimes you need a flair-up to make a statement," Hunt told the media. "Sometimes it's talk, talk, maybe it's another way of doing it. I was wrong but I mean would I do it again? No, I don't think so." "But things happen in football. He knows we can't keep hiding, you know what I mean?" he added. "Mistakes have been made but he has been magnificent in the last three games. "Maybe I've gotten him back where he should be. But no, I was wrong." - TEAMtalk media
