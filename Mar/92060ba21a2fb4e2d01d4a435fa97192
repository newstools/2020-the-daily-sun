MINISTER Patricia de Lille has provided the social development department with buildings to use as shelters for abused women. The public works and infrastructure minister, along with Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said in Parliament on Wednesday the government was committed to ending gender-based violence. “We say to women, you can walk away from an abusive relationship and that’s why we want to make safe houses available across the country to help our women,”said De Lille. The buildings to be used as shelters are on the Garden Route, in the Karoo, on the West Coast and two are in the Joburg area. Zulu said she was grateful De Lille joined hands with her department to provide shelters. “Our mandate is to provide a lifeline to survivors when they take the bold decision to leave a violent or abusive relationship.” She said they were already working on the Khuseleka One-Stop Centre to provide care and support services for women, children and all other victims of crime and violence. Zulu said often victims of gender-based violence or murder were trapped in abusive relationships, because they had nowhere to go. De Lille said the killing of women and kids was happening despite being spoken about every day. “Government needs the help of the private sector, society, community-based organisations and residents to deal with this scourge.” She said Gauteng, Western Cape and KZN were violence hot spots and they have set aside R380 000 to upgrade the safe houses.
