WE HAVE a duty to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the COVID-19. But we also have to take care of the elderly who are the most vulnerable people with chronic diseases such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. No one is safe and information shows that your risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age. CareChamp’s co-founder, Sylvia Klopper, shared these tips on how to care for our elderly: Remain calm Try not to panic and make sure to cover the basics. Try to keep elders away from following non-stop news updates. Protect your own health Follow official guidelines by washing your hands regularly with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, keeping your hands away from your face, and avoiding close contact with anyone who is sick. Practise social distancing Slow the spread among family members by washing your hands and clothes as soon as you get home, regularly disinfecting communal areas and keeping physical affection to a minimum. Limit visitors It’s best to limit all but essential visits. Encourage would-be visitors to rather maintain contact via the phone or video chats. Stick to a routine Encourage your loved ones to get up, get dressed and make their bed. Create healthy habits Getting outdoors is good for your immune system. If your loved one is hesitant to go outside, then open windows to encourage airflow.
