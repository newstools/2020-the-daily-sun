THERE will be no Moria Pilgrimage at the Zion Christian Church members this Easter. The tough decision to cancel the Church's annual Easter pilgrimage comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa call that gatherings of more than 100 people are prohibited as a measure to curb the spread of Coronavirus. In the statement released by the church and signed by ten members of the church council tonight, also the next weekend of 28 - 29 March 2020 there will be no Mokhukhu and choirs including Sunday School gatherings until further notice. The church leaders further alluded that they will keep their church members  updated if there are any changes. Every year more than 3 million Masione from various parts of Southern Africa, including South Africa, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, gather at the church’s headquarters in Moria City,  outside Polokwane in  Limpopo. The gathering is one of the largest and usually which leaves all local roads in Limpopo with serious traffic conjunction when going into the church, also leaving the church on the last day.
