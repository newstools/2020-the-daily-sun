A TEENAGER accused of the brutal murder of Thorisho Themane (28) was killed on Saturday night. Tiisetso Mphahlele (15) was stabbed to death at a tavern in Seshego zone 1 outside Polokwane, Limpopo, and was buried at Silicon Cemetery yesterday. His family apparently kept his murder a secret and buried him quickly. Mphahlele, also known as Beast, was among nine teens and two adults due to appear in the Limpopo High Court in June for the murder of Themane. A mourner told Daily Sun: “He was with his gang at a tavern and they left him behind by accident. “When they returned, he was lying in a pool of blood.” Mphahlele was thrown out of Flora Park Primary in 2018 after he was bust for murder. After he was released on bail, he was admitted to St Gregory Junior Secondary. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a 17-year-old suspect was bust on the night of the murder. “He appeared in the Seshego Magistrates Court on Monday.”
