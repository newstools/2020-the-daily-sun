A COUPLE from Philippi in Browns Farm, Cape Town, has taken the lockdown and social distancing rules to the next level. They practise social distancing in their sitting room . . . And in the bedroom as well! Nomfaniso Sylvia (49) and her husband Michael Kendle (61) have agreed to sleep in different rooms until the lockdown ends. They even suspended sex in their house for the next three weeks – they won’t budge even if the lockdown is extended. 5 PEOPLE QUARATINED IN ALEXANDRA KASI Nomfaniso said: “Since we’re in separate beds, nobody crawls to another’s bed to ask for sex. “We decided to put the beds in different rooms. Social distancing includes no sex. We agreed there’s no compromise on that.” Nomfaniso said they were taking the call to fight Covid-19 seriously. “We’re following what the president asked us to do,” said Sylvia. “We’re maintaining social distancing and want to make sure nobody gets coronavirus in this house.

We’re just taking serious precautions.” She said they no longer ate together and she left her husband’s meals near the stove. Michael said he didn’t have a problem with the new setup. He said he sometimes went out to work and didn’t know whether he was carrying the virus or not. “We’re all co-operating because we don’t want to infect each other,” he said. MAN SUES GOVT OVER COVID-19 “Nobody knows if they have it until they’re sick, but if we stay away from each other for three weeks we’ll know whether we’re sick or not.” Nomfaniso said the virus was deadlier than Aids. “Aids has medication and this one doesn’t,” she said. “With HIV, you know the process of getting infected, but with this one it just happens when you least expect it.” Michael said they still loved each other and had been married for 29 years.
