TROUBLE seems to be following ANC MP Boy Mamabolo. This time he has found himself in hot water with the law after the Seshego Magistrates Court authorised his warrant of arrest after he failed to arrive in court on Friday. Mamabolo was expected to appear before court together with EFF Limpopo leader Jossey Buthane, Alfred Magongoa, Obakeng Makhura, EFF councillor Oupa Ramaphoko and Motladi Setsiba on charges of malicious damage to property and theft. He said he submitted reasons why he couldn’t make it to court through his lawyers.

We filed documents to court to inform them that I would be absent on that day. “I know about the warrant of arrest issued against me. It’s not an immediate one, it will be effective after 14 days and besides, the police have my address to arrest me if it is immediate,” he said. NPA spokeswoman in Limopopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, said Mamabolo’s lawyers told the court he was sick and wouldn’t be able to make it to court. “The court has authorised the warrant of arrest against Mamabolo, however it will stay until his next court appearance next time. He will be arrested and charged if he fails to come to court then,” she said.
