SA's beloved beauty and lifestyle influencer Mihlali Ndamase has shared her first-time experiences with her subbies and some people think it was TMI. Ndamase, who has over 200K subscribers on Youtube, detailed her first sex experience and how painful it was. On speaking on the experience, Mihlali says "it was really sore". "It was painful as f***. Also, this guy was really tall, he was huge, so it was like... big," she added."And I also feel like, during the whole thing there wasn't necessarily any [attempt] at making me feel comfortable. So obviously the experience was very painful... it was actually very excruciatingly painful," she explained.
