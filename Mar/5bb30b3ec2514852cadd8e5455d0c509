Ilhaam Benjamin has been selling flowers on Cape Town’s Adderley Street for over 40 years. The famous market has remained operational through riots and protests over the decades, but, on Friday, it, too, will shut down as the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus takes effect. "The lockdown came as a shock,” Benjamin told News24 on Tuesday. “I don’t know how I’m going to feed my eight children, but I guess we will survive. We always survive. A loss can be covered - a death can’t be covered. We are going to have to throw away all these flowers that must still be paid for, but I’d rather lose money than see someone die." Mixed feelings South Africans expressed mixed feelings about the lockdown, but most people News24 spoke to on the streets of Cape Town said while they were expecting difficult days ahead, the situation warranted drastic measures. Cellphone and accessories trader Zahid Raja said the next three weeks would be tough, but worth it. "It’s bad, but if we look inside to our humanity then we must just do this lockdown." Barbershop owner Kelvin Samat, however, said while he recognised the need to put public safety first, he was not at all happy with the lack of information on where small businesses could access relief to prevent them from having to close shop. "If we don’t work, there’s no pay. I don’t even know how we are going to pay the rent. I don’t know where to go for help."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/id-rather-lose-money-than-see-someone-die-cape-town-businesses-brace-for-the-lockdown-20200324
