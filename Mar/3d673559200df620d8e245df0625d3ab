THIS lockdown period must not be treated as a holiday but as an opportunity to catch up on studies. These were the words of Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande. He was speaking at the update on the status of the national lockdown in Tshwane on Saturday by ministers in the National Command Council. Nzimande was joined by Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu, Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and Basic Education Minister Angie Motshega. Nzimande said he had instructed all universities to update their IT capability so they could expand online learning. He said the 14-day quarantine period for the 114 South African citizens repatriated from Wuhan City in China ended on Friday. He said the Department of Health was working on their release. “The department is responsible for transporting students to their provinces and to ensure they’re reunited with families. Transportation will start on Monday (today).” He said all NSFAS recipients would receive their allowances during the lockdown. Zulu said she had contacted the transport and defence departments to help transport those who would be collecting their social grants. She urged mums to leave children at home when collecting grants. Sisulu said most of the 41 000 water tanks obtained would go to the Eastern Cape. She said squatter camps were difficult to access so they could be disinfected.
