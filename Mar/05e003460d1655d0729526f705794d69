PREMIER Stan Mathabatha said locals couldn’t decide they didn’t want people from other provinces to be quarantined in in Limpopo. He reminded them they, too, had been transferred and treated elsewhere. He said the decision to quarantine South Africans – evacuated from Wuhan in China – in Limpopo wasn’t received in good faith and there had been a degree of panic. “Coronavirus is a reality and a world pandemic. Let’s deal with it the way we’re dealing with HIV and TB. This is for the future of children,” he said. He said people quarantined at the Ranch Hotel were not infected by the virus. “If one of them is found to have been infected, the army will take that person to the relevant place,” he said. He urged ANC members who claim party treasurer Danny Msiza owns The Ranch to stop gossiping. The 121 evacuees landed safely at Polokwane International Airport on Saturday morning. They were taken to the hotel, where they will be quarantined for 21 days. A large number of soldiers and police have been sent to the hotel to patrol and no one will be allowed to go into the hotel for the next 21 days. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba visited Charis Missionary Church in Polokwane yesterday. She warned church members to wipe off their microphones and clean the pulpits more often during their services. She advised churches to avoid hugging and shaking hands when greeting. “Rather say Hallelujah!” said Ramathuba.
