GOGO Khanyisa Kheswa takes her calling to be a sangoma very seriously and does all she can to protect her community. She told Daily Sun when she treated clients for sexually transmitted infections, she gave them condoms to prevent the problem from cropping up again. “When they come to me for help and I see they have an STD, I will refer them to the clinic and give them condoms. “I have realised lots of them have the same problem repeatedly because they don’t use condoms. I went to the local clinic to get some condoms there,” she said. The 57-year-old from Gugulethu in Cape Town said people even went to her place when they needed condoms.  “I just make sure I don’t give them to young kids because they play around with them,” she said. Siphiwe Nombakuse (44), who runs a shebeen in the area, said his patrons knew they could get condoms at the gogo’s place. He said to avoid them having to go there in the middle of the night, he took a box from the gogo and placed it at the shebeen.  Nondumiso Ntleka (34) said when her boyfriend visited her without condoms, she just went to the gogo’s place. “Gogo’s place is not just a convenience to those who need healing, but condoms as well,” she said.
