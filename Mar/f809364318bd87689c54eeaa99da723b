African Christian Democratic Party MPL Ferlon Christians has called for church leaders to adhere to the state of emergency instructions. He said this at the Provincial Parliament this morning while Speaker of Parliament Masizole Mnqasela briefed the media about Parliament activities amidst the Covid-19 outbreak. Christians said church leaders must not gather beyond 100 people but should instead listen to the President’s instruction and spread the word on how to stay safe from Covid-19. “Together we can overcome this pandemic, most importantly I want to speak to our church leaders and tell them to adhere to government instructions that they should not gather more than 100 people,” said Christians. There have been some church leaders who openly said they will go ahead with their church activities as planned and disregarded the President’s order. Christians said the task which believers should do in times of crisis is to pray and not cause any further confusion. “In times like this, we as God-fearing Christians we pray, and we also adhere to instructions from government. As a church we need to adhere as a collective and to spread a message,” said Christians. Mnqasela said the number has reduced and gatherings should not be more than 50 people. Thabisa Mbele (42) from Brown’s Farm in Philippi told Daily Sun that she has been walking around with a mask every day and doesn’t think it’s worth it to risk going to church this Sunday. “Yes, we want to worship God, but it doesn’t mean I can’t do it at home. I wouldn’t risk myself and my children in the name of church. My prayers will still be answered if I pray from home,” she said.
