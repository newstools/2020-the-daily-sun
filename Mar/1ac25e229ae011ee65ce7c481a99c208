TWO mums have paid the hard way for their sons’ alleged crimes. Their sons allegedly murdered a fellow villager last March, and the community banned the two women from the area. The Dendron police rescued Portia Sepane (45) and Flora Mapiti (47) from residents of Ga-Madikana, outside Bochum in Limpopo, and offered them shelter. But the two women have now been told to leave Dendron as well. This was because their sons, aged 19 and 20, were bust for attempted murder in January. This was after they beat a Dendron resident to a pulp. Residents told the cops they wanted the women out after they paid bail of R500 each for their sons. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: “Both suspects were arrested again after they left the facility where they were staying and allegedly attempted to murder someone. They have since been released on bail paid by their parents. We are currently engaging with the municipality for their possible relocation.” Flora said: “I’m in this situation because of my son and I don’t have anywhere to go. I paid bail for him when he was first arrested because he convinced me he would not be involved in crime any more. “I regret paying this second time,” she said. Portia said she paid bail for her son because she believed he was not involved in the attempted murder.
