LAST Wednesday, Eskom implemented stage 4 load shedding that went on until Friday night, allegedly because of fish and jellyfish in the system! In a statement, Eskom said the water pump at the Koeberg power plant in Cape Town tripped because of the low level in the suction pit as a result of the drum filter being clogged with marine life, including jellyfish. “The level in the suction pit has sufficiently recovered and the circulating water system pump has been put back in service,” the power utility stated. “Upon inspection, it was found that the pump had not been damaged as initially feared.” The statement said since the discovery, the drum filter had been cleared of marine life and excess debris. It is now back in service and no damages to the pump had been noted. “The required technical assessment and regulatory approvals have been obtained to start up and safely return the Koeberg Unit 1 back on to the grid.” According to Eskom, normally Koeberg units were able to survive a trip of one circulating cooling water system pump and the actions required from the operators were to reduce power to below 60% and to ensure temperatures on the secondary side stabilise. South Africa has been facing load shedding challenges and Eskom has had many reasons for the power shortages, including being sabotaged and wet coal.
