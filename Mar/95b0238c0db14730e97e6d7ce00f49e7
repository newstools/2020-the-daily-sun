With the mother put in grave first, she was flowed by her son during their funeral on Saturday. The funeral started at NG Kerk In Ha Rasebei near Edenburg. With the congregation less than 100, the social distancing was followed with chairs being separated from each other. Many spoke well aboit Andile (30) and and his mum Dipuo Sebonyane (46) after they died after eating mokgodu two weeks ago and Daily Sun published the story of Mokgodu kills mother and son on 20 March. Dipuo was not home when the neighbour with Tupperware with mokgodu arrived. The neighbour allegedly warned Dipuo's three kids not to eat the mokgodu which was only meant for their mother, Dipuo.  Ward councillor in the area Mzwanele Malgas said he personally knew and grew with Andile. He told the attendees: "We played soccer together. As a leader, I have to say things about him. Andile had his ways of doing things and he would question the Bible. He had a weak faith but we know that God had sent his son to save the world. But the way the two left this world, makes one to question God. This death was not meant for Andile but for his mother only. We know that his mother had a good heart and she volunteered to make sure that her family was well. To you, the evil person who did this, how happy are you right now? Did you know what these deaths would leave? How can God give that person the strength to do this? This is not the way to separate from earth. But she will answer during judgement day. To the family, stay strong and trust in God." At the graveyard, Dipuo's coffin was lowered first and Andile 's coffin was laid on top. Andile' s sister, Millicent(24) who was also hospitalized after eating the same mokgodu, cried uncontrollably and sang a rap song that appeared to have been loved by Andile. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a case of inquest was investigated by Kagisanong police and no arrest yet.
