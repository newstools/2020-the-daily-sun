Many young people who financially provide for their families act very strangely. These employed young men and women take advantage by bossing their parents and siblings around. I heard a young woman saying she couldn’t buy groceries and cook at the same time. She said her siblings must be grateful she bought them food, so they should cook all the time. Using your helping hand to serve your selfish agenda defeats the purpose. You may be buying all the family’s needs today, but don’t ruin it by treating everyone badly. Keep being an ordinary family member and don’t bully everyone. Blessings arise from kindness without making beneficiaries feel you’re the one providing for them. Be kind and fair, and everyone will be proud of you.
