 WARY to suffer a similar
fate as last season, Al Ahly have landed early in Mzansi for their decisive Caf
Champions League quarterfinal showdown with Mamelodi Sundowns. The last time they were in
the country, the Egyptians received a “hot klap” as Sundowns romped to a 5-0
win in their quarterfinals tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium. The two sides meet at the same
venue on Saturday (3pm) in the same stage of the competition, only this time
Ahly playing the return leg away. But their early arrival suggests
they have learned from their previous experience and wouldn’t want lighting to
strike twice. They have been training at the Tuks' LC de Villiers Stadium in Pretoria. They have already won the
first leg 2-0, thumping the Tshwane giants through goals from Ali Maaloul at
Cairo International Stadium last Saturday.
