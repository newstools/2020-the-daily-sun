IT’S not every day that one sees a Volkswagen Golf 6R doing doughnuts. In a video that has gone virus on social media, a black Golf 6R can be seen spinning, which a strange site to see for some of us. The sound of the pop and crackle in the exhaust of the Golf be heard from far as the car drives towards a roundabout. If you didn’t know better, you’d say the car is about to lose control. When it gets to the roundabout the black Golf 6R with white mags starts spinning before getting back on the road and driving away.
