FAKE news has been one of the challenges facing the Department of Health since the coronavirus outbreak. Two days before Mzansi recorded its first case of coronavirus, rumours were already circulating on WhatsApp about a positive Covid-19 case in the country. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize urged the public to stop sharing false information. He encouraged them to access credible information from the department and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Despite this and constant updates about the number of confirmed cases in the country, rumours were once again circulating on Twitter yesterday. It was alleged that a Soweto resident in Protea Glen contracted the virus. But the instituteâ€™s spokeswoman Sinenhlanhla Jimon told Daily Sun it was fake news. Yesterday, the department confirmed there were six more confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total number of cases to 13 from 645 tests. All the cases identified to date have been travellers from affected countries. At this time, there is no indication that Covid-19 is circulating widely in the community in South Africa.
