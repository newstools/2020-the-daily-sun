RESIDENTS of Pimville, Soweto, are frustrated as they haven’t had electricity for a week. They blame a local church for being in the dark. To show their frustration, they blocked the gates of the church yesterday. Resident Thabang Moloi said their lives had not been easy. “These people came and erected a tent church where our electrical cables flow. They claim they were digging to make sewer pipes when they cut one of the cables responsible for leaving us in darkness.” He said the tent was erected last Easter. “We had several meetings about this church and agreed we can’t have a tent church next to a free standing church because it would just be messy,” he said. Thabang said even the clinic was in darkness and this made people angrier. He said residents contacted Eskom. “Eskom people told us they didn’t have a cable to replace the ruined one, so residents said they’ll even shut down the clinic if a plan is not made,” he said. Another resident Phumzile Maseko said they were tired of inhaling paraffin. “Not everyone from zone 1 is without lights. Some houses have it, but what is tricky is asking our neighbours to iron school uniforms and charge our phones. Our kids go to school smelling of paraffin,” Phumzile said. Attempts by Daily Sun to get comment from the church were unsuccessful.
