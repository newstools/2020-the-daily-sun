PUPILS at Zwelenkosi High School have vowed to boycott classes until the education department sends them an accounting teacher. Parents joined pupils at the school in Jozini, northern KZN, saying they had been begging for an accounting teacher since 2016. Pupils have been protesting since the beginning of the week. A matric pupil said they didn’t understand how they were supposed to write exams when they were not being taught. “We need the department to intervene and bring us a teacher so we can catch up on what we’ve missed over the past two months,” she said. Parent Sabelo Gumede (37) said when the problem started, they agreed to raise money to hire a teacher until the department sent someone. “We agreed to pay R15 per child so our children could learn accounting, but four years later nothing has been done. “As parents we feel the department is turning a blind eye to this,” he said. SGB chairman Jabulani Nhleko said they had tried to engage the department several times. He said they had been trying to set up a meeting since 2017. “The old accounting teachers left in 2016 for another school but were never replaced. “As the SGB, we asked someone to help teach our kids but parents had to pay that person. “We are now tired of paying. Our children will not go back to class until the matter is resolved,” he said. Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa understood the frustration of the pupils and parents. “We urge the pupils to go back to class while we try to find answers from the district office. “I also thank parents for being involved in their children’s education.”
