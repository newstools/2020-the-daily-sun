The founder of the People's Dialogue Herman Mashaba
remains convinced that the fight against coronavirus can be won through unity. On Thursday, the former mayor of Joburg embarked on a
journey to distribute sanitisers and other protective measures at taxi ranks in
Tshwane. Mashaba said they would extend their operations to other
provinces in a bid to fight the spread of the virus. “Our work was well received by taxi drivers and commuters
alike, all of whom expressed their anxiety about the risks they face. In the
coming days, our operations will be extended across the Province as we increase
our daily deliveries of hand sanitizer,” he said. The self-acclaimed businessman said he was looking to
welcoming volunteers in the campaign. “I would like to appreciate the many people who have come
forward to volunteer to assist in this critical programme. I would also call on
organisations across our country to join these and similar efforts,” he added.
