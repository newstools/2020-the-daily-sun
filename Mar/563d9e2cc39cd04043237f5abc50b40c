SEXY actress Katlego Danke is about to hit our small screens in Mzansi Magic’s new telenovela Gomora. Speaking to Daily Sun about being on the new set, she said: “Starting a new production from scratch has been hectic, building the characters and making sure everything is credible. Everyone has been on board and we put in a lot of hours.” Katlego said this was the first production she started with from scratch. “Most productions I worked on were already established. It has been rewarding seeing it come together.” Asked if seeing the inception of the show sparked an interest in working behind the scenes, she said it’s always interested her. “For me, it’s just been a matter of when the right time will present itself. I’d love to work as a producer and have a few upcoming projects as a producer. I would also like to be a director,” she said. Katlego will play the lead role of Onthatile (Thati) in Gomora. “Thati comes across as a spoiled brat. The world revolves around her, but she is actually feisty. She is determined and does not take any nonsense, but she still has a lot to learn. “Thati has rose-tinted glasses and lives in her own airy-fairy world until she has to see the other side of life,” said Katlego. Gomora is set in Alexandra, also known as Gomora, overlooking Sandton. “Viewers will get a sense of what Alex is and the contrasts between the two worlds. “It’s going to be one hell of a ride and I take my hat off to the writers.”
