PRESIDENT CYRIL Ramaphosa penned a letter to the South
African citizens during this difficult and uncertain time. In his letter, Ramaphosa said he met with the 114 South
African citizens that were repatriated from Wuhan in China, and they have ended
their quarantine. He said for months, they have been in lockdown, first in
Wuhan for some 51 days and then in Polokwane for 14 days. “They have been unable to be with their loved ones, unable
to leave their living quarters and uncertain about when their ordeal would end.
When we add the remaining 17 days that South Africa will be under lockdown they
will have been under lockdown for 82 days,” Ramaphosa said. The president stressed the importance of a lockdown and
self-isolation. Ramaphosa said as the total number of confirmed COVID-19
cases worldwide has grown to over 700 000 and the number of deaths exceeds 33
000, we can draw lessons from these countries. “It is now abundantly clear that the most effective way for
a society to contain the spread of the disease is for the population to remain
at home and physically isolated from each other for at least several weeks. And it is important that this lockdown and all other
emergency measures are both strictly adhered to and consistently enforced,”
added Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa said lessons that can be taken from Wuhan in China
is that a lockdown works. HE explained that it shows that if we strictly observe the
rules in place to stop the virus spreading, we will be able to bring infection
rates down.
