 THESE are two of the best selling-bakkies in South Africa, and it’s without wonder that at some point they were going to be in a tug of war. The ever-popular Toyota Hilux took the top spot in vehicle sales in the second month of 2010, while the Ford Ranger managed to take the second spot in sales. It’s an open secret that Mzansi people love bakkies, and in this tug of war it might have a lot of people divided. In a YouTube video, posted by user allistairc123 the two bakkies go at it to settle who has more power. At some point during the tug of war, the Ranger can be seen going sideways while the Hilux seems to be using less power. The model of the Ranger used in the video is a Wildtrak that uses Ford’s 2.0 Bi-Turbo engine, but we are not sure which model the Hilux bakkie is.
