HEALTH Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has announced that four more people have tested positive for the Corona virus. He has made the announcement an an inter-ministerial press conference held in Tshwane. The four include a couple aged 38 years old from KZN and had all recently travelled to Italy similar to the three cases prior. Minister Mkhize also clarified that at airports ,inside domestic terminals no tests were being conducted. "We are scanning people coming from outside as it is the nature of the problem we are facing. It is where the risk areas are." The number of people who have been tested throughout the country is over 300 but can't confirm the number of people tested who were in contact with those who tested positive. "People need to be  in contact where there is an infection,that is where the risk. The issue is the contact. As far as our borders are concerned we have restricted the movement of people through our borders. What we have said is that we will try to detect symptoms and so it doesn't make a difference if that point of entry is land,airport or sea. Mkhize also added that no decision has been  made to cancel tourism and festivals as cabinet will discuss with the president.
