DJ Zinhle has broken her silence since her highly publicised split from AKA, with whom she has a daughter. In a recent interview with Drum Magazine, the star said she is doing just fine despite the break-up. “I am fine, I’m genuinely fine. I just have been overworked." She said as far as her relationship with her baby daddy was concerned, they were civil towards each other and “one big happy family," she told the publication. She said everyone still gets along. Said Zinhle: "Kiernan, my mom and I, everyone is just getting along. Our break-up hasn’t broken up the family." After weeks of speculation, AKA confirmed their break-up in an interview on Metro FM in January.
