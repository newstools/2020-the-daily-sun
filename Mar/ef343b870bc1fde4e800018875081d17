IN this rain scarce country, the biggest drivers of taps running dry is not the climate but corruption. And contrary to popular belief, the public sector is not the only culprit in this corruption. Yesterday during Corruption Watch and the Water Integrity Network’s launch of a report on water corruption, it emerged the private sector was deeply involved in the corruption. WIN executive director Barbara Schreiner said: “Too often, the private business is seen as the victim of corruption. “Bribes are paid and tender awards accepted with the excuse that such practices are necessary to get work. “Private sector bidders that enter into irregular contracts are breaking the law and placing their business at risk. “Companies have a legal duty to ensure correct procedures have been followed in the awarding of public contracts. “They should be appropriately penalised when they don’t.” She said many business mafias benefitted from corruption, demanded tenders, and in some cases actively promoted it. Schreiner said: “Village taps have run dry so that councillors and their friends get contracts to truck water.” The report recommended that the water sector should be a no-go zone for corruption by designating it as an island of integrity.
