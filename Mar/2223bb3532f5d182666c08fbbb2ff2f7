THE Department of Health has confirmed that there are four new cases of the COVID-19 disease in South Africa. On Thursday morning, the department released a statement saying the number of cases had risen to 17 since Wednesday. According to the department, the new cases are reported to be from Mpumalanga, KwaZulu Natal, Gauteng, and the Free State. “A 38-year-old man from Durban who lives in Turkey and was visiting his family in South Africa tested positive. He had traveled to the UK and returned to RSA on the 7th of March 2020,” the department said. The department further said that a woman from Mpumalanga that had traveled to the United States, returned to South Africa on the 7th of March – while a man from Johannesburg who reportedly traveled to New York via Dubai and returned to Mzansi on the 8th of March also tested positive. In the Free State, the 32-year-old man who tested positive reportedly came into contact with a Chinese businessman, meaning this is a case of local transmission.
