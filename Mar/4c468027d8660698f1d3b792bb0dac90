FIVE men accused of hacking a teenage boy’s leg allegedly for muthi purposes will remain in jail. The group made a brief appearance at the Mhala Magistrates Court in Thulamahashe on Thursday after they previously abandoned bail three times. During their appearance, Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba told them that they will remain in jail until 14 May for DNA test results to be conducted. The suspects aged between 21 and 30 are facing two counts of kidnapping and attempted murder after they allegedly lured the boy (13) with sweets and the snacks before kidnapping him. They reportedly hacked his leg using a panga by placing it over large stones on 31 October and hacking it. The boy’s troubled gogo ,aged 89,has described the five men's actions as devilish. “I will never forgive these five young men. They must go and rot in jail. They ruined my boy’s life forever. He is afraid to come home when he's discharged from hospital.” Gogo said: “His mum died some years ago and I raised him together with his sister hoping that one day they will bury me.” “I just wish a Good Samaritan can donate an artificial leg as doctors said it was too late to fix the decomposed chopped one.” The suspects were rescued by cops after an angry mob burnt their homes. A few days later they led cops to the back of the Thulamahashe Plaza where they recovered the abandoned boy's badly decomposed leg which the police collected. A local motorist who was on his way to collect fire-wood accidentally bumped onto him crawling being covered with blood near the valley and rushed him to hospital.
