THEIR dark blood-shot eyes are gazing aimlessly. Their skinny malnourished bodies, especially their hands, were shaking miserably. They try to strike up conversations with each in their trembling hush and sometimes unnecessarily pitched voices, but still, they are not consoled. They look scared and seemingly try to console each other as they wait without any assurance that their misery may end soon. All that is occupying their minds is the next fix! Where is the damn snyman (drug dealer)? They were wondering loudly with unspeakable curses from their mouths through their greasy, black and yellow teeth. These are young nyaope girls and boys who were waiting anxiously for the snyman, wondering if indeed he was coming. After some minutes while talking to the SunTeam, they heard the magical voice from behind them: “Sengikhona sondelani,” (I am here, come) said the snyman. Their sick, painful bodies that they were shuffling a few minutes ago, suddenly sprung to life! Their great saviour was here. If they had it their way, they would have even kissed him. “Wozani sekakhona,” (come, he is here) they called others as they ran behind him. Everyone wanted to be first in the queue. The few hours that they had been waiting for him were like an eternity to them. The snyman was walking briskly in front of them, with an air of authority and his thin arms open like those of bodybuilders. He was in charge and they were at his mercy. And he knew it! The lockdown meant nothing to them. As they said, the shutdown was for others and did not concern them. A day without this deadly poison for them means death. Those who want to quit are scared of the withdrawal symptoms which go, as they say, with excruciatingly unbearable, painful cramps in the tummy. On this first day of the lockdown, the normally bustling Bhareni nyaope spot in Diepkloof Zone 3, Soweto, was dead quiet. It was like a tornado had passed through just a few minutes ago.
