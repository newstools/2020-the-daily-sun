FRUSTRATED and under pressure Black Leopards coach Allan Clark is blaming Chris Katjiukua and Rotshidwa Muleka for losing Limpopo derby. Lidoda Duvha suffered a 2-0 defeat against their rivals Baroka in an Absa Premiership match played at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Bakgaga striker Evidence Makgopa scored a brace that helped the Ga-Mphahlele based side wins bragging rights and three points from two mistakes by goalkeeper Muleka and defender Katjiukua. “Not even my 11-year-old son could have made such mistakes,” said Clark. “We gave them a goal in the first half and we gave them another goal in the second. You can’t coach people how not to make school boys errors. We are our worst enemies. We gave them three points. This was a derby and you can’t give an opponent goals." He added: “What can I say to Katjiukua when he made a school boy error? Even young boy cannot do that. My goalkeeper ran out (of goal posts) when it was not necessary. “What was he doing out there? I don’t understand why he came out. Maybe is a mentality or fear of the position we find ourself. We need to have better reaction in our coming game. I am so frustrated to be honest.”  The defeat left struggling Leopards at the relegation danger zone with 20 points, especially now that AmaZulu won 1-0 against leaders Kaizer Chiefs. And now many football fans are tipping them to return back to the GladAfrica Championship after spent only two seasons in the top flight. Leopards have been doing well in the Nedbank Cup as they are in the last eight where they will face the same Baroka at the same venue. Leopards have now gone three consecutive league matches without a win, losing the all, including another Limpopo loss to Polokwane City a fortnight ago.
