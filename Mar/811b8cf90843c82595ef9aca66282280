TSHWANE’S council meeting was postponed again yesterday. The sitting was called by acting speaker Zweli Khumalo to elect a new mayor and discuss a motion of no confidence against DA office bearers. The council has recently been unable to sit without the meeting collapsing or parties walking out. READ: WATCH: ZCC MEMBERS' CORONAVIRUS SONG! There have been several failed attempts by the EFF and ANC to unseat the DA in the city. Khumalo said there wasn’t a quorum as the EFF, ANC and others boycotted the sitting. Last Thursday, Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced the decision to disband the Tshwane council and put the city under administration for 90 days, followed by by-elections in all 105 wards. Makhura said the administrators would be told to speed up service delivery. But the DA said it would challenge the decision. Mayoral candidate Randall Williams said: “We will in all probability interdict the dissolution of the municipality.”
