A year has already passed since the passing of Jabulani Tsambo, popularly known as HPP. But the feud between his family and customary wife Lerato Senagdi seems far from over. The PR guru recently revealed that her late husband’s family is taking her to the Supreme Court of Appeals this Friday. As it stands NOTHING that was awarded 2 me in my previous High Court win was handed over. Hopefully after Friday this messy ordeal will be over. #IWillNotCower ALSO READ: HEARTBREAK OVER NOMZAMO'S EXIT! Speaking to Daily Sun, Lerato said the Tsambo family should answer why they are taking her to court because as it stands she hasn't received anything from HHP’s estate after his death. The widow went on to say she can’t put into words the emotional pain she has endured as the Tsambo family never gave her the dignity to grieve her late husband. “What’s happening to me is nothing new in the black community. Widows have been attacked, victimised, shamed, stolen from and treated in the vilest way and degrading manner by in-laws once their husband pass. And because as widows we are at our most vulnerable, they succeed,” she said.
