ABUJA, NIGERIA
 authorities have reported a trend by unscrupulous people claiming to be bandits and kidnappers asking fellow civilians to pay ransom or risk being kidnapped. The trend is prevalent in the Katsina State, prompting police to threaten such criminals with the death sentence. Kidnappers abducted more than 20 caregivers in Katsina State late last year alone. Gambo Isah, the spokesman for the Katsina State Police Command, warned that anyone arrested in connection with such offences would be dealt with in accordance with the law. “Members of the public should note that death by hanging is the punishment for kidnapping,” he warned. “Parents are hereby advised to monitor the activities of their wards.” – CAJ NEWS
