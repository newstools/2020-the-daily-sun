KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has revelaed that he has no desire to play for another team again. He has vowed that he will hang up his gloves before he turns up for any other team other than Amakhosi. The 32-year-old shotstopper, who is know as Mzansi's number one by his fans, has been forced to play a supporting role this season. This after he spent a number of months on the sidelines due to injury. During his absence, Daniel Akpeyi stepped in and made the Amakhosi number one jersy his own. The Nigerian keeper showed his quality in the Soweto derby over the weekend, walking away with the man of the match accolade. This suggests he will remain Amakhosi's first choice goalie going forward with Khune set to continue playing second fiddle. But that does not seem toÂ  be a problem for Khune, who revelaed that he will fight for his position. And when a fan suggested on social media that he join arch rivals Pirates next season, where he would be guaranteed regular game time, Khune made his intentions clear. "I will retire at Kaizer Chiefs," he replied.
