SIBLINGS Lashay (10), Learyn (11) and Aiden (6) Goodall died in a car accident on Wednesday on their way to school. Yesterday, their mum Odille (34) visited the spot where her kids took their last breath and couldn’t hold back her tears when she saw the debris of the crashed vehicles. Hundreds of mourners gathered at the accident scene on the Golden Highway. Dozens carried candles and laid wreaths during the memorial service. The siblings were among 12 people who died when a taxi collided with an Avanza. Dignitaries attended the service, including Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. Goodall family spokesman Noel Matt said: “We applaud the cops and emergency services on the good work they have done. “We don’t blame anyone. We urge motorists to be careful on the road.”  Minnaar sent his condolences to the families who lost their loved ones. He said he received a call in the morning informing him five people died at the scene. “Five minutes later, I received another call informing me the number had risen to 10. When our men were done at the scene, they went to Bara Hospital and I was told the figure was sitting at 12,” he said. Joburg Speaker Nonceba Molwele said: “I can’t express how I feel. The nation is mourning those who died.” Both drivers died in the accident.  Ennerdale Taxi Association chairman Mark Collins said they were distraught. “We will continue to educate our drivers on road safety.” The family said they would communicate funeral arrangements in due time.
