TO end all the speculations and labelling across the Olympics word, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president, Thomas Bach, and Japan’s Prime Minister, Abe Shinzo, has agreed to postpone the multi-coded Games. The Olympic Games were scheduled for 24 July to 9 August 2020 in Tokyo, Japan, but they have been moved to 2021, even though they would still be referred to as the 2020 games. “In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the IOC President and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021,” a statement said yesterday.  “This is to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.” The leaders agreed that the Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times of the Coronavirus outbreak, “and the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present”. “Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020,” the committee said in a joint statement yesterday. Among leaders in the committee included the President of the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee Mori Yoshiro, the Olympic Minister Hashimoto Seiko, the Governor of Tokyo Koike Yuriko and chair of the IOC Coordination Commission, John Coates. President Bach and Prime Minister Abe expressed their shared concern about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and what it is doing to people’s lives and the significant impact it is having on global athletes’ preparations for the Games.
