HONDA’s popular BR-V compact SUV is sporting a fresh look. The 2020 model features subtle changes to the interior and exterior aimed at enhancing its styling and functionality. According to Honda, improvements have also been made to on-road and comfort through the addition of new features and added noise insulation. The BR-V is one of Honda’s core models in the local line-up, and the carmaker claims it’s the only seven-seater SUV in its class. Design tweaks on the latest BR-V include new LED daytime running lights, which also improves visibility and safety for other road users. In keeping with its practical, family-oriented design, the spacious seven-seater BR-V is now equipped with rear parking sensors on the mid-range Comfort and top-spec Elegance models to make parking manoeuvres significantly easier. The BR-V Elegance also now features a seven-inch Display Audio touch screen system with an integrated reverse parking camera.  Under the bonnet Honda’s 1,5L i-VTEC four-cylinder engine continues to power the BR-V range. It produces 88kW of power at 6 600r/min and peak torque of 145Nm at 4 600r/min. The BR-V Trend is offered with a six-speed manual gearbox only, while Comfort and Elegance models are available with a six-speed manual or a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). ABS anti-lock brakes are fitted across the range, along with dual front airbags. PRICING: The Honda BR-V carries a five-year/200 000km warranty, four-year/60 000km service plan (BR-V Comfort/Elegance only, optional on Trend) and a three-year AA Roadside Assistance.
