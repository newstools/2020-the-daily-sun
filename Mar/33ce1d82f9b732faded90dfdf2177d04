One is an electrical maintenance service and the other a cleaning service. Q: What car do you drive? A: I drive a VW Polo TDI Comfort line, 2010 model. Q: When did you buy it? A: In 2017. Q: Why do you like it? A: I like it because it’s comfortable, easy on fuel and performs extremely well. Q: Does it have a pet name? A: No, not yet. Q: How far have you travelled in it? A: So far, I’ve been to all Mzansi’s seven provinces. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: Not with this one. And it’s been years now since I’ve maintained a clean sheet. Q: Is it your dream car? A: No. My dream car is any Mercedes-Benz brand. Q: Did you change any thing in your car? A: No. It’s still standard. Q: What’s your view on other Mzansi road users? A: I’m one person who gets irritated when someone drives slowly on an open road. Taxi drivers, in particular, decide to stop anywhere. That’s annoying and bad driving behaviour. They think they own the road.
