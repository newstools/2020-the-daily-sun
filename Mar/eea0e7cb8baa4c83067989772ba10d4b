MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has been singing Motjeka Madisha’s praises after the youngster improved greatly from the previous seasons. The 25-year-old player was promoted from Sundowns’ reserve team in 2017 after captaining Downs Diski Challenge team to the land of milk and honey when they claimed the MDC, which was the only missing title in the club’s trophy cabinet. Since then, Madisha has never looked back as he kept on improving every time he was on the field. He took advantage of the long-term groin injury suffered by teammate Ricardo Nascimento last season to establish himself in the Sundowns central defence. He owned the position even when Nascimento recovered. Madisha has kept his place in the starting line-up. Despite Nascimento’s return to action over the past few weeks‚ Madisha has kept his place in the starting line-up, and Mosimane believes the former SA Under-23 international can compete for a spot in the national team. Last Wednesday, Madisha displayed a Man of the Match performance when his side kept their league title hopes alive with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Stellenbosch FC. Despite missing out in Bafana Bafana squad which was announced last week, the young lad continued with his fine display, scooping another stellar performance at the weekend when the Brazilians booked their spot in the Nedbank Cup semi-finals. “I think what is encouraging for Madisha is walking away with the Man of the Match (against Stellenbosch),” Mosimane said. “What’s encouraging Madisha is to deal with stars such as (Marwan) Mohsen and (Hossam) Ashour of Al Ahly (in the Caf Champions League). “That is the highest level ever on the continent, there is no other. Those guys are in the national team of Egypt. “He has also dealt with players from Wydad (Casablanca), who are also in the national team.” Mosimane added: “He has done that for himself consistently. It’s important for him to do that.”
