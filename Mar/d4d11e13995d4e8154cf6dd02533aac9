She was never one for fake hair but wanted to look good that day. “I was walking from the backroom when I saw the man approaching with a knife. He said nothing and continued assaulting me. “He grabbed my wig and fell on his back. I managed to get inside the room and locked the gate.” But Stella was unhappy with how cops treated her after the incident. “They said I couldn’t open a case because I didn’t know who the suspect was. “I was only told to go and open a J88 file at the hospital.
