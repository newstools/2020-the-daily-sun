KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Midderndorp has slammed his players'mindset following their shock defeat to struggling AmaZulu. Amakhosi were stunned 1-0 by the KwaZulu Natal outfit at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. The Absa Premiership leaders were a shadow of the team that impressively saw off arch rivals Orlando Pirates by the same scoreline a week earlier. Bongi Ntuli scored the solitary goal that handed Usuthu the all important three points. Middendorp was bitterly dissapointmnet by his side's showing on the night. "Â This type of games, we have seen all around the world, you are only able to handle them if you have the right mindset on the field," said Middendorp. "We did not show that. We were too casual in a lot of moments. We missed a huge chance to take the lead in the first half and they took their later. "In the second half it was always going to be difficult, we were playing against a wall and we could not find the right combinations with our passing. In the end it was a very confusing game for us. "It was a confusing game individually and as a collective. The question marks will come up, how can this happen? It has something to do with the mindset. "Watford wins against Liverpool, Norwich wins against Leicester. This is all stuff that happens, but it should not. "I believe if you have the right mindset then the result will be different. We took it too easy and then in a critical moment it gets more difficult. You have given the opponent much needed confidence." Chiefs will face Bidvest Wits next Wednesday at the same venue (7.30pm) hoping for an improved showing.
