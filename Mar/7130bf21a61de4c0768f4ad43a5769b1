Hey MizzB I’M 15 and my boyfriend is 26. We’ve been together for two years and have been sexually active since we started dating. He doesn’t love me as much as I love him. All he wants is sex.I often send him my naked pictures just to keep his attention. I feel sex is the only way to keep a man. Please help! - Girl Hey Girl Sex is not a guarantee to keep a man’s affection. Dating an older man can be tricky, as he has more experience, leaving you unsure about what’s expected. Take the time to love yourself so you don’t feel pressured to fit into someone else’s vision of you. You’re beautiful and capable of being anything you want. Focus on your schoolwork and make yourself a woman who can get a man who understands her value. MizzB is a partnership between Daily Sun and lovelife.org.za.
