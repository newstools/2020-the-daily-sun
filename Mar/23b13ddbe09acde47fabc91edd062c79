DESPITE suffering a heartbreaking defeat at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns to exit the Nedbank Cup at the quarter-final stage, Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama, praised his team for their fighting spirit. Downs midfielder Keletso Makgalwa scored the solitary goal to decide the cup tie five minutes before the end of extra time. The 1-0 defeat was hard to take for Da Gama and his men given the way they played. But a lapse of concentration in midfield led to their painful exit. Highlands players were inconsolable when referee Victor Hlungwane blew his final whistle to signal the end of the highly charged last eight encounter at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday. “I thought the boys were fantastic. It was a bit strange to see a team of Sundowns’ calibre park the bus,” said Da Gama. The former Orlando Pirates coach sees the defeat as a learning curve. Da Gama said they will regroup and gather their strength before taking on the Tshwane giants again at the same venue in an Absa Premiership match on Saturday (3.30pm). They also suffered a 1-0 defeat to Downs in the first round of their league game in Atteridgeville in October. “It’s rather unfortunate to lose with two schoolboy errors. But we take it on the chin and move on. I’m really proud of the boys and I know that they are hurting to lose in this manner,” explained Da Gama. Da Gama felt that the best team on the day lost the contest. Da Gama added: “We forced them to play the way we wanted to play. We played our hearts out but committed that one costly mistake that ultimately cost us. But there is a lot to take from this painful defeat going forward.”
