MASKANDI artist Senzo “Ntencane” Zondi, named Ukhozi FM’s Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka winner two weeks ago, apparently won R100 000 less than previous winner Mroza Fakude. Mroza won R150 000! Yet the radio station announced Ntencane’s song Wawuthembeni received 433 142 votes at a cost of R1,50 per SMS. Ntencane told Daily Sun he made more than R500 000 for the SABC. A winner should have been announced on New Year’s Eve, but businessman Owen Ndlovu filed a court interdict against the SABC. Ntencane said: “I’m happy I won. I’m not going to complain. My wish is that they play my music more so I can at least benefit from royalties.” Other artists were under the impression the winner got a very big prize but this year it was not to be. One artist claimed: “Ever since this competition started the winner walked away with something big. It’s a huge scam and we’re not happy.” Cultural and Creative Industries Federation of SA’s Thokozani “Tzozo” Zulu said: “This is exploitation. We were aware of this problem before the results were announced, but the SABC refused to meet us.” The public broadcaster’s Mmoni Seapolelo said yesterday: “The SABC can confirm that Ukhozi FM announced the results of its long-standing programme, Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka, on Friday, 13 March in the interests of listeners who voted, and artists who participated.” The results had been audited.Tzozo’s federation had requested a meeting on 19 February but did not show up.
