THE coronavirus is wreaking havoc at the Sassa offices in Tshwane. Staff felt the social grant agency was endangering their lives. So they downed tools yesterday. But residents insisted on remaining in queues, saying they won’t move unless they were helped. A staff member said they won’t assist the public without gloves, masks and hand sanitisers. “This agency doesn’t care about us. We handle documents and sit face to face with the public,” she said. Resident Matlakala Sefara (25) said she was hurt by staff’s comments.  She said Sassa staff took advantage. “They think they are powerful. They know we are vulnerable,” she said. Resident Phephelaphi Mahlangu (57) said Sassa should compensate them for money they used to travel to the offices.  “There isn’t even a notice informing us of what is going on. A security guard and a young disrespectful woman came out after some time to tell us we have a virus and should not infect her,” she said.  Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said staff at a local Tshwane office were assured of employer support amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Since the outbreak, Sassa has taken various precautions to protect staff and beneficiaries, including constantly providing information on preventative measures and precautions.”
