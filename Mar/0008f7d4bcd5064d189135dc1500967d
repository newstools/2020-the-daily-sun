ACCORDING to a report in 2016 of unwanted fertility in South Africa released by Statistics SA on Monday, about 54% of women born in 1965-1969 experienced pregnancy when they didn't plan to have any more births. The stats show it was an increase from 13.2% in the 1998 survey. The Statistician-General of South Africa, Risenga Maluleke, said of all the births of women aged 15-49- years experienced in the last five years before the 1998 survey about 17% were conceived when they were no longer planning to have any more children and such births increased to almost 20% in the 2016 survey. He said the births were revealed to increase with the age of women. Maluleke said Eastern Cape had 26.4%, KwaZulu Natal and Mpumalanga 25.1% had the highest percentage of births conceived when women did not plan to have any more births in 2016. According to Stats SA, the provinces including North West also had a higher percentage of the births in 1998. The highest increase in births conceived when women did not plan to have any more births were more pronounced in the Northern Cape and Western Cape which had a birth increase from 6.6% to 16.0% and 11.7% to 20.9% from 1998 to 2016. "The household wealth report reveals that births conceived when women did not want any more children were highest in the poorest households by 25.8% compared to 13.1% in the richest households in 2016. "The 1998 and 2016 survey findings indicate that the percentage of births conceived when women were no longer planning to have children varied by the level of education women possessed. Maluleke added that in 2016 such births to mothers with tertiary education 11.4% were four times less compared to mothers with no education 46.3% and births to mothers with no education almost doubled from 24.8% in 1998 to 46.3 in 2016. He said the report also used data on the total number of children ever born to women and the ideal number of children reported by women to estimate the average excess fertility that is the average number of extra children women had. "This was analysed by year of birth of women 1965-1969, 1970-1974, 1975-1979 and 1980-1984. “The finding from the report indicates that on average women have not reached the number of children they consider as their ideal fertility," he said. Maluleke said a pregnancy that happened when a woman wanted no more children is classified as unwanted.
