THE US Justice Department charged two Chinese men with laundering about $100 million (R1,5 billion) in cryptocurrency on behalf of North Korea. This was revealed in court filings that detail Pyongyang’s use of hackers to avoid sanctions. The two Chinese allegedly laundered cryptocurrency stolen by North Korean hackers between December 2017 and April last year. The funds were laundered through hundreds of automated transactions designed to prevent cops from tracing them. US Attorney Timothy Shea said the hacking of virtual currency poses a big threat to the security and integrity of the global financial system.– REUTERS
