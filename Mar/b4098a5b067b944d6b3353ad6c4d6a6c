 STUDENTS at
Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) Pretoria West campus protested on Monday
joining other campuses that have been protesting. Activities
at the campus were suspended because of the protest. The
students blocked the university entrance with burning tyres and stones and
chanted struggle songs while it was heavily raining. They said
they were protesting over many grievances they had with management. Pasma
representative, Moafrika Jozi, said one of the issues they had was with TUT
enterprise holding. “It is
supposed to bring third stream income into the university, but it is operating vise
versa and we don’t like that.”
