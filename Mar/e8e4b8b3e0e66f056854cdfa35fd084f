THE HAWKS escorted a couple from their residence in Northcliff to their factory in Crown Mines on Thursday morning. The couple was arrested after an operation conducted by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation, Border Policing City Deep, and Johannesburg Central Visible Policing in the Crown Mines in Johannesburg on Thursday. Police spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the team followed up on intelligence information regarding counterfeit goods activities in one of the Crown Mines factories since July 2019. “It is alleged that the suspects were rebranding debarred Stayfree sanitary pads into Always product packaging. A search and seizure warrant was obtained in January subsequently for effective operation,” Mulamu said. Mulamu said an investigation was kept within the perimeter of the factory and the manufacturing processes were positively identified. After searching the factory, over 60 000 readily packed packets of Always sanitary pads and two Rizzla manufacturing machines with an estimated value of R5 million were seized. The couple will appear before the Palm Ridge Special Commercial Crimes Court on Friday.
