RESIDENTS were shocked to see a spaza being built with road signs written “Pretoria” and “M17 Ga-Rankuwa”. They said they had no idea where the signs at the spaza in Skierlik squatter camp near Pienaarspoort, Tshwane, were taken. According to residents, the spaza shop was erected in December. Resident Albert Motau (50) told Daily Sun the spaza owner came and went regularly. “We can’t stop or even ask the man where he got the signs from as we’re afraid of him,” he said. But we feel sorry for the man. “He may end up in jail if he stole the signs.” Another resident, Ben Lebese (34), said the man should be stopped and the signs taken away. “We call on residents to stop using government property for their benefit. This is bad for the nation and people who pay tax,” he said. The residents said the signs would confuse those looking for directions. They said they would now be government’s eyes and ears. Gauteng Road Infrastructure spokesman Theo Nkonki appealed to people to respect public infrastructure, respect the road rules and adhere to signs. “No one is allowed to temper with road signs. We will look into the matter,” he said.
