MONICA Mageza has been crying for three months over the loss of her husband. The 46-year-old widow said her husband Steve (36) was found murdered in January, but hasn’t been buried as his body was taken in for forensic tests. Monica’s ordeal started after Steve was abducted on 15 December. “He called me saying someone abducted him and he could only let him go if I transferred R2 000. “I didn’t understand, but deposited the money because the man sounded aggressive and my husband sounded like he was in danger,” she said. She said the man told her he gave Steve R20 to get home. “I waited but never heard from my husband until the police said he was found on a mountain between Mamelodi and Eesterust.” She said she has been waiting to bury her husband so she could find closure. “I’m not coping. I’ve lost weight and can’t do anything without crying,” she said. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Louw said one suspect appeared in court on 10 January and the case was postponed to 7 April. He faces charges of kidnapping, extortion, robbery and four murders. In the story, 68-year-old Magdaline Mogoatlhe’s son, Tebatso (31) was also abducted and killed.
