THE last time Mampho Mataboge left home she was going to a wedding with friends from Tsitsing, near Rustenburg in the North West. Yesterday, on Monday morning she was found face down with stones in her mouth..dead. According to her sister Winnie Kole, Mampho went to a social party after the wedding. The boyfriend found her there and a fight ensued between the two. The Mataboge family says they are still not sure what caused the fight which led to their daughter's death.  The 22-year-old is alleged to have died from the hands of her 26-year-old boyfriend's from Tlaseng. After the incident the suspected boyfriend called his boss telling him he left Mampho lying somewhere on the road. He was taken to Phokeng Police Station later that day. "I received a call from a neighbour who said something has happened to Mampho around 3am on Monday. I rushed there to find a group of people and asked where Mampho was. She was covered in a white sheet dead on the ground," said Winnie. Winnie said she remembers seeing her young sister's lifeless face turned black from the yellow bone she was, and her mouth was torn on the sides. She had what seemed like a string mark around her neck. The family said the relationship was abusive physically and verbally. They described Mampho as someone who was jovial and loved peace.  North West Police Luetenant Colonel Amanda Funani said the suspect is expected to appear at the Bafokeng Magistrates Court in Tlhabane tomorrow in connection with Mampho Mataboge's murder. The funeral will be held this Saturday in Tsitsing.
