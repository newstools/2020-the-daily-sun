SHE is tired of young people asking for her secret to looking young and beautiful. She’s also tired of those who don’t believe she’s 73 years old. Gogo Johanna Peteke from Mothutlung, North West, now wants Mzansi to know how she keeps young and beautiful. She said in 1989, her life changed when her late husband left her for another woman. She felt like running away from her problems and started running small distances every morning. “I soon got addicted to running and started running in the evening. My stress went away,” said Johanna. She said after running for years, she decided to take part in marathons and races. “I started participating in 2000 and have won many medals,” she said. Johanna said when a soccer team for gogos was formed in her village, she joined it. “I’m a striker and no gogo can outrun me. I found I enjoyed soccer and it has also helped me make new friends who share the same hobbies of keeping fit,” she said. She said she has seen her peers ageing badly over the years. “Some of the girls I grew up with now use walking sticks and some are in wheelchairs.” Although she appreciates the complements about looking young, gogo Johanna said she always reminded young people how old she is. “I don’t tolerate those who try to take me to dates. I’m a good-looking grandmother, but I’m an elderly person and I will not hesitate to discipline a disrespectful young person,” she said. Refilwe Moukangwe (29) said she was inspired by gogo Johanna to start running. “I don’t want to age. I want to stay young and beautiful like her. I will in fact do anything she does to remain young,” said Refilwe.
