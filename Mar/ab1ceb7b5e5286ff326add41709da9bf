FOR 15 years, she believed her brother’s body had been stolen from the mortuary. Little did she know some family members buried him without her knowing. Now Makhosi Ntombela (59) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, wants her brother’s remains. She said her brother, Muzi, had been coming to her in her dreams telling her he wanted to come home to his people. “When my brother died, we made arrangements that another brother of mine would fetch him for burial. “But Muzi’s body was nowhere to be found,” she said. “His identity documents were at home and none of us knew who took Muzi and why. “We’ve been fighting with Avbob. We even went to court, but our lawyer got into an accident while he was still working on our case. We got another lawyer, who is dragging his feet,” she said. Makhosi said all she wanted was to find her brother’s remains so he could rest in peace. “This headache doesn’t go away and has caused me so much pain. Our mother died without finding closure,” she said. “All we want to know from Avbob is where Muzi is buried so we can fetch him and rebury him.” Avbob spokesman Marius du Plessis said a family member released the body. “We can help Makhosi by showing her where the grave is. “It’s unfortunate we cannot reveal who we gave the body to because our clause does not allow us to do so.”
