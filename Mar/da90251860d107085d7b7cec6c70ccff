THE shutdown has begun, and things seem to be business as usual at Seshego outside Polokwane in Limpopo. Some residents are still moving around the streets of Seshego, going to supermarkets and spaza shops. They said they just wanted to see if the lockdown was really going to happen. Some taxis were also on the streets even after the 9am curfew. Few residents were also doing their last-minute shopping at the Seshego Circle Centre but about 80% shops were closed. The SunTeam moved around most of the Seshego zones and there were no signs of either police or soldiers to enforce the lockdown. A 27-year-old resident who wanted to remain anonymous said the lockdown is necessary and, but it will be difficult to abide by the rules. “It is essential for us to follow the rules of the lockdown, even though it is going to be tough. Some of us are not used to staying at home and not move around for more than two days. It is going to be a long 21 days,” he said. Locals and hawkers who were operating their businesses either at their homes or in the streets were also not operating. Few of the residents who were moving around were wearing masks and gloves while others were not. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha together with his Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba were stationed at the Mantsole Weighbridge Traffic Centre to screen and test those travelling from Gauteng to Limpopo for the coronavirus.
