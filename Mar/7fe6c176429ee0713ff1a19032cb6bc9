The country is under a complete lock down after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mthethwa on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for domestic football to continue being played behind closed doors with certain safety measures put in place.Without saying it, Mthethwa suggested that players and officials be screened of the coronavirus before and after each game. Mthethwa said this following a meeting with sport stakeholders from all sporting codes.

Our position is in the interest and health of the players because for us that comes first" “We have seen around the world that all matches are postponed. We cannot go against what is happening" "Our position is clear, that all matches are postponed" “Safa has decided that there are no matches until at least 4 April" Jordaan was scheduled to have a meeting with Premier Soccer League chairman Irvin Khoza on Wednesday. However, he revealed that the PSL chairman was not available to discuss the matter further. Jordaan stated: “I was supposed to meet with the chairman at 9.30am Wednesday, but he indicated he was no longer available.”
