A Big Apple conference about the coronavirus has been canceled – because of the coronavirus, according to a report. The Council of Foreign Relations was due to hold a roundtable titled “Doing Business Under Coronavirus” on Friday, but decided to cancel it amid fears that it could lead to a spread of the deadly bug, Bloomberg News reported. The nonprofit think-tank on US foreign policy and international affairs, on East 68th Street, also has called off other in-person meetings in New York, Washington, DC, and around the country from March 3 to April 3, the news outlet reported. “There are currently no upcoming events. Please check back soon for new events,” reads a statement on the CFR’s website. The canceled confab joins a list of other events affected by COVID-19 in the state, which holds the largest cluster of coronavirus cases in the US. Among them is the New York International Auto Show, which has been postponed from next month to late August. In the US, more than 50 major corporate events with an estimated attendance of close to 1 million people have been canceled due to the outbreak, according to Bloomberg News. The state’s confirmed cases of coronavirus infections stands at 176.
