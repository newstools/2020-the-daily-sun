PITCH Black Afro had the intention to kill his wife Catherine Modisane. This was what the state said yesterday when the rapper, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo, appeared in the South Gauteng High Court. Prosecutor Matshiliso Moleko said there was evidence Ngcobo assaulted his wife before her death. “The deceased was found dead on 31 December 2018 and the cause of death was blunt trauma, which could have been caused by the accused hitting her head against the wall. The accused confirmed he pushed her and she hit her head against the wall. His confession was provisionally admitted and it should be admitted as evidence.” Ngcobo, who’s been in jail for almost a year now, faces charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. “The fact that the accused and the victim were drunk doesn’t play a big role,” Moleko said. Ngcobo is accused of defeating the ends of justice as a blood-stained towel was found in the shower by cops. But Judge J du Plessis said the towel wasn’t taken for testing, so it wasn’t known whose blood was on it. Proceedings resume tomorrow.
