A YOUNG mum allegedly buried her two-week-old baby in a shallow grave after he got sick and died. Villagers in Mutsha Tshirangadzi outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo became suspicious when they didn’t see the baby. They said they saw the mum (21) on Sunday, saying she was taking the baby to a local clinic. They saw her again on Monday, but the baby was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday. The angry villagers confronted the mum on Wednesday, threatening her with violence. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops rescued her. “She told cops her baby became sick and she took him to the clinic and later to the local hospital. She claimed the baby died on Monday and she threw his body in the river.” He said members of the search and rescue unit searched for the body. “When the body could not be found in the river, police continued with investigations, which led them to a spot where she buried the body in a shallow grave,” he said. The mum was arrested on Wednesday and faces a charge of murder. She will appear in the Vuwani Magistrates Court today. Mojapelo said the motive for the incident was unknown. Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba warned villagers not to take the law into their own hands. Social development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale said: “We need to put an end to the senseless killing of children.”
