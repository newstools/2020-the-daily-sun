 A 43-year-old man is expected to appear in court this week
for allegedly stabbing his pregnant former wife to death. The man was arrested on Friday by detectives from the
Vredenburg police station. Western Cape police spokesperson FC van Wyk said the man was
arrested minutes after he allegedly killed his former wife. The 40-year-old victim was seven months pregnant. "Vredenburg police were notified of a murder that took
place in Greenfield Street, George Karrige, Vredenburg. When the members
arrived at the scene, they were notified that the suspect had fled the scene on
foot. "A quick chase ensued, and the suspect was found and
arrested in the vicinity of the crime scene. The suspect was removed from the
scene as female community members wanted to harm him," Van Wyk said. The man is expected to appear in the Vredenburg Magistrate's
Court on Monday on a charge of murder. SOURCE: NEWS24
