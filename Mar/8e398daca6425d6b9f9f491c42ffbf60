GOGO Lydia Ramokhele (61) was hit by a car and the accident was caught on camera in January. But the gogo said she had not had a visit from the cops about her case. She believes the police want the case to disappear. Her daughter Cecilia Ramokhele (27) said the investigating officer told her he was waiting for an email and thereafter a medical report. She wondered why the cop would not get the report himself. Daily Sun published the story on 27 January. In the video from 18 January, the gogo with a baby on her back comes out of a shop in Ventersburg, Free State, and is slammed against a wall by a car coming onto the pavement. Cecelia told Daily Sun the investigating officer said they wanted to see if the video was not edited. “I think this is just a delaying tactic. My mother was readmitted in hospital and could lose her legs.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the case would go back to the Ventersburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday. Pitiki Shuping (45), the owner of the car, faces a charge of defeating the ends of justice while the alleged driver at the time of the accident, Lerato Mosia (19), will appear on charges including failure to stop at an accident, driving without a driver’s licence, and reckless and negligent driving. “This case is receiving the necessary attention. The investigating officer took a statement from the victim at her home,” he said.
