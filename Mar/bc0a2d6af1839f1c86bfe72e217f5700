 Grayston Preparatory School in Sandton has closed for the
day, following concerns that one of its teachers had contact with 10 people who
recently returned from Italy. Three people in the group of 10 have tested positive for the
coronavirus. The Grayston teacher is reportedly in isolation and the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases contacted the teacher to request a test. Gauteng education spokesperson Steve Mabona said the
department was informed about the school's closure on Monday. He added that
officials would go to the school to get further information. Mabona said the health department would be best suited to
give further direction in the case. Oil fell by the most since 1991 on Monday after Saudi Arabia
started a price war with Russia by slashing its selling prices and pledging to
unleash its pent-up supply onto a market reeling from falling demand because of
the coronavirus outbreak. Lwazi Manzi, the spokesperson for Health Minister Zweli
Mkhize, told News24 that they were aware of the closure and would shed more
light later on Monday. On Thursday, it was confirmed that a 38-year-old Hilton
businessman who was part of the Italy travel group was South Africa' s first
coronavirus patient. A 39-year-old woman from Gauteng, who was part of the same
group, also tested positive, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Saturday. Then, on Sunday, the health ministry announced that the wife
of the first coronavirus patient had also tested positive. SOURCE: NEWS24
