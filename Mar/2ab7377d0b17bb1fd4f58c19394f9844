RIGHT in the middle of luxury developments is a run-down building housing government officials. The Gauteng Department of Education district building in Sandton, Joburg, is in a poor state and employees said they often got sick. Workers said they had been pleading with the department to fix the building for more than 10 years with no success. The building smells badly, the ceilings leak and electric wires covered in cellotape hang from the ceiling. The toilets are also broken and rats run around. On Thursday, workers belonging to Nehawu demonstrated outside the building. They claimed the department was paying monthly rent of R2 million on a month-to-month lease agreement. Union secretary and staff member Marvelous Ndlovu said:“We’re tired of sharing our workspace with rats. We’re walking coffins in this building. We want to be moved to a better place.” Nehawu chairman Kgatishi Lamola said people were suffering from infections.“Our offices are busy. We have a number of people walking in, including parents. This is unacceptable.” DA spokesman on education in Gauteng Khume Ramulifho said he’d take the matter up with provincial authorities. “All the fire extinguishers have expired. “Should a fire break out, it’s going to be a challenge,” he said. Ramulifho said the department had lost millions set aside for infrastructure. He said in November the department lost R250 million and last week Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi revealed in his budget speech that an extra R184 million was lost. “It doesn’t make sense to have a budget but you don’t use it.” The department had not responded to Daily Sun’s inquiry at the time of going to print.
