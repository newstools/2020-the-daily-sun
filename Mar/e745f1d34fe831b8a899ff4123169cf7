 Classes are expected to resume at the Tshwane University of Technology on Monday. This comes after all academic activities were suspended due to violent protests by the students. Students were unhappy with issues relating to funding and student housing. Varsity spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter said the management had deliberated on various issues that gave rise to the escalating student protest at various campuses. “Based on a thorough analysis of the situation an agreement was reached between management and students that all academic activities will resume on Monday, 2 March 2020,” Ruyter said. Pretoria West campus will remain closed as there is still a threat of protests from the campus. Ruyter said the University had resolved to attend to all issues raised by students. Ruyter said disciplinary actions would be taken against students who participated in activities of vandalism. “Management has also assured students that no action will be taken against those students who were engaged in organising the protest. “However, students involved in criminal activities such as vandalism and theft of books and products in our bookshops and cafeteria in Soshanguve will be handled in line with TUT policy,” Ruyter said.
