KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Midderndorp is not panicking after his side’s latest setback in the Absa Premiership which saw them miss an opportunity to pull further clear of their nearest chasers Mamelodi Sundowns. The German mentor belives the league is “a marathon, not a sprint.” He is confident that his charges will regain the form that got them to the summit of the Premiership standings in the first place. “I know it’s a marathon,” said Middendorp. “It’s a marathon for teams fighting to win the league at the end of the season and it’s a marathon for those fighting for survival at the bottom. “I have said it again and again that we are a work in progress. “We are coming from position nine last season, we do not believe that we are the kings or whatever. We never had that feeling. “We know that we have our quality and our right mindset, but it has to be brought into every match. “You don’t just snap your finger and win the league. I have never put that opinion into place. “I have always been aware that it will be a hard race, a marathon until the end of the season. It will be close.” Middendorp, however, admitted that he would like to see more consistency from his charges from now until the end of the season. Amakhosi have been unable to win more than two games on the spin in the league since the turn of the year, something that must be of concern to their fans. But Middendorp is not losing any sleep over it, at least not yet. “It is a normal run all over the world,” he insisted. “You have a number of games and you produce a good position then you have games where opponents are coming with a different approach. “Good, some players maybe are not producing their best performances at the moment, but this is normal. It is not unusual.”
