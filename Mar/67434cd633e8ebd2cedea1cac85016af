 The landlord and tenant relationship can be traced back to the 10th century. It is an intrinsic relationship that is here to stay, however it ultimately evolves. Landlords and tenants, as an inseparable pair, currently face a significant challenge. I write this article with conflicting feelings – on one hand being a landlord’s attorney and, on the other, as a tenant. While my primary aim is to consider the legal position, there are also practical suggestions to manage the relationship during this tumultuous time. In this unprecedented situation, it is natural that certain tenants will look to their landlords for assistance. The landlord’s position is, however, precarious, despite a popular misconception that landlords hold unlimited funds or can afford to withstand non-payment of rentals. Landlords pay rates and taxes, utilities consumed by their tenants at their properties, and other operational costs, including staff salaries. Most significantly, most landlords have substantial bond repayments and other debt instruments that they must service. The below information serves as a guide for tenants and landlords in these challenging times. One must regard the entire contents of this article to understand the legal position and, with understanding of the other side’s position, hopefully reach an amicable resolution to protect the symbiotic relationship between landlord and tenant. Contractual law and lease agreements In contractual law, generally, in the event of a vis major (synonymous with force majeure) – a superior power or force which cannot be resisted or controlled – the result is that one or both parties are excluded from liability and from fulfilling their contractual obligations. In my view, the Covid-19 outbreak, and the resultant government lockdown, fall within the definition of a vis major. Therefore, a tenant intending to rely on vis major to be exempt from paying rental (in full or partially) must prove that it did not have full beneficial occupation of the leased premises for a defined period. In this regard, the tenant might be entitled to a remission of rental for the number of days that they were unable to have full beneficial occupation of the leased premises. Most modern lease agreements contain a rental payment clause that excludes any deduction or set-off for any reason whatsoever. Furthermore, certain leases also specifically exclude liability against the landlord for any claim, of any nature, for any loss or damage suffered directly or indirectly by reason of vis major. In such cases, despite the lockdown, rental remains payable and the landlord is within its rights to claim payment. However, if the lease agreement does not contain a rental payment clause, as referred to above, a tenant without full beneficial occupation may seek a remission of rental.            It is important to note that the above is subject to careful consideration of each matter on a case by case basis and that there is no general rule or answer.  Finally, my advice is for everyone to communicate, be fair, respect and be kind to each other and work together to overcome this. Our actions now, as landlords and tenants, will set the foundation for our future beyond this crisis.  Liad Hadar is director at Hadar Incorporated – Property Law Specialists.
