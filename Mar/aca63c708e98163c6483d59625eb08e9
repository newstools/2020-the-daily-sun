ELMON Mdaka is an unhappy madala after petrol was poured on his son before being set alight, allegedly for a crime he didn’t commit. The 61-year-old from Kildare Trust, outside Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, said when two cops arrived at his house on Sunday looking for his son Isaac Mdaka (36), he didn’t know they wanted to throw him to the wolves. He said Isaac died like a dog and blamed the cops for not handling the situation well. The devastated father said he was surprised when he received a call from a resident telling him to rush to the scene where his son was being assaulted. “That afternoon I received a call informing me to rush to the police satellite station, where my son was being assaulted in front of the cops. When I got there I didn’t find anyone,” he said.  He said later he received another call informing him where his son had been taken and when he got there he found him still alive. But he was in pain after he was burnt with petrol. “The police also arrived with an ambulance and he was taken to Matikwane Hospital where he died on Monday,” he said. Elmon said post mortem results revealed Isaac died from head injuries after he was hit with a firearm.  “His death will haunt me forever. I wish to see the people responsible for his death being punished severely, even though I have lost hope in the police,” he said.  Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said two suspects were allegedly doused with petrol and burnt after being accused of stealing booze at a local tavern. “We have opened a case of kidnapping, attempted murder and murder and are busy with investigations.” He said no one has been arrested.
