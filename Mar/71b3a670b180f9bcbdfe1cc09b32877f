Dynamite definitely comes in small packages and Kabza De Small is living proof of that. Although he was not present at the Dstv Mzansi Viewer's Choice Awards on Saturday, he was victorious. The DJ walked away withÂ  two awards, one for Favourite DJ and another for Favourite Rising Star. Speaking through a recorded video, the star said he was grateful for winning the award, especially because it was his first. " This is a my first award since I started in the business. I'm grateful to everybody, who voted for me. This means a lot to me," he said. Moshe Ndiki, who scooped the Favourite Presenter Award said: "I would like to thank my mother, who is my best friend for everything. I love you".
