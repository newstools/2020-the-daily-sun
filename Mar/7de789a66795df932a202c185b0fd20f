MTHOBISI Khumalo from Protea Glen, Soweto, is one of many Mzansi bikers. The business owner also enjoys riding every week. Q: What is the make of your bike? A: I own a Suzuki Intruder M1800R 2017 model. Q: When did you buy it? A: I bought it last September. Q: Is it your first bike? A: No. It’s my third bike. Q: Is it your dream bike? A: Yes, it is. Q: Why this one specifically? A: It’s comfy, spacious, attractive, durable and reliable. Q: Does it have a pet name? A: Nope. I’ll have to think about it though. Q: Would you lend your bike to anyone? A: No. That’s risky business. Q: How do you keep it in ship shape? A: I always make sure I run the engine once a week for a few minutes. That helps recharge the battery. Q: How often do you ride? A: In the summer season I ride every weekend. Q: Are you a member of any club? A: No. I don’t even attend shows because I don’t have enough free time. Q: Do you have any traffic fines? A: Not at all. I’m always careful on the road. Q: What’s your advice to other bikers? A: Since most bike accidents happen on intersections, my advice to fellow bikers is to ride slowly when approaching an intersection. And make sure you keep your eyes on the road always. Q: Did you change anything on it? A: I haven’t changed anything. But I want to change the pedals. Q: Your take on the overall standard of driving in Mzansi? A: Many drivers are impatient on the road. They like speeding. Big car drivers think they own the road and make life difficult for bikers.
