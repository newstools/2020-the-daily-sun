The kidnapping of babies is getting worse. Imagine the stress and trauma families of kidnapped children go through. Child abduction is a growing concern and everyone needs to get involved. The government must launch public awareness campaigns similar to gender-based violence ones. Schools and other community-based organisations should also help spread the message. Parents, too, need to be more responsible and never leave their children alone in public places, strollers or cars. They should teach and warn kids about suspicious cars and people. The other problem is that abductors are sometimes people that are known to the victims. So, we need to be vigilant and make sure we know where our kids are at all times. Children are reported missing daily and it seems no one really pays attention until misfortune visits them. As for abductors, please leave other people’s children in peace. It’s not worth it to kidnap kids for money. Pretoria North
