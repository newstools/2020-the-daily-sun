CHILDREN played with the distribution box and plunged the entire kasi into darkness. Residents of Browns Farm block 6 in Philippi, Cape Town, started the lockdown on Friday after more than 100 shacks were left without electricity. Frustrated residents said they spent almost 24 hours without electricity and were worried the City of Cape Town was not going to fix the electricity. “Some of us bought lots of meat so we could cover the next 21 days without queueing at butcheries,” said Mqondisi Msizi (48). “We were panicking that the meat was going to rot. I’d have taken it to my sister in Gugulethu, but we were not allowed to walk around.” Resident Khawulezile Thabatha said when the electricity went off he saw kids running away from the distribution box. “I saw wires hanging loose,” said Thabatha. “I didn’t know they were live. The naughty kids plunged us into darkness.” Councillor Phindile Maxiti, the MMC for energy, said: “A child put a wire in a distribution box, causing a short circuit that tripped supply to more than 100 structures. “The wire was removed and the circuit breaker reset to restore electricity supply.” Maxiti said the community and parents must stop kids from playing with live electricity. “This time there was no fatality, but the child could have been electrocuted,” Maxiti told the People’s Paper. “Communities are reminded to watch what the children are doing and to treat electricity infrastructure as dangerous to avoid electrocutions.”
