REFUGEES are camping opposite the cop shop in the Cape Town CBD. On Monday, they clashed with police, leading to arrests. The refugees told the SunTeam they would not go back to their homes as they were victimised every day. Ismael Kazadi (51) said he left the DRC 17 years ago and had three kids born in Mzansi. “I have asylum papers but was never assisted by the government with papers to allow me to work. I opened a spaza shop and was robbed at gunpoint. I opened a case but it disappeared,” he said. Municipal officials yesterday met national government to discuss the issue. Refugees who gathered with their belongings near District Six Museum said they slept there. Hanaah Jubez (54) said: “If the government can’t help us, they must hand us over to the UN Commissioner of Refugees. Going back to our countries is scary, as is going back to the township.” Chairman of parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Bongani Bongo, called for an immediate resolution to the situation. “It’s untenable that this situation continues despite attempted interventions that have not yielded desirable results. We urge refugees to comply with the laws of the country and with the by-laws of the City of Cape Town.”
