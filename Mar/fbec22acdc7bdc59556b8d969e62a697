MAMELODI Sundowns have no business appointing referees.Their business will be on the Lucas Moripe Stadium pitch when they cross swords with Al Ahly in a battle for a semifinal spot in the Caf Champions League on Saturday afternoon (3pm). This is according to Downs coach Pitso Mosimane while responding to questions that Ahly has expressed concern with the designation of Bakary Gassama for the power-keg.The Egyptians lead the tie 2-0, but Sundowns are looking to overturn the deficit in the return leg at home.  "I don’t want to go to Al Ahly’s unhappiness with the referee," retorted Mosimane." As Mamelodi Sundowns we don’t play in that space. "We are a football team. We appoint referees now?“We don’t want to be part of that. We want to play because the referee doesn’t score goals for you." Mosimane, however, has vouched for Gassama, pointing to his vast officiating experience. "For me Gassama is a very credible guy. He is strong and professional. He went to the World Cup. Unless if there is reference for them to say 'in this game he did this or that' against them."
