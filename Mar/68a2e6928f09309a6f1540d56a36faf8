HIGHLANDS Park coach Owen da Gama says management have taken pre-cautious measures to ensure his players are protected from the pandemic coronavirus that has swept the world by storm. The Premier Soccer League have banned the traditional pre-match handshake amid fears over the spread of coronavirus. Da Gama revealed yesterday during the Nedbank Cup media briefing ahead of their quarterfinals match with Mamelodi Sundowns in Makhulong on Saturday that their  medical team are ready to combat the spread of virus. Said Da Gama: “We are very concerned, we have actually taken measures to bring in sanitary, treated towelling for the boys. We try not to shake hands and touch faces. If a player comes and has a bit of fever we send him immediately to the doctor.” Da Gama revealed that they sent other players who had flu symptoms to the doctor to ensure it’s not the pandemic virus. “We ensure that as soon as players come in (training) and they are not feeling okay the Physio takes their temperature and send them immediately to the doctor. So, we don’t take any chances because we are scared it will spread. Hopefully this pandemic doesn’t fly out of proportion, it gets controlled and we can move on normally after this. Da Gama says if the disease spread throughout the country, the PSL must suspend the league since it’s not worth it to play in front of empty stadiums. “If it starts spreading uncontrollably then I think football should be suspended. It’s just my personal opinion, obviously the authority will make the decision. But I think it should be suspended because playing in front of empty stadiums is not what football is about. Football is about the support, the guys playing and being motivated to play.
