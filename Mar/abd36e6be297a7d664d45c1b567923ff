Mamelodi Sundowns' dream of adding a second CAF star to their jersey went up in smoke after they were defeated 3-1 on aggregate by Al Alhy. Sundowns were beaten 2-0 in the first leg in Cairo last week, giving the Egyptian club a place on the driver's seat. On Saturday, in the return match played at the Lucas Moripe Stadium, Sundowns pressed hard but luck was not on their side. As they pushed for an early goal, Sundowns' forward Lebogang Maboe gifted Al Ahly an own goal that really sucked the life out of Pitso Mosimane's boys. The South Africans did not give up and put more pressure on the Egyptians. Gaston Sirino equalised to make 1-1 in the 27th minute but it was not enough for the Brazilians to unsettle the visitors who clearly parked the bus and defended their two goal lead.
