EVEN though natural hair is embraced more and more in Mzansi, there are still a great number of myths surrounding ethnic hair, and how to take care of it. Some people say natural hair is purely worn for political reasons – and others believe it’s hard to deal with. There are many other misconceptions held by thousands of men and women who don’t appreciate their natural hair. Here are five of the most common natural hair myths: Natural hair is strong Since natural hair looks strong people assume its texture is thick and luscious. But natural hair is actually quite fragile, since the strands are weaker due to the way they curl and bend. Natural hair is not versatile There are various different, unique hairstyles that can be executed with natural hair like Bantu knots, braids, cornrows and perms. The longer your hair, the more style options you have. Natural hair is unmanageable This is only true if you don’t have proper knowledge. But when you know how to take care of your curls, they just need time and tender loving care. Natural hair doesn’t grow fast Natural hair tends to shrink, which prevents you from seeing its actual length. But it does grow quickly as people who relax their hair know – every six to eight weeks they have to do touch-ups because of all the new hair. Natural hair isn’t washed regularly Hair should be washed often. Contrary to mainstream beliefs that black hair doesn’t like water, washing hair regularly actually stimulates hair growth and removes oil build-up on the scalp.
