Seasoned broadcaster Masecha Ndlovu has received backlash after she shared a video of musician Lindo Sithole and his child having a discussion about the Coronavirus. Taking to Twitter Masechaba, who was recently appointed the spokesperson to the Minster of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa, captioned the video and said: “The message is simple.” In the now deleted video, Lindo and his son Valdo can be seen and heard speaking “Chinese” discussing the coronavirus with subtitles at the bottom for those who cannot understand their “Chinese.” When baby Valdo asked his dad if he has heard about the deadly virus, and his dad responds and says yes, you must always have a sanitizer with you and they go on to talk about the masks and how to greet people without shaking their hands. Shortly after sharing the video, Masechaba received a lot of backlash from people on social media and some even called her irresponsible, while some demanded that she takes it down as they sighted that the video was 'racist' and offensive to the Chinese people. Some went as far as saying Masechaba was being reckless as she is now a government employee, the tweet was up for about two hours and she then deleted. This is the second time received backlash on social media since appointed earlier this month. She was previously dragged for tweeting that the death toll of Covid-19 in the country at the time had risen to 119 while there were no recorded deaths at the time. SEE VIDEO BELOW:
