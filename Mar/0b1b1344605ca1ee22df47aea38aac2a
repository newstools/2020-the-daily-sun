GOGO Dorah Makhado says her sleepwalking disorder is putting her life in grave danger. The 76-year-old from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “People want to kill me because of it. They say I’m evil. They think I’m a witch.” The gogo said she had no control over the disorder, called somnambulism. She said she sometimes opened the door in the middle of the night and started walking around the neighbourhood in her sleep. “It doesn’t happen every day. But when it does, people who see me make up stories about me. “I heard that when some of my neighbours saw me walking around in the middle of the night, they thought I was up to no good. Rumours started flying. Whenever there’s a problem ekasi, I get blamed.” Gogo Dorah said what hurt the most was that rumours were first started by a close woman friend. She said she feared residents would attack her one day. Hlengiwe Mazibuko (31), who rents a shack in the gogo’s yard, said she had never seen her sleepwalking. “But I’ve heard the rumours and I fear for her life,” she said. Dr Mike Khoza from Soweto told the SunTeam sleepwalking was most common in children but also happened among adults. “It usually occurs one or two hours after falling asleep. It may involve unusual behaviour such as climbing out of the window or opening a door and going out. “Sleepwalking is usually a harmless, random event. Medication and hypnosis may help.” Sangoma Jabulani Mthumunye said it could be a sign the gogo’s ancestors wanted to use her. “When she walks at night, she’s supposed to go and meet them,” she said. The gogo told Daily Sun she had visited several sangomas, who told her she might have a calling.
