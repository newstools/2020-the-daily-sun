PEOPLE will always have opinions when it comes to national team selection. But that does not and will not deter Molefi Ntseki from picking whoever he sees worthy of a place in the Bafana Bafana squad. The Bafana coach has come in for heavy criticism for picking the likes of Itumeleng Khune and Thabo Matlaba in his recent squad for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, which have since been canned due to the Covid-19 outbreak. He was also questioned for omitting youngsters such as Maritzburg United defender Rushine de Reuck. But he has maintained his selection is influenced by the opponent he faces and that he will continue to pick players as he sees fit. “As South Africans we always have something to say, ” said Ntseki. “Whether you do it right or not, someone will say it is not right. People will always question your selection. But what is important is for us to understand the reason behind the selection. ”Not all of us will have an opportunity to learn and know why certain players are not picked. I haven’t had enough time to explain my selection, particularly of some players, who we’ve brought back, the players who were here before but were out of Bafana for years like Thabo Matlaba.” With Thapelo Morena out on a long injury lay-off, Matlaba was expected to fill his void, bringing with him mostly the experience he gained in the Caf Champions League with Orlando Pirates. “He was going to fit in well in the system we wanted to play against Ghana as well as Sao Tome, ” explained Ntseki. “He can play as a winger and a fullback in one game. “The approach was going to be a high intensity one, with players who are naturally speedy and aggressive in terms of their game model. “We really wanted to play the back-to-back matches against Sao Tome and Principe before we faced Ghana.”
