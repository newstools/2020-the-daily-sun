COSAFA’s most successful coach, Sunday Chidzambwa of Zimbabwe, is encouraging the football community throughout Southern African, but particularly all supporters, to heed the advice and instruction of authorities as the battle to contain the coronavirus continues. Chidzambwa was speaking as Zimbabwe enters a 21-day lockdown from Monday, aimed at curbing the spread of the deadly virus in the country. “The best thing for fans as we go forward is to listen to what the authorities have to say,” Chidzambwa says. “If they say stay at home, then we must heed that advice. Already it is clear we have to avoid gatherings altogether,” he said. Chidzambwa was an international star for his country before coaching Zimbabwe to the COSAFA Cup title and going undefeated through 21 games in the competition. His record is unmatched in the annual Southern African championship and unlikely to ever be broken. His last coaching assignment was with Zimbabwe at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt last July. “Unfortunately, because of the virus, the new season has yet to get underway in Zimbabwe. It was supposed to start after the CHAN tournament but now we have to wait and see.”
