Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, is offering to fund financially struggling students at the University of KZN. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, Duduzane can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but he cannot fool all the people all the time. What he is trying to do is clean his image in light of the evidence of corruption implicating his partners in crime, the Guptas, at the Zondo Commission. This is dirty money he accumulated through corruption. He wants people to see him as the good guy even though he and the Guptas bled our country dry. We canâ€™t allow a corrupt man to be crowned a hero.
