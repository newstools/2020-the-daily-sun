MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is confident that his side can still book their berth in the semi-finals of the Caf Champions League. The Tshwane giants were beaten 2-0 by Al Ahly in the first leg of the tie played at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday. Downs now have a mountain to climb at home if they are to progress to the last 4 of the competition.Mosimane, however, believes his side can turn things around, especially with their home fans behind them. The second leg takes place at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. “You can say whatever you say but it is difficult inside there," said Mosimane. “But I think we played well, I’m okay. It’s just that it will be difficult to turn the result around. We have to turn the volume up in Pretoria. We have to score, we have no other option. “Congratulations to Al Ahly, they are a good team. They pushed us back. We did not sit back because we wanted to, they pushed us back. The game would have been different had we scored the chance we created in the first 20 seconds of the match. “It’s going to be a different story in Pretoria, it won’t be like you see here. I can’t explain it. Sometimes we score three, sometimes we can get more. It happens. We scored 11 in one match the other time. We can get two.
