Convicted rapist Sibusiso Mashaba has been sentenced to
25 years in prison after he was found guilty on three rape charges. The 22-year- old man from Dwarsloop outside Bushbuckridge
in Mpumalanga pleaded not guilty when he appeared before Magistrate Betty
Lesufi in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe on Friday 20 March. He denied raping anyone and said that the victims made up
stories against him so that he could be arrested. “I don’t know the victims and I want this court to
believe me that I was shocked when I was arrested and charged for the crime I
didn’t commit," he told the court. But earlier, the court heard Sibusiso had targeted the
victims who were coming from local taverns and traditional ceremonies in
Dwarsloop when he raped three girls aged between 13 and 16, on separate
incidents. He held them at knife point before dragging them into
bushes. The alleged crimes were reported to have happened between
2012 and 2014. The court further heard the man was arrested after the
police managed to link him with DNA results. Magistrate Betty lesufi said the victims had sustained
similar injuries which indicated that the accused used the same methods when he
committed those rapes before sentencing him to 25 years direct imprisonment.
