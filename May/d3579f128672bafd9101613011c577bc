UMALUSI may struggle to perform its function of quality assurance if it continues to be underfunded. This was revealed yesterday at a joint committee of the portfolio committee on basic education and the select committee on education, technology, sport, arts and culture. It emerged that Umalusi had experienced a budget cut of 2%, meaning there was a shortage of R7,07 million. CEO Mafu Rakometsi said: “Quality insurance will bleed if the budget cuts are not confronted.” Rakometsi said the cuts had already led to the loss of skilled staff members. The committees issued a statement yesterday, saying Umalusi and the basic education department were considering alternative funding models. “The committees are concerned by Umalusi’s high staff turnover and the fact that Umalusi is unable to retain the high level of skills needed in the council,” read the statement. The committees were told Umalusi would continue to engage with the department on ways to respond to lockdown, but quality would not be compromised on the exams. Rakometsi highlighted the importance of maintaining education standards and said Umalusi won’t allow pupils to be stigmatised for not having covered the full scope of work.
