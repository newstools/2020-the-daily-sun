The radio presenter (34) from Matlhonyane Village in Mahikeng, North West, said he promoted the language through radio. “There’s power in speaking our own languages. My mum is Xhosa and my dad is Tswana. We speak both languages at home,” said LTK, as listeners know him. He hosts Gotetsa Mosha on weekday from 3pm to 6pm on Mahikeng FM. Last month, he was joined by Motsoaledi Setumo as part of the new line-up. LTK said they promoted the idea to youth that they must never lose hope. “We invite people doing incredible things on to our show to encourage those who might have given up to stand up again.” LTK also hosts Diabalola every Saturday from 9am to noon. In the first hour, he invites different DJs to show off their talents. The last two hours have top 20 countdowns for both local and international music. LTK’s radio career started in 2007 on Mahikeng FM community radio station, where he ended up as station manager. Listeners will remember him on the afternoon drive show, Capital City. “In the beginning, life was tough. I used to struggle with money for the taxi and for lunch,” said the North West University BA graduate. “People said I wouldn’t make it, but my passion and drive kept me going.” LTK said he was one of the first DJs to play Cassper Nyovest’s single Uwrongo. “It has never been released but it played on my show and he performed it in Mahikeng in 2007 and 2008.” LTK has been presenting the same shows for the past five years. He serves his Tswana listeners very well and won an award for the best afternoon presenter this year. “I’m honoured to have positive reviews. Teaming up with Motsoaledi, who plays Mmabatho on The Queen, will put the show on another level. Together we’ll grow our mother tongue.”
