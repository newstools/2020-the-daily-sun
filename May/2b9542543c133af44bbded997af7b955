Needy families from Verda Farm between Hartebeesfontein and Ottosdal in the North West received food parcels. Nelson Mandela Foundation made sure that they meet those families half away by assisting with their needs. On Friday, the Foundation's CEO Sello Hatang national rugby squad captain Siya Kolisi (Kolisi Foundation) and the local businessman Licks Maichotlo (Maichotlo Foundation) donated with food parcels, vegetables, sanitary towels, clothes together with masks to those families. Hatang said a call to his office was made by a Khuma activist Jomo Miya. "After receiving this call, I then spoke to Mr Maichotlo who assisted with all resources to these destitute families as he's always helping," Hatang said. Miya said a request was made by that farm's Phakela Primary School principal Nthoto Ramatisa. Ramatisa said: "We do have a high number of pupils without birth certificates at this school, because of their parents who don't have IDs and unemployed. And that is why we need help, but for now I thank everyone who assisted us now." Ramatisa needs help from Home Affairs and Social Development departments. These farm community members said they haven't received food parcels from government this year. Ramojaki Lerwele (56) who is staying in a mud house said:"I'm staying with my wife and our two children, but there's no one working as we survive with their social grants. These food and clothes will help us a lot." Keikantseng Diamond (53) said she's also unemployed and now depending on her relatives. The two together with others said principal Ramatisa is helping them with food mosly, but also with temporary jobs at school.
