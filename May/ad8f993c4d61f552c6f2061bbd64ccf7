Personal care services such as hairdressers, beauty services and tattoo
parlours will remain closed under level 3 of the national lockdown, according
to new regulations. Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma, gazetted the rules on Thursday ahead of a media address. While much of the economy will start to open up next month, some
exclusions will remain for health reasons.Â 
Cigarette sales remain prohibited, but South Africans will again be able
to buy alcohol, subject to some restrictions. Restaurants, bars and taverns will also remain closed, except for the
delivery or collection of food or alcohol in some cases. Conferences, events,
entertainment and sporting activities remain banned. An urgent court bid has been launched at the Western Cape High Court to
allow hairdressers to be able to trade, under strict conditions during
lockdown, News24 previously reported. Lynne Corby, owner of Sculptures Hairdressing in East London, told Fin24
that she had to rely on the UIF TERS benefit to pay 12 of her staff but it has
been challenging to get funds. She has also had to pay the remaining six of her
staff who do not qualify for UIF benefits from her own pocket. "If this
carries on much longer I will have to close business," she said. In her address on Thursday afternoon Dlamini-Zuma said that the peak of
Covid-19 infections in South Africa is still on the horizon. As the country
transitions to level 3, efforts must be ramped up to contain the spread of
infections and prevent deaths. SOURCE: NEWS24
