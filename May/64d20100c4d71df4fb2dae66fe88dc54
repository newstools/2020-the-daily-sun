Bongo Muffin's Stoan Seate is worried about the instability of the entertainment industry. The DJ, presenter and MC said the R150 million relief fund for entertainers was not enough.Yesterday, Seate was speaking about his 45th birthday and that he was also celebrating his 25th year in the industry. Stoan also said that the industry was unkind to  him as a father who needed to provide for his family. "I feel blessed God has given me so much life and has brought me this far. And as some of you might have noticed, I have been off social media for a few weeks." He said the entertainment industry and hospitality sector were the hardest hit in this crisis and will be the last to recover. "I’ve seen what the government tried to do but we all know it’s not even nearly enough. I don’t see the proportionality reflected in the minister’s efforts. "R150million is hardly enough for all these artists and this is made exponentially worse by the fact that the money has to be shared with all the sports people. This is a reflection of the amount of value that government and the society attach to us and this is just not enough. "So for the first time in my 25-year career, I have to admit my family’s financial future no longer lies in the music entertainment industry. This is a heartbreaking admission for me to make, especially after investing more than half my life and best years in this." Stoan said he was shooting a new TV show in line with his passion for helping those less fortunate.
