AFTER living with HIV for 22 years, media personality Criselda Kananda has decided to take ARVs. Taking to Instagram, the activist, who’s been open about her status and journey of living with the virus, said this was a difficult time for immunocompromised people. “For many people living with HIV, diabetes and cancer survivors, including many others who have immunocompromised health, this is a difficult period for us,” she wrote. She said the constant cleaning of surfaces, sanitising, disinfecting and covered breathing had unintended consequences. “The immune system becomes lazy, giving strength to any existing bugs in our bodies,” said Criselda. She thanked those who had been supportive when she announced she’s coronavirus free. She said her fighter cells have been disarmed. “The HIV in my body is having a live concert. This means I have to start ARVs after 22 years of living healthy with HIV. “My immune system now needs help. The next six weeks are going to be hard, but with God on my side, I can face anything and any enemy,” she said. Criselda said she forgave all those who have been saying she wasn’t telling the truth about her status. “Finally to those who’ve been spread silly gossip about me lying about being HIV positive simply because I knew and shared how to take care of myself, I forgive you,” she said. When approached by Daily Sun for comment, Criselda said: “I don’t like prolonging these discussions. “I am not willing to talk about that post because my aim was to teach, but people have turned things around and comment awfully.”
