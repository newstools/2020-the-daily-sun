FORMER Comrades Marathon champion and Nedbank Running Club team manager, Nick Bester, said it would be better to cancel this year’s race and not raise hopes that the iconic event can still take place. Last week, Athletics SA and the Comrades Marathon Association board announced that the event, which was scheduled for 14 June, had been postponed until further notice. The organisers are looking at staging the racepossibly mid-September or early October. But Bester, who won the Ultimate Human Race in 1991, said he can’t see the race taking place this year. “Let’s face it, COVID-19 is not going anywhere anytime soon. “Postponing the race raises the athletes’ hopes. “I think the year is gone and we won’t be able to run the race. I think it’s better to cancel the race altogether,” said Bester. The Nedbank Running team, also known as the Dream Team, made a clean sweep at the Comrades event last year. Edward Mothibe won the men’s race, while Gerda Steyn took the ladies’ crown. The Dream Team have dominated the Comrades race over the past few years and Bester said his runners from all over the world always look forward to taking part in the event. But the soft-spoken former ultra-marathon runner doesn’t see this year’s race happening. Steyn has gone to Dubai and is training hard, while the other runners are training by themselves in Mzansi and in other parts of the world. “It’s not only the Comrades that’s affected by this. I don’t think there’ll be any single road running event taking place this year. “The coronavirus is not going to go away just like that,” warned Bester. The Dream Team has registered over 5 000 runners. Some of them have signedsix- to 12-month contracts. The bank has agreed to pay them monthly, despite the lack of running events. “Yes, we’re still paying them and will do so until the end of their contracts. “We keep them busy with raising awareness on COVID-19, sharing videos of them training online, Facebook and Instagram,” said Bester.
