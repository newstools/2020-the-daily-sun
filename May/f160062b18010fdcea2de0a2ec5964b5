WHILE the fight against the coronavirus pandemic is getting tougher, Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba commissioned the use of new testing laboratories for COVID-19. There are only two laboratory machines in the whole of Limpopo, with one being in Mankweng Hospital and the other in Pietersburg Provincial Hospital. Ramathuba says the machine in Mankweng is Roche Cobas, which is big with high volumes and can test 300 to 400 samples a day, while Pietersburg Hospital has a GeneXpert assay that takes an hour to produce results. "These machines will assist us to fast track the COVID-19 tests samples as they come, and results will be issued within an hour. "We will no longer have to refer samples taken at these hospitals to the National Health Laboratory for testing and wait for the results," MEC Ramathuba said. She added that the Roche Cobas machine in Mankweng Hospital is already functional and as a result, they saw a huge improvement in the number of tests conducted during the massive screening and testing campaign.
