VILLAGERS went on the rampage after a girl went missing and torched her lover’s home. Morongwa Marakalala (14) was last seen leaving her home in Silbermine Village, outside Bochum in Limpopo, last Tuesday. The 18-year-old lover apparently admitted he’d been with her. He’d later walked her home, and that was the last time he saw her. Morongwa’s sister Charlotte (33) said: “I don’t live at home and didn’t know she was dating. What matters now is that we find her alive. “We’ve been looking for her for a while and are worried something bad happened.  Resident Phuti Hlako (36) said the boyfriend’s story didn’t make sense.  Cops apparently took the lover and his gogo to a place of safety after residents held a meeting on Sunday and attacked their house on Monday. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that a missing persons case was being investigated. Mojapelo said an arson case was opened after a house was set alight. “Out team has been in the area looking for the girl,” he said. Meanwhile, concerned residents pleaded with anyone with information regarding Morongwa’s whereabouts to call Power Marakalala on 076 371 9367.
