THIS was just one big happy family with no worries. But all that vanished when the landslide destroyed their home. Their happiness was quickly turned into misery. The family of five from Chesterville in Durban were living in the big five rooms which were safe and enough for everyone. But now they must squash like sardines in a bedroom that's left over after the landslide on Saturday. Family member Nonto Khumalo (28) said they were just preparing for dinner in the kitchen when the tragedy struck. “We thank God that no one was in the rooms that were destroyed. When we heard the noise and shaking, we quickly ran outside and that’s when we saw that the retaining wall fell on our house. The wall also smashed two cars beyond repairs,” she said. Nonto said the wall destroyed two bedrooms and a sitting room. She said the only part of the house that was not damage was the kitchen and one bedroom. “Now we use one bedroom, but we are scared because the land continues to slide. We fear that it might bury us while we are sleep. We have nowhere to go,” said Nonto. She added that they would appreciate if they could get help from the municipality. She said: “We would appreciate it if they could come and help to pull the sand out and help to rebuild the retaining wall since we can’t afford,” she said. She said they have since written an email to the municipality, but they had not received any response. The ward councillor Mveli Mthembu said the family needs to be patient because he and the different departments are working on the matter. “I went there when the house was damaged. I called the disaster team, electricity, and housing department to assist the family. The family wants everything to be rushed. They need to understand that it's a process and we are working on this matter. “There will be some delays because of the lockdown that started last month some people are not back at work,” he said.
