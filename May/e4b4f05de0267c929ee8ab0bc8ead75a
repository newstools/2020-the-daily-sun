BLACK LEOPARDS coach Allan Clark says playing their remaining home matches behind closed doors won’t affect his charges’ performance. The PSL has yet to decide when action will resume as the league was suspended as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Although the league is still to decide how the season will be completed, it’s highly unlikely fans will be allowed to rally behind their teams at stadiums. Lidoda Duvha have always given opponents a tough time whenever they play in front of their fans in Thohoyandou, Venda. The vocal fans are like a 12th player on the pitch in a bid to help their team avoid the relegation axe hovering above their heads. Leopards are bottom of Absa Premiership table with 20 points and six matches remaining. They are three points behind second bottom AmaZulu, who are tied on equal points with Polokwane City and Baroka FC. Said Clark: “The players are training daily at home and they are doing their best to maintain fitness. It’s difficult to say whether the team will struggle without fans or not as we don’t know under what condition they will allow us to restart the season. “We will see what is recommended by the league and what we are allowed to do. We will wait for the PSL to decide and for us, our duty is to ensure we improve on the pitch even when our fans watch on TV.” Clark emphasised that his charges have equal opportunity to retain their PSL status like a team in the top eight or challenging for the title. “We are all in the same place (not training on pitch) which doesn’t give anyone an advantage or disadvantage. We will start the same and suffer the same. “I hope we will be allowed more subs (five instead of three to protect player welfare) like in Europe because we need to be mindful of players.”
