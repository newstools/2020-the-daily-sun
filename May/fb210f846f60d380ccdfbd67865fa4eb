IT’S their duty to bust anyone who breaks the law and not break it themselves. The drama unfolded when two cops found a man in possession of a stolen cellphone. But the officers didn’t take the suspect into custody. Instead, they allegedly demanded that he give them R1 000 so he could get away. Now the officers are now paying the price. Instead of the suspect landing behind bars, the officers found themselves locked up. This is because when the cops demanded money from the suspect, he reported them to their superiors. An investigation was launched and it led to the cops’ arrest. “We can say that they were bust by the thug,” said a Vosloorus policeman. He said this should be a lesson to other cops not to take or demand bribes. The Hawks said two Vosloorus cops attached to detective services were arrested for corruption. “Two members allegedly demanded an amount of R1 000 on 30 April from a person who was suspected of having bought a stolen cellphone. “Then the suspect alerted the branch commander colonel who ensured the matter is escalated to the Hawks,” said the Hawks. “On Tuesday afternoon, the Hawks conducted an operation after entrapment in terms of Section 252A of the Criminal Procedure Act was approved. Members were entrapped and arrested at Chris Hani mall. “They are currently being processed by the Hawks at Vosloorus Police Station.”
