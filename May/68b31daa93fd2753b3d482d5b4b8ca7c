DA TSHWANE mayoral candidate Randall Williams has announced his vision for the city. Williams held a virtual briefing yesterday after a North Gauteng High Court decision found the Tshwane council had been unlawful dissolved. Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebohang Maile had pointed to challenges, which led to government placing the city under administration. But last week the court found the decision unlawful and ruled in the DA’s favour. Williams said his party was ready to serve the people of Tshwane. “Through a stringent plan, we’ll demonstrate leadership in containing the virus, prioritise health and social development, and source protective equipment and training,” he said. “We will capacitate clinics to expand testing and treatment for residents, and increase funding to support vulnerable groups and NGOs providing social relief.” Williams said his party will also introduce alternative grants to support poor communities. He said the DA aimed for 90% of street lights to be lit at all times and to prioritise provision of water and electricity. “We intend to expand our safety offering by an inner city patrol unit, counter cable theft and illegal dumping, have crime prevention strategies to combat drugs, and ensure speedy prosecutions.”
