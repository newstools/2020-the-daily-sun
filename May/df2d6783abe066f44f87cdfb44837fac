VIOLET Kobe’s family is at the mercy of a fence keeping an electricity pole up above her house. The 54-year-old mum from Ga-Ramaswikana Village in Ga-Kibi, Limpopo, told Daily Sun she’d been reporting the matter since the pole was damaged in a heavy storm in November, but the Blouberg Municipality hadn’t done anything about it. Violet said she feared the pole could collapse at any time, causing damage to her home or even killing her family. She said neighbourhood kids played on the street every day and some of them had started climbing the pole. “The pole’s carrying a live power line. If one of the children touches the line by mistake, we will definitely have a death.” Violet said she didn’t understand why technicians were taking so long to replace the pole as they had assessed the damage a day after the storm. Another villager, Morris Makhura (55), said he was disappointed that the municipality was not concerned about the safety of its residents. “This is very serious and needs urgent attention. It’s surprising to see the municipality ignoring the situation, which is posing a threat to the villagers’ lives. “The power line is live and it’s carrying electricity for the street. “Imagine what would happen if it fell on someone,” he said. Municipal spokesman Peter Moruthane said he was not aware of the situation. “We didn’t know about the matter and we have just started investigations. We learnt the matter was only reported to a ward committee member. “The issue is now being addressed as a matter of urgency and a technical team will soon be sent to fix the damaged pole,” he said.
