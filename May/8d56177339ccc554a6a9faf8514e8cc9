A TAXI driver is fighting for his life in hospital after he lost control of his minibus yesterday. The taxi was allegedly being chased by cops before hitting the Acornhoek Mall fence and bursting into flames. Mishack Shai (37), who sustained severe head injuries, was rescued by a worker who pulled him out of the vehicle before calling an ambulance that rushed him to hospital. His brother Glen Shai (28) from Casteel Village told Daily Sun they were shocked to hear what happened. “When we arrived at the scene, the minibus was covered by giant flames. Mishack is in deep pain and suffered severe head injuries,” said Glen. He said what worries them the most is the taxi put food on the table but now that it’s damaged, life will be difficult. “We’re just grateful Mishack is still alive. If it wasn’t for the worker who pulled him out, he could have been dead.” He said his brother was on his way to be on the queue at a nearby taxi rank. “Mishack told us police claimed they were chasing him after trying to stop him. That’s when they shot at the rear wheel and he lost control of the vehicle and crashed.” Centre manager Matimba Ngwenya said the driver was injured after his taxi crashed into the mall fence before it caught fire. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of reckless and negligence driving has been opened. About the chase between the victim and the cops, Hlathi said: “We don’t want to divert our focus because of allegations on aspects related to the investigation underway. Anything unbecoming will be revealed through investigations.”
