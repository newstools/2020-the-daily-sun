Hello Parents and parents to be. In the last few weeks all our lives have changed profoundly – and we and our children have to learn to navigate it safely. Regular washing of hands, wearing face masks and staying at home has become the new norm. The South African lockdown has been re-phased to Level 4, this means a selection of companies will be resuming work and more of us will be going back to work. If you are a parent or parent to be that is returning to work, you have to take extra precautionary measures to avoid being infected or infecting your loved ones at home. I got to talk to Doctor Thulja Trikamjee a specialist paediatrician as well as one of the experts on the panel of PURITY Journey Journal App™, about what precautions you should be taking when you return to work or go out in public more often. Here are some precautions Dr Trikamjee advises you should take and some of the changes to your routine you should make: Since we are heading to the influenza season, adding some Vitamin C, for example, oranges and lemons to your diet might also help with boosting your immune system. Taking an affordable Vitamin C or Zinc supplement may also keep your immune system nice and strong during the changing of season. I hope that these precautionary tips will help in keeping you and your loved ones safe. Get more articles written by experts and track your little one’s milestones on the PURITY Journey Journal App™.
