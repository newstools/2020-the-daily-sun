An Indonesian fashion designer is selling a handbag he claims is made out of a human spine and alligator tongues. The bag reportedly costs $5 000 and was legally bought from a Canadian company. The designer Arnold Putra advertised the handbag on his Instagram feed and it got a lot of traction. Insider reported that Arnold said he sourced the spine through medical surplus, but he wouldn't say whether it came from a child or not. Putra lives a flamboyant lifestyle, full of exotic travel, luxury, and high fashion. Putra has been pictured with fashion celebrities like Michèle Lamy on his profile @arnoldputra, which has been made private. The designer said it was possible to buy bones from licensed companies that receive human specimens donated to science and sometimes sell them as surplus. Putra told Insider that it’s part of a creative learning process that should involve opposition, otherwise it would just be a form of repeated validation. Alligator tongue basket bag.
