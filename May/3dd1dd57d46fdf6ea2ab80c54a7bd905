Taking care of your nails at home is important. Nails can be neglected, look dull, brittle and unhealthy. Here are a few ways to keep your nails healthy while you’re at home. Eat a healthy diet As with most aspects of our bodies, we get the best results from eating a well-balanced, vitamin-rich diet. Vitamin deficiencies show up quickly as weakened, brittle fingernails or pits in the nail. Keep your natural nails trimmed If you’ve ever had long nails, then you’ve almost certainly suffered from a broken nail at some point. Broken nails are painful! Keeping your nails trimmed and short will ensure you don’t have to deal with a broken nail. Moisturise Make sure you keep moisturising dry hands and nails with moisturising cream. Clean your natural nails with baking soda Regular handwashing is great for keeping the surface of your nails clean, but they will need some extra attention to get them clean and white underneath. The best way to clean them is to dip a wet toothbrush into baking soda and scrub under each nail. You can also add a few drops of lemon juice if you need the extra whitening power. File your natural nails the right way Filing your nails the wrong way and too roughly can damage your nails. Nails should only be filed in one direction, as sawing back and forth weakens the nail. Try buffing Buffing is the process of polishing your fingernails until they shine. If you want a more professional or smooth look, using a nail buffer is worth a try. Use caution though, because too much buffing undermines the natural strength of your nail. Wear gloves when cleaning and doing household chores If you don’t already, you really should consider wearing gloves for protection. Household chemicals can weaken and stain your nails with consistent use.
