Connie and Shona Ferguson finally respond to the controversy that always follows them, firing people. They were live on Instagram with Themba Ndaba who plays Brutus on their telenovela, The Queen. Someone in the comment section asked why they always fire people and the couple responded. Connie said: "Guys this is a soap, it's a telenovela okay? Characters come and go, that's how soap operates. It's for a story, sometimes to introduce another story, but characters come and go. This is not just something that's exclusive to The Queen, it happens everywhere and it happens all the time." Shona also added: "I hope you're answered. I think that's what people don't know. The reality of what we do is you are going to see new people in and out. It's the nature of storytelling. I mean people forget because when they watch a show, they get to a point where they say they are tired of the same people." He said for people to see new characters, somebody has to go. Themba jokingly responded saying, "Hopefully it's not me." We hope Mzansi understands the Fergusons' reasons for firing people. Read:Â ENCA'S CATHY MOHLAHLANA BAGS RADIO GIG!
