A BUSINESSMAN (66) is glad to be alive after he escaped death by inches. He told Daily Sun a gang of thugs disguised as cops and soldiers fired shots at him at Rolle Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, last Sunday at about 10pm. The businessman had gone to check on his businesses when a Toyota Hilux Legend 50 drove past. “Suddenly, the people inside the van started firing shots and swearing at me,” he said. “Realising my life was in danger, I returned fire. But they continued shooting at me as they fled. COPS BUST FOR TJOTJO “I followed them in my car until they abandoned the bakkie. I think they thought I was a cop from a task force and they fled.” Shaken, he drove straight to the Mhala cop shop but police allegedly refused to help.  “They said I must first pay them a lot of money to give to their families in case they got killed by the criminals,” he said. “I’m really disappointed with our police. They continue to demand bribes and don’t care about the safety of residents.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a misconduct case was registered after a businessman alleged that a charge office cop apparently demanded a R4 million bribe. An attempted murder case was opened and investigations were under way.
