AmaZulu caretaker coach Ayanda Dlamini has distanced himself from allegations made by a prospective footballer that he encouraged them to become an age cheat in order to join Usuthu’s academy. Dlamini, who took over the reigns at Usuthu’s after they parted with Jozef Vukusic, says he has too much respect for the to involve himself in anything that would bring it into disrepute. AmaZulu have done their best to get to the bottom of the allegations and can clear Dlamini of any wrongdoing in this regard following an Internal Investigation. “Internal investigations conducted by the club show that Dlamini’s inbox records from Facebook, compared to that of the accuser do not correlate,” the club wrote on their website. “AmaZulu FC would like to use this opportunity to express it’s views surrounding doctored birth certificates and age cheating.We would like to make it known that as a club, we do not support or condone such actions in any form.” Dlamini said he was shocked by these allegation from the individual. “Sometimes youngsters inbox you and ask you all sorts of things but when it’s a player interested in getting a chance, you try your best to offer the very best you can to advise them,” he told the club’s official website. “Yet this guy seems to have made up a bold lie that is really against what AmaZulu and I personally stand for. “I had to fight my way up from the rural playing fields and I couldn’t do it without respecting the professional aspects of the institution of football”
