ALBOW Gardens Clinic in Brooklyn near Cape Town has been closed until further notice after a clinic nurse allegedly tested positive for Covid-19. A clinic worker tipped off Daily Sun that a colleague was positive but still expected to work. City spokeswoman Priya Reddy said: “The city can confirm that the clinic is closed to the public until further notice following a Covid-19 case at the facility.” Residents said they heard the clinic was closed on Friday and were scared to walk close to the area. “People are saying it’s a no-go area because someone was found with the coronavirus, so people around here are avoiding it. I was there over a month ago, so I think I don’t have a reason to be worried,” said Nomsa Chengeta (34), who lives a few streets away from the hospital. When the SunTeam visited the clinic, it looked abandoned, the gates locked and no one in sight. This is not the first time a clinic has been closed in Cape Town over coronavirus-related incidents. In March, St Vincent Clinic in Belhar was temporarily closed and disinfected after a man claiming to have the virus visited the clinic. Recently, the health department said over 300 health workers had been infected with Covid-19, KZN being the most affected province with 138 health workers who tested positive, Gauteng with 96, and Western Cape with 64.
