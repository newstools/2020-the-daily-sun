ALSO READ:CORONA IS KILLING US, GO TO YOUR HOMES PLEASE Christopher Mashinini (53) from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, noticed Mkhululi was missing on 23 April and asked friends where he was. The friends told him Mkhululi had been taken by a scrapyard owner. “They told me he was selling steel but was assaulted at the scrapyard and accused of stealing it,” said Christopher. The worried dad went to the scrapyard seeking answers. “I asked where my son was and the man said he didn’t know,” he said. The man admitted to moering his son but said he’d fled. “His facial expression told me something different. He was hiding something.” He reported the matter to the police. The scrapyard owner and another person who woks there were arrested and released the next day. “I’ve been looking everywhere for my son. I even went to Delmas and Bronkhorstspruit,” he said. “I heard burnt bodies were found in the bushes and went there to check, but it wasn’t him.” Christopher and his wife have been to sangomas. “They showed us a mirror, which indicates the whereabouts of the person you’re looking for. “But we couldn’t see him on both occasions.” Mkhululi’s mum Emmeline (59) said she’s unable to cope. “I constantly wonder what could have happened to him,” she said. Sergeant Khensani Mathebula told Daily Sun a case of kidnapping was opened. “Those two suspects were released because the case wasn’t placed on the roll,” she said. “But now it’s under investigation and details will be communicated to the family in due course.”
