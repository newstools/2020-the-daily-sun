ROSEMARY Zimu has scored the role of Warona, the daughter of Mildred Sefatsa (Kuli Roberts), on Mzansi Magic’s The Queen. She told Daily Sun: “I cried because I have been praying for my career to grow and the way God has planned it out is amazing. I was overwhelmed and overjoyed that I will be on The Queen because it is the biggest show in Mzansi.” Rosemary (27) said this role was a blessing as she did not audition for it. “I have worked with the Fergusons before on stunts.They have seen my work. When the role of Warona emerged, they remembered me and called my agent to ask for me to come on board.” She told the People’s Paper Warona is a likeable person and is nothing like her mom. “Although she is nothing like Mildred, they are very close. She is well travelled, never stayed in one place for a long time and makes sure she leaves her mark everywhere she goes. “She is different from all the characters I have played before and that makes me excited because people will get to see a different side of me,” she said. Although Rosemary enjoys playing the character she said she is completely different from her. “I am not well travelled. Her family dynamic is different from mine. Her mom is a diva in competition with her. I have never been in a situation like that,” she said. Rosemary said she was blessed the role came her way after Isidingo ended. “A lot of things happened after Isidingo stopped production. “No one had a job after that and for something like this to happen for me, it is amazing because I know God is always looking out for me,” she said. Warona will make her debut in July.
