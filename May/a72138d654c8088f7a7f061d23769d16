INTERVENE, commissioner Jula! This is the call from the DA in KZN to provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula. The party wants him to ensure justice takes its course when police are involved in criminal activities. This comes after a video clip surfaced showing three cops allegedly stealing money from a store in Vryheid, northern KZN, on 14 April. According to DA KZN spokeswoman on community safety, Sharon Hoosan, the evidence suggested no internal disciplinary hearing or arrests had taken place. She called for the immediate suspension of the three cops. “Police officers are not exempt from the law,” she said. She called for the protection of the store owner who was apparently afraid to come forward for fear of intimidation. Attempts of getting hold of the store owner were fruitless. Brigadier Jay Naicker said last week police management in Vryheid were alerted to the video. He said they were able to identify the officers and the provincial anti-corruption unit was contacted. “They opened a criminal case and the shop was identified. The owner of the shop has refused to provide detectives from the anti-corruption unit with a statement to implicate the police officers in the theft.” Naicker said cops will still try to get the assistance of the shop owner to pursue criminal investigations. “Meanwhile, police management has initiated an internal investigation in terms of our internal disciplinary regulation,” he said.
