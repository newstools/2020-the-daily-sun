THERE was an operation at Ezimbuzini Squatter Camp in Soweto to enforce level four regulations. The multidisciplinary operation was led by Gauteng Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela and Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko. They were accompanied by the SAPS, metro cops and the army. Mawela told Daily Sun this came after they received a tip off from community members that some people in the area did not adhere to the regulations. “They told us it was business as usual. People are loitering in the streets and some are operating their businesses without permits,” said Mawela. “Some were even selling home made beer and there were people drinking. We destroyed the beer. We also found more than 100 undocumented foreigners, who we arrested.” Mawela thanked the community members who alerted the police about all the wrongdoings in the area. Mazibuko said they were shocked to find izinyoka everywhere. “The area is next to a railway line and these people have cut down all the railway cables. What’s happening here is wrong,” she said. She reminded people to stay indoors and not loiter around. “Only those with permits must be on the roads,” said Mazibuko. One resident told Daily Sun they were happy to see police visibility in the area. “There’s a lot of crime here and police are nowhere to be seen. Surely now that they have come, they’ve seen our living conditions and will keep coming back to protect us because we really need them,” she said.
