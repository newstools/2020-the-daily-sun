Operation
Okae Molao has yielded positive results when six Zama Zamas were arrested at Matholesville
in Roodepoort. These Zama
Zamas have become a regular thing, as Illegal mining equipment known as
Phendukas were also confiscated. MEC of
community safety, Faith Mazibuko said Matholesville is a crime hotspot and she
also stated that police are constantly at this place to minimize crime and
arrest suspects. "Some
people are selling alcohol and cigarettes, others are walking around the
streets with no permits and these Zama Zamas are also fighting among
themselves," said Mazibuko.  "They
also victimize ordinary community members. Some of them even put shacks in
people's yards but residents are scared of saying anything because they fear
being victimized," she added. Mazibuko
said when probed for nationality, one of the suspects said he is from
Ga-Rankuwa, one from Mozambique, two from Malawi, and two from Zimbabwe. She also
stated that none of them produced proof of identity.
