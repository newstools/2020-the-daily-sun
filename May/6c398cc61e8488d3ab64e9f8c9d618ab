 A TOTAL of 854 cars were searched, 10 cars found to be unroadworthy, three people arrested for being in possession of illicit cigarettes during a roadblock in Pietermaritzburg. The massive roadblocks were held in different parts of the city on Thursday by cops. At Imbali Crossing the situation was hectic as several taxis were stopped and passengers who didn’t have permits were asked to get off the taxis and go back home. Those that were going to work but didn't have permits were also told to get off the taxis and go back home. The roadblock caused havoc as most drivers had to park their cars keeping the entire area at a standstill. A resident Nombuso Ngubane (24) said she saw the video and indeed it was taken in Imbali. She said cops were everywhere in the city, holding roadblocks. The KZN Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula confirmed the roadblocks and the number of cars that were searched and arrests made during the roadblocks held in Pietermaritzburg yesterday. He said they will be continuing with the roadblocks in all areas across KZN and making arrests.  “Since the lockdown there has been 18 000 arrests in the province,” said Jula.
