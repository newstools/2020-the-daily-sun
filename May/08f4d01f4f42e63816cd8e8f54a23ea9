TO some, playing rugby is just a fulfilment of a dream. To South Africans though, it is truly a privilege, an opportunity to showcase one’s talent and perhaps change your life in the process. These contrasts have been brought back to the fore by Springbok legend Bryan Habana. Speaking to former All Blacks star Dan Carter, Habana explained the role rugby has played in South African society, explaining the pressure to win was no greater than that of putting food on the table. New Zealand is known to go into depression whenever the All Blacks lose in a major tournament. But Mzansi’s socio-economic challenge are a constant reminder that failing to win a major sport event is the least of society’s concerns. “In SA, rugby has given our country so much. Nelson Mandela stood for so much when he went out in 1995 and told the Springboks to use it as an opportunity to unite the nation,” said Habana. “Pressure in SA is things like not being able to buy your family food, not being able to get on public transport, etc. Playing rugby should be a privilege, it’s something that enables you to out and show your God-given skills and bring people together. It definitely means so much more for us South Africans.” Habana won the rugby World Cup back in 2007 and has left his mark on the game. Carter, one of the best world rugby players ever, has two World Cup gold medals from the 2011 and the 2015 finals. “If the All Blacks don’t win a World Cup, the country goes into a state of minor depression, ” Carter jokingly said. “Having the World Cup in New Zealand and having not won the cup in 24 years, the pressure was just immense. “There was just a sense of relief when we finally won it, like a weight of pressure was finally lifted off our shoulder,” he said.
