POPE Tsietsi Makiti of Gabola Church told Daily Sun he prayed and fasted for the alcohol ban to be lifted. “God heard my prayers and indeed the ban was lifted. For us, alcohol isn’t just for fun,” he said. “It adds value to our church. Without alcohol there’s no prayer. “Even though we can’t have church meetings together as gatherings are still prohibited, we can now pray at home. Without booze we couldn’t even do that.” Pope Makiti said they have to take a sip each time they pray. “First we sip, then it’s amen, and hallelujah,” he said. Makiti said his church members, like members of any other church, can from Monday buy alcohol and go home and pray. “We’re over the moon. This shows we pray to a living God.” He encouraged members to observe level 3 lockdown regulations and not do what they’re not supposed to do. “Let’s drink and pray at home. That way we’ll beat the virus quickly and move to levels 2 and 1. “We can’t wait for our lives to go back to normal. Once we beat the virus, we’re going to hold a big service to thank God for sparing us.” Church members in Soweto said they were happy their pope’s prayers were strong. “We’ve been thirsty for a very long time. Half a loaf is better than nothing,” said Mthokozisi Ndima from Meadowlands. The members are now begging for cigarettes too, to make the combination perfect again.
