IN celebration of the club’s 50th anniversary, Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has opened up explaining why local coaches struggle to match the same success at the club compared to foreign coaches. Chiefs are renowned for their success in terms of trophies and it is no secret that foreign coaches have had more success in the club. Foreign coaches which includes Stuart Baxter, Vladimir Vermezovic, Muhsin Ertugral, Ted Dumitru and Paul Dolezar, all enjoyed success with the club. Steve Komphela was the last local coach to be in charge of the Soweto giants and he had an unsuccessful stint in bringing silverware at the club. Komphela who reached two finals (Telkom Knockout and MTN8 where he lost both finals 3-1 and 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns and Ajax Cape Town respectively). He was the first South African to have held the reigns at Naturena for longer than a year. In a Q&A which was published on the clubs website, the chairman of the club said some of the local coaches need to work harder in acquiring knowledge. "It’s not only at Kaizer Chiefs but all the teams in the league," Motaung was quated by the website. "It’s not really difficult but it’s about knowledge. Some of our local coaches need work harder in terms of acquiring knowledge. "We’ve seen the work coaches such as Pitso Mosimane and Gavin Hunt have done to improve themselves. We need more of that sort of commitment from all our local coaches."
