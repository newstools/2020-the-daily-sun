A GOGO (91) died while queuing for her Sassa money yesterday! CPF member Patricia Sibiya said they were helping elderly people queue for their grant money in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, when they noticed the gogo using a pole to keep herself standing. Patricia said when they asked the gogo what was wrong, she said she was not feeling well. “She told me and my colleague she was feeling dizzy, so we carried her inside the plaza to get her a chair.” ALSO READ:CASES RISE AS TESTING INCREASES Patricia said once the gogo was inside, they called her family but no one answered. “When we saw the gogo was very sick, we called an ambulance and went to get her water. “She told us she had high blood pressure and hadn’t taken medication.” Patricia said they tried to get the gogo something to eat so she could take her medication. While they waited for an ambulance, they managed to get hold of the gogo’s grandson. “I left there thinking she would be OK but moments later, while I was still helping other people, I received the news she died,” she said. Daily Sun visited the gogo’s home. But the family refused to comment, saying the gogo had been a private person and wouldn’t have wanted the media to report on her death. But other family members confirmed the gogo had died and said they were at the mortuary. The gogo was the fourth person to die waiting to collect pension money since the lockdown started. Last month, three others died in Cape Town, in Soweto and in Hammarsdale near Durban.
