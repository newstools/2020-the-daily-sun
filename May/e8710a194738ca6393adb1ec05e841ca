COSATU has cautioned government not to bow to pressure from profiteers and downgrade the lockdown level. The union federation said such a move must be informed by science and broader consultation. Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla said the decision must be informed by the workplace’s ability to be able to contain the spread of the virus as reports suggested that infections of cashiers, nurses and doctors were rising. “Relaxing the lockdown to level 3 must be accompanied by strict conditions of strict adherence by the employer to the health and safety direction and other relevant health and safety legislation,” said Pamla. He said as government was weighing all these instances, it should also be aware of the suffering of the poor, whose struggle to put food on the table started before the arrival of the virus. “We need to realise that we can’t afford to run an economy on UIF grants and food parcels. The lockdown will unleash an economic firestorm that will leave many people hungry and unemployed for a long time and the effects of such an economic collapse will be with us for a long time.” Cosatu’s word of caution came as President Cyril Ramaphosa was expected to address the nation as calls for him to downgrade the lockdown to level 3 grow louder. Pamla said government must make calculated moves as the virus was not going to be wished away and might be here until a vaccine was found. The union called for more screening and testing. “Government needs to move with far greater speed to deploy 28 000 community health workers. Screening and testing needs to take place at all workplaces and educational institutions daily as a matter of course. “Health services need to be reinforced and all health and essential workers provided with necessary personal protective equipment,” he said. Pamla called for more labour inspectors to be deployed as more sectors were gearing up to open.
