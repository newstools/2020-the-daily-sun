FOR years, the boys kept quiet about the horrific abuse they suffered. A 26-year-old soccer coach from Mfekayi Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, allegedly raped them on several occasions. When they opened up about what had happened, the victims aged between six and 13 told parents and cops the suspect threatened to kill their families if they said anything. A mum (33) said her son (13) told her the coach said he’d tell the cops the boy was doing crime and they’d shoot him. “I noticed my son and other local boys were spending more time at the suspect’s house than on the soccer field. I suspected he might be doing something wrong, but my son defended the man,” said the mum. She said she started noting changes in her son’s behaviour and became worried. On Friday, she took him to a social worker. “My son refused to speak and finally, one of the social workers told us to take him to the cops and the hospital to see if he had been raped. That’s when we made the shocking discovery. My son confessed everything and we went to the suspect’s house with the police. He was arrested,” she said. A 63-year-old gogo said the suspect was close to her twin grandchildren (11), and had also abused them. “We called our councillor and he called the cops when we realised there were more victims. I honestly don’t want to see the suspect ever leave jail,” she said. The councillor said seven boys were taken to the police station. He said they told the cops that the suspect raped them. “It was the most painful scene any parent could witness. The boys couldn’t hold back their tears when they gave their statements.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a man was bust for rape.
