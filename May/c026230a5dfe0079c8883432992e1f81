SIKONKOSI “DJ SK” Ncamiso, the winner of season one of SABC1’s DJing competition, 1’s and 2’s, claims he never received all his prizes. The 2016 winner said: “I was told to fetch my prizes at a music store in Joburg. “When we got to the store, they told me to take pictures as proof I got prizes. After taking the pictures, I was told the boxes were just display items and they were struggling to get the equipment shipped from overseas.” ALSO READ:FAST FACTS: MORE CORONA CASES IN PRISON He said he got some of his prizes in 2017 and more after season four, but he was still waiting for the rest. He said the person handling the prizes had even blocked him on Whats­App. Things didn’t go well for the DJ after the show. He ended up with depression. “Two years after winning the show, I’d constantly get sick,” said the DJ. “I would start shaking and getting dizzy. I am currently taking medication and getting better.” Ameera Faber of I Love That productions said they hadn’t heard from the DJ in four years. “I know a tweet addressed to us went out recently, but we can’t comment on how we will respond,” she said. SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo said: “The SABC can confirm that SABC1 aired a DJs competition, and I Love That productions was responsible for distributing the prizes. “We’re therefore not in a position to confirm whether the prizes where distributed or not.”
