Mpumalanga cop boss Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma has
sent out a strong warning to criminals who continue to break lockdown rules by
trafficking drugs. This comes after four suspects were arrested on Monday
between Pongola and Piet Retief in Mpumalanga. It is alleged the suspects were driving a Toyota bakkie
when they were stopped by police as a result of a tip-off. The silver bakkie which was carrying four occupants was
then stopped and bags of dagga estimated to the street value of R101 000 were
found. Zuma said enforcement officers will continue to be resilient
and vigilant in arresting those who break the law. “Those who think they can take chances and traffic drugs
should know that all law enforcement agencies are working around the clock to
eliminate and prevent all criminal activities,” said Zuma. In a separate incident, dagga estimated to the street
value of R100 000 was also found after the driver of a white Toyota bakkie fled
the scene upon realising SANDF members were conducting a search on the road. The bakkie that is suspected to be from Eswatini was left
at Magogeni also with bags of dagga. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an enquiry
into the matter has been opened and a manhunt for the suspect has been
launched. He appealed to anyone with information that can assist
with investigations to anonymously call 08600 10111. Mpumalanga NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the four
suspects Bongiwe Sithole (25), Zothini Thusin (42), Lethiwe Ngobese, (41) and
Senzo Mngoma (34) appeared at Piet Retief Magistrates Court on Thursday and
were released on R6000 bail each. The case will be heard again on 18 May.
