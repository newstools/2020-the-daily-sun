“WE DON’T have anything except our plastic shacks, which will turn into our graves if a fire breaks out.” This was what the residents of Plastic View in Tshwane told Daily Sun. The residents said the lockdown had made their lives even more difficult as they couldn’t do piece jobs. They appealed to Good Samaritans to help them with food donations. Community leader Johannes Ntika (30) told Daily Sun they needed food, water and toilets. He said in 2018, four residents were killed in a fire and they lived in fear of it happening again. Anna Banda (35) said they had to get water from a nearby stream and they were scared it would make them sick. Miriam Maposa (38) said they used the nearby bush to go to the toilet. She said they struggled to walk in the bush when they needed firewood as there were piles of kak. “We still live in fear of what happened to us two years ago. People lost their lives and all their property,” she said. Miriam said residents never received counselling. “We sleep with one eye open because of what happened,” she said. Mabita Mathambo (38) said another fire could break out at any time as people used candles and cooked with paraffin stoves. Living Word Pretoria East pastor Wilmar Grove said residents relied on donations. He said for the past five years, he had been working on helping residents change their lives through a skill development programme.
