THE outbreak of Covid-19 at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban led to the infection of 136 patients and staff in the complex and four people in a nursing home. A new report found it was caused by a single patient admitted to the emergency department early in March. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of KZN’s Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine and the KZN Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform. The report into the quick spread of infections through the 469-bed facility holds key lessons for hospitals about the importance of proper infection control and the deadly consequences of identifying Covid-19 patients too late. Over 40 000 people are expected to die from the virus in Mzansi by November, as one million people will be infected and the country is unlikely to have enough ICU beds at the pandemic’s peak. Health Department figures showed the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, had infected more than 17 200 people in Mzansi by the end of Tuesday and caused 312 deaths. Mathematical modelling estimates the country will reach the 30 000-mark in diagnosed Covid-19 cases by the end of this month and could see as many as 40 000 deaths by November, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced yesterday. From St Augustine’s Hospital’s emergency room, SARS-CoV-2 spread quickly through the facility, infecting 80 staff and 39 patients in five wards between 9 March and 30 April. The hospital outbreak led to another 21 cases, including four residents at a Durban nursing home and 17 patients and staff at the outpatient dialysis unit. “We estimate the hospital outbreak and its spread to other institutions accounted for about 14% of cases in KZN reported up to 30 April,” said the platform’s director Tulio de Oliveira.– NEWS24
