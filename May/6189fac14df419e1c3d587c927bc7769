IT’S often said that one can’t reinvent the wheel. But the idiom doesn’t seem to apply to Pitso Mosimane, who has gradually been reinventing his team. The Mamelodi Sundowns coach has achieved great success with a team built on a strong foundation of younger players, the likes of Khama Billiat, Mukuka Mulenga, Keagan Dolly, Bongani Zungu and Percy Tau, who he recruited on his arrival at Chloorkop some seven years ago. “It’s all about finding the balance. Khama came to us aged 23 and went on to mature. It was the same with Percy Tau... Bongani Zungu and Keagan Dolly, who we brought in at a relatively young age,” said Mosimane. “When you put in the youngster you are taking down the squad age average. We’ve now signed Grant Margeman, who is 21. We have Keletso Makgalwa, who scored the winner for us against Highlands in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals. There is also Rivaldo Coetzee, who is 22... Motjeka Madisha, Sphelele Mkhulise, Phakamani Mahlambi. “We’ve also promoted Promise Mkhuma. “We are trying to balance the old with the youngsters; Anele Ngcongca with Thapelo Morena, Wayne Arendse with Rivaldo and so on.” Criticised by some, who reasoned that buying and building can’t go together, Mosimane has, however, confounded his detractors with his minimal spending in the last two off-season transfer markets. Mosimane has a balanced squad, which is still anchored on old horses Hlompho Kekana, Tebogo Langerman, Ricardo Nascimento, Arendse and Denis Onyango. The squad has been able to compete on various fronts, including the Caf Champions League, with relative success. “As a coach you have to believe and trust in your players. These players have put the Sundowns flag on top of Mount Kilimanjaro,” Mosimane added. Despite a valiant fight, the Brazilians crashed out of the Champions League quarterfinals two months ago. But they have bagged the Telkom Knockout and are vying for the local league as well as the Nedbank Cup honours.
