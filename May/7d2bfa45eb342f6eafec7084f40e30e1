The Tzaneen Regional Court sentenced 31-year-old
rapist Dudley Mhlongo from Mokgwathi outside Tzaneen to life imprisonment for
rape. Mhlongo was sentenced for raping a 78-year-old gogo
from one of the local villages in the area. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said
the incident took place on the 21st of July 2019, while the elderly woman was
sleeping in her two-roomed house. The victim heard a knock on the door and asked who was
knocking when the suspect forced the door open and entered the house. The suspect threatened the victim with a firearm,
dragged her out of the house, and repeatedly raped her before fleeing from the
scene. Police intensive investigations commenced until the
suspect was apprehended and detained until his sentencing. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African
Police Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba applauded the
incarceration of the rapist. Ledwaba praised members of the Family Violence, Child
Protection, and Sexual Offenses unit for thoroughly investigating this case and
successfully acquiring a life sentence.
