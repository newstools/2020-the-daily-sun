METRO FM presenter LootLove and Rapper Reason’s relationship's over.  The two confirmed the break up to Sunday Sun today. “Sizwe and I have separated, however, we continue to partner gracefully in raising our beautiful kids,” she said. However, she denied that the break up was as a result of cheating allegations. “With regards to him cheating on me during my pregnancy when I was in Port Elizabeth, this is neither true nor factual. I didn’t travel to Port Elizabeth during my pregnancy as travelling was prohibited quite early in the pregnancy as it was a high risk pregnancy,” said LootLove. Reason said: “Yes, it’s true we have separated. We genuinely would have preferred privacy in this regard because of our children and families as this is a sensitive matter. So with that said, I would appreciate it if you could respect our privacy,” he said. Read: CLINT BRINK: MY WIFE IS NOT MATERIALISTIC! ??????
