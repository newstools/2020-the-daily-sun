WHEN lockdown began, people thought the booze they had stocked up on would be all they needed until it was back to business in three weeks. But as lockdown and the alcohol ban was extended, drinkers became frustrated. But some people from kasis started brewing a drink called mfula mfula (fruit beer). This turned out to be a great opportunity to make extra cash during lockdown. A 59-year-old unemployed single mother of four from J section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, said she started selling the home brew. She told Daily Sun that she mixed brown bread, brown sugar, jungle oats, pineapple and yeast. “One 1,5 litre bottle costs R20. People, especially the young ones, are always buying my mfula mfula. I’m able to make a lot of money,” she said. She said she was sad after hearing alcohol would be sold on level 3 of the lockdown. “This means that my business will fall apart. I won’t be making money anymore.” She said although she knew she was breaking the law, the money helped her buy the things she needed. “I bought a new stove and saved some money for my daughter who is doing matric.” She knew that eventually it would come to this but she had hoped the president would extend the alcohol ban for a longer period. “So from next month my business will perish. I’m really sad,” she said.
