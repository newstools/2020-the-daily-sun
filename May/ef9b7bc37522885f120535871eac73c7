KIDS were playing at a stream close to their homes when one of them shouted "Nawu uDolly emanzini" (There is a doll in the water). The group of about five kids from J section KwaMashu north of Durban all ran to pick up the "doll". But when they got closer and before one of them picked up the "doll", one of the kids a 12-year-old girl shouted that this isn't a doll but its a baby. It was a fully grown baby boy which still had its umbilical cord hanging on it, dumped in the smelling stream on Friday. The kids then screamed and ran to inform the elders that they there was a baby at the stream. A resident Nosipho Mdunge (31) told Daily Sun that she was at her house when the kids came and informed her that there was a baby at the stream. "I rushed to see the baby. And indeed there was a dead baby at the scream. The dead baby was naked and its umbilical cord was still hanging from it," she said. She said on a tree near the stream where the baby was found they noticed that there was also a dead chicken that was stuck on the tree. "I don't know if the person who threw the baby cleansed herself with the chicken or someone else left the chicken there. It's very confusing and shocking," she said. Another resident (41) who asked not to be named said they dont know who dumped the baby there. "The stream is between two sections, P and J section so the mother of the baby could be from any of the two sections," said the resident. She said the baby was fully grown. "Maybe the mother was eight or nine months pregnant," said the resident. KZN cops spokeswoman Colone Thembeka Mbeke confirmed that the KwaMashu SAPS are investigating a case of concealment of birth. It is alleged that at J section in KwaMashu, a body of a baby was found in the stream. "The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated," said Mbele.
