PREGNANT women at KwaMhlanga Hospital share beds! They told Daily Sun they were shocked when they were told there’s a shortage of beds at the hospital in Mpumalanga. A 28-year-old patient, who didn’t want to be named, was admitted two weeks ago because of complications with her pregnancy. “Winter is here and it’s not healthy for people like us to sleep on the floor,” she said. “I decided to share. I had no choice. But my health is being compromised and I’m scared.” Another patient (32) said every hospital must be ready to deal with the coronavirus. Said the patient: “There’s no social distancing. We’re at risk. If one gets infected, all of us will be infected. “It’s a concern because we don’t know what will happen to our unborn babies.”  Over the past few years patients have been complaining about poor service, resulting in several protests at the hospital. A worker, who didn’t want to be named, told the SunTeam: “Our maternity ward is too small and congested. We can’t turn away patients if they’re sick, especially pregnant women. “Now they’re forced to share beds and it’s beyond our control.” Mpumalanga has so far recorded 68 coronavirus cases. Daily Sun was told in March that relatives of positive patients were told to fetch them. Mpumalanga health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “All maternity patients present have been allocated available beds. “The doctors have been able to discharge patients and new patients have been provided with beds. “There’s an unallocated bed awaiting any eventuality. So we don’t have patients sharing beds. “The hospital maternity section is overused. Most of the patients bypass the local community health centres in preference of hospital service.” Malamule appealed to communities to make use of their local clinics and assured them midwives who work there are qualified.
