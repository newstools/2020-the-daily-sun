AFTER facing a horrific ordeal, a man is now going for counselling. The 36-year-old from Richmond Farm in Durban said he was kidnapped last Tuesday at about 3am by four suspects wearing masks. “I was asleep when I heard someone knocking at the door and calling me by name. I got up to open the door, thinking it was someone I knew.” He said when he opened the door, he was grabbed and dragged to the bush. “They tied my hands and feet together. They covered my face and beat me, demanding money from me.” The man said he was taken to a dark shack and forced to call family and friends to ask for large amounts of money in exchange for his freedom. “I first called my sister and asked her to lend me R20 000,” he said. The man said his sister was able to transfer R6 000 to him. “My sister later sent another R5 000. “They went to withdraw it but they still wanted more,” he said. He said during the ordeal, the kidnappers argued whether to release or kill him for body parts. Luckily, his neighbours had seen the kidnapping take place and contacted his family. “They were working on getting help for me. They first went to the police to open a case but didn’t get help until they contacted my friend who’s a Metro cop,” he said. “The Metro police worked with my family and managed to catch one of the suspects during a ransom exchange.” Metro police head, commissioner Steve Middleton, said he was proud of his members. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of kidnapping was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station for investigation. The victim was rescued by police during the exchange of a ransom. The victim informed the investigators that he does not desire police investigation.” But the man claimed cops were not updating him about the case.
