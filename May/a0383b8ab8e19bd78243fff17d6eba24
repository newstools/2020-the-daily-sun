An Ethiopian man accused of being involved in a cash-in-transit heist that left two Hawks members dead, said he was living a nice life here in Mzansi. Terefe Demissie (39) said this during his bail application hearing at the Mmabatho Regional Court in the North West on Friday. He appeared with five co-accused who told the court that they were not ready to proceed with the bail application. However, Terefe was left alone on the dock after stating he was more than ready to be released on bail. When asked if he was a flight risk, Terefe said there was no way he could go back to Ethiopia. “Going back to Ethiopia is like putting myself in a pot of boiling water. I am from a very poor family. I don't want to go back,” he said. The 39-year-old said besides being scared of going back home, he was having a time of his life here in Mzansi. He said he had two businesses, a tuck shop and a scrapyard, which gave him over R20 000 per month. He went on to say he also has a wife, three children, a girlfriend, two baby Mama's and four dogs here in Mzansi. He pleaded not guilty and said he did not know all the five co-accused, saying he only saw them when he was arrested together with them. A Ranger bakkie which transported the people who attempted to rob the cash van was found at his newly rented place in Riviera Park. He said the car ended up at his garage because he was just assisting Tefo, one of the suspects who died during the shootout. He said Tefo wanted his friend to sleep there for a night so he gave him the house keys. He was left with an egg on his face when the state prosecutor read out the statement of an investigating officer which linked him with all the co-accused through cellphone record tracing. The Mmabatho magistrate court postponed the bail hearing to May 21 for further bail application hearing.
