Miss South Africa 2020 hopeful Bianca Schoombe hit the top of Twitter trends on Wednesday, after highly offensive tweets, dating back to 2013, resurfaced on Tuesday night. After a Twitter user uncovered a series of racist and crude social media posts tweeted from the 21-year-old model's private account, Bianca offered a public apology saying: "I would like to profusely apologise for putting it out into the universe then. Being the person that I am today, I have now dealt with my past by praying."Â Read the full story here She subsequently withdrew her entry from Miss South Africa 2020.

In a lengthy statement, issued by the company's director Alessandrio Bergman, it was said that Bianca was "in breach of her agreement" as Sync Model Management does not "condone any form of racial discrimination." "Furthermore, we would profusely like to apologise to all South Africans for our actions in our first statement and the representation and vetting of Bianca Schoombe's social media," the statement went on to say, adding that measures have been put in place to make sure "that this does not happen again." Entries for this year's Miss South Africa opened on 11 May and close on 31 May 2020, at midnight. The organisers have not yet announced its panel of judges nor evaluated any of the entries received.
