When nature calls one doesn’t have to think twice, but that’s not the case for residents of Monwabisi Park in Khayelitsha. Their communal toilets are built on a huge concrete slab that’s almost one-metre high, but there are no steps to climb up the slab into the toilets. Although young people find it easy to climb into the toilets, for the elderly it’s a huge task.  “People are used to it and to others it’s normal, but the elderly struggle. Instead of using these toilets they end up asking other people who have toilets in their homes, or walk long distances to the other side of the kasi to use toilets that don’t require too much effort,” said resident Nomusa Damba (43). Ronnie Bosakwe, chairman of Sanco for Monwabisi branch, said he’ll go to the councillor’s office and speak about the toilets. THEY SNEAK OUT OF THEIR HOUSES FOR WATER “The elderly are really struggling to use the toilets. I’ll go to the councillor and present this matter, and I hope it will be fixed,” said Bosakwe. Ward councillor Anele Gabuza said he’ll get in touch with the municipality and have them fixed as soon as possible.
