WORKERS from Glencarol in Babelegi, Hammanskraal, Tshwane went on the rampage yesterday. They blocked the entrance to the textile company with burning tyres, branches and stones, preventing other workers from entering and exiting. They were protesting over unpaid salaries. Daily Sun published an article last month, when the workers started to protest. But weeks later, some received payment and those who didn’t got angry and carried on with the protest. Shop steward Phillimon Mashao said the workers were supposed to get paid since the beginning of lockdown. “President Cyril Ramaphosa stated companies must apply for UIF so workers must be paid, but this company has been having problems.” He said only contracted employees and 16 permanent employees were paid. “When we asked why those were the only people paid, they said they made a mistake paying permanent people. “It doesn’t make sense at all and it’s wrong,” he said. Protester Fani Makhanya, has been working at the company for seven years. He said they were treated badly.  Fani said he didn’t want to work for there anymore. “I want the money owed to me and after receiving it, I will leave.” The workers said they will not stop protesting until they were addressed and paid. CEO Raj Shunmugam previously told Daily Sun they didn’t have any income to pay the workers. “We have no sales and income and as a result, we have cash flow problems. Our money is at the bargaining council, and we are designing masks to keep the company running.” When Daily Sun called Shunmugam, his phone rang unanswered and later it was off.
