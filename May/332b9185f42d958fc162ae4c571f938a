 "FOR me, this Covid-19 era has shown me the shock of my
life!" Those were the words from a man who has separately lost a
son and a wife a space of a month. But Joseph Mofubetsoane's family was not killed by
Coronavirus. His son Moeketsi (18) was stabbed to death, allegedly by his
girlfriend in April. And that is when Joseph's wife's life took a huge turn and
she got sick. Makamoho Mofubetsoane (52) from Kutlwanong near Odendaalsrus
could not easily accept that she had lost a child she was very close to and the
two even shared a birth date and a month. Joseph told Daily Sun: "It is tough for me right now.
But I should stand up and mourn my wife's death. I was even in the process of
mourning our son. My wife's life changed and she collapsed during our son's
funeral. We took her to the doctor several times and she was not coping well. I
have asked her to cry a lot and get it out of her lungs. But I guess she did
not do it enough and it became unbearable for her. She ended up not being able
to walk on her own. She then stopped talking and we carried my wife around the
house." He said it was painful for him but he will continue to raise
their kids. "My wife was very close to Moeketsi because they were
both born on 12 February. She took her last breath at the hospital where she
had been admitted. My wife died on Tuesday at 4:30 am. I will have to be strong
for our remaining two children aged 15 and 23. We also have a 2-year-old
daughter that we adopted. This Corona era has hurt me and my family. I now know
the pain of losing a parent, a child, and a wife. I now know how Maria must
have felt when she saw her son Jesus being killed. It's very painful to lose a
child. But God is here for us." He said the funeral could be held next Saturday.
