 THE battle of the masks has started across Mzansi! With government regulations making it compulsory to
wear masks in public, designers and small business people have started making
unique masks for those who want to stand out and make a fashion statement. Cloth masks have become a must have item since Health
Minister Zweli Mkhize pleaded with South Africans not to use medical grade
masks, especially N95 masks and respirators, as they should be reserved for
front line medical workers. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that
people had to wear triple layer face masks they could buy or make themselves. Since the announcement was made, Mzansi has seen a
wave of creativity with masks. Some of them are hilarious while others just
match outfits for the day. Social media was abuzz over the weekend with comments
on masks users found elegant or funny.  Wearing a smiley mask, Itu Manaka wrote on Facebook:
“Getting some essentials with my friend. These is lovely masks are made and sold by my friend
Shantel Nyatela so please ladies and gentlemen, do support this lady. She has a
variety of beautiful masks to offer.”  Lebogang Masia also wrote on Facebook: “Order for me
as well, Will come to collect them during the week.”
