A local police officer decided to use his birthday to fundraise and buy food for people close to a hundred. Sergeant Matome Rathupetsane from Tzaneen, says when the lockdown started, he met a lot of underprivileged people in his line of duty who were unable to make ends meet. Rathupetsane who currently resides in Alexandra said he was touched and decided to lend a helping hand. “I was touched by this mother who was one of those who were forced to turn back empty-handed. You could see she was broken and had nothing to tell the young child who was expecting food when they got home. I was shattered and I promised myself that I needed to do something to help," said Rathupetsane. ALSO READ: COPS DELIVER HEALTHY BABY! The Constable based at Sandringham Police Station decided to use his 40th birthday this week to raise funds to buy food for the poor.  "I can't forget my village because that is where more poverty-stricken families are and often are not reached like those here in big towns like Joburg. That is why I thought I should share 40 here and another 40 to those that are deserving at home,” he said. Rathupetsane believes police and policing should be used to help and not condemn criminals only. "In our line of duty, we meet different people, rich and poor, well off and hungry. We have emotions too and the problems around us touch us. We are not only out there to chase criminals but are called to assist when we can beyond what we are paid to do", he added.
