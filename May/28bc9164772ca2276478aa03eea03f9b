SHE told her kids to stay in the shack while she went to her aunt’s house to ask for paraffin money. But her 13-year-old daughter Kamva made her siblings play hide and seek outside. That saved their lives . . . The shack mysteriously caught fire on Tuesday while they were outside playing! Rebecca November (31) from Namibia in Mangaung was relieved her kids were safe. She told Daily Sun: “I’d just cooked pap and switched off the paraffin stove when I went out to ask for money from my aunt. “I was shocked when I received a call that my shack was on fire. The fire was so strong. “I lost everything. I don’t work and survive by plaiting people’s hair.” She didn’t have electricity and couldn’t say whether it was an electrical fault. “I’m glad my kids were playing outside,” she said. “But we’ve lost everything including their school uniforms and birth certificates.” Rebecca said her neighbour was accommodating them. Neighbour Vivian Ludada (57) said she was good friends with Rebecca’s mum before she died in 2013. “I couldn’t sit back and do nothing while kids who grew up in front of me suffered,” she said. Neighbours Seipati Khathi and Makarabelo Motlhakana went door to door asking for donations for Rebecca and her kids. They said the community was being supportive and Rebecca should have another shack by Saturday. Rebecca received food parcels from the councillor and a voucher from the ward committee. Councillor Matekane Nkoe said he’d get school uniforms for the kids. “The human settlements department will be back at work by next week and we’ll engage with them,” he said.
