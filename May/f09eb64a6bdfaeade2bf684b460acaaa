WHILE the race to find a potential cure for coronavirus has been intensified globally, the World Health Organisation said it welcomed innovations including working with traditional medication. This comes after a herbal medication, Artemisia, received global attention when Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina endorsed the herb as a cure for the virus. READ: MASKANDI'S BIG 4-5 WAR! It was developed by Congolese doctor, Dr Jerome Munyagi, in partnership with the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research and branded Covid Organics. In Mzansi, the herbal remedy is known as wormwood in English, umhlonyane in Xhosa and Zulu, and lengana in Sotho or Tswana. However, the World Health Organization cautioned against the use of medicinal plants such as Artemisia. They said while it supported scientifically-proven traditional medicine, there was still a need to test for the effectiveness and side effects of the newly touted drug. Many people in South Africa called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to work with Rajoelina. Some sangomas even gave the remedy the thumbs-up. Gogo Elsie Matseke said she believed the remedy was what Africans needed. She said herbs had never harmed anyone. “We grew up drinking herbs and we hardly got sick. “This medicine will be the proof that the world needs to know how powerful Africa is,” she said. Traditional herbalist Simon Makua said people’s bodies were made to work hand in hand with herbs, and that was the reason people healed faster and better when they drank herbs. “We have a lot of herbs needed to make this virus go away. I hope our government will be open to it,” he said. Social media users also called for its use.
