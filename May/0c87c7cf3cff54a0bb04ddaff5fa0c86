BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic striker Rendani Ndou faces an uncertain future. According to an insider at Siwelele, the 32-year-old player will be released at the end of season as he failed to make an impact since he arrived in 2018. Ndou was signed by then coach Steve Komphela, having scored only four goals in 22 matches for Polokwane City prior to his departure. He played only 58 minutes in three matches as a substitute this season. The last time he played competitive football was on 22 December last year, where he lasted 17 minutes when Celtic lost 2-1 to AmaZulu in an Absa Premiership match. Ndou has also been injured, having sprained his ankle in March prior to the lockdown and this has made it difficult for him to fight for his place in coach Lehlohonolo Seema’s starting line-up. Said a source in the club: “Ndou’s contract won’t be renewed when it expires in June. He has failed to prove his worth since he arrived from Polokwane City two years ago. This has given management no other option but to release him so that he can seek employment elsewhere.” However, Seema said Ndou is still part of his future plans. Even though the Thohoyandou-born player has never started a single match this season, Seema still rates him highly. Said Seema: “Rendani got injured before we closed due to the lockdown. We will help him recover because he is still part of my team. I am not aware that he will be released.” Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco said: “I don’t comment on stories based on sources.” Ndou started his professional career with Black Leopards in 2014, following a stint with Sivutsa Stars. His impressive performances with Lidoda Duvha made then Rise and Shine coach Bobbie Solomons lure him into his side with a lucrative three-year deal.
