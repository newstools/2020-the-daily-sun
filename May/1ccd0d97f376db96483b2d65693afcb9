SPIRITUAL medium Lloyd Radebe has a very special gift. Lloyd connects the ancestors with the living. The 43-year-old from Ezakheni in Ladysmith, KZN, is a presenter on Ubizo. Lloyd conveys messages from the ancestors to those who come for consultation. He told SunBuzz: “The show isn’t about religion or race. “Anyone can come. I’m connected with the spirit. Lloyd was trained by his late gogo MaMkhize, and not by a gobela. “I spent three months in 2010 in the mountain and had spiritual communication with my gogo, who taught me everything that’s needed, and I passed the test.” He said when his mum was expecting him, it was prophesied that she was carrying a healer. He’s a resident spiritual medium on The Nia Brown Shakedown on YFM every Monday from noon until 3pm. “This is where I feel complete and happy because I can speak with a large number of listeners, particularly the youth,” said Lloyd. He urged people to connect with their spirit and listen very carefully to their ancestors’ messages. The new Mzansi Wethu reality show airs on Saturdays at 19.30pm. The repeats are on Sundays at 9am and on Tuesdays at 8am.
