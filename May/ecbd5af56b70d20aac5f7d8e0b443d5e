Itumeleng Khune and Thamsanqa Gabuza are no strangers to the internet. The two stars have perhaps had more than their fair share of viral moments in the past. They have both had their very own memorable "Wooden Mic" performances scrutinised on social media before. A while back, fans on social media were left in stitches, some traumatised, after Khune gave his very own rendition of Jay Z's hit History. And Gabuza’s very own version of John Legend's smash hit All of Me, was not much better than Khune’s attempt. Now the duo has collaborated with another video that left social media users amused. This time, there was no singing involved but it was nonetheless hilarious. The two players went on Insta Live and had a very interesting and amusing conversation. In the clip that is currently doing the rounds on social media, Gabuza can be heard asking whether he is making noise for Khune’s daughter. “Am I making noise, will I wake her?” The Kaizer Chiefs Goalkeeper than replies: “Nah.. Nah don’t worry about the beep (baby)” Khune then asked Gabuza “What’s Poppin? (Whats Up?) The reply had Mzansi in stitches… “Puppy, Pupping my brother, the pub is pubbing you know like always…” replied a confused Gabuza. It is safe to say Khune and Gabuza have given fans great memories on and off the pitch in the past.
