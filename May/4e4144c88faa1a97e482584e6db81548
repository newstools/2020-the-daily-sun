WHEN the people saw the flames, they rushed to investigate and found the church on fire! They tried to put out the fire but it was too strong and firefighters were called to kill the fire at the church in Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni. But it seems the church was deliberately set on fire. Springs cops took away two two-litre bottles that seemed to have contained petrol used to set the shack church on fire. Lucas Mabelane, the pastor in charge of the church, stayed in a shack attached to the church. “I lost everything. I’m left with the clothes I’m wearing,” he said. “The sofas, two TV sets and my clothes were destroyed in the fire.” Lucas said the damage is estimated at about R40 000 and the area where they pray was destroyed. He told Daily Sun they have conducted their own investigations and they know the church member responsible for the fire. “After he fought with the residents who came to lodge a complaint against him, he was stopped from coming to the church. “He has held a grudge against the church since. He denied it but he was seen in the church premises on the same day.” A case of arson was opened at Springs Police Station. The police said no person was arrested, but they were investigating.
