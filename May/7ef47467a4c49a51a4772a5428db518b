NATIONAL
Freedom Party has delivered food parcels to 19 widows whose stalls were
destroyed by the Nongoma Municipality in KZN last week. Led by the
party leader in Zululand Sphamandla Ntombela the party met the victims in
Nongoma town central where their belongings were destroyed. Ntombela
said the party was touched by reading on Daily Sun where the municipality
destroyed the market stalls of the widows who are feeding their children with
the little money, they make selling fruits and vegetables in the scorching sun
in summer. He said in
total 26 vendors benefited from the party food packs but 19 of them were
widows. One of the
vendors Siphiwe Zitha (40) from KwaZiphethe village thanked NFP for its
generosity. She said
the party wiped their daily tears since their goods were destroyed by the
municipality. She said she feeds her seven kids and six from
their deceased sisters. Daily Sun
ran a story last week where the municipality manager Mpumelelo Mnguni said the
decision to remove the stalls was because those vendors had no permit to trade
in the town. He said the
town was filthy and residents and formal businesses had complained about it. He said the
stalls were on pavements and people were not able to walk. Mnguni told
Daily Sun the municipality is in the process to build proper stalls for the
same vendors.
