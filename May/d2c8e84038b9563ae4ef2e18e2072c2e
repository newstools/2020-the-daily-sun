The Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa held a media briefing on Monday to provide an update on the Covid-19 Relief Fund for the sector. The briefing came after Mthethwa announced a R150-million Relief Fund a few weeks ago. According to the department, 5,000 applications from the Arts and Culture sector and 300 from sport were received. However, Mthethwa expressed concern about the number of applications which were unsuccessful and were not eligible for funding. Some of the reasons were incomplete applications or paperwork, short period of application among others. “The adjudicating panel for Sport was the first to be appointed. A total of 473 applications were received from 25 sporting federations. Of these applications 291 were approved for payments,” said Mthethwa. “We are concerned with the number of people who were not able to access this fund. We need to ensure that people who need this assistance, get it. “Because of the lockdown period, people were not able to access ICT and complete the application on time. The application period was also short. We want funds to reach the athletes at the end of the day. Second call of applications is in discussion”
