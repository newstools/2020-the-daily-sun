ACTOR Sthembiso “SK” Khoza is set to make a comeback on Mzansi Magic’s The Queen! This come after his character Shaka Khoza was killed off last year. Speaking to Daily Sun, SK said Shaka was back to ruffle some feathers. He said his character would return a different person. “After Shaka was almost killed by his brother, he had some time off to gather his thoughts for almost seven months. “He will return as a different person who will no longer be the Shaka that everyone knew since the inception of the show, who is the glue to the family.” “After that incident where Kagiso tried to kill him, it will be difficult for him to know who he can trust and who he cannot trust, he won’t even trust his favourite uncle Brutus,” he said. The 31-year-old actor also poured cold water on the rumours that he was fired from The Queen. BLASTS FROM THE PAST! “We live in a country where people like to speak before they know all the information and facts and they rely on hearsay. “About seven months ago, news about the character dying came out about at least a month and a half before the character died,” he said. “It hurts how people were happy to say I am a hard person to work with and how I make production difficult. “It is painful because all those things were not true.” SK said he left The Queen to shoot Kings of Joburg. “Before it was announced that I left The Queen, I had already started shooting Kings of Joburg, which is produced by the same production company Ferguson Films. “I am having the last laugh now that I am back on The Queen. I have been wondering why people couldn’t figure out why I was fired on The Queen but hired on Kings of Joburg, but people decided to drag my name,” he said. SK said he was not sure when the character would appear on the show, but he had begun shooting.
