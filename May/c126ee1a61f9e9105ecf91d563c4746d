The national coronavirus lockdown and its effects have led to an increase in depression, anxiety and suicide thoughts among South Africans. This is evident from the sheer volume of calls received by the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) since the beginning of the lockdown on 27 March. Its operations director, Cassey Chambers, told News24 there had been a huge increase in calls. "In fact, our calls have more than doubled since the beginning of the lockdown, and it's growing every single day. Mental health experts are warning that as the world pandemic drags on, the mounting combination of death, joblessness, and uncertainty is also fuelling a mental health crisis. The WHO is asking governments to put the issue "front and center." Matthew "We've also seen an increase in calls to Childline as well as gender-based violence cases. So we've been monitoring our calls very closely to see which platforms and mechanisms people are accessing." According to Chambers, the SADAG received an average of around 600 calls per day. "We are now averaging between 1 200 and 1 400 incoming calls every day. That excludes all the people we follow up with, or patients we help to get admitted to hospitals, or responses to emails or text messages." READ | Covid-19: Is ‘normal’ healthcare being crowded out? Chambers said the number was expected to increase over the next few months as the impact of Covid-19 worsens. People usually reached out to the SADAG based on a combination of issues because so many people were impacted in every aspect of their lives, she added. "People are especially feeling anxious about the uncertainty of the current situation. What's going to happen? What can I do? Where am I going to get money? Am I still going to have a job? What about my child and schooling? These are some of the issues that are triggering a lot of people." The main issues are: - Anxiety or panic: Feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, stressing about general things, not having answers or security. - Financial worries: Pressure or stress relating to money, losing your job, not being able to pay the rent - the profound financial impact Covid-19 has had on people's financial security. - Depression: People have been triggered by the initial three-week lockdown, then the extension, then alert Level 4.   "It's been seven weeks and we've seen a lot of patients relapse into depression, and those who had a mental health issue before are really battling to deal with all these additional stressors; and those that perhaps didn't have a mental health issue before have now been triggered," said Chambers.             "When you need help, the first step is to reach out - either to a family member or loved one, or to a mental health professional."
