WE want to be tested here and now! This was the plea by gogos from Ramotse Village in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, who feel neglected during the pandemic. The gogos and women from the community picketed next to the main road yesterday . They wore masks and practised social distancing.  The gogos said they were tired of living without food as government promised them food parcels, but they hadn’t received any. One of the gogos, Lorna Chane (72), said they risked their lives to be heard. “We’ve been following the law that we must stay home. We did that but now we came out because we need help,” she said. She said they wanted to be tested and they were hungry. “It’s been over two weeks since we registered for food parcels, but haven’t received them. Most of us don’t work and our children don’t have money because it’s no work no pay at some companies,” she said.  Louisa Marang (46), who picketed with the gogos, said she was self-employed, but currently didn’t have an income. “I used to sell cookies in the street and don’t have any source of income. I am stuck with my kids at home with no food,” she said.
