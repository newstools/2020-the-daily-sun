FORMER Zululand district municipal manager Sbusiso Nkosi said he is ready to go back to his work. He was reacting to the KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairsâ€™ explosive forensic report which set aside his 2018 dismissal. Mdledle Attorneys, which investigated allegations of corruption, fraud and maladministration in the northern KZN municipality found that Mayor Thulasizwe Buthelezi flouted lot of regulations including illegally dismissing the municipal manager. Nkosi told Daily Sun today that he has been informed about the report and if it is true then he is ready to return to his job. "Well I heard that the report found that I was unlawfully dismissed. I didn't leave my job on my own, I was fired and challenged it," he said. The report was presented by Cogta officials assisted by Mdledle Attorneys in a virtual council meeting in Ulundi on Thursday. Copies of which Daily Sun has seen not only found that the mayor was wrong in firing Nkosi but even the process to appoint acting municipal manager Mpumelelo Manqele was also flawed and declared invalid. The report recommended that council charge the mayor and two officials including former speaker Sbu Nkwanyana. It also recommended that Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka and two other officials be suspended and that a commission of inquiry be appointed. Some of the findings are that all decisions including tenders signed by acting manager were invalid. The report also recommends that acting manager paid back R1, 8 m he irregularly approved for the hosting of land claim imbizo by king Goodwill Zwelithini in July 2018. The mayor is also liable for R1,6 m for extra security guards that were irregularly allocated to him. In terms of the policy he was supposed to have only two. Former speaker said he will only comment after the report has been tabled in the council. Attempts to get both mayor and other official was unsuccessful.
