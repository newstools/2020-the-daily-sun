residents of Pietermaritzburg can’t bear being thirsty any more. When Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area yesterday, people begged him to allow them to buy alcohol again. Cele visited the town, along with KZN Community Safety MEC Bheki Ntuli and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula. Cele started his day by visiting the family home of Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande in KwaDambuza before visiting the nearby KwaMabululu Shopping Centre. He greeted shoppers and asked those not wearing masks to put them on. He reminded people to practise social distancing. Outside the shopping centre, Cele met Nomonde Mthembu (45), who was selling masks for R30 each. The minister bought two for R100.  Before inspecting a roadblock, Cele visited Edendale Mall to check whether shops were following regulations. Speaking outside the mall, he said he couldn’t say when alcohol would be available again. “The matter of alcohol is still going to be discussed. For now people must drink water,” said Cele. He said a lot of people had started brewing alcohol at home. “That is not allowed. We will be visiting houses where they’re brewing and arrest them,” said Cele. He said was impressed with how stores were dealing with regulations. Cele told the People’s Paper : “It’s like people in the township don’t know what masks are. “I was so disappointed when I saw many of them without masks.”
