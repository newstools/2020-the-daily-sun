FORMER Orlando Pirates midfielder Manti Mekoa says he still has what it takes to play in the PSL for another two seasons before he hangs up his boots. The 34-year-old player hopes to help GladAfrica Championship side Cape Umoya realise their dream of playing top flight football. Umoya currently occupy 11th spot on the Championship table with 28 points from 23 matches, and are 20 points behind run away leaders Ajax Cape Town. According to Mekoa, it is worth taking the team to the PSL. “I listen to my body and still feel good,” said the veteran. “I can contribute for another two years in the top flight. “I am happy with my overall performance and I always want to do more.” Mekoa, who made his professional debut with Free State Stars in the 2009-10 season, is concerned that the lockdown will negatively affect their performance “and we slowly improving before the league was halted”. “Before the lockdown (due to coronavirus) we played Ajax and beat them 1-0. You could see that our spirit was high,” he said. “We had adapted to the coach’s (Mahier Davids) system.” Mekoa said raining alone at home in Soweto under lockdown has its own challenges. He went on: “It was a bit challenging at first doing it alone, but eventually I got used to it.”
