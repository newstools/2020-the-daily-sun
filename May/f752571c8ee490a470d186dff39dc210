MISSING Morongwa Marakalala’s partially burnt body was found on Sunday. Residents of Silvermine Village, outside Bochum in Limpopo, had been frantically searching for the 14-year-old for two weeks. She was last seen with her 18-year-old lover. Following Morongwa’s disappearance, villagers suspected the boyfriend. The home of the lover’s 63-year-old gogo was set alight last Monday. Family member Power Marakalala (36) said Morongwa was murdered and her body later dumped on the mountain. “We were still searching when the body was discovered on the mountain nearby by community members. “Her body was partially burnt. The upper part was covered in black plastic and the bottom exposed. Some body parts were missing! Power said cops helped with the search for only two days. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a murder case was opened, and provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba had instructed investigators to waste no time in hunting down the killers. “We also warn community members not to take the law into their own hands, but to help the police investigation,” he said. Anyone with information about the suspects can contact Warrant Officer Albert Manaka on 082 414 6634, CrimeStop on 08600 10111, or their nearest cop shop. Last Wednesday, police arrested 13 suspects between the ages of 18 and 32 for arson after a house belonging to an old woman accused of evil deeds was set alight. They were denied bail, but will make a formal application in the Senwabarwana Magistrates Court on Thursday.
