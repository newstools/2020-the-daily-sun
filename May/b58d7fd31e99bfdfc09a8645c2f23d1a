AT AN emergency meeting with Limpopo provincial government and the minerals ministry in Bela-Bela on Sunday, it was announced that Implats workers coming from infected areas will be quarantined for 14 days before reporting back to work. Nineteen Covid-19 cases have been reported at Marula Platinum Mine at Diphale Village outside Burgersfort. CEO Nico Muller told the People’s Paper they were shocked about the huge number of cases reported at the mine. “We will supply all needed materials at our mines’ quarantine areas for our workers’ safety.” He said focus on quarantine was a big lesson for the company to ensure they saved the workers’ lives. “We have enough capacity at our mines for the reported cases. When we return our employees from endemic areas such as the Eastern Cape, we will ensure they all get quarantined before reporting back to work. “We will also not rest in teaching our workers the best ways while on duty to continue fighting the virus.” Premier Stanley Mathabatha was pleased with the positive response from the company. “Agreeing on the mine’s quarantine areas will put us in a position to deal with the Covid-19 challenge in our mines,” said the premier. Mathabatha said it was shocking that provincial coronavirus cases were getting worse every day. “Having quarantine areas at our mines will save many from being infected across our province.” He said they wanted to ensure the lives of their people at mines were safe, irrespective of where they were. “We wanted to make the mining industry realise it was crucial their workers were healthy and safe.” Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe was grateful the Covid-19 positive workers were spotted in time. “When we ordered mines to test workers our intention was to ensure we detect the virus, and not leave a chance for it to attack employees. If one worker is found positive and it is found the whole crew is positive, we will have the responsibility to close that mine.”
