LEGENDARY American boxer Mike Tyson has scoffed at the idea of fighting former All Blacks star Sonny Bill Williams. A recent report in the Daily Mail claimed that Australian promoter Brian Amatruda had approached Tyson’s management team about the former world heavyweight champion fighting in Melbourne. He listed Williams as an option alongside former rugby league stars Barry Hall and Paul Gallen. However, a new Daily Mail report stated that celebrity agent Max Markson, who brought Tyson to Australia in 2012 and was negotiating with his handlers on behalf of Amatruda, had received a message from Tyson’s team saying the American wasn’t interested because of the quality of the suggested opponents. The message reportedly said: “Mike read the story that he would be fighting a rugby player. He has said he would not do that as it would be an insult to boxing. “He says if he does get back into the ring it will be with a real boxer.” Tyson, now 53, recently revealed he wanted to return to the boxing ring in charity fights. He has been training for the last three weeks under MMA coach Rafael Cordeiro. Reports added Amatruda had offered Tyson $3m (R53 million) to fight Down Under. Williams, who played rugby union and rugby league for New Zealand, has seven professional boxing fights under his belt. – AFP
