Winter is here, and while that may mean we’re covering up more with jerseys, jackets, long pants and boots, taking care of our skin should still be a priority. “In fact, the cooler weather can often cause more dryness than in the summer months, so dropping the ball on your skincare routine now is a no no,” explains Clere skincare brand manager, Su-Marie Annandale. Is my skin glowing, or is it ashy? Is it too dry? Is it uneven? These are all questions we ask ourselves. Annandale says that the first and most important step for even looking and glowing skin is hydration.  Hydrated skin is moisturised and the skin does not only look good, but it also helps to prevent premature ageing and has improved elasticity. How to check if your skin is dehydrated? Annandale provides tips to determine if your skin needs additional hydration: If you are experiencing any of the above, Annandale recommends increasing your water intake and using a nourishing body lotion or crème.  Clere’s range of crèmes and lotions consist of four unique formulations to suit all skin needs. These are: A Pure Glycerine formulation, a Triple Glycerine formulation, a Tissue oil and Pure Glycerine formulation and a Glycerine Gel formulation. All four formulations provide 48-hour moisturisation and contain Vitamins E & A which are gentle, yet effective.  Clere’s range of crèmes and lotions are available at all leading retailers at a cost of R34.99 and R21.99, respectively.
