Innocent DJ has dedicated his upcoming single, Ndoda, to men. The DJ and producer, whose real name is Innocent Mogapi, said the single features Miss Twaggy. Ndoda, which tells men to be and do better, will be released tomorrow. Innocent DJ from Taung in North West told SunBuzz: “This song comes at a point when it’s needed the most. “It’s time men take a stand and protect women and children. It’s time they become men. “We’re facing turmoil, not just in South Africa, but all over the world.” He urged men not to be abusers, but to be pillars. The sound behind Ndoda was inspired by his debut single Me and You Together, released last year. “My music has an African sound. It’s more Afro beat and I add guitar as well. “That’s what makes people love my music. It’s my signature,” he said. “Me and You Together still plays on radio and people love it because of the guitar.” Innocent studied DJing 101 at the Soul Candi Institute of Music in 2010, and that’s where his career started blooming. “After finishing school at Soul Candi, I became a resident DJ for a few of clubs. “I played at events as well, I got bookings in Cape Town, Durban, Lesotho and Botswana. I started producing in 2014.” He’s working on his next single. “I want to drop the song before the end of the year. Lockdown has helped me work on my music a lot,” said Innocent DJ.
