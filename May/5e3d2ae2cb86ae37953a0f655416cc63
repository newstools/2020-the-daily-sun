A community
is grieving, and a family is devastated after an 18-year-old drowned in a river
in Khunwana Village in the North West. When
matriculants return to school on the 1st of June, that will not be the case for
Kagiso Modise who was doing grade 12 at Ga-Khunwana secondary school. His family
said they were alerted about his body that was floating on the water at a
nearby river that the community normally draws water from. His uncle,
Mogorosi Manyedi said his death left the family devastated as they had high
hopes for his future. “He was a
very intelligent child, even at school he was performing well, Kagiso was
currently in matric and he wanted to further his studies to become a lawyer,”
said the sobbing uncle. Manyedi
added that the said river was notorious for taking the lives of residents. “In twelve
months Kagiso is the third person to have drowned in this river, it is well
known that there is a snake in this river that kills people,” he said. He said
most people at the village normally see mermaids combing their hair at the spot
were Kagiso’s body was found.
