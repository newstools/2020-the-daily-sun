HUMAN Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu on Thursday visited Mamelodi Hostel in Tshwane. She was in the area to inspect temporary residential units being built to reduce the number of occupants in hostels. Sisulu said the units were being built to try and contain the spread of the coronavirus in congested hostels. According to the City of Tshwane, at least 6 100 people live in the hostels. They are overcrowded, making it difficult for residents to practise social distancing. The minister said the risks posed by overcrowding were real and this meant everyone in the housing sector needed to work together. She said 1 000 temporary structure units for single people and families were being built. They were expected to be complete by the end of next month. Resident Mandla Ndlazi said he was happy the government was providing them with new accommodation so they wouldn’t have to put their lives at risk. “There are many of us here and it’s difficult to practise social distancing. “Had government not intervened, we would probably have the highest number of infections here,” he said. Simon Mdlalose said he wished the government would give them permanent housing. “Overcrowding has been our problem for years and we’ve been complaining, but with no success. I guess we should say thank you to the coronavirus for making our government see our plight,” said the minister. Sisulu also received 12 water storage tanks donated by the Danish embassy as part of its efforts to flatten the curve of Covid-19.
