PHUMLANI Ntshangase’s agent Sizwe Ntshangase says the midfielder will leave Bidvest Wits when his contract expires at the end of this season after the club indicated they will not be retaining him. The 25-year-old, on loan with Maritzburg United, was promoted ahead of the 2013-14 season, and has since featured in 106 matches scoring three goals in the process. “Gavin Hunt (Wits coach) said he will let Phumlani go and he’s agreed to leave the club,” confirmed Ntshangase. This doesn’t come as a surprise as the Umlazi-born midfielder didn’t play a single match for Wits last season, before Hunt loaned him in the second round to SuperSport United in the 2018-19 season. When he returned to the Clever Boys, Hunt deemed him surplus to requirements. The likelihood now is that Ntshangase is set to join Maritzburg on a permanent basis before the 2020-21 season gets underway. This has been backed by the Team of Choice coach Eric Tinkler, who has praised Ntshangase’s selfless work and attitude in the club’s success in this campaign before it was suspended in March due to the Covid-10 pandemic. Added the agent: “Having said all that, there was something with Maritzburg but then those talks were disrupted by the Covid-19. So going forward, when football resumes next month, he’ll remain with Maritzburg.” The former junior international will leave Wits with his head held up high. He played a critical role when The Students were crowned Absa Premiership champions in the 2016-17 season, in what was Wits’ first league title in their 96-year history. Wits claimed the double in that season as they also won the MTN8 trophy. The following season, Ntshangase helped the club add the Telkom Knockout title and his departure will see him end eight years of services at the club.
