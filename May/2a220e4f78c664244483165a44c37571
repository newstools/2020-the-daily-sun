BESIDES the increasing number of people infected by coronavirus in South Africa, the return of football is the most talked about subject. Major leagues around the world that were suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak are in the process of re-starting. However, some leagues such as those in France, Scotland and Belgium decided to curtail their championships and award trophies based on matches already played. In the Netherlands, the season was simply voided. The German Bundesliga has resumed with the English Premier League hoping to resume as well next month. Here in Mzansi, it seems like football executives are struggling to come up with a feasible plan to finish the season. And Ajax Cape Town CEO Ari Efstathiou doesn’t entertain thoughts of voiding the season. “If we had only played 50% of the games, then maybe. But we’ve played 80% of our games and we are seven points ahead,” Efstathiou said. When the league was suspended, Ajax were comfortably sitting at the top of the GladAfrica Championship table with a seven points gap over second placed Swallows FC, and a good bet for promotion to the Absa Premiership. They are on course of bouncing back to the top-flight, and with six games left in the Championship, Ajax were looking at wrapping up the season. “It will be unfair to nullify the league for the guys that are on top. I don’t see any sense in that. It’ll favour guys that didn’t try harder rather than those that did. “If you look at us, Swallows and Uthongathi FC, there’s no doubt that we all deserve to be in the top three. “If you look at the ones at the bottom, they deserve to be at the bottom. It is not by chance. It is not that they have played less games.” He added: “Even if you look at Kaizer Chiefs, they have been leading the Premiership for the past couple of months. Yes, the chasing pack is catching up. “The bottom line is they are four points ahead. It’s not by luck, but because they played well.”
