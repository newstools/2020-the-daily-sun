IT seems men are also heavy on korobela. This is according to Tumi Motsoeneng, who’s known as gobela Sikhotheni. She told Daily Sun men have been flooding to her indumba asking for korobela since she started practising about eight years ago. She said many of them were in their early 20s, and more often they wanted muthi for sugar mamas. A video of Sikhotheni (28) from Embalenhle, Mpumalanga, went viral this week when she told her thwasas she would teach them how to prepare korobela for their clients. She posted another video on Facebook yesterday, revealing women were not the only ones who used korobela. She defended her earlier video, saying it was important to teach her thwasas about korobela. She said in the video: “It’s important I teach my thwasas about korobela so that when tomorrow you go to their indumbas to ask for it, they are able to help you.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Sikhotheni said she believed people should build their own happiness. “Muthi is there to perform the impossible,” she said.  She said men and women have come to her looking for korobela for various purposes.  She said: “Women often want korobela so their men could give them money and at times to be able to control them. I give it to them.” Sikhotheni said men often wanted korobela to either make women love or respect them, or to simply just move in with their sugar mamas. She said her kind of korobela was different from most muthi. “I put muthi inside their blood by using a razor.  “All they have to do is have contact with their partners, and they will be hooked. “My korobela is not for evil deeds such as getting people fired from work or to be hated,” she said.  “When a woman attempts to have sex with another man other than her partner, the other man will not get an erection. “I have also given a man muthi for his wife who refused to accept polygamy. Both the women were able to get along and like each other.”
