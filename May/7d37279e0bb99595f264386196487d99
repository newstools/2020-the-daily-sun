Award-winning performer and musician L’vovo was recently cyber-bullied. This was after the talented musician asked a student: “Academically kuhamba kanjan?” which can be loosely translated to how things are academically. One would expect students to respond positively by mentioning their challenges and their progress but things took a dramatic turn and the Kwenzenjani hitmaker was bullied for his weight.

This led him to withdraw his genuine question of concern and he said he will never ask a student again about their progress in school. “After much consideration. I have taken the decision to withdraw this question. Akuhambi kahle kubahlali,” he wrote. But tweeps continued to bully the star to a point where he jokingly said he will sit on someone’s face. “I’m going to sit on someone's face then you start saying L'vovo Must Fall,” he wrote.
