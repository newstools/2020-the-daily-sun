AFRIFORUM opened a corruption case at Wierdabrug Police Station in Centurion, Tshwane, yesterday after a company closely linked to Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was allegedly unlawfully awarded a state contract. CEO Kallie Kriel said Gauteng government awarded an illegal contract to IT company In2IT, closely linked to Lesufi. Kriel said it signed a sponsorship agreement with Moroka Swallows last year.

Nine months later, Gauteng Finance and e-Government awarded the company a R30 million tender without following the tender process or before the communications minister could approve.” Kriel said the tender was awarded within 24 hours after tenders were requested. Treasury later raised issues with the process. Kriel said in responding to claims, Lesufi never denied knowing about the tender. He said Lesufi only decided to end the Swallows sponsorship after the illegality of the In2IT tender came out. “If Lesufi’s association with In2IT wasn’t unlawful, why would he terminate his club’s relations with the company the moment questions about the tender started surfacing? “In2IT director, Memme Maria Siyo, is employed by the State Security Agency according to records. Government’s code of conduct prohibits any state official from doing business with government.” He hoped an investigation would shed light on serious questions around the tender and that those who acted unlawfully would be brought to book. Lesufi’s spokesman Steve Mabona said the MEC didn’t have time for clowns and called on AfriForum to stop being obsessed with him.
