Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer says his technical team is working hard to keep the players “socially connected” while they carry out virtual training sessions in the hope of returning to play soon. The German tactician is hoping to lead The Buccaneers on a late push for the Absa Premiership title when football returns with the league on pause since March 16 due to the coronavirus pandemic. He had had to rely on remote training, but says it is important to keep the human element alive to keep players motivated. “We rely a lot on online technology to carry out our daily sessions with the players. Our programme is focused on the following key components,” Zinnbauer said. “Conditioning training and running programmes, ball-mastery sessions, team playing unit and individual meetings to discuss the tactical elements of our game model. “We have been cooking together, playing board games and we do what we can to keep our team socially connected. “We have also been working with different external coaches to assist the team in preparation for our return to the field. The players are working hard and we’re looking forward to being back on the field soon.” Pirates trail league leaders Kaizer Chiefs by eight points, and have played a game more, but the lottery of form and fitness when football resumes means they could yet have a say in the title race. ??? ???????? ???????????? ??
