Even though the country is in crisis, some people want salons to be part of essential services while some think salons should be the least of Mzansi's problems. Certain individuals and Beauty therapists think salons are very important and should be opened during this national lockdown. According to Nomasonto Mngwevu who's been aÂ  beauty therapist for seven years, salons have been practicing safety precautions even before the Covid-19 pandemic. She said hairstylists and everyone who works at salons have been using gloves and always have sanitizers at their disposal. "I don't understand why the president won't let salons open. I think the government should look at how salons have been operating and make a decision based on what they see," she said. Nomasonto also told Daily Sun that if government is afraid of social distancing, the procedure of setting up appointments can be implemented in all salons. "Beauty therapists work with appointments all the time. They can at least limit the number of people coming in per day, not completely closing down them down. Let's also keep the crisis of job loses in mind," she said. Beauty therapist, Moipano Mokhali said beauty therapy goes beyond beautifying an individual. She said it's therapy and makes people feel great about themselves. "Some people even become depressed when they don't have their desired look. Salons always practice hygiene and it's nothing the government should worry about about. Lockdown won't end anytime soon and salons should be opened," said Moipone.
