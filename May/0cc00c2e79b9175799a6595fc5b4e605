BAROKA captain Gerald Phiri Jnr says it will be unfair to his former team Ajax Cape Town if the GladAfrica Championship has to be declared null and void because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The Urban Warriors are leading in the Championship with 48 points from six matches to end the season before the league was suspended in March. Second placed Swallows FC are seven points behind Ajax, having played the same number of matches. The PSL suspended all football indefinitely due to Covid-19. In the 2017-18 season while campaigning in the Absa Premiership, Ajax were controversially relegated in the 2017-18 season when they had seven points docked from them after the club was found guilty by arbitrator William Mokhari of illegally fielding Zimbabwean international striker, Tendai Ndoro. Ndoro, who is now playing for Absa Premiership side Highlands Park, was not eligible to sign and play for Ajax as he had already signed for two clubs in that season and signing for Ajax, his third club, was against Fifa rules. Ajax chairman Ari Efstathiou tried to appeal the decision, but judge Raylene Keightley dismissed their case due to lack of urgency, and the Cape Town-based side were relegated to the Championship. And now Phiri, a Malawian international, feels for Ajax if the Championship is made null and void, as the Urban Warriors will have to begin from scratch at the start of next season. “Ajax have done well so far this season, and they have fought to be at the top,” said Phiri. “It will be unfair on them (Ajax) to start the season from the beginning. Imagine the hard work they put to be where they are.” But Phiri has more pressing problems to deal with in trying to help Baroka avoid relegation if and when the PSL resumes. Said Phiri: “Even before the league was stopped, we were not thinking about relegation. Our aim is to fight to finish in a good position not fighting relegation.”
