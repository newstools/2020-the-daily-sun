Why you might be kissing with your eyes wide open? It is hard to imagine indulging in anything good with your eyes open. I mean, having a bite on your favorite food is impossible to enjoy without having that closing of your eye moment. But apparently you can be forgiven for not being able to kiss with your eyes closed. According to a study on vision and tactile sensory experience carried out by Royal Holloway University of London, it revealed there is one very good reason why you might be doing it. According to the study, our grey matter (brain) struggles to process another sense while also concentrating on the visual stimuli. So looking at the object of our affections while kissing them is the result. Simply put, our brain tends to focus on what we see verses what what we feel. The research further highlighted boredom as another possibility for not showing interest in the matters of the lips. Again our eyes tend to wonder off if they find it hard to focus on one thing. So, if you cant keep him/her interested during the kiss, they will find another site to behold because there's nothing to indulge in the moment.
