THE mayor of Engcobo, Siyabulela Zangqa, tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday. All councillors and individuals who might have been in contact with Zangqa are urged to avail themselves for testing, screening and possible quarantine measures if deemed appropriate. ANC Chris Hani regional secretary Lusanda Sizani said: “It is with great regret to learn Zangqa has contracted the Covid-19. As the ANC Chris Hani region, we extend our full support to him and his family during this trying period. “We understand that he might have been infected during the process of performing his civic duty as the mayor. “We commend his braveness and for not being coward to set up structures in that local municipality to ensure the Covid-19 curve is flattened, and that its spread is contained in lower margins,” he said. “It’s also our wish that communities refrain from stigmatising the virus and any person tested positive for it, and rather maintain a collective effort and measures to fight the epidemic. This virus knows no rich, poor, race, creed and borders, It affects the entire human race. “We wish the mayor a speedy recovery and also pray that he remains resolute without any distractions,” said Sizani Municipal spokesman SivuyileMyeko said: “As part of the municipality’s precautionary measures, municipal offices have been temporarily closed for purposes of disinfection.” He urged the public not to enter the premises, but to approach their ward councillors if they needed any assistance. “Non-essential staff will work from home,” he said. The Engcobo municipal offices are in the Chris Hani district. Chris Hani, Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo City were declared hot spots by President Cyril Ramaphosa. When he was addressing the nation on Sunday, the president said efforts to counter the spread of the virus in hot spot areas would be intensified to decrease the numbers of new infections.
