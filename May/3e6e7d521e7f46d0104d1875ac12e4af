POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has made it clear that the sale of booze in level three does not mean people can now hang out together. Speaking during a ministerial briefing this evening, Cele was clear that social visits were not allowed. "Visiting your friend,your girlfriend or boyfriend is not allowed. Social visits are not allowed in level three. You will drink alone",he said. He spoke briefly about cigarettes which are also banned during level three saying if one is caught with cigarettes,cops are allowed to ask one for a receipt and where they got the cigarettes. Cele then spoke briefly about church gatherings that will be limited to 50 saying curfews have been removed overall but social distancing rules must be maintained. "No hugging is allowed as people must still keep the 1.5 metre distance",he added. Regarding the permits that people need to move between metros and provinces, Police Minister Bheki Cele says people will need evidence on why they are travelling. For example, someone moving for work should have on them a letter from their employer which explains their situation. Similarly with funerals, one would need a permit from the police and a magistrate. Those travelling for funerals must be back home within 72 hours. Cele says 841 police members have been infected so far - 601 of those have been in the Western Cape. Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says the South African borders remain closed, apart from for evacuation and repatriation purposes, as well as for transportation of goods. Those who need to enter SA to attend schools will be allowed to do so, provided they have a permit. Home Affairs will resume issuing birth certificates. People who need to leave the country under special circumstances may apply for a passport.
