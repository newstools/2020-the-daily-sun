Have you ever played with a pinyada? That's a game that's often played during birthday parties and Halloween, which sees someone being blindfolded. They are then given a long stick and the objective of this game is take this long stick and hit a object (pinyada), which is often tied onto a tree and left to hang from the top. The fun comes in when you're trying to figure out where the pinyada is, and once you find it you have to hit it hard because it has all sorts of goodies filled inside it. Having sex in the dark is exactly like playing the pinyada game. You are often in a dark room with your partner (blindfold), and the objective is locate the pinyada (you know what that is) and hit or tap it until all the goodies come out. Most people get turned on when the lights are off. You see what I did there. This is because sexologists believe that most humans are sexually turned on by dimming or switching off the lights. A certain mood is created, and both partners level of sensuality is heightened. According to Glamour magazine, sex in the dark also offers a sense of comfort to those who are constantly obsessed with their body goals. Although some will dispute the idea, citing confidence and sexual experience arguments. Call me futuristic, but with the electricity crisis we have in our country don't you think those who are already practicing sex in the dark are ahead of us in terms working around our energy crisis? Jokes aside, again this is entirely up to you. You can decide to keep the lights on. Or be turned on, while the lights are off.
