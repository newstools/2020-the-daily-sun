Some clients of magoshas have been "difficult"
about the industry being shut during lockdown. But now Magoshas in New Zealand have been given the green
light to restart their business after it was stopped during lockdown. Magoshas are allowed back on the job after New
Zealand entered alert level 2. RNZ reports that guidelines were agreed to by officials
and the Prostitutes' Collective to keep magoshas and their clients safe. National coordinator Dame Catherine Healy said she had
spoken to many magoshas around the country and all of them had been lobbied by
clients about returning to work during alert levels 3 and 4. "There was an impatience there coming in from the
clients or a stupidity - I'm not sure which." She said it was just a small number of clients who were
putting pressure on sex workers. She is relieved the industry
has got approval for level 2 because clients may have flouted the law,
especially with regard to contact tracing, if magoshas were not allowed to
work. "It was felt that there would be a lot of
belligerence if sex workers were forced to hang on until level 1. In fact, we
felt it would be entirely unrealistic and the harm that could result in terms
of contact tracing. "The important thing is sex workers
aren't going to be in breach of the law." Healy said the rules are similar to most other
businesses - it is about good hygiene practices and keeping records for contact
tracing. In addition, the Prostitutes Collective has issued other
guidelines, including no kissing of clients and avoiding other people's breath. Some sex workers would also wear masks and they were
being encouraged to adopt other methods, such as fantasy sessions, that did not
involve physical contact.
