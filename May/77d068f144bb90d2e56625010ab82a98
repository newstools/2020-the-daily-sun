MAMELODI Sundowns supporter saw a gap for business
during COVID-19! He says he saw a business gap in making his favourite
team’s masks from scratch. According to him, he has already sold more than 2 000
masks. The Mamelodi Sundowns popular supporter says he started
making the masks towards the end of April. Abdul Mahomed (40) is from Primrose in Ekurhuleni and
where he is a Sundowns supporters’ chairman in his area. He even pimped his car in Sundowns colours for
everyone to see that he is a die heart fan. He has also named his other business Sundowns Auto
Body. He said his love for the team has pushed him to do
something that will help fight the pandemic. Abdul told Daily Sun that he only makes Sundowns masks
because it is his favourite team that he supports. "These masks are so special to me because they
have the colours of my number one team and they are also helping to protect
people from having COVID-19," he said He added that the story of masks is amazing because
many people never believed him when he did the masks. "Many people love my masks and people call me
from different places saying they need them. "There is nothing that makes me happy and proud
than making these masks in the amazing colours of Sundowns," he said He said the advantage of his masks is that they are
more quality, the material with a three-layer cloth and such become safe and
offers more protection. "This is not about making money but saving lives.
It is also about showing love to the team," he said. Abdul also does Sundowns golf t-shirts, branding
stickers for cars, and many more. He said his Toyota Tazz represents the Sundowns home jersey. Abdul said his family also supports the Tshwane based
team. He described the team's President Patrice Motsepe as a
good and caring man.
