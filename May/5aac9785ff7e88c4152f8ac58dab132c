It has been barely a month and already the Jika hitmaker has fired shots at those who have not subscribed to the platform but have opinions over it. People have been reviewing the platform online. One fan said R50 is a lot to pay per month, he can’t just blindly subscribe. “'Support local' they say, but it’s hard to blindly support without fully understanding what you are getting into. “It’s R50 now, R600 a year. And that’s money. So some of us want to understand what we’re signing up for, I love AKA but I can’t just blindly support him,” he said.

That’s 160k p/m. I’m asking you for 50 bucks. While not doing a single gig. I’m putting myself out there and you still complaining. Hayi man. Just buy a ticket, broer,” he wrote. The fed-up musician went on to say: “Just leave us as the Megacy to enjoy our #AKATV in peace please ... Nobody is forcing you.”
