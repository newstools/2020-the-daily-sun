Former
president Jacob Zuma has lost his appeal against a high court ruling that he
defamed ANC veteran Derek Hanekom, who he accused of being a "known enemy
agent". The Supreme
Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein dismissed Zuma's appeal without it being
heard, stating that there is no reasonable prospect of success in the appeal. The SCA
further held the view that there are no other compelling reasons why the appeal
should be heard. In 2019,
Zuma tweeted that Hanekom was a well-known agent of the enemy. His tweet
followed revelations that Hanekom had met with the EFF to discuss a motion of
no confidence in Zuma when he was the sitting president. Hanekom
took Zuma to court in a defamation case, which the former minister of tourism
won. The
KwaZulu-Natal High Court ordered Zuma to apologise for the tweet and
interdicted him from publishing any statement in the future that said or
implied that Hanekom was an enemy agent or apartheid spy. SOURCE:
