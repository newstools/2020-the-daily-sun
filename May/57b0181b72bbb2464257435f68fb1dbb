THE Gqabu family, which lost all its belongings in a shack fire, has been dealt another blow. Daily Sun published the story last week under the headline, “Only our cat survived vutha!”  ALSO READ: ONLY OUR CAT SURVIVED VUTHA Nozuko Gqabu (42) said while trying to get help to rebuild their three shacks, other residents started erecting shacks on their stand. She said residents of Phantsikocingo squatter camp in Browns Farm, Cape Town, had been eyeing the stand from the time when their dad was still alive. “There was nothing we could do because we don’t own the space. They wanted to build shacks while my father was still alive but he never gave them the opportunity. They finally got their chance after the fire.” She said 20 shacks had replaced their three shacks, which were gutted by fire. Lulamile Mayarha (40) felt sorry for the family. “But we’ve been renting for too long. So when we saw the space we decided to invade it and build our shacks. We don’t have money to pay rent so we couldn’t miss this opportunity,” he said. Lulamile said some people had lost their jobs since the lockdown and eviction by landlords. “They had a lot of space while we’re paying rent, but that’s all in the past now because we got the space and built our homes.” Nosipho Mjacu (34) built there because she didn’t have a place to stay. “My landlord chased me out after I failed to pay rent. When we saw how big the family’s space was we decided to build shacks, but we left space for them to rebuild their shacks.” No one knows what started the fire, but the family believes it was vutha sent to destroy them.
