The Department of Education is faced with more learner deaths and the Gauteng MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi is saddened by this. He expressed his pain and concern after learning of two recent deaths that happened in separate schools in Hammanskraal. Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said an 8-year-old learner lost her life due to a faulty electrical cable. "It is alleged that the girl got electrocuted after touching a cable which was wrongly earthed at her home on the 29th of April," said Mabona. He said the learner from Selang Primary School unfortunately died upon arrival at the hospital. Meanwhile a 12-year-old boy learner from Lethabo Phalane Primary School allegedly died of diabetes. "Sadly, the boy learner allegedly experienced complications on Tuesday, 21 April at home, and was rushed to a local hospital and succumbed to his chronic sickness on Thursday, 23 April," said Mabona. Mabona said the police are investigating circumstances surrounding the death of the electrocuted girl. “We would like to convey our sincere condolences to both families and the school community. We pray for their strength during this time of affliction” said Lesufi. He said both schools will facilitate memorial services to celebrate their lives, after the lockdown period.
