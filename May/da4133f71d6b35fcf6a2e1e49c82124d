Kaizer Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro says being away from his loved ones in his homeland of Colombia during this pandemic, has been tough. The South American is one of many foreign PSL players who have been away from home throughout the lockdown as they await the return of action. Although he feels at home in Mzansi having spent almost five years after his arrival from Bolivia, Castro would have loved to spend the lockdown with his loved ones in Colombia. The 31-year-old is a few months shy of qualifying for permanent residency, which requires full five years of uninterrupted living in South Africa. “We all want to be closer to our families, especially in a time like this as family members need to support each other,” Castro told his club’s official website. “I am here for a while now and used to South Africa, but Colombia is my home and that is where my parents are. There is nothing one can do at this stage but to have faith that this will not take long.” Castro urged fans to continue following the government regulations during lockdown in order to flatten the curve and stop the spread of the deadly virus. “It is this time when you have to get closer to your family. Mostly, I advise everyone to learn from this change and new normal,” added Castro. “We are at home and taking part in activities, including training. The kids are enjoying doing new things. We received school programmes before lockdown. It keeps us busy every day and they are enjoying it a lot.” Castro is trying to keep fit during this time so that he is ready to go should the league resume soon. “Training is all about discipline. I take care of myself and follow the team programme religiously,” he added. “Some days I put in extra work when necessary. With all the training we do, I miss the action on the pitch with the rest of the squad.”
