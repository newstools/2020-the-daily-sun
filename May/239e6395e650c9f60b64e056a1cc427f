GROWING up, her dream was to compete in the Miss South Africa pageant. And when she became Miss Mamelodi Sundowns in March, Kadija Makhanya (23) took her first step towards this goal. “This is a big platform with a great impact and reach. “To have this opportunity given to me in the way it was has made it very meaningful,” she said. Born in Umlazi, south of Durban, Kadija said her ambition was to be crowned Mzansi’s most beautiful woman. “I’m confident and excited for the journey that lies head. I’m aware of my capabilities and I know I’ll make everyone proud,” she said. Kadija said this year, Miss SA decided Miss Sundowns would automatically be a semifinalist in the top 35. “I’m happy for the opportunity to take part in Miss South Africa, as it has always been my dream. “I’m on a constant journey to become the best version of myself while remaining authentically me.” Kadija said her mum was her number one supporter and she had a great support system. “My family and friends are my rock. I’m so grateful for their support,” she said. Kadija said the coronavirus pandemic was affecting everyone and safety and health were a priority. “Most of my normal activities have been affected but I’m working remotely. The nature of most of my work requires travel and mass gatherings,” she said. “It was a bit disappointing to be crowned and then three weeks into my reign, the pandemic hits Mzansi.” Kadija, who lives in Cape Town, is a part-time civil engineering student at Tshwane University of Technology. She said she was passionate about innovation and development. “I aspire to be one of the few leading women in the construction industry,” she said.
