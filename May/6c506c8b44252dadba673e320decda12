IT is no secret that Rhulani Mokwena has a soft spot for Orlando Pirates. In fact, the incumbent Chippa United coach has an unfinished business at the Buccaneers! Mokwena is currently on loan at Chippa, and it is still unclear where he will be in the new season.But what is clear is his wish to return to a club which gave him his big break as a head coach at the highest level. ”We’ve seen these things happen in football. We saw Mourinho leave Chelsea and come back and many other coach, ” said Mokwena. ”But I don't have control over that. What I do have control over is my growth as a coach. ”Whether that means growing away from or with Pirates... ”The most important thing is I continue to grow.” Mokwena faces an inevitable task of keeping the Chilli Boys, who are two defeats away from safety with 26 points, in the money-spinning Absa Premiership, post the coronavirus-enforced break. But significantly, he has to assert his credentials as the right man for the big PSL in the long term.
