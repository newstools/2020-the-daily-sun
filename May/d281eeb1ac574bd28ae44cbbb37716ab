MANY players have come and gone, but others such as Siyabonga "Nsimbi" Sangweni have left an indelible mark inÂ  the PSL. Sangweni was a rare type of a defender who could easily read the game and launch attacks from the back. Orlando Pirates snapped him up from Golden Arrows in 2011 after some impressive performances and instrumental in Pirates winning the treble. He also scored some memorable goals for Golden Arrows, Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana. Who can forget his special goal for Bafana Bafana against Cape Verde in Durban in the 2013 Afcon tournament? Sadly, in 2016 it was announced that he had to retire prematurely due to a recurring injury - he had 29 Bafana caps at that time. What other memories do you have of Nsimbi?
