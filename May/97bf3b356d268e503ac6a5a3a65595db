A pigeon has been handed over to the cops after
being accused of being a spy. The pigeon was caught in India after being accused of
being a Pakistani spy. The alleged spy was discovered by Geeta Devi who lives in
the Kathua district of Kashmir after the bird flew into her home on May 24. It was found having been painted pink and was carrying
around on its foot a ring with numbers on. The Times of India reports that Senior Superintendent of
Kathua Police Shailendra Kumar Mishra said: 'We don't know from where it came.
Locals captured it near our fences. We have found a ring in its foot on which
some numbers are written. 'Further investigation is underway.' The bird was captured by locals near the India-Pakistan
border fence and was eventually passed on to the police by the Indian Border
Security Force. The Telegraph reported that police told the Times of
India: 'Though birds have no boundaries and many fly across international
borders during migration, a coded ring tagged to the captured pigeon's body is
a cause for concern as migratory birds don't have such rings.' The pigeon will remain in police custody until they have
finished their investigations. This is not the first time that a spying pigeon has been
caught passing between India and Pakistan. In 2015 another
pigeon was intercepted, this time in Manwal village two and a half miles from
the border. It had the message 'Tehsil Shakargarh, district Narowal'
in Urdu stamped on its tail along with some numbers. The area mentioned is Pakistan's Punjab province. Though an X-ray was carried out on the bird, nothing
suspicious was found Police kept it in their custody anyway and listed it as a
'suspected spy'.
