Responding to Prince Kaybee, DJ Black Coffee sarcastically asked whether Prince Kaybee is a celebrity. "Here’s a question without the 'urge of sounding intelligent'... are you a celebrity?" he asked. The mouthful music producer responded and said: "Hosh Coffee. I see myself more as a servant of the people, if people wish to call me a celebrity or celebrate me it’s a blessing. I’m an artist and creator first, I don’t care much about the definitions of the industry because I know who and what I am."

You are way too popular and influential to not help other people grow. Why must they not do it? What lessons can you teach besides a loose comment? Angilwi teach us." Prince Kaybee responded and said: "Hosh Euphonik. The DJ live sets on TV are AFPs (advertiser funded programming) sponsors pay per episode, does it make sense to pay for studio, crew, catering, lights, broadcast signal, cameras operators and NOT PAY DJ while there are three sponsors plus channel budget? Ha ke lwane." SEE TWEETS:
