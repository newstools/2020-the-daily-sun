THE return of Joey Mongalo to the Bulls from the Lions is not only about a switch between two franchises. Mongalo has joined the Bulls as a defence coach in Jake White’s new-look coaching team, which also includes breakdown specialist Nollis Marais, forwards coach Russell Winter and current backline coach Chris Rossouw. The 35-year-old’s appointment also underlines the Bulls’ commitment towards transformation, which is lacking at franchise level. The Sharks have former SA Schools A coach Phiwo Nomlomo as the skills coach, the Stormers have Rito Hlungwani (forwards) and Hanyani Shimange (scrum) in their coaching set-up. But there is still an acute lack of transformation, and perhaps faith in black coaches within the franchises, as seen when the Lions opted for Ivan van Rooyen as head of coaching staff ahead of an equally competent Mongalo. The SA Rugby Union have expressed their discontent with the make-up of coaching teams, and vowed pressure will be applied on the teams to give more black coaches opportunities. Mongalo has, over a decade, proven he has the credentials to occupy a bigger position and the latest move could help open the path to bigger things for him. He has served in several positions, including defence and attack for the Currie Cup, Super Rugby, SuperSport Rugby Challenge and junior teams, where he contributed to the back-to-back SA Rugby Under 19 Championship titles. Mongalo bid an emotional farewell to the Lions, thanking the people who have helped shape his career, so far. “It is never easy to bid farewell, particularly when one has formed meaningful bonds with an astute organisation such as the Lions Rugby Company, the exceptional groups of players, staff and management teams over the last decade,” said Mongalo. “I’m thankful to every coach and management member that I have served with or led, every player that I have had the privilege to coach and all the ground, office and kitchen staff for making a positive difference in my life.”
