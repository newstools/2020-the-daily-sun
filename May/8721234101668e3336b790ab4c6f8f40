DEPUTY President David Mabuza has refused to be drawn into allegations of Duduzane Zuma’s direct involvement in his trip to Russia. Although it’s on public record that Mabuza admitted to getting a lift from the Guptas to Russia to get specialised treatment for poisoning, Duduzane recently stirred up the matter by claiming he personally arranged it after he was approached. On his new YouTube channel, Zooming with the Zumas, Duduzane revealed Mabuza was again accommodated at the Guptas’ establishment when he returned from his treatment. But Mabuza’s spokeswoman Matshepo Seedat said Mabuza would not respond to the allegations and referred questions around the poisoning to Parliament records. “The deputy president has in the past, including in Parliament, spoken openly on these issues. We have no comment on the video and any questions should be directed to Mr Duduzane Zuma himself,” she said. In the video, Duduzane is in conversation with former president Jacob Zuma, but he was not clear why he brought up the issue of helping Mabuza. However, he indicated he and Mabuza enjoyed a cordial relationship and would talk on the phone. He also revealed Mabuza was no longer taking his calls and he didn’t know why. “There has been a breakdown with my relationship with Mabuza and it’s not from my side but his side. I clearly don’t know why and maybe we will have that discussion one day. I am the man who was part of saving his life and we used to speak on the phone,” he said. But Zuma did not express his opinion on the matter and it’s not clear if he will do so in the next part of what promises to be a series of discussions.
