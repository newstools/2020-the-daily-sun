Actress Dawn Thandeka-King has shaved off her hair. With the lockdown's strict regulations, it means salons remain closed, which then means there will be no changing of hairstyles. This is one of the reasons that theÂ Uzalo actress, who plays gangster Mangcobo in the popular SABC1 soapie, opted to shave all her hair. The star took to her Instagram account to show off her new hairdo. I shaved it all off...... I blame it on the Lockdown, ???????? #Quarantinediaries A post shared by  Dawn Thandeka King (@dawnthandeka_king) on May 8, 2020 at 9:56am PDT
