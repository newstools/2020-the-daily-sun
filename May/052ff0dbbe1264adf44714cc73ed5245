SHE recently gave birth to four kids. And she breastfeeds them every morning before she leaves to graze. But before she leaves, the gogo goat knocks on her owner’s kitchen door to demand bread to generate milk. And to get her owner Zandile Kuwane’s attention, gogo goat bleats at the kitchen door or pushes it open. When Zandile doesn’t respond, gogo goat enters the kitchen to search for the bread herself. Zandile (34) from Diepkloof, Soweto, said the gogo goat is the oldest of their 12 goats. “She has given birth to other goats which have their own kids. That’s the reason we call her gogo goat. She doesn’t spend a lot of time in the kraal because she currently has four kids to feed and look after,” said Zandile. She said their father left them the goats when he died in June last year. “He used to love and take care of them, and we are continuing with the legacy. This our inheritance,” she said. “I don’t have a problem looking after goats while my peers go around the township in high heels and the latest fashion brands.” Zandile said her dream was to one day become a big livestock farmer. “We wish government provided us with enough land to grow this business. I am currently unemployed and my sister is the only breadwinner,” she said. She said she looked after the goats during the week, while her sister Zanele took over on weekends. Zanele said: “Our father used to spoil his goats and fed them anything. “He mainly used to feed then dry maize corn and vegetable leaves.”
