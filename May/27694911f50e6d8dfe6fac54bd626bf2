HUNDREDS of performing artists who applied for financial relief haven’t been paid. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said they didn’t meet the criteria, meaning the department couldn’t pay them. Addressing an interministerial briefing yesterday, he said some of the artists were advised to immediately lodge appeals. A three-person panel had been established to help with appeals.

Of these, 232 were recommended and the process of payment was started, while 603 were rejected and 203 referred back to the department. When government announced the lockdown last month, it set aside R150 million to help artists. Among those who should have benefitted were those whose performances had to be cancelled. Mthethwa used yesterday’s briefing to announce strict guidelines for production companies which might be allowed to start shooting again. The guidelines require companies to sanitise sets before shooting started, during each shoot day and at the end of each day. “There must be dedicated cleaning staff to sanitise and clean bathroom spaces regularly throughout the day, and a daily register of all people granted access to the set must be set up, with their daily temperatures. “Where possible, all crew and cast must use their own transport and those without must be provided by the company. “The driver and all occupants in a vehicle must wear face masks.” He said catered meals on set needed to be boxed separately for each person with sealed cutlery, or people bring their own meals. No shared craft and catering areas would be allowed.
