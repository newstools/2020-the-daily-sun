BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coaches are having a nightmare lockdown with their families as they were allegedly paid peanuts last week. SunSport has reliably learnt that Siwelele development structure coaches together with Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka who are in charge of the first team were each paid R10 000 or less last Thursday. As if that was not enough, ground keepers and those who work at the Siwelele office felt the pinch more since they were allegedly paid R1 000 and R900 respectively. A coach, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid being victimised, says he was shocked when he got a bank notification on his mobile phone. “I could not believe that I got paid peanuts. I thought my eyes were deceiving me when I looked on my phone. What can I do with less R6 000? And how am I supposed to pay all my bills? This is the third consecutive month that I didn’t get my full salary. The players always get paid up to their last cent while we suffer every month. The management got the full monthly grant (of R2 million from the Premier Soccer League) and I don’t understand why they are treating us like trash.” A fuming ground keeper, who didn’t want to reveal his identity, says he was surprised when he was told that the club has no money. “I got paid R1 000 and when I enquired I was told that it’s an advance and the club has no money. How can they give me a lousy advance instead of giving me my salary? This is the worst amount I was ever paid in my entire career in the football industry. Management don’t bother how we survive together with our families, as long as their pockets are full. They frustrate us every month.” Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco said: “I won’t comment unless you tell me who spoke to you.”
