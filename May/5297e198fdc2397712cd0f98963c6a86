South African swimming superstar Chad le Clos has gone under the knife and will be out of action for up to six weeks. Fortunately in this case, Le Clos will miss no swimming meets of any importance due to the continued shut-down of all sport due to the coronavirus pandemic. Le Clos, who was forced to beat a hasty exit from his Turkish training base prior to South Africa going into lockdown in late March, took to social media on Monday to post a picture post-surgery. Le Clos added: Hey guys quick update - had 2 surgeries this weekend to fix a couple of long term problems and both were a success. Recovering well but will be out of action for 4-6 weeks. Thanks for all the support. While it's unclear what the surgeries were for, Le Clos dealt with a groin hernia heading into the 2019 FINA World Championships, and it was reported at the time that it may require surgery after the meet. Le Clos, 28, is South Africa's most decorated Olympian of all time, having won a gold and three silver medals to date. He would've been odds-on to add to that tally at this year's Tokyo Olympics before Covid-19 put paid to those plans, postponing the Games by 12 months.
