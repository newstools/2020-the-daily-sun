Mamelodi Sundowns striker Mauricio Affonso is desperate to get back to action as he continues to recover from injury from home. The 28-year-old Uruguayan, who joined the club at the beginning of the season, struggled with a number of niggling issues before undergoing a groin operation. He returned home for recovery and wasn't expected to play again this season. And while he is not missing any games - with no football being played as a result of the coronavirus - the former Alianza Lima frontman is sick of being sidelined. Reflecting on his time at the club so far and his recovery, Affonso told the club's official website: "I left as soon as I started finding some form, I scored the goals in the Telkom Cup but was then frustrated with this persistent groin issue I had been carrying. "That is why after speaking with the club and coach, we decided it best for me to have the operation and return for pre-season and give the upcoming campaign my all." He added: "It's tough as a player when you get injured, especially when you join a club and have a lot to prove. It takes time to adjust to a new playing style and settle into the club, I was getting there and then this happened. "This quarantine has made me miss football. I watch a lot of match replays and am in constant contact with the club and my teammates which makes me want to get back sooner. "The club, coach and doctors have all been great, I am two months post operation and am recovering well. I want to continue doing the rehab work, so that I can get back doing what I love the most, playing football." - TEAMtalk media
