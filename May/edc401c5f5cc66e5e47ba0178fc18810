COLD and powerless. This has been the painful lockdown experience for the residents of Bophelong. The kasi near Vanderbijlpark, Vaal, has been experiencing long periods without electricity following the damage to one of the transformers at the power station in Vanderbijlpark. Dozens of gatvol residents braved the cold weather yesterday to protest outside the gates of Emfuleni municipal offices, chanting and waving placards. They demanded to why the load shedding implemented by the municipality to help ease the load on the single remaining transformer was hit them more than other kasis. Speaking to public works MMC Bheki Ntsele, who attended to the residents’ cries, community leader Thabiso Maphike said their kasi was being discriminated against. “We’ve been having these issues for a long time, and nothing has been done. “When mlungu’s have electricity issues, they gather at the power station and their issues are resolved,” said Thabiso. “Are we supposed to do the same? We need a permanent solution to this. “We need the municipality to tell us when will our issue get attention.” Another community leader said they didn’t have issues with the load shedding schedule, but they were always the ones left in the dark. “When the schedule says it’s our turn, we are left in the dark. “When it’s the other area’s turn, it continues with us,” he said. Ntsele said since July last year, the municipality replaced up to 21 transformers. He said to resolve the matter they have to normalise Bophelong.
