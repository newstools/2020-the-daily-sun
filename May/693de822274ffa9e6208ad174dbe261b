KAITANO Tembo is heading back to school... inside the comfort of his home this time. The SuperSport United coach is scheduled to train under some of the top European managers in Spain and improve his tactical knowledge, thanks to the initiative of his La Liga and his club. The Spanish football organisation have implemented digital programmes to ensure players and coaches keep learning and developing themselves during the lockdown necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The course applies to various clinics, international federations and clubs faced with similar conditions as a result of the deadly outbreak. The programme will begin with a look into how to develop a seamless transition strategy for players moving from the academy into a first-team environment. It will also delve into the holistic perspective on a game model and the team's strategies, which will result in the development of a proper management structure within the team and the technical staff. ”Education is key to the develop of the game and this can only be done by sharing knowledge with insiders and football experts, ” said Tembo. ”The ability to have a masterclass presented by La Liga and its stakeholders allows us to further develop our knowledge of the game. ”During these unprecedented times, we can adapt to new ways of learning and sharing insights, understanding the Spanish methodology and sharing our South African philosophies.”Not only does this allow for my development by that of my team and the players too.” La Liga SA managing director Marco Pelegrin has given the initiative the thumbs up. He said: ”Kaitano is one of the best coaches in the PSL currently. This is also a great opportunity for La Liga to gain more knowledge about South African football, as well as for Temvo to get to know more about the Spanish approach to the game.”
