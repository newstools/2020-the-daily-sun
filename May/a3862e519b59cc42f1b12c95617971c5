SINCE the 2019/20 season started only three players have  managed to feature in every minute of the Premiership season to date, with two of those coming from SuperSport United. The trio are the true ever-presents for their sides after 24 games, while a fourth has missed just a single minute to leave him desperately close to the honour as well. The SuperSport duo of goalkeeper Ronwen Williams and defender Clayton Daniels have not missed a second for their side this campaign, which for the latter especially is a huge achievement. The 32-year-old has completed all 24 league matches, and 31 games in total in helping Matsatsantsa to the MTN8 title in September. The pair are joined by Chippa United defender Kevin Moyo, who has also played every minute for his side in what is his first season in South Africa after joining from Zimbabwe’s Platinum FC. The 27-year-old has immediately become a key figure for his team, and the only one in the squad to have started more than 20 matches. Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile was desperately close to joining them, but he was substituted off in the last minute of the 2-0 win over Chippa United in October to spoil his record. - SuperSport.com
