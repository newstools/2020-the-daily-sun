When the four women heard them breaking in through the roof, they stood their ground and fought for their belongings. One of them, aged 24, told Daily Sun it was at about 1am yesterday morning when they were woken by a noise of the roof being broken at their house in Bester near KwaMashu, north of Durban. “We have a two-roomed house. They broke the roof of the dining room and jumped inside the house,” she said. “But by then, my mother was already there, waiting for them.” 'OUR KIDS ORDER UBER TO ROB DRIVERS' She said one of the thugs saw her mother in the dark and hit her with a gun. “My mother fought with them, asking them what they wanted in the house. Me and my sisters joined her in fighting them off,” said the daughter. She said one of them managed to escape. “We switched on the lights and asked the other thug who his friend was. He told us the name and told us they wanted a speaker that was in our house,” she said. “We don’t know if it was a real gun. Some residents said it was real but it didn’t have bullets. “I think they wanted to scare us with it because they know we are women and there’s no man in the house.” She said they called the cops and the man was arrested.
