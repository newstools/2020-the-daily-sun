FOUR young boys went fishing as usual on Monday morning but instead made a gruesome discovery. A unidentified woman’s body was found lying on the bridge at Vezubuhle near KwaMhlanga. The woman, believed to be between 20 and 25 years old, had a cut on the right eye and bruised neck and hands. The body was hidden under a rock. The woman was wearing a pair of blue jeans, pink socks and a peach T-shirt. The boys, aged 13 to 15, said they ran back home to raise the alarm after seeing the body. “We couldn’t catch any fish all morning. A stone blocked the water,” said one of the boys. “We thought that was why there were no fish and removed the big stone and saw the body. “We ran back home and told our parents, who phoned the cops.” A 33-year-old woman told the People’s Paper: “When we passed here with my friends in the early morning, we didn’t see anything. “We were on our way to the mall to queue for shopping. It’s shocking that a woman’s body was lying dead in the bridge tunnel. “This is scary. We leave home while it’s still dark to go queue at the mall.” Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a murder case was opened. Anyone with information was asked to call Colonel Nompumelelo Manzini on 082 318 9651.
