AMAZULU boss Lunga Sokhela says his side will now rely on youth for success instead of pinning their hopes on over-aged players in the PSL. Sokhela told SunSport that they will follow in Ajax Amsterdam’s footsteps by grooming talent from their development structures. He emphasised that the new approach will also help them to save money instead of signing the so-called experienced players who will milk their pockets. Said Sokhela: “We have looked at players who did well in our MDC (MultiChoice Diski Challenge) side. We have three boys we have put in our first team programme and when the new season starts they will be ready. “We also have about four or five boys that are on loan in the NFD (GladAfrica Championship) who have done well and we want to bring them back. We are at a stage where we don’t see the need to buy players.” Sokhela also revealed that Usuthu fans will witness a new brand of exciting attacking football next season in line with the new philosophy. “We want to play with high tempo and that’s why we need to have a lot of youth. We have good youngsters like Sibusiso Mabiliso (21), Sphesihle Maduna who is a 20 year-old. Not forgetting Tapelo Xoki, a 25-year-old with lot of experience. “We want to play a similar style that was introduced by Foppe De Haan at Ajax Cape Town, including lots of speed and energy in the team. We can’t say we want to take this direction if we sign a 37-year-old.” Sokhela revealed that they will also come up with a different strategy to generate money since the coronavirus pandemic has cost them on sponsorship deals and gate takings. “The Covid-19 says to us ‘guys you need to do things differently and adapt to the new world’. We will never live in a world with a lot of sponsors and spectators like before. “People lost their jobs and they won’t have R700 to buy an AmaZulu jersey. That’s why we want to focus on youth development rather than buying players.”
