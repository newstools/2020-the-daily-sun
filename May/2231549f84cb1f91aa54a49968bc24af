Kaizer Chiefs head of sports science Jarred Marsh has revealed the new methods the club are using to keep players fit during the coronavirus lockdown. Premier Soccer League clubs have had to learn to adjust quickly to the new environment and have turned to technology to administer group training sessions, via software like Zoom. Marsh has explained that training at home not only requires a different approach but also has different goals to the training schedules used under normal circumstances. "The exercise is not the same as having access to training fields. Training at the Village is geared at playing football. Our online training focuses on preventing injuries," explained Marsh on the Kaizer Chiefs website. "We focus on stabilising, doing core, movements, cardiovascular and conditioning. With this programme, we want to keep the players as fit as possible. "The training has to generally suit every kind of home setting. Players have three running sessions per week in their programme. "Each player responds differently from the impact of road running. We have devised sessions to allow players to build up the intensity of their exercising. "The programme includes building a strong vascular base to allow the acceleration and slowing down movements, which are part of football match functioning. "Through video, the players are divided into smaller groups. We are able to monitor them via GPS. Every player has a GPS app through which we can monitor the distance covered, speed and heart rate. "We don't know how much time we will be given to prepare for the remaining matches. It is going to be important after lockdown to prepare the team adequately. "Lack of match exposure may cause injuries and hamper the results and progress. We are looking forward to the day we return to the pitches."
