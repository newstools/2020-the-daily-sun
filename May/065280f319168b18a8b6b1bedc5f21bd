RESIDENTS of Old Crossroads in Cape Town are still reeling in shock after five people died in a house fire on Monday night. The victims were two couples and a one-year-old boy from Zimbabwe. They were renting rooms on the ground floor of a double-storey house. Residents who were patrolling the area saw flames coming from the house and rushed to help. Gcinikhaya Nondabula (42) said they were patrolling when they saw a cloud of smoke coming from the direction of the house. “We ran to the house, but the fire had spread to the rooms on the ground floor. “I never saw such fire in my life. We alerted the tenants who live on the top floor,” said Gcinikhaya. Resident Yoliswa Tukushe (47) said it was the first time something like that had happened in the area. “That fire looked like vutha because we did everything to try and save them, but the fire was fighting anyone who came close to the door,” she said. Tenant Itari Marwa (39) thanked the patrollers for their efforts in stopping the flames. He told Daily Sun he was grateful to them for saving his life. “If it wasn’t for the patrollers who were screaming saying there’s fire in the house, I was going to be among those who died in that fire along with my wife and kid. “We managed to jump for safety and luckily no one was injured,” said Itari. Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk confirmed the incident. “Two women, two men and a one-year-old child succumbed to their injuries. An inquest docket has been opened and the cause of the fire is unknown,” he said.
