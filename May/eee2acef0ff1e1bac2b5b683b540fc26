THE coronavirus has released creative juices among many. Jonathan Ndou turns heads wherever he goes with his face mask made of a leaf. The 28-year-old said people thought he was trying to be funny when went to the malls. But he insisted he was only protecting himself from Covid-19. Jonathan from Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said he was doing it to show people that they needed to do anything to protect themselves from the virus, including those who didn’t have money to buy masks. He said a lot of people laughed at him, but he didn’t mind. “I don’t mind whatever they think of me. Some laugh, saying I am crazy. But if they think I’m worried, they’d better think again, said. “There’s nothing wrong with this beautiful leaf face mask. “I love it, and I am following the lockdown regulations to curb the spread and prevent the risk of getting infected,” he said. He said it worried him every time he saw people not wearing masks. “I’m worried about poor people whose lives are at risk of being infected with coronavirus, especially orphans, as they don’t have money to buy these costly fashionable face masks being sold for up to R70 each,” Jonathan told Daily Sun. “Instead of buying costly face masks, I use my natural leaf face mask from the indigenous tree as I save the little I have to help others. I use it once a day and throw it away.” Jonathan, who studied N4 civil engineering, said he planned to use some of the money he earned as an intern to help the needy. He said he was also planning to raise more money to buy masks so he could donate them to the poor through his foundation, Hand of Hope.
