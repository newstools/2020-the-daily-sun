If you breach lockdown regulations, you can be fined as much as R5 000 and end up with a criminal record. Offences include being caught with liquor or spreading fake news about Covid-19. The judiciary has issued a list of offences under the Disaster Management Act that carry admission of guilt fines of between R500 and R5 000. Judiciary spokesperson Nathi Mncube told News24 the chief magistrate determined fines annually, but that there was particular interest in the latest fines, owing to lockdown regulations. "In terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, these fines are issued every year in agreement with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA)." Some of the offences that will result in a R5 000 fine being issued include: You can also be fined R3 000 for failing to close a non-essential business  and R2 000 for selling non-essential goods. Lesser amounts include R1 000 fines for a failure to confine yourself to your home and moving between provinces (outside of the grace period), as well as not adhering to the curfew of staying at home between 20:00 and 05:00 without a permit; and R500 for running, cycling, walking beyond 5km of your residence and outside the allocated hours of 06:00 and 09:00. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/you-can-be-fined-up-to-r5-000-for-breaking-these-lockdown-rules-20200507
