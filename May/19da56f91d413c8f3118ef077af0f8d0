Gogo Nomsa Mqhalana has been waiting for 15 years to have a house. The 74-year-old lives alone in a shack at Nyankathisa squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. She told Daily Sun she’s survived two shack fires. “It’s difficult and scary to stay in a shack. You burn or lose your belongings at anytime.” She doesn’t remember the year she registered for a house but believes she should’ve received it by now. “I don’t know what’s holding them back from giving me the house. I registered years ago.” The gogo said last month her shack caught fire because of faulty electrical wires. “You know what happens in a squatter camp. People connect electricity illegally. I don’t know what they did but the fire started on the electrical wires they connected on top of my shack, and I almost died,” she said. “Living in a shack is a nightmare. I’m praying to get my house before the end of this year. “There are a lot of problems here. When it’s not fire it’s floods. We struggle to sleep. The City of Cape Town must give me my house,” said gogo Nomsa. Her neighbour Noxolo Mgquba (37) said seeing elderly people living in shacks broke her heart. “I wish government can start taking care of elderly people. They don’t deserve to stay in shacks.” Human Settlements MMC Malusi Booi said gogo Nomsa registered on the housing database on 11 December 2005. “Generally, there’s no specific timeframe as it depends on the availability of housing opportunities, and whether an applicant qualifies when the opportunities do become available,” said Booi. “It’s also important for the resident to keep her address and cellphone number up to date so the city can contact her when it’s her turn to be assisted.”
