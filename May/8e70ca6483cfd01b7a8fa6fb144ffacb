THE shortage of clean water in some Limpopo areas could see an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases around the province. And some residents have started panicking about their safety. This is because the people of ward 13 in Schoonoord, Ga-Sekhukhune, still face water challenges. Resident Mishack Morobela (57) said they’ve been without water for months. “Our municipality failed to give us water a long time ago.” He said government has urged people to wash their hands regularly to avoid the spread of Covid-19, but they were still lacking water. “We live in a situation where we can’t run away from this pandemic because we don’t have water at all,” he said. “Life has become something else because our own government has failed us.” Another resident, Christine Komane (40), said they’re unemployed and it was a challenge for them to buy water. “This is because we have to go deep into our pockets for water,” said Christine. “We feel like this virus will easily attack us because we don’t have water to wash our hands,” she said. “I wish government knew the importance of water before the virus strikes.” Sekhukhune municipal spokesman Moloko Moloto, said the municipality was aware of the crisis. He said efforts were underway to get equipment as soon as possible. “In the meantime, the municipality will provide residents with water through tankers,” said Moloto.
