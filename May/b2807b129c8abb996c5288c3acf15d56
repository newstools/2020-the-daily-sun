THEFT and vandalism have put the brakes on rail transport. For more than two months, trains have not been running to many stations between Joburg and Vereeniging. This has left thousands of commuters in the Vaal area, south of Joburg, stranded and frustrated, even before the lockdown stopped rail transport. A visit to Houtheuwel, Kwaggastroom, Eatonside and Residensia stations on Wednesday revealed vandalism, theft and damage to overhead cables, buildings, ticket offices and the rail line itself. In Eatonside, thieves took everything, including doors, ceilings, windows and frames — leaving only the walls standing. At Houtheuwel, there are no cables, steel railway tracks have been cut and fencing has been stolen. Gauteng Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng told Daily Sun there were several incidents of cable theft, even before lockdown.  Mofokeng said the Houtheuwel to Residensia section last saw trains run on 3 March. The last train on the Residensia to Stretford section ran on 10 March, and from 25 March, no trains have operated between Stretford and New Canada. When the SunTeam asked why there weren’t any security guards, Mofokeng said they are having problems with security contracts but that should be resolved soon. “The railway police and Prasa Protection Services patrol these sections.  “To reinstate train services will cost millions at a time when Prasa is experiencing financial challenges,” she said.
