 IT’S time to adjust to the new normal, say churches. But some of Mzansi is wondering why places of worship are special.EITHER WAY, WE’RE SAY CHURCH LEADERS WHO’VE EXPRESSED GRATITUDE. On Tuesday, when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the reopening of places of worship, he said religious leaders would be recognised as essential workers, but church services would be limited to no more than 50 people. Pastor Giet Khoza of Rhema Church said they closed the church because they understood what was at stake. “This period will assist us to prepare for the new normal by getting the big auditorium sanitised. The virus has affected many people. It has led to depression. We need to uplift their spirits,” said Khoza. Grace Bible Church leader Bishop Mosa Sono said they were preparing a guide for worshippers on how to conduct services. “Based on scientific evidence, no laying of hands will be allowed. This is a preparation process. For our small churches it will be easier. However, we will look into a number of systems that could be fair to every worshipper,” said Sono. He said it might include worshippers taking turns coming to church or preregistering. Gabola Church leader Pope Tsietsi Makiti told Daily Sun they would be meeting to discuss ways of ensuring that members are safe. “While we will be drinking alcohol, the members will not be allowed to share drinks,” said Makiti. South African Zionist Church bishop Bheki Ngcobo reportedly said churches should be compensated for lost revenue during lockdown. Meanwhile, leader of the One SA Movement, Mmusi Maimane said while going to church was voluntary, there were still risks due to human error. Social media users also expressed their views. @ndabenhle04: “Are we going to ignore the fact that there are still private businesses who feed families but still are closed?” @JoeMakgapeetsa: “Pastors will only invite those who pay their tithes.”
