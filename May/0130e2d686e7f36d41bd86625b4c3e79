FUMING Rustenburg taxi operators cannot bear the pain of paying for their compounded taxis. They claim that the Rustenburg Local Municipality is robbing them in daylight. Bojanala 1 Regional Taxi Council Deputy Chairman June Motloung said when a taxi driver is found not wearing a mask or carrying passengers exceeding the accepted capacity, the taxi is compounded. In order for the taxi to be released, an amount of R5000 must be paid for the taxi to be released. Motloung said let drives who violet the regulations be arrested; we don't understand why the taxi should also be taken. We also want to help fight this virus, however, let this not an opportunity for our leaders to suck money we don't have. "I have been in this industry for a long. I enjoyed it but the municipality has made me hate what I do." Municipal spokesperson David Magae said the Rustenburg Municipality is only doing what is expected of them, which is to ensure there is law enforcement. He said they were not trying to scam anyone, but what the municipality does is guided by the law.  Magae said in terms of the regulations issued by the government R5000 per taxi had to be paid when operators were found contravening the regulations which include taking the taxi. "The municipality is enforcing the law. Anyone who is found violating the lockdown regulations will be punished according to the offense."
