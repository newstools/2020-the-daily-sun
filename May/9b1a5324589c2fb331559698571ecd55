THE battle for a swift return to the Absa Premiership gravy-train is not over for Free State Stars. “If we can’t qualify for the play-offs, we will go for automatic promotion next season... guaranteed, ” said Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena. As usual, life in the lower National First Division (NFD) GladAfrica Championship jungle has been pretty tough for Ea Lla Koto and Mokoena didn’t expect any less when Stars shockingly dropped down to the GladAfrica Championship. They have been there before and surely know how to bounce back. Stars are in sixth spot on 35 points, five off the play-offs spot with six match left this season. Is promotion possible? “Look, we were peaking at the right time if you look at our form before the lockdown, and anything could have happened with regard to qualification for the play-offs, ” Mokoena said. “But I’m not bitter about that. There are bigger issues to worry about. There are people dying from the Covid-19 pandemic. Football will always be there. “If we make the play-offs… it’s all well and good. If not, as I said, I can guarantee you now, next season we gain automatic promotion. We will be better prepared and wiser, with no relegation hangover and all of that. Most importantly, it’s getting the right players for the NFD... horses for courses.” Splashing the cash as a way out of the NFD has been the norm for many clubs. One Aziz Kara of FC AK tried and failed. But as proven time and time again, promotion is gained through good management, coaching and collective spirit towards a common goal. They say it’s football and not “shopping” down in the lower leagues. Ajax Cape Town are favourites for automatic promotion, leading the pack with 48 points. They are followed by second-placed Swallows FC with 41 points and Uthongathi on 40. Yet, with the Covid-19 outbreak there is no telling certainly how things will pan out.
