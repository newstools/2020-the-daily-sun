A
39-year-old who got stuck in a window while breaking into a house in Alabama
over the weekend has appeared before the Klerksdorp Magistrates Court. He
is facing a charge of housebreaking with the intent to commit an unknown crime. According
to police spokeswoman Colonel Ad√©le Myburgh, Lesego Tau was remanded in custody
until his next court appearance on 15 May 2020 for a formal bail application. She
said the accused's court appearance stems from his arrest on Saturday, 9 May
2020 in the early hours of the morning. Tau
was allegedly caught by the homeowner after he got stuck while entering the
house through a window in Alabama outside Klerksdorp.  It
is alleged that the homeowner went to bed on Friday, 8 May 2020, and was
awakened by a strange noise and went to investigate. The
owner allegedly found Tau, stuck in the window, and screaming for help. The
police were ultimately called to and arrested the suspect.
