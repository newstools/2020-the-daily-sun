In the latest update that rates all matches played since May 2019 at 100 percent and those of the previous two years at 50 percent, Australia have taken over from India as the top-ranked Test side. India have yielded the top spot for the first time since October 2016. This is largely because India had won 12 Tests and lost just one Test in 2016/17, the records of which were removed in the latest update. However, Virat Kohli's men still lead on the ICC World Test Championship standings, which runs until 2021. The Proteas suffered the biggest rating fall of eight points as they dropped down to sixth in the Test rankings. South Africa, who were led by Faf du Plessis, lost eight of their last nine Tests and are almost effectively out of contention in the World Test Championship. In February, Du Plessis stepped down from his role as captain of the Proteas' Test and T20 teams. The Proteas sit seventh on the World Test Championship log with 24 points. In the ODI rankings, the Proteas are on 108 points, moving up one spot to fourth with Australia slipping back on 107. The Proteas finished seventh in the 2019 Cricket World Cup standings after only registering three wins in their nine matches. World Champions England still maintain their No 1 ranking with India behind in second place. In the T20 rankings, the Proteas remain fifth as Mark Boucher's side prepare for this year's T20 World Cup. Australia is due to stage this year's global event from 18 October until 15 November but the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has seen the ICC and Cricket Australia exploring various options.
