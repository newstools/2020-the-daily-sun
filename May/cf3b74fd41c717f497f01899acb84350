ISIBAYA actress and author Ayanda Borotho has made Mzansi proud. She’s been nominated for the top 100 list of the United Nations’ Most Influential People of African Descent. The actress, who plays Siphumelele on the Mzansi Magic soapie, said she felt humbled for being nominated for her influence in the media space. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ayanda said: “When I go about my work, I don’t do it in the hope of getting recognition. When I received the email notifying me of my nomination, I was humbled. “Especially with this being the United Nations, this is an affirmation that I am walking in the right direction.” Ayanda said she was happy she was noticed because she supported important issues. “I use my influence and voice to advocate for gender equality and the well-being of children. I believe these are important issues that cannot, and should not be undermined,” she said. “Although a lot of people find me controversial, I would like to think I’m disruptive, which means I challenge things and take action, unlike controversial people who bark but don’t bite. This shows my disruptiveness is being heard and is making an impact.” The actress said she hoped she would make it to the Top 100 list. “I really hope I make the list so I can fly the South African flag high,” she said.
