I find it absolutely appalling that, even though the coronavirus has spread all over the world and reached Mzansi, people still disregard its graveness. People in the Eastern Cape in particular have on many occasions flouted the law by roaming the streets, as if they were vagrants. With the eye-popping growth of the disease in Madiba’s home province, it’s disheartening that people don’t want to pull their weight in helping to flatten and end the spread and existence of Covid-19. I wonder if it’s just a poor mentality or the result of being uneducated. Or is it because the Eastern Cape is a poor province? Charity begins at home. It takes one person to change the world. Make do with what you have and help save our beautiful land. ) Percy Mogwane Maserumule Park
