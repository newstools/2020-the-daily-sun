Khloe Kardashian recently shared on her Instagram Stories her newly organised space, thanks to The Home Edit and it made wig lovers go bonkers. Yep! A room full of wigs. Khloe captioned the photo: "50 shades of blonde! One of my favorite rooms! Thank you The Home Edit!" This comes as no surprise as Kim has also shared a tour of her massive pantry/kitchen setup, including a "main" fridge, a closet just for frozen yogurt, and rooms and rooms of food and drink for her family of six. You can only imagine how many hair extensions you need to have to need a room full of them.
