Are we masking our cheating habits during this lockdown? As we rapidly approach 100 days of us being locked down at our homes, we have had to sadly adapt to more changes than Cape Town's one day weather patterns, and that has proved to be a tall order. Some of us are now working remotely, eating more and are now in health matrimony with water and sanitisers. Relationships have become a complex issue, as some are enduring long-distance relationship struggles whilst some are feeling the strain of being stuck in one space with their partners. This conundrum has led to a spike in partners cheating during the lockdown. From social distancing, partners have began to socially distance themselves from their partners and a result an outbreak of the cheating virus has begun. According to an article on Cosmopolitan, the numbers are rising and the masks are off. Cheating sites are seeing an increase in users looking for affairs since the pandemic hit. Illicit Encounters has seen an 18% rise in activity from male members, and a 12% rise from female members in recent weeks. Furthermore, more than half of these men said they'd initiated new affairs in the last four weeks, with 74% of them citing "boredom" as the reason for seeking out new lovers. 46% of female members have made contact with a new partner in that time, with the majority saying the coronavirus crisis had exposed the weakness of their relationship and made them realise they needed "fresh stimulus". With our government resorting to a phased approach to returning things to normal, cheating has also moved up in various phases. https://www.dailysun.co.za/LIfestyle/sexting-will-be-a-thing-now-20200330 With the rise of sexting on various social media platforms, the only thing that is on in the bedroom is the phone's light in-between the sheets. If you're lucky and have the golden ticket of a work permit during the lockdown, you are also tempted to offer your essential service elsewhere.
