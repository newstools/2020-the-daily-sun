AFROTAINMENT boss DJ Tira has been running the entertainment streets for 21 years! He was planning to celebrate his achievements, but he will have to put his celebrations on hold due to the lockdown. He told Daily Sun: “It’s been a long, exciting journey and I’m thankful for all the support I have received. “This celebration will reflect on my journey as a DJ and as a result I will be playing a lot of my past music.” He said he was very young when he started and had grown over the years. “I’ve learnt some lessons and have somehow influenced the industry,” he said. Tira said he had no intentions of hosting the celebration online and would wait until the lockdown was lifted. I cannot do it online because it will not be the same. “I need the interaction with my fans. I need that instant feedback,” he said. Apart from being a producer, he is also known for spotting and nurturing talent. One of the latest talents he’s been focusing on are Qwabe twins Viggy and Virginia. After their dramatic exit from Idols South Africa, Tira worked with them on their branding and single.
