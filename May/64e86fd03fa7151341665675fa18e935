CHURCHGOERS have something to look forward to as Mzansi enters level 3 of its lockdown on Monday. President Cyril Ramaphosa has just announced during a televised briefing that religious gathering will be allowed but under strict lockdown regulations. People of faith were not too happy this past Sunday when boozers celebrated the news by the President that alcohol wouldÂ  be sold during level 3 also under strict conditions. Ramaphosa said the role of the religious community has been vital since Mzansi geared to fight the coronavirus two months ago. "We recognise and appreciate the role of the religious community says Ramaphosa. The noble values shared by all faith communities have come to the fore - helping the needy, feeding the hungry and caring for the sick. As we prepare to move to Level 3 we recognise the desire to serve communities and society." "As part of the regulations, the current restrictions will be eased.Social gatherings are still not allowed and churches will have to stick to the 50 limit set for funerals." "Places of worship will be limited to 50 people at a time depending on space .Sanitation and cleaning must be done and goers must wear masks and practice hygiene.Social distancing and hygiene measures that are in place must be practiced in church.Sunday, 31 May will be a dedicated day of prayer. I call upon all of us to turn our thoughts to all affected by this pandemic and the families who lost loved ones."
