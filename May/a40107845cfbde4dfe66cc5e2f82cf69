DREAMS do come true, and you can win if you want to! That is the motive behind Banyana Banyana midfielder Kholosa Biyana’s big sacrifice. Biyana is so passionate about her football career that she even quit her job to focus on what makes her happy. She studied radiography at Durban University of Technology in 2013 and after graduating, she got a job. But the player told SunSport that she felt her job as a radiographer at Mjanyana Hospital in the Eastern Cape delayed her progress in football. She decided to quit in 2017 and registered for a course that had something to do with sport and continued playing soccer. Three years later, the 25-year-old is happy with her achievements and said she has no regrets. “Sometimes in life we need to take a big risk to achieve other things,” Biyana said. “At this stage, I cannot say I am satisfied with what I have achieved in football since quitting my job. But I am happy, and there’s huge progress.” Last year she was part of the Banyana team that made a debut at the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. Like most of the women players, Biyana echoed the same sentiment that it is not easy to reach the top. She added: “I am not there yet but I am taking each day as it comes. “I want to achieve big things and be one of the best players in the country. But I don’t need to put myself under unnecessary pressure. “I also have dreams of playing overseas in top leagues like my teammates Refiloe Jane (who is playing in Italy, Serie A) and other overseas-based players.” Currently, the Eastern Cape-born midfielder is juggling football and university. She is doing her honours degree in sports science at the University of the Western Cape. “It is not easy because we have a lot of school work and also I have to train, but the most important thing is to balance the two (studies and football).”
