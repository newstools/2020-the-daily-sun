GOLDEN Arrows players, a former coach and management have shared their fond memories of defender and captain, Nkanyiso “Sgora” Mngwengwe. Mngwengwe sadly passed away on Monday morning. The 30-year-old’s death came as a sad shock to his family as he was in the process of tying the knot with his fiancé. Arrows team manager Nonceba Madlala, who saw Mngwengwe grow up in front of her, said: “He was one of the senior players who contributed immensely in helping the team gain promotion (in 2014-15 season). "In the 2016-17 season when we won our last game against Orlando Pirates at Moses Mabhida Stadium which secured our position in the top eight, he was epic. In the 2014-15 season when the club returned to the Absa Premiership, Mngwengwe played a big part and was the first names in the starting line-up under then coach Shaun Bartlett. The former Bafana Bafana striker, who is now an assistant coach at Kaizer Chiefs, said he couldn’t believe a player who was so skinny could be a top defender but Mngwengwe proved Bartlett wrong. “When you saw him on training fielding and in matches, he always had that never say die attitude,” said Bartlett. “I called him Mbazo (the nickname of former Bafana defender Aaron Mokoena) because that was (the type of) attitude he had throughout. I’m very saddened by his passing.” Mngwengwe teammate, Nduduzo Sibiya described him as an “humble soul” and “easy person” to hang out with and a true leader. Sibiya said: “Sgora’s attitude has been the same since I met him way back and he maintained that (attitude) before he passed away.” Arrows midfielder Seth Parusnath said he would remember his smile and recalled how he ran to him when he scored his first league goal on debut (on 12 December 2018 against Bidvest Wits). Parusnath said: “He picked me up to celebrate with me, it is something I’ll never forget.” Despite playing 143 games in seven years, he never played for current coach Steve Komphela due to knee injuries.
