A BITTER war between neighbours over a passage is so bad that one neighbour has blocked the other neighbour’s car out. Joseph Mahlangu (65) now parks his car in another yard, two streets away from his house. He and his wife Makobone Maseko (53) tried to get help, but nothing seemed to work. “We don’t enjoy the benefits of owning property,” he said. Joseph from Payneville in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said the dispute started more than five years ago. “We reported the matter to the municipality and land surveyors came two years ago but didn’t solve the problem. “I’ve been trying to negotiate, but my neighbour won’t budge.” He said his neighbour recently built a wall that blocked them out. The neighbour, Stella Seleme, said it wasn’t her problem that her neighbour’s car couldn’t go through. “They must go to the municipality and stop harassing me,” she said. Residents have said they’d break down the wall if this passage war wasn’t sorted out. “She’s just being spiteful. Where is ubuntu?” said one resident. Zweli Dlamini, the Ekurhuleni city manager’s spokesman, advised the family to go to city planning to check plans and site allocations. He said they’ll investigate and find out what went wrong.
