The North West Department of Social Development introduced a WhatsApp channel to handle the social relief of distress applications. The department urged community members to send a ‘Please Call Me’ or ‘Hi’ to the Whatsapp number allocated to every district in the province. People who have been trying to reach the department through these numbers seem unhappy with the service. Residents have been complaining that the numbers do not work, or they are not getting responses. "You are playing with our people. These numbers do not work. Some of the numbers are not even registered on Whatsapp," said one member. Petrus Siko, Spokesman for Social Development said that the Department of Social Development and the South African Social Security Agency has noted concerns from the general public on the turnaround time of Whatsapp numbers allocated to districts for applications of social relief of distress during the lockdown. "Currently our regional call centre has recorded more than 18 000 calls including WhatsApp messages," said Siko. "We are doing everything within our power to address this challenge." "We call on community members to continue using 018397 3360 and the WhatsApp numbers to make applications for social relief of distress. During this period, the demand has become elastic." "Each district has been allocated two WhatsApp numbers which community members should use to apply without visiting social development and SASSA local offices which are currently," said Siko The numbers for each district Bojanala Platinum: 082 048 2063/082 044 8903, Dr Kenneth Kaunda: 082 324 3330/082 059 8761 Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati: 082 325 2286/082 042 3968 and Ngaka Modiri Molema: 082 324 2779/082 048 3071 The Department has called on the public to exercise patience while they devise means to assist them.
