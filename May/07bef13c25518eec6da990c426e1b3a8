BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to brief the media tomorrow on preparations for the reopening of schools next month. Motshekga met the Council of Education Ministers and MECs from all nine provinces on Monday to discuss the state of readiness to open schools under level four lockdown.

The Eastern Cape reportedly said it could not guarantee it would be able to open next month. The other six provinces are at different stages of readiness. Department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the minister also met teacher unions’ leadership, SGBs and the SA Principals Association. “These sessions happened ahead of the minister’s return to the National Coronavirus Command Council yesterday. Cabinet is also scheduled to sit today, where the recovery plan on the education sector will also be discussed.” He said the briefing will include final dates and details for possible re-opening of schools. On Friday, the SA Democratic Teachers Union called on members not to go to work, claiming the department failed to meet the minimum level four safety requirements, including delivering non-negotiables to schools. These included fumigation and disinfection of facilities, provision of soap, sanitisers and masks, screening of pupils, teachers and support personnel and reducing class sizes. The union said: “It’s unlawful to expect workers to report for duty when safety is not guaranteed. Members can’t put their safety and that of their families and communities in danger by reporting for duty before precautions are in place.” Mhlanga said they won’t force schools to open and compromise lives, saying those that weren’t ready wouldn’t reopen. He hoped all school management teams and teachers would report for duty on Monday to ensure they were ready for reopening for grades 7 and 12 on 1 June.
