TAXIMAN Caine Shai felt thirsty after dropping off commuters, so he took off his mask to drink water. The 34-year-old from Burgersfort, Limpopo, said about five cops approached him on Saturday and asked him why he didn’t have a face mask on. He said before he could explain, they allegedly dragged him out of his taxi, moered him and kicked him to the ground. He said he tried to show them his mask, but they kept beating him. They eventually put him in a police bakkie and drove him to the cop shop. Caine was released without being charged.  “I was shocked when I was released and found all the money I had collected from two loads of passengers, my float and sanitiser missing from my taxi.” He said he had to pay a fine of R1 000 for going against disaster management regulations. “I was feeling pain and went straight to Moroke Hospital, where I was treated for internal injuries,” he said. His sister Vinny (43) said she took Caine to hospital as he had body pains and had been pepper-sprayed. Caine didn’t open a case against the cops. Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa advised him to open a case at any police station. “We’re on standby and he can contact our provincial officials for investigations,” he said.
