The rainy season brings misery for Ramaphosa squatter camp residents in Cape Town. When the rain comes, to these residents it means that electricity connections trip more often. Residents would start using more paraffin which then increases chances of shack fires. Resident Skhokelo Fekedwana (25) said they get their electricity from a nearby Siyahlala area, where he would together with other residents fork around R1500 per month to connect electricity from another resident’s house.  “When the rain comes, it means the beginning of our electricity troubles, our connection cables start burning and electricity tripping becomes our daily norm. When you sleep at night with electricity in the morning or during the middle of the night the cables, we use to connect electricity will be burnt out because of rain,” he said. Fekedwana said they must buy paraffin for R12 per litre and is unemployed. One of the fears for residents in this squatter camp is shack fires that may be caused increased use of paraffin during winter. The informal settlement is three years, but residents said they have suffered the same problems for the past three years. They claimed they have requested the government to assist them, but their requests have fallen on deaf ears.  Residents said they want the government to upgrade their township and ensure that the roads are flattened, electricity and drainage system are provided. When Sunteam recently spoke to Mayco member of Energy and Climate Change Phindile Maxiti said the community is on private land which makes it difficult to upgrade it. “The informal settlement is located on private land and the City does not have approval from the landowner to provide services on this land parcel,” he said.
