TEN gang members are behind bars after being arrested on Monday by the anti-gang police unit in Botshabelo, Free State. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “Seven BTK members were arrested in connection with the brutal assault of a self-confessed Nigel gang member. “The 21-year-old victim was brutally assaulted last Tuesday at his house in U-section, Botshabelo. “He was stabbed and stoned. He was admitted to hospital with serious injuries. “With the help of the community, the police followed up on information whereby an anti-gang unit operation yielded positive results early on Monday.” Makhele said the gangsters were aged between 19 and 29. “They will appear in the Botshabelo Magistrates Court soon on a charge of assault. “Three more wanted suspects of the Driehoek gang were also arrested the same morning. They have been on the run over allegations in the murder of Ntaki Mokofane. He was found murdered in Botshabelo F section on 29 September last year. The suspects allegedly stabbed him. They were unknown at the time. With the help of the community, the three men aged between 20 and 28 were caught and will be brought before the court on a murder charge soon.”
