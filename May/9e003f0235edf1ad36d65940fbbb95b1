THE Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association yesterday partially abandoned its court challenge. This came after association members were allowed to manufacture and export tobacco products.

It then filed an urgent court application to force it to lift the ban. Chairman Sinenhlanhla Mnguni said part A of the application no longer had to be argued in court. Part B – the sale of tobacco products under level 4 – was still ongoing. “We’ll now turn our focus to the relief sought in part B of our application, including confirmation by a court of law that the sale of tobacco products and cigarettes is lawful under lockdown regulations,” he said. Mnguni said the association had full confidence in the justice system and hoped for positive results. “Clarity on this will be given in due course,” he said. “The public at large must be mindful of the fact that several documents need to be exchanged before the matter is ventilated in court.”
