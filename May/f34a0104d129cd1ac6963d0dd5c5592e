POPE Tsietsi Makiti of Gabola Church told Daily Sun he prayed and fasted for the alcohol ban to be lifted. “God heard my prayers and indeed the ban was lifted. For us, alcohol is not just for fun. It adds value to our church. Without alcohol, there’s no prayer,” he said. “Even though we can’t have church meetings together as gatherings are still prohibited, but now we can pray at home. Without booze, we couldn’t even do that.” He said when they pray, they have to take a sip. “First we sip, then it’s amen and hallelujah,” he said. Makiti said his church members, like members of any other church, can from Monday buy alcohol and go home and pray. “We’re over the moon. This shows we pray to a living God.” He said they encourage their members to observe the level 3 lockdown regulations and don’t do what they’re not supposed to do. “Let’s drink and pray at home. That way we will beat the virus quickly and move to level 2 and 1. We can’t wait for our lives to go back to normal. Once we beat the virus we are going to hold a big service to thank God for sparing us.” Church members in Soweto said they were happy their Pope’s prayers were strong. “We’ve been thirsty for a very long time. Half a loaf is way better than nothing,” said Mthokozisi Ndima from Meadowlands. The members are now begging for cigarettes too, to make the combination perfect again.
