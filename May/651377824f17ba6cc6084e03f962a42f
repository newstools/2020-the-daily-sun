Following confirmation that nine mothers, two babies, four
doctors and one nurse had tested positive for Covid-19, KwaZulu-Natal health
officials have decided to close the doors of the General Justice Gizenga Mpanzi
Memorial Hospital (formerly Stanger Hospital). The KwaZulu-Natal health department said in a statement on
Tuesday it's believed that the first case resulted from a mother who was housed
at the boarder mothers' lodge at the hospital. She reportedly did not disclose that her husband was one of
the positive cases linked to a supermarket chain store in Ballito. Other
mothers at the lodge soon tested positive. "As a Department, we are extremely concerned by these
developments, and have urgently exercised our Constitutional obligation to
prevent a further outbreak of the virus," the department said. "What is of particular concern to us is the fact that
these infections have taken place in spite of the hospital's Infection
Prevention and Control (IPC) measures, as well as the requisite Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) that has been made available to staff." It said that an urgent investigation has been instituted by
the province's Communicable Diseases Control and IPC experts to establish how
the virus was able to spread at such a rapid rate within the hospital. All 16 affected people have been isolated. "The hospital, with 219 patients, has effectively been
turned into a quarantine site. All staff and patients in the surgical ward and
ICU have been tested. "The remaining staff and patients will be tested this
evening and tomorrow," the department said. Low-risk patients are being diverted to district hospitals
in the area, while serious cases are being sent to King Edward VIII Hospital. The department said the interim plan will be reassessed in
the next 24 hours. SOURCE: NEWS24
