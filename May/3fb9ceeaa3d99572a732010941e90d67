GATVOL workers at Knittex Factory in Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, won’t go back to work unless they get paid. They were forced to return to work earlier this month after being away due to lockdown. But they downed tools on Monday and vowed to continue striking until their demands were met. Shop steward Mangcoba Hlatshwayo told Daily Sun the company forced them to return to work on 4 May and they were promised payment on Monday, but no worker was paid. “We’ve tried to hold talks with our employer, but they kept making empty promises,” he said. “Instead they threaten to dismiss us when we talk about boycotting. What makes us angry is that the company claimed money from UIF on our behalf during lockdown, but kept such info a secret.” He said workers were tired of hearing long stories at a time when they were unable to support their families. Hlatshwayo said: “As workers we agreed that we’d stay at home if they don’t pay us. “They’re taking us for granted. All the company cares about is production.” Director Deon Joubert said the company had been in consultation with union representatives and workers about various payment options. He said: “We can confirm the company paid all employees in full and on time since the inception of lockdown. “The payments were made in advance and were received by the company. “In terms of the UIF relief scheme, the company will continue to administrate and account for such, in accordance with rules set out by the Department of Employment and Labour.”
