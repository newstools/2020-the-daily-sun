PATRICE Motsepe and his foundation have set aside R2,1 million in prize money for musicians who would compose and produce songs in South Africa’s 11 official languages. According to the South African billionaire who donated handsomely to the fight against Covid-19, the public will be able to vote for their favourite songs, with the winners’ prize purse standing at R700 000. Motsepe announced this in Sandton yesterday as part of Mamelodi Sundowns’ 50th year celebration.  He said the competition is called the “Mamelodi Sundowns 50 Year Anniversary Most Popular Songs Challenge” which will be launched next month when the country enters Level-3 of the nationwide lockdown. He said the “highlight” of the most popular song competition will be the prize money for the “seven most popular songs, as voted for by the public throughout the year” which will be awarded at the club’s celebration banquet in December. “Sundowns will release more details in the coming weeks,” Motsepe said while revealing the idea was the creatives of his son. He said in a statement: “This will enable us to continue promoting and supporting football and music, and what is exciting about this challenge is that it also specifically promotes African traditional and cultural music. “... (it) seeks to involve and encourage the youth, football and music lovers in South Africa and on the continent, who are at home, and while complying with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations to compose and produce songs. “The concept is designed on “reality show-type format” wherein individuals register and participate in a national singing competition.” Meanwhile, Motsepe added that they were due to play against top European football clubs as part of their 50th year celebrations but “because of the Coronavirus pandemic the match will not take place”.
