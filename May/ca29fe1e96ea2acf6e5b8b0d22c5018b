THE month of May is the most memorable for Mamelodi Sundowns winger Lyle Lakay. This is because the 28-year-old lifted his first ever Absa Premiership title with Sundowns in May last year, and he said the 2018-19 campaign is the highlight of his career since he joined the Brazilians. Lakay has had a wide ranging career which has taken him from Bloemfontein Celtic, to his home town of Cape Town where he played for Cape Town City and to Tshwane, where he is currently playing for Masandawana. He joined Sundowns from Cape Town City in July 2018. On his first stint under coach Pitso Mosimane, Lakay helped the team win their ninth League title, which happened to be the first in his football career. The pacey winger admits his first season at Chloorkop was the best of his career. “My highlight of last year has to be winning the league. It was my first league medal, and it was in my first season at Sundowns. So that has to be the highlight,” Lakay said. Last season, the Cape Town-born player got his first taste of Caf Champions League football. After travelling a lot with Downs in Africa chasing glory on the continent, he said Morocco is his favourite country in Africa. He added: “I like Morocco because of the atmosphere and whenever we played Wydad Casablanca. I think we played them the most over the past years. Every season we get them in the group or the semis. The atmosphere in that country is great and I also like their die-hard supporters.” Lakay and his teammates are all still in limbo as the PSL season has been suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When the league stopped, Sundowns were determined to defend their Absa Premiership title. The Brazilians are four points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs, with a game in hand.
