SOUTH AFRICAN runners are relishing news that they can now hit the ground running and burn rubber on the cold tar during Alert Level 3 of the national lockdown. Elite athletes and amateurs all over the country can’t wait to put on their running shoes. But they’ve been warned to be cautious and not run themselves into injuries. Hloni Motloung, Katlehong Athletics Club chairperson, shared his running tips: “We all want to burn the fat and get some much-needed exercise.” Motloung believes winter is more dangerous for athletes, not only because of the low temperatures, but the number of cars on the road usually increases during this season of the year. Runners were only permitted to train outdoors for three hours, between 6am and 9am outdoor, during Level-4 of the lockdown. “Runners should wear masks when running,” Motloung warned. “They should run against traffic to be able to see cars approaching. “It’d be a good idea to walk, run or jog on the pavements. “Wear reflective and bright clothes at night and avoid earphones while running. “It’s advisable to leave behind your electronic gadgets at home.” Motloung has also discouraged group running. “Be considerate to other runners, particularly if you want to spit or clear your nose.”
