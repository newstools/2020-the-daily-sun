But when Lerato Ralekaota, who was 37 weeks pregnant with her second child, got to the hospital, she was told her baby girl had died. She said she was not helped immediately and was only operated on two days later. The 28-year-old from Thabong near Welkom, Free State, is now accusing the hospital of negligence. “At the hospital I was told it’s a normal pregnancy and the baby was big. I was sent back home. But I went back on 4 May because I couldn’t feel the baby move,” said Lerato. “I was shocked when they told me my baby had died in my tummy. The hospital made me stay with a dead baby in my tummy for days.” Lerato said she was told a dead baby was not life threatening and they had emergencies to attend. “I looked forward to having my second child,” said Lerato. Free State health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said they were aware of the incident. Mvambi told Daily Sun: “The patient was admitted with intrauterine death which is commonly referred to as stillborn. A sonar confirmed a big baby and the patient was booked for a C-section, but was delayed because of emergencies. The patient was stabilised with no complaints. “All pregnant women with complications that need to be operated on are handled at Bongani Hospital. “The patient, who was under intense monitoring, was successfully operated on. She was referred to a social worker for further counselling.”
