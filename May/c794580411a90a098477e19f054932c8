Lerato Sengadi will erect a tombstone for her late husband HHP. This comes after the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a ruling by a lower court that found the late rapper, whose real name was  Jabulani Tsambo and Lerato were married in customary law. The Tsambo family was not happy with the decision taken by the lower court. They appealed the matter at the Supreme Court of Appeal, which ruled in Lerato's favour. In a recent interview with 702's Eusebius Mckaizer Lerato said the process of getting this far has been rather draining. “It’s emotionally, spiritually and physically draining,” she said. Said Lerato: "It has been a very painful 18 months where I have had to deal with legal issues while grieving, I’ve had to put my healing on a back burner.” She said she wasn't consulted during the burial process. “I was at least supposed [to have been] consulted on what the burial process was, instead his corpse was stolen and he was buried without me seeing him. How [do] I deal with that; how do you recover?” she said.Lerato said she's been working on finding closure after HHP took his own life in 2018. “I have to deal with getting that for myself. It starts with me having my rights, that’s the most important thing right now, my husband's legacy,” she said. Today, 30 April 2020, the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa has RULED IN MY FAVOUR in the appeal of Tsambo v Sengadi! • • • I will not forget this day for as long as I live! It is over!
