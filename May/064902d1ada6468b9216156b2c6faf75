"THIS pain I'm feeling now I don't even wish it upon my greatest enemy. I can't describe what I'm feeling." These were the words posted by Mpho Marsh (4)'s mum Annastacia Marsh (28) on her Facebook page after Mpho was found dead. Mpho went missing after he followed a 15-year-old boy who was looking after the livestock at the veld in Tweespruit on 25 May. On Wednesday Daily Sun published the story of 'Help cops find little Mpho' Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele had said the police in Tweespruit were searching for the little boy. Makhele said the older boy had alleged that he was chasing after other animals and Mpho could not catch up with him. By the time the older boy came back, Mpho was nowhere to be seen in the veld. But on Friday, the little boy was found dead and the incident has shuttered Annastacia and yesterday she expressed her feelings on social media. She wrote: "I am broken and I don't think I'll ever recover from this. I hate that awful mountain. I hate myself for letting my son go there. I hate this place called Thaba Patchoa." Makhele confirmed that Mpho was found dead. Makhele told Daily Sun:"The missing file of a 4-year-old boy that went missing in the Thabapatswa location at Tweespruit in the Easter Free State is now an inquest investigation. The body of little Mpho Albert March (4) was found on Friday afternoon by a community member who went to the mountain area to fetch wood. He was found face down with bruises to the face. Mphoâ€™s mother reported him as missing on the 25t of May. He went missing after he went to the veld with another 15-year-old boy. The police tried by all means to search and find the little boy, but on Friday his lifeless body was found.
