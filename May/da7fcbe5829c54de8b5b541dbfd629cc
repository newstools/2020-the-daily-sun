WHEN Esihle Nqeketho’s family heard the car found burnt at the cemetery fitted the description of that of their missing sister, they were shattered. The 29-year-old said they’ve been looking for her sister Khulakazi Ndlovu (39) since last month, but with no luck. Khulakazi from Phoenix, north of Durban, went missing on 2 April. Esihle told Daily Sun that they were now starting to believe that the burnt car found at Molweni Cemetery with human remains was that of their sister. She said Khulakazi lived with two kids (14) and (5) in her house. She said when she left, she told them she’d be back soon. “The children said at about 11pm, she called and told them to lock up because she’d be late. But that was the last time they heard from her.” Esihle said in the morning, the kids told her Khulakazi didn’t come back home. “I was worried because she had never done that before. I called her but her phone was off. I searched for her almost everywhere, but there was no sign of her.” She reported her missing at Phoenix Police Station. “A few days later, we were told the description of her car fit that of the vehicle found burnt at Molweni Cemetery. It was found on 3 April, so we believed it was indeed her car.” She said they also believed the car belonged to Khulakazi because she went through her tablet and found emails from the tracking company showing that her car was last seen driving into the cemetery. “And I saw she drove to Molweni Cemetery. I informed the cops and they took DNA samples. We’re now waiting for the results,” she said. Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the matter. She said the case had been changed from inquest to murder. “The DNA tests have been done and the family is waiting for the results.”
