HUNGER pangs have worsened among families led by hawkers, especially people who do piece jobs. Joburg councillor Sthembiso Zungu said food is a challenge in ward 122. He sometimes has to dig deep into his own pocket to help those who’re not coping. Said Zungu: “People see others on TV receiving food parcels and premiers talking about food banks.” He said this was becoming a problem and people blamed councillors. “Some of us haven’t received anything for our wards from our leaders, except small donations from the private sector,” said Zungu.  He has more than 30 000 poor families in his ward, which covers Eikenhof, Lehae, Zakariyya Park and Vlakfontein.  Resident Gladys Mafuya said: “The mayor gave us blankets, but can we please get food?”
