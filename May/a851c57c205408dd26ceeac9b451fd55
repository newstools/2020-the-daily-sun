HEALTHCARE workers’ unions are hopping mad about a shortage of protective gear. As members continue getting infected with the coronavirus, unions have accused the government of sending them to slaughterhouses. READ: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEETING DISRUPTED BY PORN! Nehawu and Samwu, both under Cosatu, said the rising number of infections was proof that the government was not prioritising frontline workers. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize this week announced the total number of healthcare workers who had tested positive stood at 511. Nehawu’s general secretary Zola Saphetha has even gone as far as calling on members not to report for duty. He claimed some members said their jobs were threatened if they refused to work without protective gear. “Some workers had to resort to using refuse bags as aprons. “We call on the national health department to punish those gambling with the lives of frontline workers harshly,” said Saphetha. Samwu accused Co-operative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of failing to ensure municipalities followed the regulations she had announced. Secretary general Koena Ramotlou said the situation had become worse, since more people were allowed to return to work under level four. “Our pleas to get the minister to intervene in instances where municipalities have been failing in their constitutional mandates have not been responded to, creating an environment where municipalities are deliberately sending workers to slaughterhouses,” he said. He claimed some workers in Cape Town had asked to be screened and tested, but were humiliated and told to go back to work if they wanted to keep their jobs. “Municipal workers have reported to the union that they literally have to beg management for personal protective equipment they require to safely execute their duties,” he said.
