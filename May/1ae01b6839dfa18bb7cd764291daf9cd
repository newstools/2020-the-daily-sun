Grieving daughter tells how she had to watch her parents'
joint funeral over video link after they both died from coronavirus just days
apart. Katie Orchard, 30, lost her parents Richard and Pat
Telford from Bestwood, Nottingham in the UK on Easter Sunday and April 14. Daily Mail reports that Richard, 87, and Pat, 72, had
been married for 30 years but tragically spent their final moments apart in the
Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital respectively. The couple were taken to hospital by ambulance after Pat's
chest infection began to deteriorate on April 9 and were diagnosed with the
virus before their conditions worsened. Katie said it was heartbreaking to have to watch their
funeral alongside her two daughters and husband Curtis from a video link rather
than being at their side. She said: 'It was surreal and very difficult watching. 'Knowing that this is the last time you will see them,
but you aren't there. We were sat there watching and hugging each other in the
comfort of our home. 'It will hurt for the rest of our lives. That room would
have been absolutely packed normally, I know that for a fact because they were
so well-loved. 'My youngest was asking what the boxes [coffins] were,
she did not understand the situation but she wanted to watch with us. 'I thought it was handled very respectfully and was
beautifully done. It was a nice touch that they bought flowers too.' The last time Katie saw both her parents alive was Easter
Sunday and she said it has been 'hell' for her and her family since losing
them. She said: 'Things have been hell. This virus is real, it
is happening. People don't understand the impact until it affects them. 'I remember mum telling me can you pack us a bag for
hospital as I don't think we are getting any better.' Katie said it 'made her ill' to explain to her children,
Lexi, five and Leah, 10, that their grandparents had died.
