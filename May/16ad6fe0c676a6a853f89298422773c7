THE Eastern Cape health department has called for those who brew mbamba to be charged with culpable homicide. Ten people died in Stutterheim in the Amahlathi Municipality, apparently after they drank a brew mixed with methylated spirits. Mayor Agnes Hobo yesterday visited Mzamo Village, where the last victim died. She said: “He died on Monday in hospital. We visited his home to trace people who drank with him. “Methylated spirits is mixed with coffee bags and Refresh drink. People who drink it say they get stomach cramps and get dizzy. I think it does something to their intestines.” The municipality had committed to burying the victims, whose living conditions are very poor, especially in Gasela Village. Said Hobo: “We asked spaza shop owners to remove all methylated spirits from their shops because people abuse it. We asked police to arrest the perpetrators” Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said 12 people were admitted to Stutterheim Hospital, two of whom were confirmed dead on arrival. He said: “Last week three people died in Keiskammahoek after consuming a home-made brew. Nine post-mortems were done in Bhisho last week. Results pointed to these dangerous concoctions.” Colonel Sibongile Socie said inquest dockets were opened after three people died at Nonibe and three at Bumbane, Keiskammahoek. Stutterheim cops were investigating another three cases and appealing to residents to stop making booze at home.
