A TV news presenter who was on-air while working from home gave viewers much more than they expected. A half naked woman  appeared behind him while he was live and the woman is said to be his nyatsi! According to the Daily Mail UK, Alfonso Merlos from Spain  (41), was hosting on the Estado de Alarma channel live on YouTube from his home, but he did not realise what was happening behind him. The site reports that viewers were quick to note that the woman who passed behind did not look like his girlfriend,Big Brother star Marta Lopez and discovered that she was in fact a fellow 27-year-old journalist, named Alexia Rivas. Alfonso has since insisted that he and López were not together when he was caught out. The DailyMail reports that Rivas, the woman spotted behind him, has since added that she has been seeing the anchor for a few weeks, and that he said he was single when they started seeing each other. 'I didn't get into a relationship, he told me he was single. We have been [seeing each other] three weeks,' she told Socialité. However, in a further twist to the drama, Marta López has said that as far as she was concerned, she was still with Merlos at the time, and has called the situation 'shameful'. According to Spanish news outlet Lecturas, Merlos and López had fallen out over an ex-boyfriend of hers, causing them to spend four days apart, during which the broadcast occurred. 'I had been mad at Alfonso for four days. He didn't want me to do something that affected my family. I did it, and he got mad. We argue,' she told the outlet. A call from López's ex, whom she shares a son with, reportedly sparked the argument that led to the pair separating for four days. López claims that she and Merlos had been together in coronavirus lockdown since March 12, two days before the country implemented some of the world's toughest containment measures, and had spent the first half of the lockdown together until their argument.
