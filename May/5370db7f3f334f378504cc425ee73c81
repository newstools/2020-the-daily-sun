JUST like any other customer three men went into the
Foschini shop at Jubilee Mall in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane on Thursday. But these men were on a mission to rob a shop. But as they were done, leaving the shop they saw police
walking towards them, and they panicked abandoning what they just collected and
ran. According to the police spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo,
the men took out their firearms and pointed at the staff at one of the shops at
the mall. “The staff were pushed into the storeroom while the manager
was taken to the safe,” Masondo said He added that the manager was forced to open the safe and
cellphones were taken away in a trolley. “On their way out of the mall building, they came across
police and they left the trolley and ran away. “They fled the scene with an unknown vehicle. No one has
been arrested and no injuries,” he said. Shoppers at the mall said they don’t feel safe anymore. “If people can easily get inside the mall with guns it means
that they can easily kill someone,” one said. Lerato Khope (23)
said criminals are now using coronavirus masks to hide and they fear they will
also get robbed. “It is difficult to see who is who because we are constantly
wearing masks. “It is really scary because we are protecting ourselves and
at the same time criminals are using this for their own evil acts,” she said. Shoppers said something must be done because robbers will
come back. “People are out of jobs and they are looking for ways to
make money. “This is the time for the police to come and protect us,”
they said
