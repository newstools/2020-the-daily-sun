 Now that
many South Africans are practicing social distancing, being the first person at
an accident is even more complicated than before. If you are
first at the scene of an accident all the same procedures apply except you
should ensure that you always have personal protective equipment (PPE) in your
car. “First,
call for assistance and provide emergency services with accurate details. Then
the main objective is the preservation of human life.” Ensure your
vehicle is off the road and out of the way of oncoming traffic. Use a triangle
to warn oncoming drivers. Managing
director at MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert says before you approach the car or any
crash victims, ensure that you are wearing your face mask. As is the case at
any crash scene, ensure that you wear gloves. If the
injured individuals are conscious and not in need of your assistance maintain
social distancing. “At any
accident scene, if you are a position to perform a live-saving action, that
should be the priority. Examples include removing people from burning cars or
out of the road or, if you are trained, performing CPR (do not forget to obtain
permission from injured people who are conscious). Most
people, however, do not have emergency medical experience and likely cannot do
much more than call for assistance, remove immediate danger from the vicinity
and reassure the victims.” Ultimately,
you need to weigh up the risks against what level of help you can provide. “It may be wise
to keep an extra mask and set of gloves in your vehicle so that in the heat of
the moment, if someone else required this, it is available. Arriving at a crash
scene in the time of COVID-19, has become much more complicated. Ultimately,
let the preservation of human life be your deciding factor,” advised Herbert.
