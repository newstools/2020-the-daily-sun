WHERE were you in 2010? Are you aware that this is 10 years after South Africa became the first African country to host the 2010 Fifa World Cup? The SA Football Association (Safa) is calling on football fans to share their memories to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the 2010 Fifa World Cup using the hashtag #my2010memories on social media.  Much was expected as Africa hosted its first World Cup over 100 years since the formation of Fifa, and South Africa did not disappoint, as it hosted a fantastic celebration of football, humanity and global celebration. The tournament, at which Spain won its maiden World Cup, is still regarded as one of the best and most successful versions ever of the world’s biggest sporting event. "So many fantastic, lifelong memories were made and from 11 June to 11 July 2020 the South African Football Association is calling on South Africans, the rest of Africa and football lovers the world over to mark the 10-year anniversary of this landmark event by sharing your memories, pictures and videos using the hashtag #my2010memories," Safa said in a statement.  The online campaign will run from 11 June 2020 to 10 years after the opening match at which Siphiwe Tshabalala scored the tournament’s sensational opening goal to 11 July 2020 - 10 years after Spain lifted the trophy – on all Safa and Bafana Bafana social media platforms. We look forward to seeing your memories of this special time in our country’s history and will share further details in the build-up to this milestone.You can also include @sunsportsa or @dailysunsa when sharing you memories.
