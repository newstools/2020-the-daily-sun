RADIO is Motsweding FM host Mokopi Molebatsi’s best friend. “It consoles me in times of need and never judges me,” said the Motsogapele host. “It updates me on what’s going on in my neighbourhood and is there 24 hours a day. I rely on it.” Her show is for those who lie awake early in the morning. “It’s a quiet time when people connect to their souls and ideas flow,” said Mokopi (39). “This is when we’re together and find ourselves. I’m very attached to my listeners. “It’s as if we’ve met face to face. I’m sad when something goes wrong for one of them. We’re a big family of brothers and sisters. “I love them. The moment I switch on the microphone, my spirit is lifted.” Mokopi’s listeners are her best teachers. “I learn a lot from them, and that gives me peace of mind,” she said. Her show tackles everything that happens in daily life. “We even speak about taboo topics like tlof tlof. “Listeners are free to speak about their problems and we don’t judge one another. “I play soul and R&B as a way to heal our souls after heavy topics.” Mokopi was born in Kagiso in Mogale City, but grew up in Itsoseng in Lichtenburg, North West. “Soul music speaks to my heart,” said Mokopi, who also hosts the music show Kgolakganyo on Sundays, which is more about music. She plays mainly 80s and 90s sounds. Mokopi studied radio journalism and translation studies. She was a presenter at Radio PUK and during school holidays volunteered at Teemaneng Stereo community radio station. She first worked at Teemaneng before Motsweding FM between 2005 and 2011, and joined North West FM before rejoining Motsweding FM. “Being awake in the early hours is my game,” said Mokopi.
