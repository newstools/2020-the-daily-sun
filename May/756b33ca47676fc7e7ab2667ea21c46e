Cape Town mayor Dan Plato handed out 1000 masks at
Vangate mall on Friday as government called for everyone to wear a mask in
public to fight coronavirus. Some shops in Cape Town are refusing shoppers to
enter without a masks. “As it has now become mandatory to wear face masks in
public, we handed out masks to residents coming to the mall to do their
essential shopping. This is to assist residents in staying healthy and safe and
will help to limit the spread of COVID-19. The masks are donations from the business
sector in Cape Town and we are grateful for their contribution in helping to
limit the spread of Coronavirus,” said Plato. Langa resident Nozipho
Ngcebetshane (41)who had visited Vangate mall said a pharmacy refused her to
enter because she didn’t have a mask. “They told me that they have masks for
R15 I can give them money to buy the mask while standing outside then they will
give me the mask so that I enter there shop. They were clear that if I don’t
have or buy one from them I should try and go by medicine elsewhere. I only had
money to medicine so I didn’t have any money to spare,” she said. Ngcebetshane
said she bumped into Plato who was handing out masks and managed to get one and
then returned to buy the medicine.  Plato
said the masks are durable, washable, reusable and they work well as mechanism
for public to fight coronavirus. “It is important that we continue to practice
social distancing, good hygiene habits and not touch our faces. Let us wear
masks whenever we leave our homes.  We
must adhere to the regulations as set out and do our part to contain the
virus,” added Plato.
