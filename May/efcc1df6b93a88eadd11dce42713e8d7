HONESTLY, I am not afraid of Covid-19.” Those were the words of Zanele “Mazet” Nhlapho, the 29-year-old soccer player from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. She played for Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies for 13 years before signing a one-year contract with KF Apolonia in Albania in September. But in February, she lost her dad. “The deadly virus was killing people but because I have faith in God, I managed to travel home to bury my dad. I’m back in Albania, fresh and breathing,” said Mazet. She said she felt at home overseas. “I’m keeping myself busy by learning Albanian. Playing in Europe is quite challenging. At first you have to adjust to the language, players and the system the team uses when playing,” she said. “ I’m not homesick. If it wasn’t for my family, I was going stay in Europe forever. I love it, especially the country I am in now.” Mazet said she felt she was being herself as a soccer player. But she said if she were not a footballer, she’d be serving the community as a nurse or motivational speaker. Her message to young girls who wanted to make it big was to continue working hard and be passionate about what they were doing. “What I hate most in life is drugs, alcohol and crime,” she said. The former Phomolong Ladies player studied nursing and tourism at Boksburg College. She said she wanted to study nursing after football. She said she was the first Mzansi female footballer to be chosen as captain outside her country.
