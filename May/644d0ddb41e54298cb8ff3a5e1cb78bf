SWALLOWS FC chairman David Mogashoa says they are trying hard not to take the approach of cutting salaries of their players. He insists they will try hard not to tamper with their players' pay despite the Covid-19 challenges that have wreaked havoc in the world, with most teams opting for the short cut and reduce staff's salaries. Mogashoa insists Swallows would do everything in their power to ensure their players are paid fully every month, for as long as they can sustain it. SunSport understands that Swallows spend about R950 000 in salaries to their technical staff, which includes players, and that is R450 000 more than the PSL’s monthly grant of R500 000. “Everyone is feeling the financial pressure. Even some of the biggest clubs in the world,” said Mogashoa. “We are no different but we are determined to ensure our players and staff are not affected. At the moment we have been successful in that regard because we have managed to pay everyone at the club their full salaries. “The grant has been helpful but as you might imagine, is not enough to run a club and keep it alive financially during these tough times. We have to make every effort to not be forced into any action that could affect our staff payment.” Swallows have had a stellar first season back in the professional ranks as they look to rebuild their brand following a well documented fall from grace which saw them plunge to the depths of the lower-tiers of Mzansi football. They are currently second on the Championship standings, seven points adrift of leaders Ajax Cape Town with six matches remaining. Mogashoa believes cutting their player salaries now would demoralise them and destabilise the dressing room, ruining the team’s chance of gaining promotion to the Absa Premiership.
