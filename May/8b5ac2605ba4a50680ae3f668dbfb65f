A partially burned body of a 14-year-old girl who was
earlier this month reported missing has been found. Morongwa Marakalala, from Silvermine village in Driekoppies,
went missing on 5 May 2020 at about 21h30. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the
police then launched a search operation immediately. A Police helicopter, the K9 Unit, Search and Rescue Unit
and members from Senwabarwana police station, assisted by the community,
jointly conducted a search operation in the area but the child could not be
located. Mojapelo said the police were called when the gruesome
discovery was made on Sunday. Community members went on the rampage and torched a house
belonging to a 63-year-old woman, accusing the family of witchcraft and that
they were responsible for the disappearance of the child. 13 suspects were consequently arrested on a charge of
arson and will again appear in Senwabarwana Magistrate's Court on 21 May 2020,
for formal bail application. The Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo Lieutenant General
Nneke Ledwaba is saddened by the brutal murder of the child and has instructed
the investigators to waste no time in hunting down the killers. “I warn community members to desist from taking the law
into their own hands but instead assist the police in the investigation of this
brutal incident.” Ledwaba has urged anyone with information that can lead
to the arrest of the suspects is requested to contact Warrant Officer Albert
Manaka on 082 414 6634, the Crime Stop number 0860010111 or the nearest police
station.
