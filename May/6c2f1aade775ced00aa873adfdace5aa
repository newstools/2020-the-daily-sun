   NOT JUST in most shops, but the rule of ‘No Mask No
Entry’ will also apply for commuters using all modes of public transport. Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mababolo emphasized the
importance of commuters having masks every time they board a taxi. “If people don’t have masks, they should be allowed to
comminute, because the president has issued a directive that everybody must
wear a mask. “No mask, no commuting,” The MEC said during his visit
yesterday to the Randburg Taxi Rank where Santaco had a disinfection programme. “If we find a person in the taxi not wearing a mask,
the taxi industry would have undermined the directive of President and the
regulation which are part of the law.” He said it will be crucial for the taxi industry to
enforce mask-wearing. “People are also allowed to bring any cloth that will
serve the purpose of the mask.” The taxi rank was sanitised as well as the taxis.
Santaco through its private sector partners also brought an overhead sanitizing
device that commuters have to walk through when they enter the rank. “What we are seeing here is really remarkable and
highly appreciated. Creativity and smart technology that seeks to use smart
technologies like the sanitizing tunnel. He said the Randburg taxi rank was the first to be
testing the sanitising tunnel technology. “Comminuting and taxi rank will never be the same. We
are reorganizing how commuting will be done in taxi tanks. Chairperson Johannes Mkhonza said: “We are here today
to intensify the war against coronavirus. “We also here to give education to our drovers all our
queue marshals and passengers as well as to disinfect our taxi rank and our
taxis inside so that our facility is free of coronavirus “We are also here to enforce to enforce the new
regulations, such as all passengers and drivers having masks on.”
