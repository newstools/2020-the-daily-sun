HIGHLY experienced former Moroka Swallows goalkeeper Greg Etafia says he is not worried about where he will be playing next season. The 37-year-old Etafia came out of retirement after four years to sign a one-year contract to help Owen Da Gama and his Highlands Park team this season. Da Gama signed the veteran goalie after Tapuwa Kapini, who doubles up as a motor mechanic in Kempton Park, got injured before the start of the season. And now, like many other PSL players, Etafia’s contract with the Tembisa-based outfit expires at the of the season. The Covid-19 pandemic has made life difficult for football club bosses to start discussing players’ future. “I don’t want to talk about the contract issue as it’s for the management (to decide),” Etafia said. “My focus is here at Highlands and to do what I was signed for. I signed with them to help their goalkeeping department as Kapini was injured. “But I am not worried that much as only God knows. I am where I am because of Him (God).” Since he joined Highlands, the former Nigerian international has not had any game time as Da Gama preferred Marlon Heugh as his number one keeper. And now Etafia, who has been working hard at home during the lockdown, will be hoping Da Gama will give him a taste of top flight football again in one of their remaining six league matches when the Premiership resumes. Etafia has been in Mzansi since 2003 and spent 12 years as the Dube Birds goalkeeper. In 2017 Etafia worked as goalkeeper coach at Baroka.
