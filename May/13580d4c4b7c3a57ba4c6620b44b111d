Russell Wilson said he has found the perfect match in singer Ciara. The American football star followed advice he got from his dad that he should marry someone as special as his mother, and he did just that. This, he detailed in a tweet while celebrating Mother's Day with his mum and wife. Tweeted Russell: "My dad used to always tell me, 'son... marry someone as special as your momma'. "Well Pops..I found the Perfect Match." #HappyMothersDay to the two most special mommas in the world. Red heart."  Russell is always praised for the way in which he treats his wife Ciara during their public appearances, often helping her with her dress.
