A MAN arrested in Cape Town with 38 bricks of cocaine worth about R30 million was released after his bail of R100 000 was paid. Mario Williams (36) appeared in the Kuils River Magistrates Court on Tuesday facing drug possession charges. He was bust near the N1 Engen in the Kraaifontein area on Sunday after cocaine was found in a truck. The Hawks on Monday said the accused had gone to the garage to pick up the drugs found in a truck driven by a driver who didn’t know about them. The accused has no previous or pending cases against him, and his release conditions confined him to his home. He needed police permission to go to work and must report to a police station three times a week. Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase said at the time of the arrest, first investigations showed the container on the truck had made its way from overseas and had passed through different provinces before arriving in Cape Town. The Hawks said the truck driver was not arrested, as he was unknowingly involved. Williams is due back in court on 20 August. Last Thursday, the Hawks, police and Sars customs officials found ecstasy powder and tablets valued at over R6,3m in a container carrying furniture from Europe. After seizing the drugs at Cape Town Harbour, cops bust a 30-year-old man and confiscated about 1kg of hydroponic cannabis in Durbanville. – NEWS24
