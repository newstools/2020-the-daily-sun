LIMPOPO’S Capricorn District Municipality currently has the
highest number of Covid-19 cases in the province, sitting at 22 with only two
deaths. The districts executive mayor John Mpe has come out to urge
residents to cooperate with community health workers who, as a significant
stride to fight the spread of Covid-19. This is as they are continuing to visit homes to screen and
test everyone for the virus while other families chase them away, refusing to
be screened. Mpe said there is no danger in getting screened. “Our message is that whether or not you or anyone in your
family is showing symptoms of infection should be subjected to screening and
testing. The fight against a virus that threatens their existence as humankind
can only be won with the cooperation of everyone,” he said. The aim of this process is for government to identify
potential hotspots of infection and allow contact tracing teams to work quickly
and stop the spread. Also, it is only through this screening and testing that
health workers can reach people with pre-existing medical conditions such as
diabetes, asthma, TB, HIV/Aids, cancer, heart diseases and others. “The exponential growth in the massive new cases reported
daily are scary and show that the country is fast heading for a peak this
winter and that should get everyone dead worried and therefore work with
government to strengthen the effective defence against this virus and flatten
the curb,” "I pay tribute to our community health workers for
leading this colossal struggle. If we continue on this path, I have no doubt
that we stand a better chance of succeeding in building a district that is
fully responsive to this pandemic,” said Mpe.
