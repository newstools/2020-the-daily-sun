Engineer, Elon Musk wants to name his baby X Æ A-12. He and his singer girlfriend, Grimes, welcomed their baby boy into the world this month. Unfortunately, according to TMZ, the name is not allowed by the law of California. "According to a supervisor at the Department of Public Health Vital Records Office in Los Angeles - where the baby is believed to have been born - it is against California law to include numbers or symbols in a name. The law states names must only include the 26 letters of the English alphabet. Obviously, the name Musk and Grimes are claiming for their boy does not meet that criteria," read the article. Grimes took to Twitter on Wednesday to explain the name to people. In the meantime, people on Twitter made fun of the name, saying it sounds like a robot's name.
