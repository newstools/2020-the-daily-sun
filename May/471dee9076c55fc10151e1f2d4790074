TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula is not happy with lack of implementation of Covid-19 restrictions on Rea Vaya buses ekasi. “I’m not happy. People sat too close to each other on buses,” Mbalula said yesterday. He was in Soweto, south of Joburg. He’d gone there to check if stations and buses were being disinfected regularly. Mbalula said there would be consequences. He reminded commuters to abide by strict social distancing rules and wear masks at all times. The minister said buses had to be limited to only 70% capacity. He told the People’s Paper: “The plans are great but Rea Vaya bus management can do better in implementing Covid-19 regulations.  He said he’ll meet with management to ensure there were marshals in buses and at stations checking if people were practising social distancing. According to him, several measures had been put in place including daily disinfection of buses at the depot.  Mbalula said disinfection of stations at regular intervals was equally important to ensure that surfaces people came in contact with were virus free. Commuters were happy to see the transport minister doing the rounds in their kasi. They told Daily Sun buses were full at times, making them fear for their lives. “The number of infected people is growing daily,” said Thabiso Tsonyane. “When the bus is full one becomes afraid of what might happen. “Maybe something will change, now that the minister has come.”
