THEY were apparently so drunk they passed out in a car, with the engine running in the middle of the road. The men, one of them in branded ANC clothes, had a bottle of expensive whisky in the car. Food parcels were found in the boot of the car! When JMPD cops arrested them, the man in the ANC clothes became aggressive. When he was shoved into the cop van, he kicked and damaged the back window. A video taken at the scene shows the man causing a racket inside the police van. He can be heard swearing at the cops. In the background, a female cop indicates that the man is insulting her. Spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed the incident. He told Daily Sun officers found a stationary BMW, with the engine running in the middle of Kliprivier Road, before midnight on Saturday 18 April.  They were both arrested and charged with contravention of Covid-19 regulations and being out on a public road at night.  “The driver was also charged with malicious damage to property,” said Minnaar. Daily Sun tried to get comment from ANC spokesman Pule Mabe,who had not responded at the time of going to print.
