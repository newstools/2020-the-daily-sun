HIGHLANDS Park striker Tendai Ndoro has finally parted ways with the Tembisa-based club yesterday. SunSport has learnt that the burly Zimbabwean player agreed to terminate his contract with the club yesterday, and was given his clearance to look elsewhere. Ndoro has not been one of coach Owen Da Gama’s favourites, and the club added to the 35-year-old’s woes last month when they cut his salary by an estimated R20 000. The out-of-favour Zim Warriors player was among the highly paid players affected at the club since the PSL season was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to our informant, the club reached an amicable agreement with Ndoro, who accepted the offer and opted to stay unemployed, for now. “He should be having his clearance by now. “He’s aware that injuries have not been good to him, which forced the club to put him in the first list of players to exit. At 35, I wonder if he would be able to get something soon,” said the informant. When contacted for comment, Ndoro did not confirm or deny that he is leaving the club, opting to say: “I don’t like talking to the media. No, no, no, I don’t like this. “I am going there as we speak and you’re already giving me a call.” Ndoro has started only six times this season and made three appearances off the bench, while he spent most of the time in the stands. The club’s shareholder, Sinky Mnisi, said they prefer not to comment on such matters. “I don’t know who has been released yet, and maybe he could be in the list,” said Mnisi.
