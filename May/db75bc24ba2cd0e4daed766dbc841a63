SAFA president Danny Jordaan will today address allegations levelled against him in a report directed to the National Executive Committee (NEC) by former acting CEO Gay Mokoena. Jordaan has reacted angrily to accusations that he was running the football association like his personal fiefdom, trampling on the constitution. In a virtual press conference today, Jordaan and his executives are expected to address this and several other issues afflicting the troubled association. Mokoena’s report, which was compiled for the NEC but later found its way to the media, is said to have divided the football governing body. His laments that Jordaan was violating the constitution and flouting corporate governance principles have rung true with some members of the council. Some, though, feel it is all sour grapes from Mokoena, having vacated his position as CEO. “Any CEO who talks nonsense must go through the report and see what they said while they were a CEO,” said Jordaan. “You know nothing about your company and now that you are no longer a CEO, you attack your company. It is not correct. This behaviour is unacceptable. That report is nonsense.” Mokoena, who is still the Safa vice-president, has kept mum on the matter and it is understood that he is preparing for the NEC meeting where the matter will be addressed. “This matter will go before the NEC,” Jordaan said. “He should report to the board first and matters must be dealt with there first and not to spread things all over. “The association has not even been given the right to respond. We’ve now responded. He cannot defend what he has put on paper.” Safa has been beset by various challenges in recent years, ranging from financial difficulties, poor corporate governance to the contentious presidential elections two years ago.
