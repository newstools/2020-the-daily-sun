Nomakula Mandyoli (58) from Lower Crossroads in Cape Town had her leg amputated last year. She told Daily Sun that the doctors had no choice but to amputate it, to free her from the pain. "For many years I had a sore toe, but I never thought it was diabetes until I visited the hospital,” said Nomakula. The doctors told her two years ago that she had diabetes. Nomakula said before she got amputated, she worked on the farms. She said her life changed in October last year when the doctors told her they are going to amputate her leg. “I was also tired of being in pain, I agreed, but I can't walk properly using the walking stick because I have arthritis that's why I need a wheelchair," she said. Mandyoli said that having a leg amputated is the most painful experience. “At first it becomes difficult to accept the condition especially because I used to do things myself. “The changes are stressful and to think that you have to ask other people for food doesn't make things any easier," she explained. She said this has changed her life forever. “I can't walk, and I am struggling to get something to eat because I can't work anymore." She said her wish is to get a wheelchair so that she can move around freely.
