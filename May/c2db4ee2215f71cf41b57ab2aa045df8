Maritzburg United defender Rushine de Reuck is eyeing a move to an overseas club but is happy to stay if there are no offers coming in. De Reuck has drawn admiring looks this season as he helped make the Team of Choice one of the most stout defences in South Africa, conceding only 17 goals in 24 games. Maritzburg's chief operations officer Quinton Jetto has revealed that the club are aware of De Reuck's dream of playing overseas and would not stand in his way. "Ultimately, we would look at any offer that comes for a player. We will never stand in any player's way if there is a good offer that comes to the club," Jetto told SAFM. "We understand where we are as a club, but it will always be in consultation with the coach and player." "De Reuck has a five-year contract. We improved his package according to his performance. Our intention is to make sure he’s happy first," he added. "His first preference is to go overseas, but if there is no offer, then he would like to stay here for another year before he moves somewhere." SOURCE: SPORT24
