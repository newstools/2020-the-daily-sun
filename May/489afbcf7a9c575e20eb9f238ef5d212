TALENT Moyo said having a child who struggles to walk is painful. She can’t get help from government because she’s a foreigner. The 38-year-old mum of three from Newtown in Mamelodi East, east of Tshwane, said her daughter Faith (10) can’t talk either. “This is a difficult situation because there’s no way I can leave her home with other children,” she said. Faith was born at Lephalale Hospital in Limpopo but doesn’t have a birth cerificate as Talent, too, doesn’t have an ID. She said her daughter can’t get help from government and isn’t going to school because of her condition.  “She’s always home with me,” she said. “Other children are scared to play with her because of her condition, and some beat her as she can’t defend herself.” Talent said not having documents isn’t easy and that her kids are suffering. “I don’t work and we sometimes go two days without food,” she said. “I feel that I’ve failed my children. Worse still, my disabled daughter can’t say anything when she’s hungry.” Gauteng social development spokesman Thabiso Hlongwane said the department will attend to the matter urgently.
