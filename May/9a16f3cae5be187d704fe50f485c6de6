RESIDENTS of Mashibiring Village outside Burgersfort, Limpopo, are fixing their own roads. This despite the president’s call to stay home. The village is near Marula Platinum Mine. The roads are bad and there’s lack of water in the area. Resident Phillipos Tebele said they had hoped the mine would bring development to their village. “We have no roads at all and it’s appalling to see the mine turn a blind eye,” he said. Phillipos said all they wanted from the mine was better service delivery. “Motorists had enough of driving on stoney roads. It’s unfortunate all vehicles in the village end up in scrapyards,” he said. “We’re obliged to contribute more than R50 every time we want to fix the roads, which some cannot afford.” Resident Trevor Maebela said they had seen no development in their village since the mine started operating. He said they didn’t expect to live in this situation, with the mine operating nearby. “The road we are complaining about is less than 3km. “We believe it will not cost the mine much,” he said. The mine’s communications manager, Phumlani Dlamini, said the matter would be attended to. “Although we are pre-occupied with the Covid-19 pandemic, we can assure that we will pay attention to the villagers’ challenges,” he said. “Due to the pandemic, all employees are sent home, including grader operators, whom we would have sent to work on the matter.”
