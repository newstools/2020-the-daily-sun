LINDA Sibiya has a voice for radio but what his fans did not know is that he can sound just like the late former President Nelson Mandela. Mr Magic as he is affectionately known, surprised his fans when he posted a video on his Instagram sounding exactly like Tata. In the video, he is heard praising Mzansi's government including President Cyril Ramaphosa for standing together and fight against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. His fans sounded amazed and told the former Ukhozi FM DJ how good he is. Zwelakhe_Gumede said: "BauSbiya uyakwazi ukumlingisela uTata Mandela (Mr Sibiya, you know how to sound like Tata Mandela)." Luckykankosi said: "Wow Sotobe uyinkunzi kodwa (Wow Sotobe you are a genius)." Although Sibiya is no longer a radio DJ, he makes sure that he stays relevant and keeps in contact with his fans especially during the lockdown. He does this by inviting celebrities and host the online talks. He has also appeared as a host for the controversial Mzansi Magic show Mnakwethu. Read:Â KWASA KING SHOWS LOVE!
