The 30-year-old, on loan at Estudiantes, was seen playing cards and smoking with friends in his homeland. Argentina president Alberto Fernandez recently extended lockdown in the country until Sunday, 10 May. Rojo is not the first Premier League player to break government rules. Jack Grealish, Kyle Walker and Moise Kean plus several Arsenal and Tottenham players were all criticised for breaking lockdown regulations. Meanwhile, Premier League clubs met on Friday to reaffirm their commitment to resuming the campaign and are understood to have earmarked Monday, 8 June as a best-case scenario to return following the coronavirus suspension. "The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers," read a statement released. "The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning. "No decisions were taken at today's shareholders' meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding 'Project Restart'." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
