AWARD-WINNING actor and director Thomas Gumede is going to be a dad! He announced the news on social media yesterday. He shared a picture of the sonar scan and wrote: “I remember clearly the day I found out about you. Your mother looked at me and said ‘I’m pregnant’ and then proceeded to cry.” He shared what it was like to be part of his unborn child’s growth. He wrote: “As I’ve watched you grow from trying to feel for the first kick to begging you to stop guquluzing and playing soccer and your mother’s tummy now in third trimester.” He also said his unborn baby had given him purpose.

You have given me purpose. “I now have a real reason to be as crazy and ambitious as I have been because you need a role model, a hero, a friend, a mentor, a father,” he said. The first-time dad also excitedly said that he could not wait to meet his baby boy. “I promise you I will do everything in my power to give you the best life opportunities, to smother you with love and kisses until you’re old enough to tell me to stop! I’ve felt love, but never like this. Woza mfan’wam, sik’lindile,” he said. Shortly after sharing the news, congratulatory messages started flooding in from industry colleagues such as Zenande Mfenyana, who’s also expecting, Masechaba Khumalo, SK Khoza and Salamina Mosese. Daily Sun attempted several times to get comment from Thomas, but he had not responded to calls and SMSes at the time of going to print.
