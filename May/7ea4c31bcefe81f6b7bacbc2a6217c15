The KwaMhlanga Regional Court sentenced a 42-year-old man
from Tweefontein to two life terms for two counts of raping his 14-year-old
stepdaughter. The court heard that the victim’s mother went to attend a
traditional ceremony training when these incidents happened. The accused took the victim to his parental home where the
first incident happened and again on their way back, he pulled off on the road
and forcefully raped her under a bridge. DPP spokesperson in Mpumalanga Monica Nyuswa said the victim
reported the ordeal to her sister and her mother and the authorities were
alerted. In court, the accused
denied the allegations levelled against him until the state presented DNA
evidence linking him to the rape. However, the accused
disputed the accuracy of the DNA evidence. The Regional Court
Prosecutor, Bianca Harmse, led testimonies of the victim, the first report, and
that of the forensic nurse. The J88 confirmed penetration with injuries to the victim’s
private part and the accused was found guilty as charged. Addressing the court
for a harsh sentence, the state emphasised the seriousness of the offense and
that it was committed against a child by her own stepfather who was supposed to
protect and care for her in the absence of her mother. The state submitted that there were no substantial or
compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed sentence of life. The accused was sentenced to two life terms. He was found
unfit to possess a firearm. The accused was also
found unsuitable to work with children. The court further ordered that the name
of the accused is entered into the National Register for Sex Offenders and that
his employer be notified. The Acting Director of Public Prosecutions, Advocate Matric
Luphondo, applauded the good work by the team in addressing the scourge of
gender-based violence in our society.
