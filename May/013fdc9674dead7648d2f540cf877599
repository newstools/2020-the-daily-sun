EIGHTY destitute families feel fortunate to have received staple food. Each household received 12,5kg maize meal. They told Daily Sun it’s been hard to make ends meet since the lockdown started. Most of the families survive on odd jobs and social grants. On Monday, residents of Somali squatter camp near Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni gathered at In Him Ministries Church. The church’s Bishop Hlony Radebe, in partnership with residents, reached deep into his pocket to provide maize meal for desperate families. Radebe said the list was compiled by community leaders and the first group of 50 beneficiaries received maize meal. “Residents are struggling and were hit hard by the lockdown. “We wanted to help ease the struggle. “We realised most families planted vegetables in their backyards but had no money to buy maize meal. “Some households have 11 family members and it only makes sense to buy 12,5kg so that it lasts them for a month at least.” Nonhlanhla Mguni (26), who takes care of her three kids and three nieces, said she relies on social grants. Her vegetable garden has beetroot, green pepper, tomatoes, carrots and spinach. “My maize meal was finished. “This has come at the right time,” said Nonhlanhla. “I often run out of maize meal before the month comes to an end, but I’m happy to have received so much.” Another beneficiary, Comet Ndlazi (38), said: “It’s been tough worrying about maize meal and meat.”
