ON Wednesday, a monkey from nowhere climbed a tree near Legae Intermediate school in Bochabela, Mangaung. Residents crowded around, some even wanting to burn the tree and kill the creature. But SPCA staff said it was just a harmless monkey. Mpho Sethoka (44) from Seven Days wanted to kill it because it looked weird. “I was very scared. No one in this area has monkeys or apes. We have corona to worry about and the last thing we need is strange monkeys. I wanted to pour parrafin on the tree and burn it so it can come down. I stopped when I saw the police.” Neo Ntesele (27) was happy to see the animal in the kasi. “Our own zoo in Bloemfontein is closed because it does not have money. I love animals and I enjoyed seeing it. I was shocked when others referred to the poor animal as tokoloshe. Our people need to learn about nature. “I called the SPCA when my community wanted to harm it. It stood still for hours with the hope that the crowd could go away. I was relieved when I saw the SPCA team and knew no one will kill it. It felt like I was in the zoo again,” said Neo. The SPCA asked cops to control the crowd while they planned to take the monkey down, but failed. They said they had a call saying there were three monkeys, but only one was spotted. A resident screamed: “Use your gun with a drug. Don’t miss because that thing will attack us all.” After taking photos, the SPCA left without the monkey and kasi kids tried to climb to the top of the tall tree, but it was not doable. SPCA spokeswoman Reinet Meyer said her staff saw the monkey but left without it. “The monkey ended up climbing out of the tree by himself and ran away.”
