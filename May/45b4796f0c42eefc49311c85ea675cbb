The Reserve
Bank's monetary policy committee has voted to reduce the repo rate for the
fourth time this year, from 4.25% to 3.75%. As a result
of the cut, the prime lending rate will fall to from 7.75% to 7.25%. The repo
rate is the benchmark interest rate at which the Reserve Bank lends money to
other banks Reserve
Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said at a briefing on Thursday afternoon that
the central bank now expects SA's GDP to shrink by 7% this year. In April, the
bank had predicted a 6.1% fall in GDP. The
decrease in the repo rate was widely predicted by analysts as the Reserve Bank
seeks to bolster SA's fragile economy by lowering interest rates and upping its
bond purchases. SOURCE:
