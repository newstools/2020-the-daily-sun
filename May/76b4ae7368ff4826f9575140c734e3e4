TRADITIONAL healer and well-known musician Joe Shirimani says: “Let’s deal with Covid-19 in our African way and believe in our cultural way of healing. “We can help each other to treat it, as our tradition is not limiting us in practising our culture. The only challenges we experience as traditional practitioners is that African people are not believing in their roots.” He said healers have herbs to find a solution for the pandemic. “Our grandparents had herbs that can cure flu. Why not test the herbs that healed us Africans in the past and turn to them in this time of crisis?” He said traditional practitioners were overlooked in Mzansi. NDZ: LET'S TALK ABOUT ZOL! “We have strong herbs that kill diseases, we have strong medicine. Our muthi doesn’t have side-effects as they’re natural.” The Pompa hitmaker released his album 2020 in December. It’s relevant to the situation the country is now in. “People think I was professing about this year. It says I can’t see properly. I see a black cat,” he said. He said in African culture a black cat means bad luck. “It never crossed my mind that I was predicting something.” Joe said his ancestors never showed him the signs. He said lockdown has delayed some of his music projects.
