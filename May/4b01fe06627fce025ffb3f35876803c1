THE number being targeted for coronavirus testing has gone up, but the department could be missing many people who show no symptoms. This was revealed yesterday by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize in a webinar with data collecting companies. The companies shared predictions of how the virus would be spread, which painted a grim picture. They predicted as many as 40 000 people could be killed by the virus by the end of the year, and as many as three million infected. Mkhize said the department had compiled a list of people who had come into contact with those who had tested positive and that number was worrisome, as it was higher than predicted. He said more people than expected were also testing positive. Mkhize said the lockdown created a barrier between people, slowing the spread. The minister said none of the projections done earlier had forseen the Western Cape having 60% of cases. He said they had predicted this would happen in either Gauteng or KZN, due to population numbers and poverty in the provinces. “Whatever the predictions are, we need to do our best to reduce the impact.” Mkhize said his department would be asking for more analysis to find out which areas should be focused on. He said models would keep improving as they learnt more about the virus. The minister acknowledged the department had struggled with testing, but as many as 18 000 people were recently tested in 24 hours. “There’s a huge challenge now to re-organise targeted testing, so we can deal with the upsurge in the Western Cape,” he said.
