SUNSPORT has learnt with sadness the news that Golden Arrows defender Nkanyiso Mngwengwe has passed away. Mngwengwe is said to have lost his life in the early hours of this morning after he was taken to hospital. Those who are closer to the player say he struggled to breath and when he arrived at the hospital he was declared dead. With details still sketchy right now, almost all Arrows players and those who are closer to him have put Mngwengwe’s pictures and followed with crying emotis. Arrows are set to release a statement in the next coming hours. The 30-year-old has been at the club for seven years. He was promoted at the beginning of the 2013-14 season and has since made 143 appearances, scoring five in the process. Before Mngwengwe’s passing, he didn’t play a single match this season as he was recovering from the knee injury. It is same injury he suffered against AmaZulu on the 22 December 2018 at King Zwelithini Stadium and had kept him out ever since. But speaking to SunSport a few weeks ago, Mngwengwe said he had recovered from the injury. Before the season was suspended, he was back training with the team fully. Coach Steve Komphela was just cautious to play him as he was out for so long.
