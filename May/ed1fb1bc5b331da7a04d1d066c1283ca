MANY motorists say they have to avoid blood flowing on the street every week. This as animal blood fills the M10 road in Bloemfontein every week and many say the blood comes from a company that slaughters animals such as cows, sheep and goats, and supplies to butcheries. The blood comes through the drain and fills the street. Taxi drivers say they have to struggle with blood that ends up smelling inside their cars, leaving customers complaining about the foul smell. SunTeam visited the place on Thursday afternoon and two cars nearly collided while trying to avoid the river of blood. Driver John Zulu said he started seeing bloody road two months ago when he began driving a taxi. He said: "At first I thought that people had been brutally killed and I stopped the taxi and ran to see where the blood was coming from. I know blood when I see blood and I was ready to call the police but I realized that it was coming from a manhole. The passengers started to shout at me to come and drive them because they were getting late. They then told me that they were used to the blood on the road." When SunTeam arrived at the scene, private construction workers were busy trying to solve the problem. Two cars were also caught on camera after they nearly collided because of the blood on the road. Another taxi driver Tshepo Sejanaga said the blood was coming from where the animals were being slaughtered. "This issue needs the municipality because clearly the drain system is blocked. Now we have to drive on the blood and that leaves our taxi smelling animal blood. This blood will end up causing accidents and killing us because this is a road where we put foot more on the accelerator. I did call the municipality last month but they clearly can't fix the problem," he said. Mangaung Metro Municipality spokesman Qondile Khedama said they were not aware, but he will send a team to investigate the matter.
