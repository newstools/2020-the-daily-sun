Actress Nokuthula Mavuso took to Twitter and wrote a letter to the presidency and to Minister Nathi Mthethwa. In the letter, she explained how she hasn't received her cut of the relief fund. She said she hasn't worked since April 2019. She got a role in a series that was supposed to be filmed from 26 March but couldn't resume because of the virus. "Dear @NathiMthethwaSA @PresidencyZA. My name is Nokuthula Mavuso & I'm a freelance actor who hasn't worked since the birth of my child in April 2019. I was due to work on a series that was meant to shoot on 26 March 2020. The project cannot resume until ports of entry are reopened," she wrote. She said she sent all the documents needed by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture. However, she hasn't received a response. She wrote: "I was hopeful the fund would cushion the #LockdownSA #COVID19SA blow. I sent through all docs required by your dept. I'm yet to receive an acknowledgement of receipt from your dept." The actress said it hurt to see actors being treated badly. "It pains me that actors like myself have been ignored or rejected without a plausible explanation. And for the record, #CCIFSA doesn't represent many like myself. I've engaged with the leadership on this platform on how membership works. No answers. If you could, kindly advise on a way forward," her thread continued.
