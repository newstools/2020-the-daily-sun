THOUSANDS of people are expected to be making their way to Gauteng following the slight easing of the lockdown from level five to four. This is due to some economic sectors opening their doors for the first time since the lockdown was put in place five weeks ago. On Friday morning at the Grasmere Toll Plaza, people could be seen trickling into Joburg from Free State and other provinces. One person who was happy to be back on the road was taxi driver Phaphama Bembe who drives between Cape Town and Joburg. Long-distance taxi drivers have been hardest hit by the lockdown due to the restrictions on interprovincial movements. Phaphama told Daily Sun: "As a taxi driver I'm very happy, I will be able to put food on my table for my kids. "During the lockdown, there was nothing I could do because this is out. We are thankful the government has opened up for seven days so we can work between provinces." Joburg Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo was part of the awareness campaign at the Grasmere Toll Plaza early today.  "Today is the first day where certain industries are opening, we are expecting an influx of people from different provinces to come into Joburg. "This eve there is just for awareness of washing their hands and social distancing because Joburg is an epicentre of Covid-19 here in Gauteng."  He said they are at Toll Plaza to share information about covid-19 and not just arresting them. He said now under level four lockdown, people must be home between 8 pm and 5 am. "Every person in the road must have a permit and they must comply."
