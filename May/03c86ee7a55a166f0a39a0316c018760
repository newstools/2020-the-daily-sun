KABZA De Small has not rested since he started his music career. His partnership with DJ Maphorisa has produced hit after hit. Now it seems that rivals can’t take the heat anymore. Yesterday, controversial soccer butterfly Sjuku, who’s a thwasa, posted a recorded message to Instagram asking Kabza to take it easy. He said Kabza, whose real name is Kabelo Motha, was closing doors for other DJs who still wanted to make it. “This time, please release an album and call it Scorpion the end,” pleaded Sjuku. He said it felt like Kabza was releasing so many hits he was a member of the illuminati. “When the corona ends, please give others a chance.” Kabza saw Sjuku’s video and responded with his own, in which he said he was not in the illuminati. “It’s hard work ntwana.” He said he was not closing doors for anyone. “We’re simply doing our thing. “Anyone else can come and do their own. No hard feelings.” Many social media users were on Kabza’s side. Temo casting agency said: “Honest truth Kabza, you can’t back down because of someone who is lazy.” Daily Sun tried to get hold of both Kabza and Sjuku with no success.
