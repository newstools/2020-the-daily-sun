VETERAN Joseph Motlhasedi Ntsime was laid to rest on
Saturday at Moruleng Village in the North West. Fifty Mourners gathered at the Moruleng United Reformed
Church (URC) to bid farewell to Ntsime, who passed away last week. The family complied with lockdown regulations. Mourners
wearing masks and gloves were sanitised as they came in and out throughout the
funeral service. The funeral proceedings were kept very short. Attended by
family and few church members.  The-89-year-old leaves a legacy in Setswana literature and
contribution to theÂ  preservation of indigenous languages. Ntsime graduated with a BA Degree at the University of South
Africa. JM Ntsime High School in Mogwase, outside Rustenburg was
name in honour of the legendary poet. Mourners who attended the funeral spoke of Ntsime as a
God-fearing man. Ntsime was humble, regardless of his achievements and that is
how he will be remembered.  Everyone was touched by the funeral and they were all sad.
They said he put his village and the whole North West on the map and he will
not be forgotten. There is a huge difference between people who attend church
and people who are dedicated to the church. Ntsime gave his soul and heart to
his church, said one Mourner. "We have lost a warrior. A gain has fallen. We shall
take everything we have learned from this man to better ourselves" Mourners said that they wish that funerals should still be
conducted this way even after lockdown. "Lessons learned during the COVID-19 must be used to in
the future. It will be disapline in who people carry themselves and a lot of
lives will be saved." Ntsime was laid to rest at Legkraal cemetery. Ntsime had many talents and he will be remembered as a wise
man who valued education.
