IT looks as if Mzansi will soon be Zooming with the Zumas! Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane seems to be behind a programme by this name on YouTube that has set tongues wagging on social media since earlier this week. In a trailer posted by Duduzane, the former president says: “I think the time has come that I must also start speaking.” This is a promise he’s made many times in the past. Yesterday, in a 45-minute video clip Duduzane posted on social media, he tells how he saved Deputy President David Mabuza’s life when the then Mpumalanga premier discovered he’d been poisoned. He said Mabuza was airlifted by helicopter from Nelspruit, but when a storm stopped them from landing at OR Tambo he was dropped off somewhere else and picked up by car and driven to the Firebrand terminal at the airport. “The captains of the plane were panicking,” he said. According to Duduzane, they said it was a high-profile trip and asked if the gentleman was okay, but he assured the pilot the sick man was a very high- profile person and they then flew to Moscow, Russia. He said Mabuza vowed to find the people who were behind his poisoning and make them pay. Mabuza apparently told Duduzane he knew those people and they visited him while he was half-conscious in hospital. Duduzane said Mabuza appreciated his help and he was sure those were the efforts of his father, but Mabuza was no longer taking Duduzane’s calls. “There has been a breakdown in my relationship with David Mabuza,” he said. “I don’t know why and maybe we’ll have that discussion one day. I’m the man who was part of saving his life and we used to speak on the phone.” Speaking about his mother Kate, who committed suicide in 2 000, Duduzane said he was called to her bedside and consoled by anti-apartheid activist Reverend Frank Chikane. He also spoke of his mother’s suicide note, which said his father shouldn’t attend the funeral. He didn’t give much details about it.
