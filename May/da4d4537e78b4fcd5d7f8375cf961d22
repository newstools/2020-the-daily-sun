"HE was a beast in the field of play," that is how former AmaZulu goalkeeper Frederick Mfeka paid tribute to Cedric "Sugar Ray" Xulu. He described the deceased football legend as a man of few words "but was a beast in the field". AmaZulu confirmed the passing away of the 81-year-old on Monday at the Marianhill hospital, just outside Durban. It is reported that he was receiving treatment after battling with cancer.  “Sugar wasn’t someone who used to talk too much, but he transferred that perfectly on the pitch,” recalled Mfeka who played with Xulu for 10 years at AmaZulu. “He had a pride to play for the club. He refused to be corrupted by big clubs at the time. Maybe we didn’t know much about money than today.” Xulu was at the heart of the AmaZulu team that won the league title in 1972 under Bethuel Masondo. It was a side that was packed with talented players such Patrick Ngidi, Michael Yende, Richard Ngubane, Brainsby Khulu Sibiya and Wellington "Chippa" Khoza, just to name a few.  A year later after Usuthu won the league title, Xulu, along with Mfeka, were included in the South African Black Eleven team that played against the British All Stars on 9 July 1973. In that match where Kgomotso Modise was manager, it was the cream of crop of Mzansi which had the likes of Lucas "Masterpieces" Moripe, Petros Nzimande, Ephraim "Shakes" Mashaba, Joseph Sethlodi, Kaizer Motaung, Percy Moloi, Shaka Ngcobo and Jomo Sono. He was named the skipper on that day. Xulu is one of few South African players to have a venue named after him, which is the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in his hometown in Clermont.  Added Mfeka: “He was a top talent. Teams used to suffer when we were playing at Curries Fountain. It has been painful to see him in and out of hospital as I've known him in 1967 up until now. I’m sure he’s resting now.” PSL chairman Irvin Khoza honoured him with the prestigious Chairman’s Award last year during the 2018-19 PSL Awards held at ICC in Durban.
