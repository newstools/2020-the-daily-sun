On her Facebook posts, she said:"Please don't be fooled. This Zanele Mazet below is not me. It is a fake account, using my pictures and scamming people for money. Please help me report him/her."  After her post, some of her Facebook friends informed her that the hacker tried to rob them. Bongani BK Khumalo said the hacker blocked him after he asked for bank account details to send R700 a hacker asked for. Nthabiseng Motsoagae also told LaMbokazi-Nkambule that someone was using her cellphone number. LaMbokazi-Nkambule said that people should be careful of such hackers. "Before a person sends money, they must check first if they are sending it to a right person. Some people can do anything even committing crime to get money," said LaMbokazi-Nkambule.
