PARENTS and caregivers are unhappy about kids going back to school. Last month, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said officials would return first to prepare for schooling and pupils would follow after a month. Gogo Lettie Songo (91) from Olifantsfontein, Ekurhuleni who suffers from blood pressure and diabetes, lives with her grandson. “If kids go back to school, it will be the end of my life. He’ll bring the virus home and it’ll kill me.” She said if they do go back, government must provide shelters at schools. Dan Rachoene (50) from Tembisa lives with his high school kids and two grandkids. “I have high blood pressure. The moment my kids return to school, my life is in danger. Focus on defeating the virus and we’ll start over next year,” he said. SA Democratic Teachers Union won’t allow members to report for duty. It said: “Personal protective equipment has not been bought. Disinfecting of schools has not even reached 25%. “It is unlawful to expect workers to report for duty when their safety is not guaranteed. We call on our members who were to travel from various provinces to remain safe in their homes.”
