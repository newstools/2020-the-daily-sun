STRUGGLING Black Leopards midfielder Andriamirado “Dax” Andrianarimanana is a happy man. The Madagascar international says he can’t wait to play football again when the Absa Premiership resumes as he served his ban. The Premier Soccer League was suspended in March due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Andrianarimanana was banned for four months by Fifa in February for breach of contract after he signed with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs from Madagascar’s outfit Faso Juniors in 2018. He joined Leopards in 2019 but since he was banned, Leopards coach Allan Clark did not include him in his team. Chiefs were banned from signing players for two transfer window periods. But Amakhosi have appealed the ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The 29-year-old missed Lidoda Duvha’s six league matches and also watched three Leopards Nedbank Cup matches from his home in Polokwane. The last time Andrianarimanana played for Leopards was on 24 January in their 1-0 league defeat to Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium. But when the PSL resumes, Andrianarimanana will be available for selection and the Antananarivo-born player told SunSport he is raring to go. “I just want to play football again and I am happy this problem is over,” said Andrianarimanana. “It has been a tough time for me, but I had a good support from Leopards. “I came to South Africa to play football. I am just happy. I have been training hard alone because of the lockdown. I feel fit and ready to play.” His return to action will be a huge boost for the under pressure Clark as he now needs all his star players to help the Venda based side survive relegation. Leopards are currently bottom of the log table on 20 points with six matches remaining. The other good news for Leopards is the return of goalkeeper Jonas Mendes from injury. Mendes was out for almost two months.
