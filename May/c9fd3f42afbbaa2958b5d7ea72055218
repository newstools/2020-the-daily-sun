MULTI-award winning artist Sjava has announced his shock departure from his record label Ambitiouz Records.   "Through them ngikwazile ukwakhela umama umuzi ekhaya" ,which means he has been able to build a house for his mum. "Angina nkinga namuntu .Angiyena umntu wama beef nokukhuluma." He said he had taken a break from social media to deal with his decision. But he added that not seeing eye to eye with a company business wise does not mean the end of a personal relationship. He asked his fans to continue supporting him and not attack his now ex-label. Sjava was the one big artists left at the label following the rocky departures of other big names such as Emtee and Amanda Black who both claimed to have been mismanaged by Ambitiouz financially. Other artists such as Fifi Cooper ,A-Reece and LaSauce also left the label under a dark cloud. Sjava released two wildly successful albums under Ambitiouz,Isina Muva and Umqhele. He won a BET Award and many local awards including big awards for Umqhele at last year's SA Music Awards. Sjava disappeared from social media since fellow singer Lady Zamar and his ex girlfriend accused him of rape earlier this year.
