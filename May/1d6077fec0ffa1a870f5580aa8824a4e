CHILDREN
from a centre for the vulnerable are currently kept at another place after
raging flames swept through their centre. Following
this fire which almost claimed the childrenâ€™s lives the Social Development KZN
MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for an investigation into the cause of a fire
that broke out at the Comfort Child and Youth Care Centre (CYCC) in Kokstad
KZN. The
centre which is the home to 44 vulnerable children suddenly burnt down on
Wednesday. Fortunately,
workers of the centre managed to rescue all children and moved them to a safe
place at Peter Pearce Centre where they are currently kept. But
four of the children were rushed to the hospital for smoke inhalation after
they collapsed at the centre. Three
of the four children were admitted for further observation while one was
discharged on Thursday. The
building of the Comfort Child and Youth Care Centre was partially damaged by
the fire. MEC
Khoza said she is concerned about the incident and the extent of the damage
left by the fire at the children's home. "We
find comfort that there was no life lost in this unfortunate incident. The fire
left a trail of destruction in property meant to provide shelter to the
vulnerable children," said MEC Khoza. She
said the management of the department will work closely with the law
enforcement agencies, fire authorities, and other experts to determine the
cause of the fire. "We
are grateful to the workers of the centre who ensured that there was no life
lost. These workers had to face risk when they rescued the children," she
said. She
said a team of social workers has been assembled to render psycho-social
support services to the affected children and workers of the centre. The
KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquiry was opened
at Kokstad SAPS after the fire broke out at a youth centre. Gwala
said the matter is still under investigation.
