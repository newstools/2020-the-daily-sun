Radio personality Criselda Kananda says she is finally on ARVs. The star, who has been open about her HIV status for years, has shared how she lived with the virus without taking ARVs. In an Instagram post she said she is finally taking ARVs and that she is out of danger as far as the coronavirus is concerned. Also, she said she forgives people, who spread lies about her not telling the truth about her status. Covid_19 Realities First things first. Thank you God that I’m alive even though I’m not ?? well. Many persons living with HIV, Diabetic and Cancer Survivors including many others who have immuno compromised health, this is a difficult period for us. The constant cleaning of surfaces, sanitizing, disinfecting and covered breathing though very necessary it unfortunately leads to unintended consequences. The immune system becomes lazy giving strength to any existing bugs in our bodies. After years of fighting My fighter cells are disarmed. I take this moment to thank you all for the prayers and words of encouragement. I’m grateful for a chance to say thank you to my family, friends and the medical staff @netcarewaterfallhospital I’m out of danger SARS-Covid free(negative) but the HIV in my body is having a live concert. This means I have to start ARV’s after 22yrs of living healthy with HIV. My immune system now needs help. The next six weeks are going to be hard but with God on my side I can face anything and any enemy. Finally to those who’ve spread silly gossip about me lying about being HIV antibody positive simply because I knew and shared how to take care of myself I forgive you. #gratefullheart?????? #godisstillincontrol A post shared by  Criselda Kananda (@positivegp) on May 24, 2020 at 2:55am PDT
