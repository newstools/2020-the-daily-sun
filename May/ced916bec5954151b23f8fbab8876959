BAYLAND squatters in Port Elizabeth have called on the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality to put politics aside and give them water and toilets to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. For two years some of the residents on Perseverance Road have been sharing water from a broken water pipe with cows and dogs. They also have to make fires to repel the snakes when they relieve themselves in nearby bushes. They’re struggling to get services because they don’t have a ward councillor. Both ward 41 councillor Simphiwe Tyukana (ANC) and ward 52 councillor Francois Greyling (DA) have disowned these residents. The outbreak of the coronavirus also stopped the IEC from resolving this demarcation problem. The area was formed in 2018 and has about 1 800 shacks. There are only four communal taps near R75 Uitenhage Road. Those who live near Peserverance Road have to walk about 2km to get to the taps. On 25 March, they were part of a violent total shutdown with Westville and Joe Slovo squatters that led to the torching of buses on the R75 Uitenhage Road in demand for electricity. Community leader of Bayland Nomonde Soga said: “The municipality can’t help us because we don’t have a ward councillor. Every time we need services, we are told to go through our ward councillor. In order for us to get communal taps we had to ask the Informal Settlements Forum to intervene. But this is not the time for politics. We need water and toilets to protect ourselves against Covid-19.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki promised to follow up the matter since 11 May. While Nelson Mandela Bay ANC councillor Andile Lungisa hasn’t responded to our calls and messages since 13 May.
