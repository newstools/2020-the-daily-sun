Kylie Jenner is reportedly not a billionaire. The reality TV star hogged headlines last year after being touted as the youngest billionaire following claims by Forbes Magazine that she was. This was after she sold a 51% stake of her cosmetics company Kylie Cosmetics. The magazine has now made a U-turn on its initial announcement of the 22-year-old star's billionaire status. The magazine said it reviewed financial data released by Coty Inc, which bought a 51% stake in Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics company in November 2019. Those financial filings show, "Kylieâ€™s business is significantly smaller, and less profitable, than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe," the magazine said. Forbes now estimates the net worth of Jenner, 22, at around $900 million. Writing on Twitter on Friday, Jenner said the recent story was based on "a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions". "What am I even waking up to. I thought this was a reputable site," she wrote.
