BLACK Leopards goalkeeper King Ndlovu has opened up about the injury he sustained early this year which added more to his frustrations. The lanky stopper has not played this season at the club. The arrival of Guinea-Bissau international Jonas Mendes saw Ndlovu spending most of his time eating ice on the bench. The 27-year-old from Ga-Rankuwa says he understands why Mendes, who recently recovered from injury, has been playing ahead of him. Ndlovu said: “He’s a quality goalkeeper, number one for his country and has been to Afcon I understand.” “Last season I played almost every match, but this season it has been tough. What frustrates the most is that when I was about to get a chance when our number one keeper (Mendes) got injured. I also suffered the same injury. “Being out for three months was not easy, it is frustrating luckily the league was suspended in the process." Both Ndlovu and Mendes have been out since February due to same ankle fracture injury. However, the lockdown was a blessing in disguise as it granted Lidoda Duvha goalkeepers time to recover as they will be back to help their club fight relegation battle as they are bottom of the log. Ndlovu stated: “I have recovered now. I am just working twice as hard ensuring that when the league resume of it happens and I get a chance I keep that number one position.” Since players have been training from home, Ndlovu said it has been challenging but remains committed to the job. He stated: “I have been under pressure before. I am positive I will be back at my best again.” Mendes has also fully recovered from injury.
