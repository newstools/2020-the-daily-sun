THE struggling taxi industry could soon receive a lifeline from the transport department. Earlier today,Minister Fikile Mbalula revealed that even though the industry was not regulated, it would be getting financial assistance. Speaking at a taxi rank in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni, as drivers were being screened and tested for corona virus, Mbalula said the process of regulating the industry was started before the lockdown. “I’min the process of regulating, transforming and formalising the taxi industry.When corona virus arrived in this country  I was on that journey and I’m still on that journey. I’m engaging with the industry to address issues of formalising it,” he said. Mbalula said there would be an indaba, which was supposed to have already taken place,to endorse decisions already made. “Inthe coming week or so, I should come back to report the details of how much wewill be supporting the taxi industry,” he said. Mbalula was part of a group of government officials overseeing the screening of taxi drivers and queue marshals. He said passengers should not be the only people being tested for the corona virus. “Taxi drivers must have masks. If they don’t have a mask, they can infect their passengers,” he said. Mbalula said the government would be providing masks but if drivers didn’t get them,they should find something else to cover their mouths. The minister seemed pleased with the taxi industry’s steps to fight the corona virus. “The taxi industry has come to the party and supported the government’s efforts to fight the corona virus,” he said. Driver William Chauke said it was important for drivers to be tested for the virus as they transported a lot of passengers. “When drivers load people into ta xis, they don’t know whether they have corona virus or not,” he said. William said the testing process was not that bad and other drivers should also get tested.
