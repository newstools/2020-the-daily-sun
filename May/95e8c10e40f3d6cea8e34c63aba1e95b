CHRISTOPHER Moloi’s family hope for good news every day. Teacher Christopher (30) went missing in Delmas, Mpumalanga, on 28 February. A 32-year-old relative said Christopher was last seen at a local tavern, where bouncers allegedly moered him. The relative told Daily Sun they tried calling him on 29 February, but his phone was off. “His mother went to his school and asked his colleagues about his whereabouts. “They went to check at his place and found the door wide open, but the burglar door was closed. “A neighbour saw Christopher with three men in his car on the Sunday he went missing.” The car was found in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, but Christopher was not there. According to the relative, neighbours had told them unknown people usually came to his house at night and later left. The relative accused cops of dragging their feet. She said: “Every time we ask about the case, they tell us they’re still busy. “We update them on what community members are saying, but they haven’t done anything. “We’re very hurt and our gogo is not coping. We’re still searching for him, even under this lockdown.” Christopher was the breadwinner. Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of possession of a suspected stolen vehicle was opened. Two suspects were bust.
