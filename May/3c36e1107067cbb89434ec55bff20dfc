THE last time Bongani Zungu played second division football was back in his days with AmaTuks. And he is not eager to take a step back to the lower Ligue 2 when the new football season kicks off in France, post the Covid-19 lockdown. Amiens SC suffered the unfortunate relegation fate after the French football season was declared over last week. Together with Lyon, Amiens have reacted angrily to the decision which has cost them a place in the money-spinning Ligue 1 and the former European qualification, and have already threatened legal action. But it is no secret the Bafana Bafana midfielder is hankering for a move away from the French club, having failed to secure a move to Spanish side Mallorca in January. “I’ve been looking to help the club avoid relegation. “But beyond that I’m looking for a fresh challenge elsewhere,” said Zungu while reacting to the sad state of affairs in France. “Things didn’t quite go well when I wanted to move in January this year. “But the club know about my intentions to move. “I would really love to play in Spain. Teams play good football there and I’m hoping to get a team there. “Football is a short career. You can never tell what tomorrow holds.” The abrupt ending of the French season was as part of the government’s effort to contain the spread of coronavirus that has brought sport to a standstill in most parts of the world. As is the case with the other leagues worldwide, some teams had played 27 matches, leaving the French League to draw up the final log standings according to a performance index, the number of points per match weighed by head-to-head record. Zungu joined Amiens from Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes three years ago, and has seen his star and profile rise in the two seasons he has been with Amiens so far, having played against some of the best players in the world. The 27-year-old has a year left on his contract, but a move to the lower division will be a huge setback in his career as he looks to spread his wings.
