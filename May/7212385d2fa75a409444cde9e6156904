THE ANC Youth League in eThekwini is devastated after regional secretary Kingdom Gcabashe was shot and killed on Tuesday in Mpumalanga township, west of Durban. Regional spokesman Thulisa Ndlela today told Daily Sun the leadership received the news with shock. He said they were concerned about the continuing killing of their leaders by faceless people and called on the police to find the killers immediately. He said Kingdom was ward 91 branch secretary and a pastor at Remnants Church of God. Ward 91 branch chairman Simphiwe Khoza couldn’t believe Kingdom was no longer with them. When he received a call about the shooting, he rushed to the scene and found him lying dead in a pool of blood. Khoza believed the killing was political. Cousin Lindokuhle Madonsela (36) said Kingdom went to buy airtime at a spaza shop and when he approached the gate, two men opened fire. “I saw two men running from the scene to the getaway car waiting from a short distance. We rushed to Kingdom, but he was already dead. He had many gunshot wounds in the head and 11 cartridges were found on the scene.” A source claimed the killing was an inside job in the ANC. He said two rival camps were campaigning hard to control the ward in the upcoming branch general meeting, and were preparing for the ANC regional conference and local government elections next year. “What happened is a recipe of what people can expect once branches begin sitting for meetings. The winning camp will elect a candidate for ward councillor, so it’s about power that will take people to the resources in the municipality.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder has been opened at Mpumalanga Police Station.
