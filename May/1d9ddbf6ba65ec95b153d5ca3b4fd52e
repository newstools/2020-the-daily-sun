CHIPPA United forward Ruzaigh Gamildien says his coach Rhulani Mokwena has been misunderstood and says he’s a top coach. Gamildien, who re-joined Chippa in the January transfer window from GladAfrica Championship side Steenberg United, said Mokwena is one of the few coaches who is up to date with the new techniques of the game. The former Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach was appointed as Chippa coach in a surprise move in March, signing a deal that will run until the end of this suspended season. His club Orlando Pirates said it was a loan move, the first of its kind in coaching terms in the PSL, after he cut a forlorn figure following Bucs appointment of unknown Josef Zinnbauer in December. “It is a pleasure working with Rhulani because he’s a good coach and well-versed with technicalities of the game,” said Gamildien. “He tries to bring across his philosophy in a manner which is very easy to understand.” Mokwena led his new side to a 0-0 draw against Bidvest Wits away in his first and only match in charge in March before the league was suspended due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Mokwena was put to his toughest in August last year when Pirates appointed him after the shock departure of Milutin Sredojevic. The young coach was deemed as one of the upcoming coaching talents but things didn’t fall into place for him at Bucs. Under his charge, Pirates crashed out of the MTN8, Caf Champions League and the Telkom Knockout. Afterwards, it was just a matter of time before he was replaced as he won only four of 15 matches he was in charge of in all competitions. “I never worked with him before and I only see what he’s capable of now at Chippa,” said Gamildien, when asked if he thinks Mokwena failed at Pirates. “I doubt if there’s any bad vibes in him because the only thing I have noticed are good vibes.”
