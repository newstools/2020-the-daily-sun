SPRINGBOK fullback Warrick Gelant couldn't have asked for a better birthday present than a bumper deal to join the Stormers. The Rugby World Cup-winner, who turned 25 on Wednesday, switched to the Cape side, opting not to renew his contract, which expires in July, with the Bulls. The 25-year-old spent six years with the Bulls where he established himself, and he has thanked the Pretoria franchise for helping him built his career this far. ”I arrived here as a young man with big dreams, and the people around me assisted me to build my career and most importantly to live my dream, ” said Gelant. ”I sincerely would like to thank each and every individual for making my time here special, from the coaches and players to the management and admin staff. ”It feels strange saying goodbye after all these years. Loftus was my home, and the people at the Bulls were my family, but the time has come for me to move on and enter a new phase of my life.” Stormers coach John Dobson has welcomed Gelant, describing his arrival as a major boost to the vision of a backline that will be able to ignite the passion of the faithful. He said: ”Warrick has established himself as one of the most dynamic backline player in South Africa, so we could not be more thrilled to have him on our books going forward.”
