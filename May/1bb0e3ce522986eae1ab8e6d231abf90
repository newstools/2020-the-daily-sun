SHOPPING during lockdown has become difficult for the elderly in Soweto. They walk long distances while carrying groceries as taxis are scarce. But they’re relieved now after Tuk Tuk cabs were introduced ekasi three weeks ago. The cabs take them from a mall in Diepkloof, right to their doorstep at a cheaper price. Gogo Emelda Mlambo (63) said she lives alone and relies on people to buy her groceries, but they buy the wrong items. They also demand money to do errands for her. But Tuk Tuk cabs only charge her R8. “I decided to do my own shopping,” said gogo Emelda. “We’re grateful to the people who came up with the idea. “I used to stress a lot because I had to walk long distances. “Taxis were not operating at normal times.” David Ngwenya (70) from Orlando East said his feet were swollen, so he couldn’t walk a long distance. Tuk Tuk cabs came to his rescue. “We can’t request Uber because it’s very expensive. It costs R25 a trip and that’s a lot for us pensioners. “I know Tuk Tuk will deliver me home,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to the manager of Tuk Tuk cabs in the area, Lendl Prior, who said they get a lot of good feedback from the elderly in Orlando and Diepkloof. “Our normal price is R10, but it’s R8 for the elderly. They appreciate it because we deliver them home,” he said. He said to comply with Covid-19 regulations, they carry one or two passengers.
