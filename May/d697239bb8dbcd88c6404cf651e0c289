He then explained that he he has been taking some Eucalyptus, lemon, ginger, honey, garlic clove that he would chew, and hot water during his quarantine. Ndaba said he beat corona with that concoction and anyone who talks about a vaccine was lying. What most people did not know is that he alleges that he was cured by traditional medicine. One of his relatives, Ndikela Mandela, also collaborated his story by posting on Facebook that her brother Ndaba was cured by indigenous herbal remedies. "To all those foaming at the mouth about the efficacy of umhlonyane and other herbal remedies, my brother Ndaba took indigenous herbal remedies after testing positive for Covid-19 - that's a fact. After two weeks of taking such remedies, he went for testing and they came back negative. He's been negative since. All remedies he took ranging from ginger, black pepper, oranges, turmeric, garlic are the ones that made him better!!" European doctors and scientist’s shame on you. I guess you will never change #africastandup A post shared by  d_rebelsouljah (@ndaba_mandela) on Apr 6, 2020 at 5:45am PDT
