ZAMBIA national team boss Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic says the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) are on the verge of hosting a long-overdue goalkeeping course in the country. This will be first since 1998, but the course can only happen when the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted in a bid to increase skills in this area of speciality. “Based on the information that we have, schools are supposed to open in June, we are also looking to use this, probably one area which has been so much been neglected. Imagine that the last goalkeeping course was in 1998,” said Micho. “We need to retain a Zambian goalkeeping academy and school. We are looking forward to get started with our goalkeeping coach Dushan Stojanovic who has been working for 23 years in seven countries producing top class goalkeepers in five top leagues and playing Uefa Champions League himself. “We want to spread goalkeeping activities to the rest of the country and producing a school.” Polokwane City's Cyril Chibwe, Kennedy Mweene of Mamelodi Sundowns and Charles Muntanga are some of the players that have had to under the training courses.
