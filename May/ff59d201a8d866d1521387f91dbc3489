MARITZBURG United boss Farook Kadodia says they have yet to decide whether to implement salary cuts on their players or not. PSL clubs are starting to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. AmaZulu were the first to disclose to their players that salary cuts were imminent this month, while Highlands Park players that are on a high salary scale like Tendai Ndoro were also affected. Although The Team of Choice have the backing of Umsunduzi municipality in Pietermaritzburg, Kadodia has been forced to sell his top players almost every season to run the club due to lack of sponsors. He sold Siphesihle Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe to Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in June last year and had to release key players like Lebohang Maboe, Evans Rusike, Cuthbert Malajila and Rudolph Bester to keep the club afloat. Said Kadodia: “We are not in a position to commit ourselves at this stage. We will have a meeting to map the way forward. The majority of businesses have had many challenges economically due to the lockdown and it’s not easy to maintain the club if you don’t have a sound financial backing.” Kadodia is aware that the R2 million PSL monthly grant is not enough especially when the clubs are not getting any gate takings since the season has been halted. “The existence of this club is purely due to sales we’ve done in the past. We will always develop and sell players for us to survive.” Meanwhile, Kadodia revealed that the stoppage of the season has forced them to delay negotiations with players whose contracts expires in June.
