WITH pupils expected back at school on Monday, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says no schools will be opened without personal protective equipment. Speaking during a visit to Seshego Secondary in Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane yesterday, the minister said only schools that had satisfied all safety requirements would open on Monday. She said schools spent this week cleaning classrooms so they would be ready for pupils. “Deliveries are beginning to arrive today,” she said. On Monday, Motshekga said she expected schools to ensure every child had a book and personal protective equipment. “We’re working towards Monday because just reorientating the space is not easy. We’re expecting on Monday and Tuesday, we can do inductions and reorientation to make sure we can throughly deal with health issues,” she said. Motshekga said she expected learning to resume on Wednesday. She said whoever was ready on Monday had to reopen, but if schools didn’t get their equipment the department would not force them to work without them. The announcement about reopening schools had received mixed reactions from parents, with some calling it careless. Parent Natasha van Heerden said nobody expected schools to stay closed forever, but Monday was too soon. Mqombothi Nsizwa said Motshekga must be held accountable.
