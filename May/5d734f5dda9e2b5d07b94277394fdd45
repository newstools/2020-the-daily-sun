BAFFLED cops using a drone to hunt a suspect discovered the
shape of a giant 4-5 ploughed into a field. The officers stumbled across the rude design which they say
caught them "completely by surprise". The Sun reports that Devon and Cornwall Police drone team
shared the image online and it has, unsurprisingly, attracted plenty of
interest. A spokesperson for the page said: "It's absolutely
amazing what you see from the air and sometimes we're caught a bit off guard. "Whilst in West Cornwall and searching for an offender
who'd recently run off from police, we came across this unusual piece of
artwork in a field, taking us completely by surprise." Some social media users joked that it was "an
arrow" to tell the police the offender "went that way". Kris Guest wrote on Facebook: "The best thing is that
someone hasn't just done it randomly they have actively planned this, procured
a grass cutting apparatus, then made their way to this field and gave a
circumcision if you will." Clive Wilkins wrote: "That's just an arrow pointing to
where the offender is hiding." Colin Dorrance joked: "Must be a hardened criminal."
