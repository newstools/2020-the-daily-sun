GAGASI FM presenter DJ Sphe Live is excited about releasing his debut single. The radio presenter, whose real name is Siphesihle Shabalala, has always wanted to pursue music and is glad it’s finally happening. The 29-year-old from Ladysmith in KZN told SunBuzz: “I grew up in a home where everyone loved music. “My dad played the guitar and we all loved anything music related. “Before I could release music, I wanted to build my brand. People don’t back one’s music if they don’t know you. “So I knew that once people knew me from radio, they’d buy my music. That’s why I’m releasing the song now. “I don’t have a title or release date yet, but it’s almost done. I’ve featured Bob Eazy, an amapiano love song.” Speaking about his love of radio, DJ Sphe Live said: “Growing up, I’d take my mum’s phone and record myself imitating radio presenters. “I loved radio that much, so I decided to go to school for it. I studied journalism at Icesa College in Durban, KZN. I then joined Durban community radio station, Vibe FM.” Sphe Live joined Gagasi FM last year and hosts two shows – the Breakfast Gang Gang which airs on Saturdays from 7am to 10am, and The Sunday Chill Zone every Sunday from 2pm to 6pm. “It’s been great. People are responding to me so well. “I didn’t think it would happen so soon. But the plan is to go to bigger stations because the end goal is to build my brand.”
