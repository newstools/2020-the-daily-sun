The City of Johannesburg is planning to relocate approximately 1 600 South African citizens from the densely populated Setswetla informal settlement in Alexandra. "The Department of Housing decided to come here today to present and engage on the plans that we have for this informal settlement. We are going to be playing our role and we are going to try to deal with over-populated settlements, and Setswetla is one of the informal settlements that we identified,‚Äù Housing MMC Mlungisi Mabaso told the media in Setswetla on Tuesday. This comes after daily stats to date have revealed that the densely populated Gauteng is one of the three provinces with the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases. In addition, it comes amid the need to ensure that families living in densely inhabited informal settlements, are given shelter while being able to practice physical distancing.  As a result, the City has identified two sites in Alexandra to relocate 1 600 citizens to temporary structures in the form of containers.       "They have asked us to give them a few weeks, the contractor is ready to start erecting those sites that people will be moving into so we are looking at a maximum of three to four months," Mabaso said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/city-of-johannesburg-to-relocate-1-600-residents-from-densely-populated-settlement-in-alexandra-20200505
