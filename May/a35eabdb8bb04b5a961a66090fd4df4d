BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga was scheduled to brief Mzansi tonight about tomorrow's plans for Grade 7s and 12s to return to school. But that briefing was cancelled about 30 minutes ago as the Minister is said to be still be in consultations about the readiness of schools tomorrow. The same briefing was postponed during the week and many are now asking what must their kids do tomorrow.   Angie is now scheduled to address the nation tomorrow at 11am. About two weeks ago the Minister announced that Grades 7 and 12 were to return to school tomorrow. On Friday, the Department of Education gazetted the new schedule of the school calendar which outlines that Grade 7 and 12s will return on Monday, followed by other grades from July and August. News24 reports that on Saturday, Motshekga met with unions who are convinced the education system is not ready to resume on Monday. School governing bodies and unions believe it is not in the best interests of children and teachers to return to schools while there is uncertainty about health and safety. They have argued that not all schools have received deliveries of personal protective equipment (PPEs) for pupils and staff, and that many schools have not yet been cleaned or disinfected.
