The number of Covid-19 cases keep increasing drastically and now stand at 6783 with 447 new infections. It's the 4th day of Level four and the numbers will keep increasing as some South Africans are breaking the rules. People were spotted in public places without wearing masks or practicing social distancing.  The EFF commissioner, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the number of infections will keep increasing due to overcrowded public transportation. He recommended that the government fix conditions that could give rise to essentials workers being easy targets. "They will argue that they did not wear masks while they forced them to go to work," said Ndlozi.  Some people agreed with him while others argued that he should come up with more solutions than criticism.   "With all due respect, you're also endorsing panic into those who look up to you. Cases will rise due to an increase in testing, recoveries will increase hope. I understand that you're trying to inform people but please propose solutions as well," Chubby Mauke tweeted.
