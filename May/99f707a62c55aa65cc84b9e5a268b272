DO you know of the story between top DJ Bob Mabena and Doctor "16 Valve" Khumalo back in the 1990s? Well, the two young heart throbs at that time, were riding the wave of successful careers with Khumalo being darling of the Kaizer Chiefs supporters and Mabena the king of the radio airwaves. The duo went into studio and decided to do a music collaboration. The result was that "GET FUNKY" was born and the song became a hit on radio and TV shows. The singing was not that top notch, especially Khumalo's rapping, that left many listeners in stitches, but people did not care and it was a party song in 1994. Khumalo had such a distinguished career at Amakhosi that the club boss Kaizer Motaung retired Khumalo's No 15 jersey after he hung up his boots. "16 Valve" was a dribbling wizard who created a lot of scoring opportunities for his teammates...when he was tired of creating, he would go on score the goals himself. He was also a big star at Bafana Bafana and he scored SA first goal when Mzansi was re-admitted into the world of soccer. Mabena is a legend who carved his niche as a club DJ in the 1990s. He has also worked for various top radio stations and is still a big name even to this day... His collaboration with Khumalo was a winning combination.
