IT'S been a month since Mzansi went under lockdown due to the coronavirus. The small busy town of Isipingo, south of Durban, appears to have paid no attention to this. For the town, it has been business as usual. When the SunTeam visited the town, streets were already packed with people moving up and down, some doing window shopping while others were joining long queues to the local supermarkets. The town used to service townships like Umlazi, Folweni, and Kwamakhutha in the 80s before malls were built in the areas but it seemed as the town managed to keep its customers. It was feared that after big malls mushroomed in surrounding black townships, Isipingo would be a ghost town. Many of the people who spoke to Daily Sun, but asked not to be named, said they came to shop in the supermarkets because it is cheaper than the malls in townships. A 28-year-old woman from Felekisi near Amanzimtoti said she lives next to Galleria Mall but preferred to come to Isipingo because goods are expensive in the malls in townships. KZN government spokesman Lennox Mabaso said the government has noted that areas like Isipingo were not adhering to lockdown rules and regulations. He said police were preparing to raid the town today. “By the end of business today you will know how many people would have been arrested. Just give us a few hours and see,” said Mabaso. There has been concern that many areas under eThekwini Municipality were not adhering to lockdown rules. There have been even suggestions that the city will remain on level 5 while the whole country moves to level 4, but yesterday mayor Mxolisi Kaunda announced that the city will be allowed to move to level 4 with all other areas.
