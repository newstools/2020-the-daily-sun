FUNERAL parlour owners in North West have accused government of failing to educate them on how to handle Covid-19 corpses. Companies are running at a loss after personal protective clothing prices were inflated following the coronavirus. African Funeral Practitioners chairman, Kabelo Maine, said the organisation had approached government for training. “We need training on how to protect ourselves when we handle Covid-19 corpses,” he said. They had written to the provincial health department to be given training on how to handle Covid-19 corpses. STRICT MEASURES FOR FUNERALS AS COVOD-19 PANDEMIC DEEPENS “This virus is dangerous and we find ourselves in a difficult situation. We’re also worried about our workers and their safety,” he said. Gomotsegang Funeral Services owner Diteko Ndimande pays three times the normal price for face masks and sanitisers. He uses sanitisers and protective clothing and cleans the workplace, but because of the virus he spends more. “We’re running at a loss. These things are expensive. We were buying a five-litre sanitiser for R150, and now we’re being charged up to R750 a litre.” Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said government has agreed to work with funeral parlours and will conduct training at government districts. “The department has been receiving requests from various funeral parlours and organisations. We see this initiative as a good idea because we know funeral parlours have a huge challenge at funerals.” Lekgethwane said his department was planning to schedule training that will be advertised in all municipal districts. “We’ll make sure they reach all funeral parlours and individual funeral parlours,” he said.
