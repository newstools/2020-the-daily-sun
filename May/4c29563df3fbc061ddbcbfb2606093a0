LOCKDOWN restrictions haven’t slowed down Miss SA Sasha-Lee Olivier. She connected with her million followers and lent her voice to important causes on social media. Sasha-Lee said she was continuing her #itsnotyourfault campaign, ensuring that people who were sexually assaulted knew they were not to blame for the abuse. “I’m also continuing to raise funds to buy, pack and distribute Rape Comfort Packs.” Last week, she attended an International Nurses Day event with deputy health minister Joe Phaahla and Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku. With Miss SA 2020 being crowned in August, Sasha-Lee urged pageant hopefuls to enter online. “All you need is a thorough knowledge of who you are, what you stand for, a vision for what you would like to do with this title and the courage to pursue it,” she said. Sasha-Lee said the pageant transformed lives and she was proof. “To the women who don’t fit the template placed upon them by a subjective society that dictates narrow standards about what it means to be beautiful, they must see they will always be enough the way they are. Beauty never was a body shape, but what you put out.”
