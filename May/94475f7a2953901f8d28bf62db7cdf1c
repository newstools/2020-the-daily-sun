She also dabbles in production and also as an events manager.Hulisani hosts a show on 94.7. She revealed that she is working on a talk show,  which she’s been pitching since 2014. She said in part: “Still working at pitching the talk show and getting funding for it. I’ve been pitching my talk show since 2014 I think so the year it happens people need to understand like Sade said it takes five years just to get recognised. For some of us the kind of shows we want to do and the ideas that we have, it sometimes takes seven years.” Lara is an actress and is working on her first feature film.
