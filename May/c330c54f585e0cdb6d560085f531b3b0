The South African Police Service has denounced fake
social media accounts claimed to be belonging to the Minister of Police, Bheki
Cele. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the
Minister has no social media account, be it private or official. She said there are more than 160 accounts across Twitter
and Facebook impersonating to be the minister. “Minister Cele has denounced any social media account in
his name as fake and has issued a stern warning to those impostors whose motive
for impersonating the Minister cannot be for anything else but to draw
unsuspecting social media users into their criminal activities,” Peters said. ALSO READ: MAKHIS FIGHT OVER DOG POO! Brigadier Peters said one account has just under 60 000
followers who wrongfully believe that they are following and interacting with
Police Minister. She further said that investigations headed by the Hawks
were at an advanced stage to identify and locate these fake account operators
and bring them to book. “It is on this same principle that some citizens who are
active on social media may want to share similar anonymous tip-offs, only for
such information to fall into the wrong hands of these impostors. “This in itself poses a risk on the personal safety and
the lives of law-abiding citizens whose intention is to work and collaborate
with the police on crime prevention and combating,” Peters added.
