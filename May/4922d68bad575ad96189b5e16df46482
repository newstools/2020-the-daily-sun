MINISTER of Sports, Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa could make an announcement before end of the week with regards to time frames as to when football will be ready to return to action, post the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. A task team, which was established by the Joint Liaison Committee (JLC), comprising SA Football Association (Safa) and the Premier Soccer League (PSL), will table a report for consideration tomorrow for the return of football. Mthethwa tasked Safa and the PSL to speak in one voice and the JLC will report to him on the safety and health measures proposed on how safely football could resume. According to information reaching SunSport, some of the proposals include the travelling of players, training and areas to be sanitised at training and match venues. In his update yesterday, Mthethwa revealed that all contact sport codes can return to training but without any form of competition, while non-contact codes are permitted to compete. Mthethwa is under pressure to come up with a date on when football will return as the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship clubs are awaiting to complete their respective seasons. “Transportation of all athletes, contact or non-contact, should adhere to the national transport health protocol directions,” Mthethwa said. “All sports bodies and professional clubs should develop and implement policies and procedures for workforce contact tracing following employee COVID-19 tests.” In a letter seen by SunSport this week, directed at the National Soccer League members, acting PSL CEO Mato Madlala said an urgent meeting has been set for Tuesday, to update members on what has been resolved by South African football, “as well as the attitude of government to that position”. “It’s crucial that we act responsibly, support efforts of government and none of us seeks to place our own interpretation on what’s permitted under the new regulations until we have clarity,” reads the letter.
