This led to my presentation at the African Union in Addis Ababa where I intended to invite artists in the continent to be part of this initiative. With the lockdown, we are presented with an opportunity to experiment on this format. We are ready to launch, whilst providing relief for our artists to earn income. We also intend to solidify the online platform as an alternative or secondary platform for our artistic offering." On 24 May, they will host Africa Day Celebrations which will be streamed online. Artists like Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Percy Maimela and Ncamisa Nqana will be performing.
