SEE POST: The decision to open up about this part of my life has been a very scary one for me because of how personal and difficult this particular journey has been for me. When I was 11 I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and my world changed forever. Diabetes is a chronic disease and something that diabetics have to navigate and calculate everyday. We have good days and we have bad days. But on top of that we deal with so many stereotypes and misconception that makes us feel uncomfortable and sometimes ashamed of our condition- I often hear people say things like , “only old people have diabetes”, “only overweight people have diabetes” “did you get diabetes from eating too much sugar” - and the answer to all of these questions is no. When I was younger I would avoid telling people about my condition until it was absolutely necessary to avoid judgement which often meant putting my own health at risk. This period of the Covid pandemic has been an incredibly scary time for people living with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes and everyday I wake up and think about all the people across SA who are living with diabetes and aren’t able to isolate or fully protect themselves.
