The government continues to stick to its guns when it comes to alcohol ban during lockdown but some people are trying to get ways to evade the restriction. Cops in Khayelitsha have bust a woman in Harare area for brewing umqombothi and selling it to desperate beer lovers ekasi. Harare SAPS spokesman Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said  cops where on a patrol earlier today when they made the discovery. “Police have today arrested a 51 year old woman for illegal dealing in homemade sorghum beer. At approximately 11:55 police were on patrols when they were notified of illegal activity at 34 block Harare. “On arrival at the premises they encountered a number of people drinking this homemade sorghum. Police confiscated 28 litres of this homemade alcohol and further issued fines for the patrons found on the premises on charges of the disaster management act as they failed to confine themselves in their homes during lockdown,” said Vukubi. Residents from the area told Daily Sun that the lady has been brewing booze since the beginning of lockdown and she is well-known in thearea. “Her house is a go-to area for boozers and she has been making a killing for a while. Lots of people go and buy, the only problem that people make sometimes is to gather and drink outside the house. If she was making takeaways, she wouldn’t be in trouble today,” said a woman from the area. Recently the Western Cape Liquor Authority (WCLA) said they suspended 20 liquor licences after the holders were found to be violation of lockdown regulations.
