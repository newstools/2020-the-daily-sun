TEMPERS ran high this week as former security guards demanded answers over their unpaid salaries. The workers of Matome and Moloto Protection Service, who gathered at Ga-Rankuwa Industrial in Tshwane, said their employer fired them last year and promised to give them their salaries. They said some of them were paid in March and last month, but the rest hadn’t received anything. Edwin Tenese (50) said they’ve been waiting for their November salaries. “We were promised to get paid and had already made plans for the money.” He said when they called management they were told they didn’t know when they’d be paid. “Management said their client hasn’t paid them yet. We’ve been hearing this lie for a long time,” Edwin told Daily Sun. “We don’t have jobs and our children are hungry. We need that money to look for other jobs and to put food on our tables.” Collen Makhubela (33) said if the company didn’t have money, why were they paying some workers. “They should be paying all of us or nobody,” he said. “This is what makes people to protest as we are desperate. “This isn’t money we are borrowing. This is our money.” A representative from the company said the workers would be paid. “We understand their frustrations, but we are not getting paid by our clients, so it’s a problem to pay the workers,” he said. “It’s not that we are not paying them. We are taking money from other projects. “We have been paying them in groups. We’ve assured them they will get paid.”
