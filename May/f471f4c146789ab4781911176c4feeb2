A five-year-old boy from Raphahlelo village in Sekgosese area outside Modjadjiskloof, who travelled with her sister, pushing a wheelbarrow to fetch water on Tuesday afternoon was hit by a bakkie. It is lockdown, children are expected to be home at all times, but not for Raphahlelo villagers who are forced to push wheelbarrows and cross roads for water. The chairman of the local community policing forum, Pheko Baloyi said it was on Tuesday afternoon when the child and sister went to fetch water. On their way back home, crossing the road, a local bakkie hit the boy. "We reported the case to the Sekgosese police, and the child was transported to Kgapane Hospital," said Baloyi. Baloyi added that the car that hit the boy is not roadworthy and had tyres with exposed wires. Baloyi confirmed there's no water in the village and never received the recently distributed water tanks by the Mopani District Municipality. He said some buy water for R2 per 25 litres but to those that don't have money to buy from nearby water sellers, travels extra trips to fetch free water, crossing tar road to a local non-profit organisation. The Limpopo provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the police have registered the case but are still investigating. The Mopani District Municipality spokesman Odas Ngobeni said the district only received 115 from the 177 they had requested from the Department. "We had to distribute informed by the need of each community. "However, we have a water tanker schedule developed by local municipalities in consultation with ward councilors," he said.  "The reported incident of the child hit by a car has not been brought to our attention or that of the ward councilor by anyone in that ward," said Ngobeni.
