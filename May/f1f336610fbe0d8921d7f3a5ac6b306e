Madala Charlton Rayi (81) from Mfuleni says his dogs protect him from being infected with coronavirus. This is so because he doesn’t have surprise and uninvited visitors who may bring coronavirus into his house. Speaking to SunTeam, madala Rayi said despite being instructed by the government to stay indoors, some people continue loitering in the streets and paying unnecessary visits to peoples’ houses. “My dogs protect me from possible carriers of the virus, nobody can just budge into my house and say I’m visiting you madala, even if you ran out of salt, you will have to stand outside my yard and call me out. If it was not for my dogs, people would probably have been getting in and out of my house,” he added. Madala Rayi said the issue of coronavirus is scary especially to old people and he never knew that his dogs would play such a huge role. “When a person knocks at your door sometimes, they are close to you and you cannot say go away because there is coronavirus, but my dogs do that job for me,” he added. Resident from the area Yoliswa Dumezulu (44) said madala’s house is a no-go-area if you don’t tell him over the phone that you are visiting him. “You will have to tell him that you are visiting his house, if you don’t do so you will definitely be welcomed by his vicious dogs at his gate,” she said. Madala Rayi originally from Lady Frere in the Eastern Cape said he was born, grew up and may even die amongst dogs. His father was a hunter so he knew dogs all his life and life without one is meaningless. “I cannot imagine a life without a dog because for all my 81 years on earth, there were dogs around me,” Madala added. Currently madala has four adult dogs and 14 puppies from two of his dogs that gave birth at the same time. The names of the dogs are Snowy, Vaseline, Rex and Beauty.
