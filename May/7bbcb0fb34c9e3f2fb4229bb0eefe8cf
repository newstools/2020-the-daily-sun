SAMPLES from human remains that were found in a Tongaat River have been taken in order to determine if they belong to a missing teenager Andile Mbuthu. Earlier today police questioned six men in connection with the teenager's disappearance. Their investigation led to the river where a gruesome discovery was made. Andile (16) from Hambanathi area in Tongaat north of Durban, a grade 12 pupil was allegedly kidnapped while walking with his cousin on 28 April. Later his family was informed that he was being beaten at the tavern and when they went to find out at the tavern they were told that he had escaped. On Tuesday a video of the teenager emerged on Facebook. In the video he was seen lying in an empty room with blood on the floor, badly assaulted. However, the search for the teenager began until cops found the human remains today (Friday). Andile's aunt, Zodwa Jali (39) said:" DNA samples have been taken in order to determine if the human remains that were found in the river are of Andile or not." She said there is nothing they we can do or say right now but to wait. "Police have told us to wait for the DNA results and we will do just that," she said. The KZN cops spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said detectives from the provincial administrator's office have been investigating a missing person's docket after the teenager's family approached the commissioner's office with their concerns. He said they have been working on an investigation and yesterday (Thursday) they took six suspects in for questioning in connecting to the teenager's kidnapping.
