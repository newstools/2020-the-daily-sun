AmaZulu have confirmed that club legend Cedric 'Sugar Ray' Xulu passed away in Pinetown on Monday evening. He was 81. The Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Clermont, just outside Durban, is named after him and AmaZulu have often played home games there over the years. The club confirmed Xulu's passing via their official Twitter account on Monday evening with reports that followed suggesting he had been battling cancer. "It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Sugar Ray Xulu, an AmaZulu legend," the statement read. "Our condolences go out to all his friends and family during this tragic time." Xulu was considered one of South Africa's best players during his era. AmaZulu, meanwhile, are currently in 15th place on the PSL log with six matches remaining in the 2019/20 season. There is no indication when, or indeed if, the season will resume as the fight against the coronavirus continues. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
