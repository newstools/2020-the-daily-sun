FATHERS are known to distance themselves from the responsibility to take care of their kids. This leads to mothers assuming responsibility for raising kids single-handedly. Now, the fathers are at home due to the lockdown, it should be their turn to help feed the kids, play with them and teach them good manners. Remember, women take good care of kids while also ensuring the house is clean and breakfast, lunch and supper are served. The stage is set for men to share household responsibilities and interacting with children. Children have interesting questions to ask, and parents should answer them honestly and openly. You can’t raise your children well, unless you know them. The more fathers interact with their kids, the more they feel free around them and share their talents, expectations and challenges with them. We may be experiencing financial challenges at the moment, which is sad. But we must also spot the silver lining in the cloud – in terms of lockdown. We understand the situation we find ourselves in better and therefore should explain it in detail to our children. Mothers can do with the help of fathers or adult uncles to convey the message to kids and comfort them. Give children the assurance that although things are bad for now, they’ll get back on track soon.
