MUSICIAN Thapelo Mabotja’s name is slowly gaining recognition. The 26-year-old, who’s better known as Swagger, believes his hustle is the reason behind his success. The musician from Ga-Malebogo in Senwabarwana, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, released his first music videorecently. It’s for the song Bophelo Bo Boima. The hip hop and R&B artist told SunBuzz he developed an interest in music in 2007. In 2016 he founded Gatela Pele Music Production, a record company. The video demonstrates people’s struggles. Swagger told SunBuzz: “It shows how people move from one province to another looking for work and end up on the streets. “I compiled the content for the video after learning that people were going through a lot.” Swagger said the existence of struggle can easily turn one into nothing in society’s eyes. He called for teamwork among Limpopo artists. “It’s crucial that we work as a team to ensure we put our province on the map and make it shine,” he said.
