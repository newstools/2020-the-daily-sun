Famous for her controversial way of doing things, Zodwa Wabantu sure is on her way to building an empire for herself. From launching a perfume range Touchable Day and Touchable Night last year to now hinting at an entire beauty collection, we cannot wait see what Zodwa has in store for us. The dancer took to social media to share that she’s expanding her beauty line with the release of lipstick and petroleum jelly. “Ladies, are you ready for my Zodwa Wabantu Lipstick??& Zodwa Wabantu Petroleum jelly. It’s coming,” she said in her post. The new products are not yet on the market for sale but you can still purchase her perfume collection online. Speaking to Daily Sun, Zodwa said that the products were still in production process in China. "They are still being manufactured in China. They will be shipped here soon. But I'll also be adding more products. Soon, there'll be a mascara, blush, body shimmering lotion and normal body lotion, basically everything for skin and beauty," said Zodwa. She also shared that with the current pandemic, her other income revenues are stuck so she decided to start working on her products because China is back to working.
