TWO weekends ago, an episode of Mzansi Magic’s Seng’khathele saw Tumelo Mngomezulu dumping the mother of his child Gugu after coming out as gay. But in a shocking turn of events, Tumelo posted on his Facebook page it was all lies! He said he appeared on the show to promote his production company, Young Mind Motivation Production. Social media users were shocked when he made the claims in a number of posts. But when the SunTeam approached him, Tumelo said he was actually lying on Facebook because people were judging him. “I’m gay, but people where I live in Orange Farm in Joburg were laughing at me because of the show. Otherwise, I’m gay and I’m breaking up with Gugu,” he said. Tumelo earlier claimed Gugu was an actress with his production company. “Gugu and I were really together and broke up after the show. Everything on the show was true. “I apologise for lying and I’m ready to tell the truth now. I’m gay and proud.” Tumelo said he didn’t realise lying on Facebook would land him in hot water. “The people from the show contacted me and told me to release an apology letter, which I did,” said Tumelo. “They also said they’ll launch an investigation and that they might open charges against me.” Mzansi Magic spokeswoman Philly Khubeka said the show didn’t hire actors. “Mzansi Magic and the producers of Seng’khathele don’t hire actors for the reality show. People are interviewed on the basis that their stories are real-life situations,” she said. LGBTQI+ activist and socialite Yaya Mavundla said action must be taken. “This is totally absurd and antagonising. This is a very sensitive topic and we can’t accept people trying to capitalise on LGBTQI+ community struggles and the progress it has made in fighting the social backlash it received for many years. “If this was meant for him to gain publicity and promote his company, then some very stringent action should be taken.” Yaya said if anything, Tumelo ruined things for people who want to come out to their families.
