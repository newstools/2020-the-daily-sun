Mlungus are battling over whose Zulu is the best. They've been sharing videos on Twitter showing off their Zulu language speaking skills. All this comes after a live Instagram video of DJ Tira and a young white guy who claimed to be the king of white people. He calls himself Mehlemamba Ngidi. He even gloated about the fact that he has Isphandla. Other Mlungus didn't take this very well, they started sending videos of themselves speaking IsiZulu and corrected the young man. Some criticised him stating that his Zulu is even half cooked. Another one even showed off his clan names.   Mzansi is having a feast, enjoying this battle over the best Zulu speaking Whites. "As much as this appears to be funny, I'm happy with how this country is becoming a rainbow nation. Even though others are still getting arrested for calling some people with the K word, we're really progressing," Loyd Zizwe tweeted.  "This is really hilarious but I'm mostly surprised by the amount of people who speak Zulu so fluently. I never thought so many whites knew Zulu. I'm happy with the progress we're making as a country. This Lockdown is revealing shocking things," said Sizakele Mcunu.
