NETBALL SA (NSA) president Cecilia Molokwane has urged Mzansi netball players not to take their eyes off their stomachs. The hard-working netball administrator and retired player warned that NSA will organise trials to gauge and select fit players across the country. Molokwane’s message is simple, don’t gain excess weight when sports returns. “I’ve warned the players that we will organise trials and if you come back overweight you will be in trouble,” Molokwane said. “I doubt that anyone wants to be out. I believe that all the players will come back fit.” Proteas coaches – Dorette Badenhorst and Dumisani Chauke – have given players programmes to follow during the national lockdown. Chauke also posts her training videos on social media every week so that all netball players can use them to stay fit. “Netball is a simple sport. You can train easily on your own with the ball. You just need the ball and aim for the target,” warned Molokwane. Molokwane stressed that with South Africa set to host the 2023 International Netball Federation (INF) World Cup in Cape Town, players must always increase their appetite for the game. She said the sport is on the right track and that her biggest wish is that schools, universities and districts can step up their game and start to invest a lot in netball. “The federation is here to support everyone and all that we need from them is that they must always keep fit and work hard. Regular training is a must even if you are at home. Let’s dream about the World Cup on home soil together and make it happen,” said Molokwane.
