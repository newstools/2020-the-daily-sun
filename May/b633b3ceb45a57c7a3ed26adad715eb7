THE woman (39) has two kids aged 18 and 10 and doesn’t want more! Her pastor hubby keeps pleading that they try for another child. When she heard he’d been spotted sneaking into a sangoma’s indumba, she knew something was wrong. The woman from Emaphuphweni in Ekurhuleni, said he then suggested she see a therapist after she had a miscarriage recently. “I’m dealing with the loss in my own way. He must respect that.” She said he’s so obsessed with making another baby that, now that it’s lockdown, he keeps pestering her to break open the pearly gates. 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUNANIS “I was angry. We’d already spoken about this. I’m on birth control.” But the man of God wouldn’t take no for an answer. He apparently went to see a doctor on Monday and insisted she stay behind. “I knew something was wrong,” said the woman. A friend saw him going into an indumba later that day. “He’s not a big muthi fan. I never thought he’d go as far as seeing a sangoma,” she said. He was carrying a black plastic bag when he returned. On Tuesday, while rummaging around, she found imbiza and muthi in the bag. “I confronted him. He said it’s corona medication,” she said. But her own private sangoma confirmed her worst suspicions: the muthi was for making her pregnant! “I was furious. We had sex that Monday,” she said.  “He was told to sprinkle some in my food and drink imbiza before poking.” The pastor (42) said: “What if God decides I can no longer have kids? It’s God’s will if she falls pregnant.” Mayehlentabeni Ntshangase, the pastor’s sangoma, was shocked when the wife stormed into his indumba. “He told me it’s what they both wanted. I gave him imbiza and mahlabekseni,” said Mayehlentabeni. Mahlabekseni means “morning glory” in Zulu.
