Andrea Ivanova is on a mission to have the biggest lips in the world. The 22-year-old Andrea has had her 20th round of lip injections in a bid to super-size her pout.  ???????? A post shared by  Andrea Ivanova (@andrea.andrea345) on May 3, 2020 at 10:34am PDT  Andrea’s goal of having the biggest lips in the world does have some difficulties as she has had plenty of injections. “It was hard to eat after the injection and two to three days after the procedure gets more difficult,” she said. "I feel great to have even more but some doctors think it's enough, though I still want them bigger. My doctor said he will do more injections for me but said I have to wait for at least two months. "There are no restrictions to what I can eat. I think my lips are lovely, I love them. I am not sure if they are the biggest lips in the world but they are one of the biggest, I think," she added.  Andrea has faced a lot of backlash on social media but says that there are more people who admire her lips. "There are people who like me with bigger lips and there are people who like me with smaller lips but it doesn't matter to me because it's important for me, how I like it. Other people's opinion is irrelevant," she says.
