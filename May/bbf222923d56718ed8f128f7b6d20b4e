SIPHELELE Ntshangase’s manager Jazzman Mahlakgane says he has no idea what the future holds for his client at Kaizer Chiefs when the  Absa Premiership resumes. Mahlakgane revealed that with football in South Africa suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it makes predicting what lies in store for the midfielder difficult to work out. Ntshangase faces a bleak future at Chiefs as his contract with the Absa Premiership leaders expires at the end of this suspended campaign. What makes it worse for Ntshangase is that he has yet to feature for the club this season and Chiefs are yet to indicate whether they’ll renew his contract or not. “I don’t know what is going to happen. I don’t even know if league football will be played in this country,” said Mahlakgane. The 26-year-old Ntshangase joined Chiefs from Baroka FC in the second half of the 2017-18 season on a two-and-half-year deal along with Leonardo Castro. Amakhosi showed a lot of faith in him and gave him the coveted number 10 jersey while Castro, who joined from Mamelodi Sundowns, has fared better. Ntshangase has not lived up to the expectation the club had for him. The Pongola-born midfielder has not played for Chiefs in the club’s last 30 fixtures. He last played for Chiefs on 27 April last year when he came on as a substitute in Amakhosi’s 1-0 loss to Bloemfontein Celtic at Peter Mokaba Stadium. But Mahlakgane says the former SA Under-23 international will rise again and prove doubters wrong when football returns. “I do man-management on my players. I make my players understand that football is not predictable,” said Mahlakgane who also manages Themba Zwane of Sundowns. “He has put the past behind him and started working very hard to get back into the team. People will soon talk to me about him differently.”
