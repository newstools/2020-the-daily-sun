All Zodwa Mathibela wanted after completing her matric was to study and become a social worker. But her dream faded when she became blind. She used to suffer from headaches while still in high school until she got blind. Despite her condition, Zodwa still finds time to help other people in need. The 47-year-old handed over warm clothes and food parcels to 21 disadvantaged families in her community on Tuesday. She said the little she gave to the needy would help them make it through lockdown. Zodwa from Zakheni Village near KwaMhlanga said she gave back every year. She said she had turned her home into a drop-in centre where poor kids get food to eat every day after school. She also owns Phumelele Children’s Home, which she runs from her home. “After I became blind, I realised I could no longer study further. But as time went on, I had to pick up the pieces and help needy people in my community. Every year I give food parcels and clothes to poor people. I was born with a good heart to give. I always feel good whenever I have done something to help people,” she said. “I spend most of my time going around asking for donations from businesspeople and churches. I also ask for clothes and food from Good Samaritans so I can help the needy. That’s how I practise social work. I didn’t want my blindness to hold me back.” Wheelchair-bound Petros Songo (68) said Zodwa was a godsend and he’s happy he’ll have something to eat with his family. Emma Mtsweni (44) said: “The little we get does not last us for two weeks. Zodwa has become our saviour and has come to our rescue. I am very happy and this is for the second time I get food and clothes from her,” she said. Community leader Simon Sello said what Zodwa was doing is extraordinary. He said he wished more people could follow in her footsteps and help people in their communities.
