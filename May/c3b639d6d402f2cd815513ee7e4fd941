PHILANI Zulu’s future at Kaizer Chiefs is uncertain. Zulu’s agent Saheed Adebayo is also in the dark whether the club will retain the Pietermaritzburg-born versatile player who is yet to feature for the PSL log leaders this season. “At this point in time, I don’t know what is going to happen with Zulu at Chiefs since the league was suspended,” said Adebayo. “Bobby Motaung (Chief football manager) has not mentioned anything to me if the club will renew his contract. But I think things will become clearer when the season resumes.” The 27-year-old Zulu joined Chiefs from Maritzburg United in 2017 season and has barely played, recording three league matches this season before lockdown. Other players at the Absa Premiership log leaders whose future is up in the air at Chiefs comprise Joseph Molangoane, Siphelele Ntshangase, Brylon Petersen and Leonardo Castro. Midfielder George Maluleka, who was in the same position as these players, turned the club’s offer down and is movin to Mamelodi Sundowns at the end of the season.
