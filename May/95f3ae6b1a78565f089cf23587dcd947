 “IT is not an easy decision to take a break from something that has been close to your heart for many years.” That is according to DJ Joy Morales (38), who has decided to use the Covid-19 lockdown as the right time to take a break from being a DJ. The DJ, whose real name is Thabo Morudu from Soshanguve, Tshwane, announced he was taking a break after 20 years' deejaying. He said he would be focusing on his Soul4Real Records. "I'm using the lockdown as an opportunity to take a break and put more energy on my music label which I started four years ago. The journey has been tough with a lot of challenges,” he said.

"Now I'm glad I will use my experience to build my music empire and help young artists realise their  dream." He said it's bad to be overlooked on something you were giving your all to but that has built his character. "I'm not taking a break because of fearing competition. I'm ready to compete with the big boys in the industry and take my artists to another level. I will always be behind the scenes, unlike before when I was with the crowds." Joy Morales said being a professional DJ was cool and you could make a lot of money if you press the right buttons. He decided to move to Midrand in Joburg in October so he could be closer to the market and has since signed six artists under his label. "I will miss my kasi and fans who have been there for me in good and bad times."He said Soshanguve would always be in his heart and he would always visit when he had time. The artists in his stable are Dineo "Abileash" Mokoena, Penelope  "DJ Miz-Dee" Dhlamini, Hendry "DJ Rendy" Shipalane, Kenneth "Ken-i" Chauke and Khosi "King P" Prince, who will be his focus going forward.
