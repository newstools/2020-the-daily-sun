LABOUR and Employment Minister Thulas Nxesi is worried about looming job cuts. Nxesi told the portfolio committee on employment and labour that there were going to be budget cuts across the department as they would be forced to do a balancing act. UIF would have to sustain people who lost jobs due to the coronavirus. READ: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEETING DISRUPTED BY PORN! “It’s going to be worse. There’s going to be cuts all around. “Where do you think the R500 billion comes from? “Obviously, the budget was done before the coronavirus and the plans were before the pandemic.” Nxesi said mass retrenchments would result from the outbreak and government would have to come to the party. “What’s very clear is that the state will have to come to the centre and deal with this issue. And to deal with this is mass employment,” he said. “The strategy will be to help out and formalise what we call public employment. “We have to formalise a lot of public employment programmes, and these have to be labour intensive. We can’t put everything to tender all the time.” Nxesi said Mzansi might have to ramp up its infrastructure, both hard and soft, to help create jobs. He said the country was still behind in the building of roads and dams, and this would have to beramped up and formalised so people could get jobs instead of putting projects to tender. “So if we’re to ramp that up we might be able to create jobs in some industries,” he said. The department was speeding up employment policy and migration to prioritise locals.
