ACTOR Luthuli Dlamini has started a community newspaper. Best known for roles on soapies such as Generations, Uzalo and Zabalaza, the actor has co-founded NTU News with his business partner Nolubabalo Mcinga. The newspaper will officially be launched today and will be distributed around the Amathole District in Eastern Cape. Speaking to Daily Sun, Luthuli said they came up with the idea of starting a newspaper to help people living in rural areas. “We wanted to make sure everyone in the rural areas of Amathole, which is where we are based, gets important information,” he said.  “It’s no secret that people in rural areas have little to no access to phones, TVs or even WiFi.  Asked why they had chosen to start a newspaper with the coronavirus lockdown leading to a number of print publications going under, Luthuli said: “We did that on purpose. We want to show people that the virus should not stop their lives. The newspaper will also be a vehicle for communication where people can be educated about the virus.”
