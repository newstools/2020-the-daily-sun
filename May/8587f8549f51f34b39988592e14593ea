THE government has allowed people who were stuck in other provinces during lockdown to go back to their homes. Magoshas are excited about the seven-day travelling period as there’ll be many more cars on the roads. The SunTeam visited some magoshas in Mangaung, Free State, on Monday. They said they had made more money in the past three days than they had since lockdown started in March. They told Daily Sun their customers, who had been stuck in their homes with no permits to move around, told them they had missed their punanis. A magosha said: “I’ve been struggling to make the money I used to make per day. My average daily turnover had been R250 but since lockdown, I had been taking less than R100 home. I was happy when the government said any person who was not at their place of residence or work before lockdown period, and who couldn’t travel between provinces during lockdown, will be permitted to return to their places of residence or work until the end of level 4.” She said her customers had taken the opportunity to use her services. “On 1 May, I went home with R350 and the following day I made R450.” Another magosha said this showed that men had been hungry and thirsty for their punanis. “I wish you could have been here on Friday to see for yourself. There were lot of cars. Some even waited for me when I was out with another client. I wish life could be like this for me every day. This shows that indeed we’re essential workers.” Another magosha urged other men to use their services. “We know that some men have been stuck in their homes with their wives and girlfriend. We know they’ve been craving for something different. I say they should come before the travel period expires. I promise them a good and longer time of pleasure. I want them to come in their numbers before 7 May because after that, it’s not going be easy again,” she said.
