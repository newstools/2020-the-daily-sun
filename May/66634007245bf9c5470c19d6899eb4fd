LINDIWE Sisulu has appointed corruption buster Advocate Terry Motau to lead a team of lawyers that will review fraud, corruption and irregular expenditure reports in her department. The minister said many officials implicated in corruption remained at work or were suspended with pay. READ: THE 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUNANIS! Said Sisulu yesterday: “I directed Motau that I want all reports on fraud, corruption and irregular expenditure, all water boards to be reviewed, and all recommendations implemented. “Officials and service providers involved in corruption must face the consequences.” She said priority must be given to all claims facing water boards and senior managers. “I received a report that over R16 billion worth of projects have been issued irregularly, including blanket corruption and fraud by officials awarding tenders to themselves and close relatives. This will not happen on my watch,” she said. Motau has in the past been involved in high-profile investigations focusing on corruption and looting at VBS Bank in Limpopo. Last week, Sisulu placed Amatola Water Board under administration, citing infighting.
