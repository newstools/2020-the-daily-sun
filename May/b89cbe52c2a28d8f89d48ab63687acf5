A 25-year-old Philippi was killed on Thursday afternoon over his phone. Thugs robbed him of his phone, but they also ended up robbing him of his life as well. Residents in Tywaka street in Browns Farm in Philippi said thugs who were fleeing after robbing a saloon in the area stopped their getaway car after they saw a man who was walking alone. They wanted his phone and he refused but he ended up paying with his life. “They had just robbed a local saloon and fleeing when they saw the man who was holding a phone in his hand and when they tried to rob him of the phone he resisted. A scuffle ensured then one of the thugs shot him and they then ran to their getaway car and drove off at high speed,” said Nomawethu Nyembesi. Onlookers then rushed to try and assist the man but he fell down and died on the scene. Cops spokesman Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident: “A 25-year-old man was shot and killed on Tywaka Road Browns Farm by unknown suspects who are yet to be arrested. The circumstances are being investigated.” A witness Zola Mangwanise (37) said the deceased should have just let them take away the phone. “They wanted his phone and he should have let them take it the moment he saw that they have a gun. Sometimes it’s not worth it to lose your life over a phone. Thugs don’t care they are heartless they will kill you and to them you are nothing,” said Mangwanise.
