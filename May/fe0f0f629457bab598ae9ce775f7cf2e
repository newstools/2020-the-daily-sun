ALL Jimmy Motsweni wanted was to get water for his kasi. But his kind actions almost cost him his life! READ: THE 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUNANIS! The 47-year-old from Bhubesini squatter camp in Ekangala, Tshwane, was beaten to a pulp by men who accused him of disturbing their plans. Jimmy said the kasi had been getting water from JoJo tanks but they were not filled last Tuesday. After a few days without water, he decided to investigate. “I called the company that delivers our water and they told me they were told by some residents to stop. I told them to come and deliver because whoever told them they shouldn’t was lying,” he said. He said on Sunday the water truck came but the driver asked for a police escort. Jimmy called the cops and they came, but they had to leave to respond to an emergency. “As soon as they left us, a group of men approached and asked the truck driver why he came after being told not to deliver water any more. When I tried to explain, they grabbed me and began to beat me up,” he said. Jimmy said while they were busy assaulting him, they kept saying he was causing trouble for them. When they were done, they left him bleeding on the ground. “I don’t know why they assaulted me. All I wanted was to help the residents get water,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of assault was opened. “No arrests have been made, and the investigation is continuing.”
