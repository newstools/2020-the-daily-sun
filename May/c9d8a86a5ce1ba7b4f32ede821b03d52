South Africa
has recorded 12 new fatalities, taking the Covid-19 death toll to 206, Health
Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Monday. The North West recorded its first
death, the Western Cape 8 new deaths, Eastern Cape 2 new deaths and one
fatality in KwaZulu-Natal. There have been 637 new
infections, taking the total positive cases to 10 652. The total recoveries are 4
357. Cuban doctors The Cuban doctors who came to
South Africa to help fight the coronavirus have been in isolation and are
expected to begin their work "in the next few days," said Mkhize. "We are not aware if they
have been tested positive," he added. They will be deployed to the
hotspots, including metropolitans in the Western and Eastern Cape. Hotspots will also have a team of
healthcare workers who will be permanently stationed there. The Eastern and Western Cape will
need particular expertise, particularly on the community side of infections
says Mkhize and the Cuban doctors will come with that. There is a concern of the rapid
spread of the virus in the province, and as a result, 800 additional nurses are
also stationed there. President Cyril Ramaphosa is also
expected to visit the Eastern Cape later in the week.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/coronavirus-all-the-latest-news-about-covid-19-in-south-africa-and-the-world-20200312
