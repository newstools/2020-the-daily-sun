POLICE were out in full force on Saturday looking for people violating lockdown regulations. The operation saw a number of people being arrested for various offences in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. It was led by Gauteng Community safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela. Cops seized drugs and fraudulent documents. People found on the streets without permits were arrested, as well as motorists without valid driver’s licences. A butchery selling rotten meat was shut down. Three suspects who were allegedly on their way to commit a business robbery were arrested. This was after cops followed them and found four firearms in their possession. The cops, who were accompanied by soldiers, also encouraged people around the Kempton Park CBD and the taxi rank to stay at home. They handed out pamphlets about ways to curb the spread of Covid-19. Mawela said foot patrols produced good results compared to officers patrolling in police cars. He said they were able to reach corners they could have easily missed should they’ve been in cars. “Foot patrolling brings us closer to the people as we see exactly what’s happening. “This is our new way of policing,” said Mawela.
