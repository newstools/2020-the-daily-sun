A notorious alleged cash-in-transit robber will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Thursday to hear judgment on his bail application. Provincial Hawks spokesperson, Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Elvis Press Makhubela (41) was arrested early in March this year following an investigation by the Hawks. Makhubela was linked to at least two cash-in-transit robberies which took place in the Sabie and Nelspruit areas of Mpumalanga during 2017 and 2018 respectively. “The accused made court appearances in March 20,31st and his bail application which was vehemently opposed by the investigators was heard last week Monday,” Ramovha said. Makhubela was allegedly part of a heavily armed group that attacked an armoured cash vehicle enroute to Marble Hall.

Makhubela is also scheduled to attend trial in October this year in the Graskop High Court for the matter that he was granted bail for. Ramovha said Makhubela is to appear alongside his 47-year-old accomplice, Lehlohonolo Tleketle who is already serving an effective 30-year jail term for CIT robberies. “The investigators continue to probe Makhubela’s involvement in other related incidents across provinces.  More arrests are expected as investigations continue,” said Ramovha.
