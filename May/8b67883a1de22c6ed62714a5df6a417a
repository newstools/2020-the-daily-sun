TSHAKHUMA TSHA MADZIVHANDILA owner, Masala Mulaudzi, is on the verge of buying an Absa Premiership team. SunSport has reliably learnt that the GladAfrica Championship side owner is busy negotiating with the financially struggling Bloemfontein Celtic. Bidvest Wits’ name has also been bandied about. “All I can say now is we’re at an advanced stage to finalise the deal,” said Mulaudzi. “Unfortunately, I can’t reveal the name of the teams as the deal is not signed yet. But we’re left with 10% to seal everything. For now everything’s going well and we’ll make an announcement in two weeks’ time.” When pushed if it’s Phunya Sele Sele or The Clever Boys, Mulaudzi said: “I’m sorry, I can’t mention the names as it’ll be unprofessional. All I can say is I’m very close to owning a PSL team next season, which will be based in Venda. We’ll have two PSL teams if Black Leopards survive relegation. The team we’re talking with is inland-based.” Celtic CEO, Khumbulani Konco, told SunSport he didn’t know anything about Phunya Sele Sele being on sale. “Celtic isn’t on sale,” said Konco. “This is the same thing when TS Galaxy owner Tim Sukazi was heard on radio saying he wanted to buy PSL team and people just assumed it was Celtic. To be honest, we’re not in negotiations with anyone buying Celtic.” Meanwhile, Mulaudzi also confirmed Tshakhuma is on sale and has already received two offers. “I know we’re in a good position in the Championship log to fight for play-offs spot. “But I can’t own two teams. I’m selling Tshakhuma and have received two offers, one is from Limpopo and the other from Mpumalanga. We’re busy negotiating with them. My goal is to see another Venda team in the PSL next season. So, everything will be clear in the next two weeks.” Mulaudzi bought Tshakhuma in 2017 from Cape Town-based side Milano United FC.
