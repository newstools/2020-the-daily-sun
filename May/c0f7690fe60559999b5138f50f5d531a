Rapper Big Zulu says he is happy with his latest release,
the AmaMillion Remix which features Kwesta, YoungstaCPT, MusiholiQ, and Zakwe. The video was released on YouTube four days ago and it is
already seating at 80 000 views. When the video was filmed in March, it ended with a lot of
drama. The day ended up with bullets flying. The drama happened in Westbury, Joburg. Syabonga “Big Zulu” Nene, Senzo “Kwesta” Vilakazi, Ntokozo
Zakwe, Michael “Stilo Magolide” Chirwa, and Riyadh “YoungstaCPT” Roberts
narrowly escaped death. Their cars were stoned after there was a shooting. The rappers told Daily Sun that things took a nasty turn
when they flashed some money as part of the shoot. Some people allegedly grabbed the money and ran away. When
the crew chased after them and demanded the money back, they were allegedly
threatened with knives. It was alleged that when the rappers were leaving, some
residents tried to rob them and that’s when bullets were fired.  According to the rappers, no one was hurt as the bullets
were fired in the air but some residents of Westbury alleged that two people were
injured. Even so, the video has come out and many people are loving
the Westbury part of it. They say it is dope.
