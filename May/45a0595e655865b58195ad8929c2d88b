A 35-year-old Mpumalanga man is expected to appear before
the Witbank Magistrates Court on Monday in connection with the murder of her
25-year-old girlfriend. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier
Leonard Hlathi, the incident took place on Saturday (16 May) at Vosman. Hlathi said an argument broke out between the couple,
then moments later, the man allegedly assaulted and strangled the woman. "Upon hearing the commotion, the suspect's uncle who
resides in the same yard rushed to their room with an intention to intervene
but found the woman lying motionless. He then alerted the neighbours who in
turn notified police and medical personnel," he said. He said the woman was certified dead at the scene and
police immediately arrested the man for murder. Meanwhile on Thursday evening an 18- year- old woman was
allegedly raped by a 31-year - old man believed to be her friend. The incident
also took place at Vosman. Hlathi said reports indicate that an argument broke out
between the two where the man then apparently assaulted as well as raped the
woman. “The matter was reported to the police who opened a case
of rape. The suspect has since been arrested and is also expected to appear at
the same court tomorrow,” said Hlathi. Mpumalanga police boss, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma
has once again called on the public to stand up against Gender-Based-Violence. He said it seems as if the plight of women is rapidly
increasing regardless of the efforts made by government to curb the scourge. "Our courts continue to impose harsher sentences but
despite this, perpetrators of Gender-Based-Violence, continue to prey on
vulnerable women and children. This situation cannot continue like this and it
shows an underlying problem of moral decay in our society," he said.
