Mamelodi Sundowns winger Ali Jose Meza says he is making the most of the current lockdown period while juggling some serious babysitting duties. The 29-year-old player, recently became a father for the first time. During this lockdown, he says he has been training from home and spending most of his time baby sitting. “I am enjoying this time with my son and wife, but I am training hard, I am itching to get back, Meza told Sundowns website.”“I train with the club over Zoom, then I go for a run around my complex and put some time on my legs. I also have some weights and balls so I set up my station at home and get to work.”The winger barely has enough time these days with some serious multi-tasking going on across the Meza household.“I don’t think I have ever juggled this many tasks before, I wake up 7am and have breakfast with my family. My wife is currently studying Finance, so I help out with babysitting duties while she gets to work. I then train with the team from 10:00 – 11.30 / 12:00. I am then back on babysitting duties while my wife prepares lunch for us. My son then falls asleep at 13:00 and then I hit the books. The Venezuelan player, who joined Masandawana from Bolivian club Club Deportivo Oriente Petrolero in 2018, is busy learning English. He added: "I am studying English online, so I do that from 13:00 – 15:30. Then we are back on duty with my son, Gael-Ali until he falls asleep at 22:00.”Meza then joins his friends, Gaston and Mauricio online as the three of them play PlayStation into the early morning.“I am currently hooked on Fortnite – I link up with Mauricio & Gaston and we play all night.”The Venezuelan finished by sharing a common sentiment, “everyone is missing the rhythm of football. The league should give us a week or 2 to get into tone. To complete the 8 remaining games.”
