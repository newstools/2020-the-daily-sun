Lingelethu cop shop in Khayelitsha
has been closed down over positive coronavirus case at the station. The station joins the long list of other
stations that were closed recently due to coronavirus in the province. For the past two months about nine
cop shops in the province had to be shutdown temporarily for decontamination
due to the virus. Speaking to Daily Sun, Brigadier
Novela Potelwa said the cop shop has been closed and services have moved to a
nearby facility and residents can still get help from cops. “Lingelethu West in
Khayelitsha has relocated operations of its community service centre to the
Khayelitsha resource centre across the road from the station due to a COVID-19
related case. The relocation is affected to allow the decontamination of the
facility in line with the COVID-19 protocols. It is also to ensure that service
delivery continues, the number, for those who wish to contact the police station
is 079 880 9894,” she said. The Brigadier said cops who have had
contact with the positive cop will be quarantined. “Police members who have been in contact with
the infected case are quarantined and are undergoing the necessary screening
and testing,” she added. Cop shops that were closed recently
includes Milnerton, Wynberg, Langa, Bredasdorp,  Struisbaai, Cape Town
Central, Philippi East, Athlone and Hermanus. Last week
minister of Police Bheki Cele said the country has 253 cops who tested positive
of coronavirus with 178 of the total number are from Western Cape. President Cyril Ramaphosa is
expected to visit the province this week where he will meet the provincial leadership
to discuss about the pandemic.
