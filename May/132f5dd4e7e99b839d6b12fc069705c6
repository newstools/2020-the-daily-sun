Football supporter are always keen to know everything when it comes to their favourite players. And apart from following their every move on social media, there isn’t much else they can do to get close to their stars. They rarely get the opportunity to get to know the stars they idolise better off the pitch. But Mamelodi Sundowns have made it easier for their supporters to get to know their stars better. The club have released a video of versatile player Lyle Lakay answering some of the question any fans would love to ask him. Lakay, who has been enjoying some free time to spend with family and doing some of his hobbies during lockdown, gave fans some access to his lifestyle. The speedster answered questions about what he does for fun, his best moment with Downs and more. “I don’t think our scheduled allows any of us to have a hobby. I had one before, but whenever we do get free time I prefer to relax at home and watch Netflix and now and then go for a walk,” said Lakay. About his best moment with Downs, he said: “My highlight of last year has to be winning the league it was my first league medal and obviously it was in my first season at Sundowns so that has to be the highlight.” Watch the video below:
