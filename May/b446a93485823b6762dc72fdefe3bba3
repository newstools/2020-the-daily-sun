MEDIA personality  Lerato Kganyago has announced her separation from her Mpumalanga businessman husband Thami Ndlala hardly a month after the couple tied the knot. She posted the statement on social media stating that they have decided to part ways. The Metro FM presenter released a joint statement that said: "It is with sadness that we announce that Thami and I have decided to go our separate ways. We have come to realise that our different priorities and workloads have not afforded us the time to invest in our relationship. We will continue to care deeply for each other, and look forward to growing our friendship. We have nothing more to say on this subject, and hope that our privacy will be respected during this difficult time." Lerato and Thami got married in March at an intimate venue that had a few celebs such as Dineo Ranaka, Somizi Mhlongo and his husband Mohale, Naked DJ and former SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago.
