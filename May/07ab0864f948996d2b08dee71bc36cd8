THE struggling taxi industry could soon receive a lifeline from the transport department. Yesterday, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said even though the industry wasn’t regulated, it would be getting financial assistance. Speaking at a taxi rank in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni, as drivers were being screened and tested for the coronavirus, Mbalula said the process of regulating the industry started before the lockdown. “I’m in the process of regulating, transforming and formalising the taxi industry. When the coronavirus arrived in this country and visited us, I was on that journey and I’m still on that journey. I’m engaging with the industry to address issues of formalising it,” he said. Mbalula said there would be an indaba, which was supposed to have already taken place, to endorse decisions already made. “In the coming week or so, I should come back to report the details of how much we will be supporting the taxi industry,” he said. Mbalula was part of a group of government officials overseeing the screening of taxi drivers and queue marshals. He said passengers should not be the only people being screened and tested for Covid-19. “Taxi drivers must have masks. If they don’t have a mask, they can infect their passengers,” he said. Mbalula said government would be providing masks, but if drivers didn’t get them, they should find something else to cover their mouths. The minister seemed pleased with the taxi industry’s steps to fight the virus. “The industry has come to the party and supported government’s efforts to fight the coronavirus,” he said. Driver William Chauke said it was important for drivers to be tested for the virus, as they transported a lot of passengers. “When drivers load people into taxis, they don’t know whether they have coronavirus or not.”
