FANA Nkosi wants police to return booze they confiscated last month. The 50-year-old from Piet Retief, Mpumalanga, was accused of breaking lockdown regulations after hiding his booze in a vegetable garden. Fana told Daily Sun when lockdown was announced at the end of March, he bought alcohol worth R1 485.

I would drink while I was working in the garden,” he said. “I don’t understand why police had to harass me in my own house.” Fana said police searched his home five times and broke down the doors after hearing rumours he was selling alcohol. When they finally found his stash, he was fined R1 000 but the case was dismissed. There was no evidence he was selling booze. The cops were ordered to return his alcohol. “I don’t want the money because there’s no alcohol to buy anywhere,” he said. “Cops say they can’t give back my alcohol for investigative reasons.” Fana claimed one of his kids was assaulted by a cop during the raid. His son Bheki (23) said he was surprised when cops arrived.  “They went straight to the garden and dug the beer up. A cop insulted me and hit me with a back of a gun,” he said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the police were told to conduct further investigations before bringing the docket back for a decision. “We can’t give him his liquor back because there’s no order from the court saying we should do so,” he said. Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa confirmed they received a complaint about the alleged assault and were investigating.
