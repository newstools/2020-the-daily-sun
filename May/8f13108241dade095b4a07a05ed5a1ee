MPUMALANGA police are looking for suspects who robbed an SBV cash vehicle in Kriel. The robbery happened on 29 August last year when a group of heavily armed men who were wearing the same uniform as the guards took an undisclosed amount of cash while it was being loaded in the ATM. According to the Hawks, it’s alleged the SBV security guards were loading cash into an ATM when they were suddenly confronted by an unknown number of heavily armed suspects wearing the same uniform as theirs.  Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the guards were forced to open the armoured vehicle vault while being threatened with explosives. She said in the process, a guard was shot twice, but he survived the attack. “The suspects fled in a silver Toyota van and a Toyota Etios, taking along the truck keys,” said Sekgotodi.  Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the armed robbers is urged to call investigating officer Captain Thembi-Nkosi Nkambule on 082 303 9872, or CrimeStop number 08600 10111. Sekgotodi said all information will be treated with strictest confidence and callers may remain anonymous.
