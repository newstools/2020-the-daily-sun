ABATHEMBU king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has written to acting king Azenathi Dalindyebo, ordering him to leave Bumbane Great Palace immediately. In the letter that went viral on social media, the king dropped a bombshell. “Ndithi ke mfowam mandkikuxelele ukuba awunguye unyana wam wesende, ndingenguye nam uYihlo. Ndicela ke mntwana womntu uthi uba uyakrokra uye kwiDNA test, nam ndizimisele ukuba yinxalenye yalomgama. (I decided to inform you you are not my biological son. If you are in doubt you can go for a DNA test. I am prepared to be part of it).” HOW TO APPLY FOR R350 GRANT! Babalo Papu from Buyelekhaya’s office said the king wrote the letter. “His majesty welcomed the fact that Azenathi is not his biological son and his mother is a divorcee, so both have no legitimacy. His majesty has communicated his stance to Azenathi and his mother.” Azenathi told Daily Sun he would not respond to junk, before ending the call. But spokesman Chief Zwelenqaba Mgudlwa said Azenathi got the letter. “All those things in the statement are ridiculous.” Mgudlwa said Buyelekhaya called AbaThembu traditional leaders when former president Jacob Zuma was in office. He told them Azenathi was his son. NDZ: LETS TALK ABOUT ZOL! “He told us he was stepping down and Azenathi will take over. It’s surprising he is saying he is not his biological son.” Yesterday, a royal family insider told Daily Sun Azenathi pushed Buyelekhaya too far. “He is disrespectful and needs to be called to order. Zwelibanzi (Buyelekhaya’s praise name) is within his rights to ask him to vacate the great palace,” adding the revelation made Azenathi an illegitimate acting king.
