PLACES of worship are part of institutions that will under the
microscope of the law enforcement officers from next week. Gauteng top cop General Elias Mawela hopes that they will comply with
the regulations under the upcoming alert level three lockdown. President Ramaphosa recently announced that churches, mosques, and other
places of worship will be deemed essential under the new level. Given the high population, Mawela said they don't have enough personnel
to police everyone in the province but will go all out to ensure that rules are
adhered to. "Personnel will never be enough, we are policing 15 Million people
who we know, excluding those who are here, and we don't know about them. He said there are a lot of people coming to the Province, even from
neighbouring SADC countries He said they might not be able to police everyone but hopes that leaders
of the religious institution will comply, or they will be forced to close their
institutions. "We donâ€™t want people to go about with civil disobedience, here we
are dealing with human lives, this pandemic doesn't care where you are a
churchgoer or not." Mawela who was at their weekly operation Okae Molao in Booysens said he
is concerned about the increasing criminality in Gauteng. "Criminals are coming back in numbers taking advantage that we are
focusing on regulations. "Just yesterday, there were incidents of hijacking, one in Midrand
and another in Jeppe. "Our police offices foiled the incidents and arrested six people
and recovered the vehicle." He added: "We are going to intensify, asijiki and we are not going
to slow down so that the people of Gauteng can feel free."
