It appears to be business as usual for popular Umhlobo Wenene gospel Show Iqonga Levangeli despite the SABC probing it for alleged wrongdoing. Sunday Sun reported last week that the hour-long show which is hosted by Nomonde Vakalisa is being investigated by the public broadcaster after it emerged that certain songs on the programme were played more that twice. SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said she couldn’t divulge internal procedures with Sunday Sun.  “The SABC can confirm that as previously stated, this matter is being attended to in line with the corporations’ internal procedures. At this stage we are unable to provide further detail until the process is concluded,” she said. ????????

Host Vakalisa was previously cleared by the SABC when allegation emerged that she had requested money to interview singer Yongama Mrwetyana in 2017.
