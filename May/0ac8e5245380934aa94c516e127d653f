IT WAS business as usual for party-loving residents of these kasis even though lockdown is in full force in other parts of the world. But Operation Okae Molao put a stop to that. Police, traffic cops and soldiers on Saturday combed the streets of Sebokeng and other kasis in the Vaal for any sign of imbamba and illegal skyf. They conducted random stop-and-search operations on main roads to enforce level 4 lockdown rules. Many people were bust with booze, illegal cigarettes and drugs while others were arrested for contravening other lockdown regulations. Police Minister General Bheki Cele, Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko led the operation. Later in the day Cele visited various places such as the Sebokeng Hostel. The police minister told Daily Sun: “We’ve conducted roadblocks in and around the kasi.” A suspect was bust in Sebokeng for driving a car whose engine number didn’t match the vehicle description and for having loads of imbamba in the car. A taxi with three passengers was stopped after 8pm in Sebokeng and a sealed bottle of J&B and ice found. Six other people were bust in Sebokeng zone 10 for hosting a social gathering. “These people were found drinking and smoking hubbly bubbly,” said Mazibuko. Sebokeng Hostel resident Siyanda Nxumalo (33) praised the cops ans welcomed the operation. Siyanda said: “People continue with their lives as if there’s no lockdown. “At least with all these operations, they’ll start taking this thing seriously. “We’re happy to see the minister visiting the area.”
