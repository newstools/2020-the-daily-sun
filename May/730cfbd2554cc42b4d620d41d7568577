ORLANDO Pirates legend Lucky Lekgwathi believes that former young coach Rhulani Mokwena has what it takes to one day return to the Buccaneers’ hot-seat. Lekgwathi, who won a double treble with the Soweto giants, said Mokwena was thrown into the deep end pretty soon in his career. At the beginning of the season, when incumbent Milutin “Micho” Sredejovic made a surprise resignation, Mokwena was escalated to the caretaker coach position where he found the going a little tougher than expected. “The guy started so well, collecting points and playing good football,” said Lekgwathi. “They then became sluggish and started donating points to other teams. The chairman (Irvin Khoza) identified the problem and changed the coach. “Rhulani is a good coach, but with his experience, it was too soon for him to become head coach of Pirates. They gave him a chance to prove himself. He went to Chippa United and the chairman brought in a new German coach (Josef Zinnbauer). “You do not become a good coach overnight. It takes years and experience to be the best. But he still has age on his side and will grow. Other senior coaches have been in the game for more than 20 years and they are very experienced. “Rhulani must just focus on his ability and how he can always improve himself.” Lekgwathi was speaking from Soshanguve where he, together with his pal and retired SuperSport United captain Thabo September, donated food parcels to an old age home in the township where he was born and bred. Lekgwathi added: “I grew up in this township and the food parcels were a way of giving back to my community. Thabo is always helping me because I am always available to help out in his Foundation in the Eastern Cape.” The 44-year-old said that the PSL cannot give log-leaders the championship just because they are on top of the table. He said that we must wait until the virus is contained because the league race is too tight and close to decide which team is going to win it.
