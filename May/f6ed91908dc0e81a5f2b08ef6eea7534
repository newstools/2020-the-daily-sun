The ANC in the North West is mourning the death of one of
their own, councilor Sipho Vava from Tlokweng outside Rustenburg. He died on Wednesday, from natural causes after spending
time at Job Shimankana Tabane hospital in Rustenburg. He was deployed as Speaker of Council at the Moses Kotane
Local Municipality. He became active in politics in 1990 as an ANC member. He
was among many who gave selflessly to every work they did. He was also part of the Tlokweng Branch and became an
important member of the Self Defence Unit. Vava played various crucial roles alongside IPC Coordinator
Hlomani Chauke. Chauke said: â€œThe ANC has lost one of its finest, humblest
and disciplined activists who carried himself with honour and dignity in the
execution of his organisation and government responsibilities." "We dip our revolutionary banner in honour of this
selfless cadre who has left an indelible mark in the hearts of many of our
people. We convey on behalf of the general membership of the ANC, our heartfelt
condolences to his family, friends, and comrades," he said. Moses Kotane Local Municipality Mayor Ralesole Diale
described Vava as a municipal dictionary who did everything by the book. Known
as Kilaki to his colleagues, he had a love for productivity and teamwork. Diale said he met Vava in 2006 when he was a ward councilor
for ward 21. Through hard work and dedication, he later became the Chair of
Municipal Public Accounts Committee (MPAC) for a period of five years. "He was a dictionary for matters that affected the running
of the council. He would always quote from the structured act, systems act, and
MFMA. He was currently the speaker of the municipality since 2016. He
contributed a lot as he served in the REC and also as a branch Chairperson. "During the last days of his life he was a member of
the Interim Regional Committee. Working in the committee of the regional
structure. During the last two elections he was the Moses Kotane
Sub-Coordinator," Diale said.
