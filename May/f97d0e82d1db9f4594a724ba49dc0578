ANGRY residents burnt down a shop after the owner was granted bail on Monday. The people of Mangaung phase 6 were outraged after the release of Bangladeshi shopkeeper Sojol Khan (32). He was arrested on Saturday for allegedly planning to kill his mastandi and her son. Khan allegedly offered to pay R12 000 for the murder and had apparently already paid a down payment of R6 000. But the matter was reported to the cops and he was charged with conspiracy to commit murder. The SunTeam couldn’t reach the victims, as they had apparently gone into hiding. But gogo Rachel Leepo (69) said she was Khan’s mastandi four years ago. “I let him use my yard for a spaza shop, but my children were not happy and he left within four months. I was charging him R800 a month, but I struggled to get him to pay his rent.” Samuel Ntoi (29) said the justice system favoured those with money over the poor. “We don’t want him here. He must rot in jail. He has many shops and I think the others will also be burnt down,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed the incident. “It’s alleged that Sojol Khan solicited the murder of his landlady and her son where he had place a tuck shop container. “The police were informed and observation was kept until he was arrested on Saturday,” he said. “He was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and he appeared before the magistrate on Monday and was granted R1 000 bail. “He will appear again at the beginning of next month.”
