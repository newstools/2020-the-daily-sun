Bafana Bafana midfielder Keagan Dolly says it's unlikely that he would return to play for a South African team as he is developing well at Montpellier. The 27-year-old signed for the French Ligue 1 outfit at the end of January this year and has thus far made six league appearances, prior to the Covid-19 lockdown. Dolly has been linked with a move to Kaizer Chiefs before next season, but he has poured cold water over the rumour, stating that he feels playing for a European club is better for his career at this stage. "Seeing people like Percy Tau doing well in the Champions League [for Club Brugge] and Bongani Zungu doing well against the likes of PSG [Paris St. Germain]," Dolly told the South African Football Journalists Association. "Lebo Phiri scoring goals and captaining Guingamp, it motivates me to work harder. "With me always talking about my injuries, it always seems like I'm making excuses. The main reason why I'm still here and working hard is because of the support structure that is around me. "I'm not thinking of coming home anytime soon. For me, it is better not to play that side and learn to become a better person on and off the field than staying in South Africa where I know, I might play week in and week out. That will not benefit me." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
