ANDILE Mogakane may still be an unknown name in local cricket. But that could quickly change for the young all-rounder as soon as he takes up his position in the Dolphins team in the upcoming season. The 20-year-old is among the six new recruits for the Durban side, having been upgraded from a semi-professional contract to a franchise deal for the new campaign. Like fellow budding star Lifa Ntanzi, Mogakane has been moulded at the famed KZNCU, Township and Rural Development Programme. In fact, that was where he caught the eye of the scouts who took him to Northwood Boys High School in Grade 9. “I was offered a place at Northwood and had to adapt quickly as it was unfamiliar to me coming into an English speaking school,” said Mogakane. “My first year was tough. I stayed back and repeated Grade 9 where I was selected for the KZN Coastal Khaya Majola Week team. I only expected to be picked for the Under-17 side. “I’m forever grateful to the coaches who guided me through my younger years in Lindelani. When I was in Grade 7, I was picked for the national development tournament in Joburg and I played well.” The youngster hasn’t looked back, going on to be selected for the South Africa Under-19 team in Grade 11, the team which faced the West Indies in a home series. And bigger things were to follow as he signed a semi-professional contract with KZN Cricket and, at the end of the season, made his debut for the Dolphins, a first-time deal with the franchise was on the table. “I was so excited when I got the offer. My family was so proud that I was given a contract. But there’s so much work to do now. I’m really excited to join a squad of players that are so supportive,” he said. Mogakane can’t wait to strap up and get onto the crease and hit the boundaries for the Dolphins.
