HOUSE producer TNS is proud to be a daddy to his son. After everything he has been through TNS said that his 4 moth- old son has been his strength. "He is a source of my joy. I can't define the kind of love I have for him. I named him Phupho because he is part of what I dream," said TNS. He said when things get hard for him, the smile of his son cheer him up. "He is still young so he cannot speak. But through him I understand a baby language. Sometimes he would be looking at me with the eyes that say 'daddy, everything will be alright. I love you.' "And then I'd regain strength and hope. He is really my blessing. He gives me the, reason to live and work hard" said TNS. Read:Â KAY SIBIYA AND BABY MAMA BREAK-UP!
