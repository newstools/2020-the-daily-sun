WE all know that Mzansi is in love with bakkies and fighting for top position is the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux. The current Ranger T6 has been in production since 2011, the time to replace it would inevitably come. Leaked details of the new Ranger indicate that it might be released in 2022. According to CarExpert, the bakkie will get a brand-new plug-in hybrid powertrain, which hasn’t been installed in any Ford product to date. The plug-in hybrid will be employed in Ranger and Everest.  It will use a 2.3-liter turbocharged engine mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission supported by an electric motor for a combined output of 270 kW and 680 Nm of torque. The new Ranger will also spot Ford’s SYNC4 infotainment system with a 12.8-inch vertical display on the centre console and a wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity.
