TWO of every five companies are not complying with  the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the
number has increased since the beginning of Mzansi’s lockdown. The department of Employment and Labour said its inspectors
have found that compliance was still a challenge in many companies, more so by
state owned entities where compliance was at 50%. The department in a statement said the inspection of 2789
companies throughout the country from April 30th to May 8  found that 1237 were not compliant and 1463
notices were issued to these companies. Departmental spokesperson Teboho Thejane said the notices
ranged from contravention, improvement and prohibition notices. “Of these inspections, 411 were conducted at government and
or state owned enterprises where the rate of compliance was at 50%. The
department is concerned that since the introduction of lockdown level 4, more
organizations are not complying. “Given that the virus is spreading substantially, it is of
great concern especially at those employers where there are long queues or
people congregating. This is especially prevalent at government related workplaces,”
said Thejane. Inspector general Aggy Moiloa is quoted  in the statement saying the inspectors were
shocked that some companies were struggling to comply with safety regulations
when these should every company’s habit. “No wonder we still have so many workplace accidents.
Progressive organizations invest in the wellness of their employees,” said
Moiloa. Thejane said the inspectors would be upping a gear with
their inspections as more companies were starting to increase their operations
and more employees expected to report back for work.
