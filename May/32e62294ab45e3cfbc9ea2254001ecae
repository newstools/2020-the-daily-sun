PASSENGERS can now be sanitised. The National Taxi Alliance in the North West and Sigma Medical unveiled a body sanitising booth at the Rustenburg taxi rank today, for the first time in the province. The booth is motion sensor-operated. As soon as movement is picked up, sprays in the booths begin to release water-based sanitiser and items carried by hand in the booth will automatically be disinfected. The 3,4 metre booth carries a 500-litre tank that needs to be refilled when it runs low, and is also wheelchair accessible. The sanitiser used in the booths is alcohol-free, made through use of residual barrier technology with organic material. Provincial secretary Neliswa Setlhodi said the aim of the installation was to fight the spread of the virus, and ensure protection for passengers and town dwellers. “It’s very important that our people are safe at our taxis and ranks. This booth sanitises the whole body. “We encourage associations in the province to buy it. They will only sanitise once, unlike having to sanitise every load they have. This will also assist passengers who are allergic to the alcohol in sanitisers.” Shop worker Notyatyambo Radebe (27) said: “I have been working shifts since lockdown started. This virus has made it difficult to live around my family because of not showing any signs. Sometimes I feel guilty coming from work and not knowing if I’m safe or not. So having my whole body and clothing sanitised is a big relief.”
