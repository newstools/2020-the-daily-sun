 The Gauteng MEC of Education and youth development, Panyaza Lesufi is asking police to intervene on a misconduct shown in a video that has been circulating on social media platforms. The video shows a child smoking hubbly bubbly sitting with adults.    Last month Daily Sun reported on a Â toddler who's parents lit cigarette on his mouth. The mother posted a picture and stated that her child hasn't had a smoke in a while. The SAPS and social welfare had dealt with the those parents. A few weeks later, another child is making rounds on social media smoking hubbly bubbly without a hustle. He puffs it like a pro, raising eyebrows and making people question if he does this on a regular basis.   Mzansi is angry and want those responsible for this to be jailed. "I can't believe this. This child looks like he does this on a regular basis. I really hope these stupid heads spend their rest of their lockdown days behind bars," Shakes Loyd tweeted. Thembisile Ndlovu said what annoys her the most is the fact that the child looks like he does this all the time. "He doesn't look like he's getting lessons, he looks like a pro. Can police make sure they find these people. This is unacceptable and I hope social welfare deals with the mother because she has probably seen this video," She tweeted.
