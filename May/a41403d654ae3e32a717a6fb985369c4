Three Mpumalanga cops attached to Skukuza police station escaped death by an inch after the bakkie they were travelling in caught fire. This happened along R536 between Kruger National Park and Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Thursday shortly after three cops left the park when their bakkie allegedly exploded into flames and started burning. According to Bushbuckridge local municipality fire and rescue chief Rexon Silinda, the stationed at Mkhuhlu fire department received an emergency call about an incident of a vehicle that was burning outside the park.  “When our team arrived at the scene, they found a police bakkie in flames and they battled to control the fire,” he said. “Eventually they managed to stop the fire before it could spread to the Kruger National Park but unfortunately the bakkie was burnt beyond recognition,” said Silinda. Silinda said at this stage no one knows what could have caused the fire. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed that a police bakkie caught fire but no one was injured.
