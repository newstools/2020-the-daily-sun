Thugs who smuggle and sell cigarettes must be punished. Cigarettes sales and delivery are banned right now, yet know-alls out there smuggle and sell them. It’s common knowledge Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, minister of co-operative governance and traditional affairs, reversed the decision on cigarette sales. Still, lockdown hasn’t stopped wiser-than-thou lowlifes from doing business on the black market. Some pitiful smokers can’t go a day without craving. We see them smoking in street corners and ask ourselves: where did he get that skyf? Smokes kill and are bad for one’s health. Smokers tend to share smokes, thereby increasing chances of spreading or catching the virus. They should hold out for the sake of their and their families’ health. It’s a good thing law-abiding citizens still alert cops to such criminal activities. ) Letter by Rachel Molema, from Theresa Mews
