PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa visited KZN yesterday to assess the province’s progress on handling Covid-19. Accompanied by Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, Ramaphosa first held a session at Archie Gumede House in Mayville, Durban. He then went to Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital in KwaMashu, and to the Agricultural Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg. The hospital is expected to be one of those that will manage Covid-19. Zikalala said they had set up a district command counsel and working with contact trace teams, started mass screening, created community trace teams and roadblocks. They’ve identified places which could be used as isolation centres, including Clairwood and Dr Pixley Ka Isaka hospitals. Zikalala said they had also accepted offers from the private sector for beds and so far, there were 2 141 beds for isolation. He told the president schools were left out, but needed to be included as many schools in KZN had been vandalised. Many schools still needed to be fixed so they could be ready once they reopen. He said teachers and pupils would need screening and personal protective equipment. Zikalala said there was budget and asked the president for help. Ramaphosa was impressed with how the province was handling the pandemic. He said water was a known challenge, that needed a long-term plan. He said he’d urgently address the issue of national leadership excluding KZN on projects.
