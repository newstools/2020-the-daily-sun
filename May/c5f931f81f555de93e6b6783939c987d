THEY were starting a new life and things were going well, but lockdown messed up everything. Residents of Putfontein in Ekurhuleni, who were recently moved from Glen Marikana, need help to get food parcels. Many lost their jobs and have run out of food and ideas on how to get it. Community leader Nthabiseng Mokonyane (39) told Daily Sun they asked for food parcels recently but were told their addresses weren’t registered. “We’ve been here for almost two months and our addresses are still being processed, but does this mean people have to starve? “Ekurhuleni has food banks meant to help those in need.” Nomthandazo Beshu (37), a single mum with six kids, said things were not bad when she was working. “I used to work on a no-work, no-pay basis. No one is helping and things are bad,’’ she said. “I understand having kids was my decision, but the municipality promised to help.” Lindiwe Mkhungo (43), another single mum of four, said: “I’m on my own and have nowhere to go for help. “We don’t want to abuse food banks. We just need help.” Isaac Ngobeni (41) used to work at a shoe shop in Kempton Park. “I only have maize meal and two potatoes in the house,” said Isaac. “My sister helps me with food sometimes, but I just don’t want to be a burden.” Mayor Mzwandile Masina’s spokesman, Phakamile Mbengashe, wasn’t aware of the matter. “People can call 011 999 5102 to enquire about food parcels,” said Mbengashe. “Businesses, NGOs and individuals who’d like to make donations to the Ekurhuleni Covid-19 food bank are requested to call the same number.”
