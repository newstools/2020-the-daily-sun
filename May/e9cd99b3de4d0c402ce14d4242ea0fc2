A lockdown operation has yielded yet another result. A motorist was arrested for drunk driving by the Joburg Metro police at Golden Highway and Provincial Road near Finetown on Friday night. According to the JMPD spokesman, Wayne Minaar the officers got a very big surprise when they stopped the driver in a white car. "He was under the influence of alcohol and was still driving whilst holding a full glass of alcohol. He was also in his possession of three full bottles of Whiskey, two bottles of Monkey Shoulder, and one bottle of Bains," he said. ALSO READ: NO REASON FOR COUPLE’S SPLIT!
