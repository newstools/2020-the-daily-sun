EKURHULENI Mayor Mzwandile Masina has found himself in a sticky situation. Claims have been made that Masina’s speech writer Malaika Mahlatsi wrote his PhD thesis for him. READ: THE 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUNANIS! The allegations were made by Mahlatsi’s ex-boyfriend, who didn’t want to move on after their week-long relationship ended in heartbreak. In social media posts, which have since been deleted, the ex apparently claims to be in possession of a recording in which Malaika claims she was doing the PhD for the mayor and being paid. In a turn of events, the mayor denied the PHD allegations and served Malaika with a notice of suspension. In a statement, Malaika denied doing the PhD. She said she was only helping him with review and engagement, which scholars did. “My boss sent me a chapter of his work and requested my opinion on it and I saved it on my laptop.” She said her ex-lover, who was a regular at her house, might have seen that piece of work as he was using her laptop to watch Netflix. “He might have seen this chapter on my computer and made the assumption that I was writing it when in fact, I was reviewing it and making commentary.” Responding to the claims, the office of the mayor said: “The mayor is currently in the early stage of preparing his research proposal for a doctoral degree in philosophy. “At no point has any individual authored or contributed to the contents of the research proposal. “The mayor has and continues to adhere to the student code of conduct of the institution.” The municipality suspended Malaika after she was heard on the clip saying the mayor instructed the chief financial officer to cut staff salaries. “The claims are untrue and devoid of factuality,” read its statement.
