RESIDENTS of Bester, north of Durban, are still reeling in shock following the death of a 36-year-old man in the area. The man allegedly committed suicide yesterday by hanging himself with a rope from the roof rafters inside his room. It’s alleged he was found by his mother after she returned from the mall. A resident who came to the scene a short while after the discovery said it was believed the man killed himself after an alleged fight with his girlfriend. “It’s alleged his girlfriend was pregnant and he thought the baby was his, but the girlfriend recently confessed the baby’s carrying is not his but someone else’s,” said the resident. The information was allegedly revealed in a suicide note found at the scene. “After the discovery of his body, his mother told neighbours she was aware her son was stressed after learning that she wasn’t the father of the unborn baby,” said the resident. “His mother told us she had told him not to worry too much about the matter because it was something that his heart can let go after some time. But it’s clear what his mother told him didn’t convince him from his decision because he ended up taking his life.” The SunTeam visited the family today. A family member said: “The mother of the dead is not around. She is busy with funeral arrangements. We don’t think it would be a wise decision that we give out information without her approval.” The family member refused to give the SunTeam the mother’s cellphone number. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “I can confirm that an inquest docket was opened at the Ntuzuma cop shop after a 36-year-old man was found hanging from a piece of rope inside his room.”
