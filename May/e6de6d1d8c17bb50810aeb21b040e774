GAUTENG Health MEC Bandile Masuku unveiled a new coronavirus testing station. He visited the station at Forest Hill City Mall in Centurion, Tshwane, along with Rebosis Property Fund CEO, Sisa Ngebulana. Masuku said the centre was part of a partnership between the department, the property fund and Faith Care Medicals. “The partnership will see testing stations being set up at various malls in Tshwane in an effort to upscale screening and testing,” he said. The testing station would help stop the spread of the coronavirus by giving shoppers and the public access to screening and testing facilities for free. “This is one of the strategies we’ve developed to deal with hotspots. We’ve identified shopping malls, retail sectors, taxi ranks and bus stations as areas of focus because people visit these places,” said Masuku. He said everyone entering the mall would be tested. “This is one of the malls where we have permanent facilities on site. Other malls have shown an interest in putting our facilities on their sites.” As the province moved to lockdown level 3, government would work at ward level with community and faith leaders to enforce wearing of masks. Ngebulana said the initiative would be rolled out to more shopping malls. “The idea is that shopping malls are public places that cater for families,” he said. “They have the responsibility to create a safe environment.”
