COPS seized drugs worth R6 million in two massive busts this week. Police arrested a 45-year-old suspect in Booysens, Joburg, yesterday for possession of drugs worth R1 million. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun: “An intelligence-driven operation made up by the national drug task team, the Joburg Metro police and other law enforcement agencies led to the bust as the suspect was drying tik in preparation to sell.” He sent a stern warning to criminals that they would be caught if they continued breaking the law during the lockdown. Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said they received information that drugs were being manufactured on the property. “Officers found dishes and homemade equipment which are used in the mixing of drugs commonly known as kat and crystal meth,” he said. “The male suspect in his mid-40s is a foreign national and was renting the house where drugs were being made in the garage.” Minnaar said the suspect would appear in the Booysens Magistrates Court soon on charges of possession, dealing and manufacturing narcotic drugs. Makhubele said: “Upon arrival, police discovered a laboratory used to manufacture tablets and other illegal substances with an estimated value of R5 million.”
