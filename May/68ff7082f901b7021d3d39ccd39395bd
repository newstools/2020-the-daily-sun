WESBANK has denied claims that it is planning to repossess over 45 000 cars from its customers. Social media was abuzz on Monday with users claiming the vehicle finance provider would repossessing the cars. According to WesBank’s Head of Marketing and Communication Lebogang Gaoaketse, these claims are false and unfounded. “Repossessions are always the very last resort for WesBank. The bank would rather consult with its customers to make new arrangements for payment than repossess a vehicle.” Gaoaketse said during these challenging times it remains a priority for WesBank to assist its customers where possible. “As such, a payment relief option has been made available to those negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,” Gaoaketse said in a statement. "To date, we have received over 100 000 applications and have offered relief to over 53% of customers that have applied and have qualified for assistance. "These numbers are a clear indication of where our focus is now, so such allegations are irresponsible at a time where customers are vulnerable and need solutions," added Gaoaketse.
