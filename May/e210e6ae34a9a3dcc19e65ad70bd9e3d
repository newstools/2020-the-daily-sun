TWO unemployed kasi men have developed a walk-through sanitiser booth to help fight the coronavirus. According to the pair from KaBokweni, outside White River in Mpumalanga, the booth can sanitise 1 000 people a day. Although the booth is still being tested, one has been placed at the KaBokweni Complex for residents to use for free. Project managing director Mandisa Shabangu (34) told Daily Sun the booth was big enough for trolleys and wheelchairs to go through. Mandisa said he and his partner Nicolus Lukhele came up with the idea while trying to create job opportunities for themselves. “This is a good idea because, with the booth, it will be guaranteed that everyone who enters a public space has been sanitised and not just their hands,” he said. “We just thought it was the best solution to guarantee everyone in a shopping centre, school, or public space is fully sanitised.” Mandisa said it was their first project and they were planning on building more booths. He said they hoped to make a living out of the business. “This is our new lifestyle. We are going to be living under these circumstances for a long time. Going forward, this is going to be compulsory and we believe some potential clients will pull through and buy from us,” he said. Resident Nonkululeko Mpila (42) said it was a good initiative as many people didn’t have sanitisers at home. “Most of us rely on sanitisers we get from the shops, so this is going to help us a lot. It will not only sanitise us but also the trolleys we use for shopping,” he said. Nonkululeko said he hoped shopping centres and other institutions would consider buying booths to keep customers safe.
