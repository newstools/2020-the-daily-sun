HE has to kneel down when he kisses his girlfriend. But that’s not because he’s trying to be romantic. He’s 2,2 metres tall, while his girlfriend is only 1,4 metres tall! However, this height difference doesn’t bother Glen Madika (28) and his girlfriend Pfunzow Mukwevho (22). Instead, it has not only gained them recognition in their kasi in Thohoyandou in Limpopo, but throughout Mzansi, with their relationship being called a long-distance relationship. People even stop the couple for autographs or photos. Glen said it all started on Facebook. “I saw her on Facebook and liked her, but was afraid to say anything. Two years ago, I texted her and told her she was my crush,” he said.  He said they started chatting and planned to meet. He said they talked about their height difference before they met. “From that moment, I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with,” he said. Glen said he liked the way Pfunzow looked at him.  “I’ve been in other relationships before, but none match this one. When Pfunzow looks at me, I can tell she is filled with love,” he said. Asked if he was offended when people stared, he said: “I used to feel offended, but I eventually got used to it. “We attract attention wherever we go and enjoy it.” Pfunzow told Daily Sun she loves her boyfriend and doesn’t care about his height. “People can’t help but stare when we are together and we’ve grown used to it,” she said.  She said they did not kiss much in public, but when they did, Glen sat down or knelt. The couple said they wanted to get married after Pfunzwo finished her mechanical engineering studies. Pfunzwo hoped their children would take after their father.
