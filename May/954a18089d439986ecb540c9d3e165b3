Actress Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa is relishing her superwoman role in playing struggle icon Charlotte Maxeke in the hit movie Loving Thokoza. Produced by Mandla N’s Black Brain Pictures, the 32-year-old stars alongside Rhythm City’s Mduduzi Mabaso in a cut-throat narrative about identity and sacrifice during a time of adversity at the hands of the Apartheid regime.

I learnt so much from playing this role and what it means to appreciate and protect our democracy,” she says. She added that it was her first time playing a struggle hero, and she had to prepare a lot for the role. The movie is set to be available to movie lovers across the world on Showmax this month. “I spoke to my mom and women in my life who lived through the transition into the new dispensation and what that was and what it meant for them. We also have bodies of the work profiling the life and works of women such as Mam Albertina Sisulu, Winnie Mandela and Charlotte Maxeke who the role is based on.” Meet Charlotte Grootboom.
