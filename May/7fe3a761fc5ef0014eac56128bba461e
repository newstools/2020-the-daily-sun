"Hard times for lovers." We have officially pasted the 50-day mark of the national lockdown, and like Black Coffee's 2007 smash hit, it has really been "hard times for lovers". According to new research, a quarter of us are feeling pressure on our relationships due to the lockdown. New research commissioned by the leading relationship charity, Relate, has highlighted the impact lockdown measures are having on romantic relationships. Almost a quarter of the survey's respondents (23%) said the current circumstances are placing pressure on their relationship with their partner. More than one in eight (12%) of those who currently live with their partner agreed that staying at home is making them doubt their relationship. The research found that irritation is an issue for couples: 27% of respondents said they were finding their partner irritating right now, with feelings of irritation more common among women. 31% found their partner irritating compared to 22% of men. Simply put, people are beginning to reach relationship boiling points. Emotionally and sexually, frustration is beginning to creep in and will soon implode should this pandemic continue. The Chief Executive of Relate warns of the consequences Covid-19 will have on our relationships in the long run. “These findings reflect what our counsellors are seeing. People coming to us for support are saying that the Covid-19 pandemic and its repercussions are magnifying existing issues. Everyone’s trying their best to get through whilst stuck under one roof or living apart  but that door won’t stay closed forever, which is why we’re urging anyone experiencing issues to get in touch now rather than letting things fester until things get irreparably bad,” he added. As our president adopts a phased approach to getting things back to new normality, the question is: At which phase will your relationship be with your partner?
