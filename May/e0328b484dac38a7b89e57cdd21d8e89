While some churches across the country are happy that they will open on level three of the lockdown next month. But that isn't the case with the  Shembe Nazareth Baptist Churches. The Shembe will not be opening their churches because  they have many members.They say the 50 restriction of congregants will be impossible to maintain. They church said they will continue praying at their homes  and  abide to the rules set by  the President Cyril Ramaphosa when he announced the lockdown in March. The Ebuhleni Nazareth Baptist Church spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe confirmed on Friday  that their inkosi Mduduzi Unyazilwezulu Shembe instructed their members  to stay at their homes. He said this is because they have many members in their different churches accross the country. He said in some churches there are 1000 and some 1 500 congregants who attend their services. "So we will continue worshipping in our homes.  We don't want to end up looking like we are disrespecting the president by gathering in more than the restricted 50," he said. He said they don't have a problem with the president or anyone else but this is simply their decision as the church. A member (24) of the church who asked not to be named said they respect the call by made by their leader of not going to churches. "We currently pray in our homes. So there is nothing wrong with that," said the member. Another member (55) said although she misses going to the church but its better to be safe than sorry. "Opening our churches while the cure of Coronavirus hasn't been found would have been a big mistake for us," said the member.
