So far, we employ 40 people, divided into 33 drivers, two managers and five administrators. “Customers request services from control, are picked up at their desired location and dropped off anywhere around Soweto.” Tukk Tukie is affiliated to the Diepmeadow Taxi Association. According to Moosa, Tukk Tukie has keeps growing, thanks to high demand. Said the businessman: “We fill the gap and make public transport accessible. Shoppers, in particular, use our service. “The cheapest fare is R10 from Diepkloof Square to anywhere in and around Diepkloof, while R15 is the most expensive ride.’ Ahmed said the local taxi market was good and services like Tukk Tukkie made it better. Said Ahmed: “We always believed there was a gap in the market. “That’s because taxis normally drop people off on main roads, and many people don’t live near main roads. And thing get harder if commuters have been shopping and have plastic bags and other things to carry. “In such cases, we fill the gap & make public transport easier for the customers of our industry.”
