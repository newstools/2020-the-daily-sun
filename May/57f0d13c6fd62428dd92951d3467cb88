HIGHLANDS Park are suffering! The Tembisa-based Absa Premiership club have been hard hit during the lockdown. The club’s sponsors Jonsson Workwear have stopped paying the club their monthly sponsorship money because they have lost visibility and mileage. Highlands are also losing out from other sponsors during games who are paying for their names to be placed on advertising boards, gate-takings and hospitality. All football in Mzansi was suspended in March due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Now Highlands co-director Brad Kaftel has made a plea for the Premiership to resume before matters get worse for his and other clubs. But for that to happen, Kaftel says it is important that the task team appointed last week by the SA Football Association and the Premier Soccer League submits a well researched document to government. Since the Premiership and GladAfrica Championship were indefinitely suspended clubs are feeling the heat from sponsors. Kaftel said the suspension of the league has come at a huge cost as they don’t have as many sponsors like Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs to call on for funding. “Lives have got to go on and we are not going to get rid of this virus now, it is going to be with us for a while. We have to live around it. We have to find a workable solution,” said Kaftel. PSL clubs could be forced to play behind closed doors like the German Bundesliga which resumed at the weekend with teams playing in empty stadiums. If PSL clubs were told to also play behind closed doors Kaftel said: “That will be a shame because our supporters (at Makhulong Stadium) have been amazing. They make our games exciting.”
