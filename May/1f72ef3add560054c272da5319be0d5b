Police in Cape Town have bust two suspects for
allegedly hijacking a bread delivery truck and stealing 300 loaves of bread. The bread truck was recovered in Makhaza Khayelitsha
earlier on Thursday. According to Harare Police station spokesperson
Captain Siyabulela Vukubi, they were informed by community members that there
was a stolen bread at a house in their neighbourhood. They rushed to the place they directed to in block 56
in Makhaza were two suspects were bust. A Makhaza resident who spoke to Daily Sun said the
rumour started going around that lots of stolen bread was stashed in their kasi
but she didn’t take it seriously. “There are lots of things that happen here ekasi,
people sometimes just speak about things which they are not really sure about
for the sake of gossip, so I ignored. I was shocked later to see cops coming
here to arrest the suspects. “I think they intended to sell the bread to residents
on a lower price,” said the resident who didn’t want to be named. Vukubi said 39 crates of bread containing 388 loaves
were found at a house. Cops said the bread heist was done in Grabouw outside
Cape Town and was stashed in Khayelitsha. “Two suspects aged 32 and 36 were arrested for
possession of presumed stolen property. Police are now trying to trace the
ownership of the bread truck that allegedly dropped the bread at that
particular address. “Both suspects will appear in Khayelitsha court as
soon as they are charged,” said Vukubi.
