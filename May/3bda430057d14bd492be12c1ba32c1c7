 AFTER two consecutive postponements, the government has finally
confirmed that it is ready to tell the nation what life will be like under
alert level 3. The two postponements led to wild speculations, but Minister in the
Presidency Jackson Mthembu on Wednesday stepped up and offered an explanation,
saying this was owing to the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that
churches would worship in level 3. The initial press briefing to be led by Co-operative Governance and
Traditional Affairs Minister Dr. Nkosana Dlamini-Zuma was scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon but was postponed to Wednesday. But after Ramaphosaâ€™s announcement on churches on Tuesday night, Mthembu
said the National Command Council needed time to factor in regulations to guide
the opening of churches. There was no explanation offered for the Tuesday postponement but
Mthembu said Dlamini-Zuma and Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel will be
on hand this afternoon to explain to the nation the details of the regulations
under level 3. He said later in the day, Police Minister Bheki Cele and other related
ministers will also have another briefing to tell the nation about their
readiness to implement level 3 regulations. Level 3 will see more movements and more industries opening as well as
the sale of alcohol, but Dlamini-Zuma has emphatically said there would be no
sale of cigarettes. Tobacco companies have launched a legal challenge against this ban and
in court papers, the minister remains steadfast.
