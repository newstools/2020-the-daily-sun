SUNPOWER has kicked in and Anna’s greatest wish will come true! Anna Tshabalala (51) will attend her mother’s funeral service thanks to SunPower and Incredible Happenings pastor, Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng. Mboro promised to pay for the private ambulance that will transport Anna to her mum’s house a few streets away in Tsakane. “I feel so happy. I feel relieved. My thanks to Pastor Mboro,” said Anna.  She said her mum Betty Shabangu (70) meant everything to her and they spent a lot of time talking on the phone every day. Anna has not seen her mum since 2017 after she became bedridden because of an accident as well as being overweight. Her mum was also overweight and bedridden, so they couldn’t visit each other. Though her mum lived a few streets away, transport to get to her funeral would cost around R3 000.  Mboro told Anna: “We will help you to go to the funeral because you won’t have peace if you don’t say goodbye to your mum.” He said it’s because of Jesus that he’s still able to help people. He said other pastors should also help people. Mboro promised that after lockdown, with the assistance of the church mandate and through Incredible Happenings Construction company, he’ll install a sliding door so Anna won’t have to squeeze through the tiny doors of her house.
