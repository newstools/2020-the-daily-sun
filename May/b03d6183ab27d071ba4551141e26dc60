COMRADES Marathon superstar Bongmusa Mthembu is counting the costs of coronavirus impact. The talented runner from Kwa-Zulu Natal has suffered a triple blow due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Last year he won the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town, and went on to secure second place finish in the Comrades Marathon. Mthembu scooped a bronze medal at the International Association of Ultra-runners (IAU) 50km championships in Brasov, Romania, where he earned the highest placed South African finisher prize, when he ended in 30th place. But all the races have been scrapped due to coronavirus. The Two Oceans that was supposed to have taken place in the Easter weekend was cancelled. Last week, the Comrades Marathon was officially scrapped and in March, the IAU 50km championships, scheduled for Jordan in November, also suffered the same fate. Mthembu collected R250 000 for winning the Two Oceans in the Mother City, received R45 000 for being the first Kwa-Zulu Natal runner to complete the Comrades, in addition to the R250 000 cheque he collected for his second-place finish. He also received an undisclosed amount of money for his performance in Romania. Mthembu is an unemployed father and takes care of his family and extended family with money he makes from running. The three-time Comrades winner runs in the colours of retail company Arthur Ford, and they are doing their best to help him with monthly stipend, but it’s not enough. Xolani Mabhida, Mthembu’s coach, said he runs to earn a living: “To be honest, Mthembu is having it easy. He is getting something small from his running club (Arthur Ford) to help him to put something on the table. “So, he is affected by all these cancellations of top races. “But he won’t stop training even though he won’t be competing this year.” Mthembu’s consolation is that he’s a beneficiary of the department of sports’ Covid-19 relief fund where he received R20 000.
