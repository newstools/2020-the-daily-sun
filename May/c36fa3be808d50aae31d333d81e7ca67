MARITZBURG United’s Keagan Buchanan has major concerns following Ben Motshwari’s plight of contracting Covid-19. Motshwari’s club Orlando Pirates revealed that their star midfielder presented a flu like symptoms and after undergoing Covid-19 tests and the results came back positive. Buchanan, a former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder who has been in good form before the season was stopped, said having seen one player contracting the virus, it’ll have a serious repercussions on the way forward. The feeling now around the players will be to just end the season. “Because a lot of people will fear this virus although as footballers we have a job to do, but we also have to look at our safety first,” added Buchanan. The Soweto giants added the 29-year-old Motshwari is now in isolation at home for the next 14 days. After that 14-day period, he will need to be retested and that test will have to be negative before he is cleared. This came as huge setback to the PSL who aim to resume football, as he became the first player in the league to be infected by the virus. The Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship were suspended on 16 March because of Covid-19. Buchanan said this shows this disease is very dangerous and urges people to keep on following government’s protocols to steer clear of the virus. “It just shows that this virus is very scary,” said Buchanan on Zoom interview with journalists. “This means it can happen to anybody. My advice to him and everyone is to try and stay in your house, minimise the amount of people you come into contact with. “Sadly, we don’t know how he (Motshwari) got it and obviously it is not a nice thing for him. But as his colleagues, we rally behind him, support and keep him in our prayers.” According to SunSport sources, Motshwari’s issue was raised in the PSL’s executive meeting also held last Thursday, which included officials from the health and sport ministries, to find ways to resume the league.
