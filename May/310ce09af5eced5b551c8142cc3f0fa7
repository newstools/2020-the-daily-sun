FORMER Comrades Marathon champions Gift Kelehe and Ann Ashworth have described the cancellation the Ultimate Human as a bitter pill to swallow. Athletics SA (ASA), Comrades Marathon Association board and KwaZulu-Natal Athletics confirmed that the 95th edition of the race will no longer take place as planned. This popular ultra marathon, initially scheduled for 14 June, was rescheduled for late September or early October this year. But the three parties decided that it’s better to cancel it and shift their focus to the 2021 edition because of the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. In a media statement yesterday, ASA president Aleck Skhosana, who also doubles as the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) acting president, said the organisers had no choice but to put the elite athletes and thousands of social runners out of their misery by cancelling the event now and not wait any longer. “It was a long and hard decision to make, but we did it for the safety of all South Africans. We believe that we made a good decision,” said Skhosana. CMA chairperson Cheryl Winn said there was no other option except to cancel. “It is with profound sadness and regret that the CMA Board ..., had to make this decision. We do so with the knowledge that it will come as a great disappointment to thousands of Comrades runners, who together with us at CMA, have been holding out hope that the race would somehow proceed,” said Winn. Gift Kelehe, who won the Comrades title in 2015, said the cancellation is hard to take. “It’s a big blow for me,” said Kelehe. “But I’m just glad that organisers have taken a decision because we’ve been training without knowing if they will cancel the race or not. I’m gutted but have no choice but to accept this difficult decision.” Ann Ashworth, the 2018 women’s Comrades winner said: “It’s a disappointing decision. It has always been my goal to run the Comrades and this year was no different.”
