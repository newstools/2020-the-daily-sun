WHILE many complains about black tax, gospel star Thinah Zungu said it brought him nothing but blessings. The award-winning gospel star said with his first payments as a musician he made sure his parents were happy before he pampered himself. He told Daily Sun: "I put the happiness of my family first, my parents in particular. Now I feel blessed and I know that what I have are because of the blessings I received for taking care of them."

He also posted the interior of the house with his family sitting on the couch. "After I built my father a house, I was encouraged to build my own. And now I am a proud house owner. I am no longer spending money on rent. Some would think that black tax is a form of abuse but for me it's a blessing," said Thinah.
