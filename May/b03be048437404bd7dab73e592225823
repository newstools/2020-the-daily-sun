HE CAME to Mzansi hoping for a better life and better healthcare! But Dighton Sithole found more hardship in the country. The 34-year-old, who’s originally from Zimbabwe, lives with a disability and needs help. He struggles to talk properly, hold anything and can’t walk as he uses a wheelchair. Dighton from Stinkwater in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, has been locked down in crowded Plastic View squatter camp for almost three weeks. He said he did not even have nappies he could use. Dighton said he survived by begging in the streets, but life has been hard since lockdown started. He appealed for help as he sometimes went to bed on an empty stomach. “I’m suffering. Please help me with food and nappies. God knows why He made me like this, but I don’t blame Him. At the moment I don’t have food or a place to live,” he said. Neighbour Solomon Motsepe (55) said he helped to push Dighton around. “We’ve been friends since November. I change his nappies, but he has run out of them,” he said. Solomon said life has been difficult for his friend. “This man needs help because his situation is very difficult and touching. He needs a shelter and food,” he said.
