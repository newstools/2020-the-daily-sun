MFUNDEKELWA MKHULISISAZI Vundla is counting on Good Samaritans to help him put food on the table for his family of 10. The 32-year-old quantity surveyor from Mbizana in the Eastern Cape lost his job when lockdown started. He’s been doing odd jobs to support his family. “My boss told me we couldn’t continue working. That was it.” His family now survives on his parents’ pension grants. “With the little money I used to get, I was able to help at home, but life is difficult now,” he said. Sazi said he’d only heard about food parcels on the news. “Unfortunately, we’ve not seen food parcels in the Eastern Cape,” he said. Meanwhile, Tshepo Mekoa, founder and group CEO of Brima Invest, wrote on his Twitter account: “Two months ago we were a company facing vertical growth and hiring more people. “Then coronavirus came. It hit us so hard that this week we had to lay off 40 employees. “Laying off staff was the hardest thing I had to do. Can someone please wake me up and tell me it was just a dream.” On Tuesday, Sars commissioner Edward Kieswetter said the lockdown could cost R285 billion in tax revenue this year. Sars said over 20 000 workers were retrenched last month. According to the University World Institute for Development Economics Research, Mzansi’s economy could shrink by 16% this year. Up to seven million jobs could be lost. Last week, Associated Media Publishing, which printed magazines like Cosmopolitan, said it would be closing. This week, media company Caxton said it’s stopping magazine publication.
