SAMMY “Fever” Mashabane says he was made to run around like a headless chicken for only R7 000! The Motsweding FM presenter said a couple who hired him to MC their wedding cancelled his services after suspecting he might be a fraudster. Simon and Gaopalelwe Magape, who got married on 25 April, said they went to the bank and blocked Sammy Fever’s account after they deposited money into his account and had no communication from him.  The frustrated Sammy Fever said he would not want to defraud people for R7 000 and risk his reputation. “I’m a celebrity. There’s no way I’d suddenly disappear with their money,” said Sammy Fever. He said he believes the couple intended to tarnish his image. “The wife told me her husband was a lawyer, and that she’ll take this to the newspapers. I’m talking with my lawyer to pursue the matter with my bank. How can a bank close my account and render me a fraudster after that person deposited money into my account?” He said Gaopalelwe called him and told him she went through his account and knows how much he had in that account. “She tells me the details of my bank account. They have the power to see what’s in my account.” Sammy Fever said he’ll pay the couple back after they cleared his name. Gaopalelwe said they didn’t have a problem clearing Sammy Fever’s name, but they wanted him to pay them first. “We only want our R7 000, then we will go to the bank and tell them that he’s not a fraudster,” she said. She said they paid Sammy Fever R2 000 and later paid the remaining R5 000, but after he failed to acknowledge the receipt of the money and not communicating, they panicked. “My husband is a lawyer and he also panicked after Sammy went quiet.”
