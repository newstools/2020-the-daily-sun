SEVEN people ended up in hospital when a 23-year-old woman with a dead mouse playfully chased her five friends and a child. The six she was chasing ran into a toilet in Turflaagte in Mangaung, Free State. When she tried to force her way inside, the toilet fell on them. They all sustained minor injuries and were taken to Pelonomi Hospital where they were later discharged. The 42-year-old yard owner was left without a toilet. Daily Sun published the article headlined, “Chaos inside small toilet” on 5 May. It drew the attention of Pastor Clement Sehloho from Faith Worship Centre. The pastor and his team got another toilet built. The toilet owner said she was grateful to the pastor because it was difficult to go to neighbours and ask to use their toilet during lockdown. Pastor Sehloho said he was touched by the story. He told Daily Sun: “I realised that the family still needed to wash their hands because of Covid-19. They also have to stay at home and obey lockdown regulations. They needed to use the toilet and things were not easy for them. “I then decided to approach my colleagues and asked for donations to buy materials and build a new toilet for the family,” he said. “We were able to buy the materials and the family got a new toilet. It’s not as perfect as the ones built by the government, but it’s better than nothing.” The owner said the pastor and his crew did an outstanding job. “The ward councillor did not help us like he promised. But the pastor and his team heard our prayers and they came to our rescue. “The tap is also working again. Now my family and I are able to hands regularly. We’ve been helped and I’d like to thank Daily Sun, the pastor and his team for their help. They’ve spent their own money and for that we’re very grateful. The toilet doesn’t have cracks and we all feel safe when we’re inside it.”
