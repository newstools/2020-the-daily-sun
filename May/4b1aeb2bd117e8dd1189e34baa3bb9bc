THE Sitholes have long had to deal with cops storming their home. They believe this happens because they’ve rented out space in their yard to foreign shopkeepers. But what started as a verbal fight with cops at the Sithole home in Orange Farm, south of Joburg, on Saturday night turned very ugly. Emily Sithole (39) claimed her 20-day-old baby was pepper sprayed and several people were assaulted by the police. According to the family, cops forced entry into the shop on the property. “These cops are doing this because my parents are from Mozambique. I tried to tell them to stop when they started pepper spraying as there was a baby in the house, but they continued,” she said. Emily claimed whenever the police harassed the family, senior cops at Orange Farm Police Station sided with their members. “Our family has tried to report the same cops who keep visiting us, but the station commanders don’t take us seriously. “All we want is for them to treat this case with the seriousness it deserves. “They must investigate these cops who often come into our yard to abuse us,” she said. Emily said the cops threatened them because they thought they were ignorant of the law. “We are not living a normal life, yet we are South African citizens. Our rights are being violated,” she said. “We are pleading with the police bosses to take action. We always read stories about cops killing people. We’re not safe at all.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of common assault was opened at De Deur cop shop. .
