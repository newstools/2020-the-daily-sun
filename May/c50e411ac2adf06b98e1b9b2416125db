YESTERDAY, Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi warned companies reopening today to follow regulations. The construction, road maintenance, IT and domestic work sectors will be reopening under strict guidelines as the country has gone from level 5 to level 4 of lockdown. But people who tested positive for the coronavirus soared this weekend. On Saturday night, 385 new cases were reported, bringing the total number to 6 336. The virus has killed 123 people so far. Nxesi warned inspectors would be out in full force to enforce regulations. “Employers must act responsibly. While we depend on the goodwill of responsible employers, workers also have a responsibility here to wash or sanitise hands and to wear the personal protective equipment provided. “Employers must screen workers when they report for work. Workers with symptoms must be put in isolation and arrangements made for safe transport for a medical examination or self-isolation. “Employees who recover may return to work after a medical evaluation subject to ongoing monitoring in line with instructions of the health department.” Employers should provide workers with at least two free face masks. “Failure to comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act is a crime and failure to take the necessary measures to prevent transmission may result in prosecution.” Nxesi’s department and the health department were working on UIF payments for legal foreigners.
