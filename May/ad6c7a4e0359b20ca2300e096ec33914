 The fall in the petrol price of recent months is set to come to an end
in June, according to the latest projections released by the Automobile
Association on Friday. The Association said in a statement that petrol is expected to increase
by up to R1.18 a litre. The association also expects an increase of 22 cents
for diesel and 41 cents for illuminating paraffin. Remarking on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central
Energy Fund, the AA noted a stronger than expected economic recovery for South
Africa as the main reason for their projection and warned that there could be a
shortage of diesel as demand from industries starting up again after the Level
4 lowdown shifts to level 3 next week. The lockdowns around the world, aimed at curbing the spread of the
Covid-19 novel coronavirus caused economies to halt, when had an adverse effect
on the demand for oil, as reflected in a historical oil price crash in late
April. "The global lockdowns under Covid-19 saw fuel demand plummet. The
resulting oversupply left storage bunkers full, with the extraordinary outcome
that oil prices in the USA briefly dipped below zero," the AA statement
said. At the end of April all grades of petrol fell by R1.74 per litre from
midnight from the beginning of May, while diesel declined by between R1.56 and
R1.61 per litre. The AA statement released on Friday warned that despite the moderate
price rise for diesel, motorists are likely to encounter shortages of diesel in
the short term. In the same statement, the South African Petroleum Industry Association
noted a faster recovery than expected, leading to a dramatic increase in the
demand for diesel which refineries are currently not able to meet. The AA said motorists should anticipate fuel prices slowly returning to
their previous levels over the medium to long term and budget accordingly. SOURCE: NEWS24
