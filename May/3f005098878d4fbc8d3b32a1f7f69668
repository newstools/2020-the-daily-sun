Hello Mizz B I’M 33 and my girlfriend is 29. We’re deaf. She’s HIV positive and pregnant, but I’m negative. This weighs heavily on my mind. When I tell her to break up with me, she threatens to kill herself. I need help. Hey Brother One partner being positive doesn’t mean the other is safe. It takes three months to make sure of the first results. It’s important you get tested again. Your result shows negative as the virus may be undetectable at the time of the test, but this is when one could be very infectious. HIV isn’t a death sentence. One just has to stick to treatment.
