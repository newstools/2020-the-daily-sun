RESIDENTS from the Glenwood area in Durban are unhappy. This comes after their refuse was not collected this week. According to one of the residents, Tebogo Cebisa (32) the refuse was supposed to be collected on Monday. "We took it out, as usual, thinking it was going to be collected but that never happened, as a result, it's still lying there on the ground outside our gates in plastic bags," said Tebogo. She said they were not given any notice as to why they refuse will not be collected this week. She said they are worried about their health because if it remains uncollected for the next few days it will be scattered by dogs. "When dogs scatter it, flies will be attracted and that will pose a health hazard to us. We are going to get sick," said Tebogo. Another resident who is the mother of a 4-year-old boy, Noxolo Makhathini (27) said they are more worried about the health of their kids. "We can't afford to have flies flying all over the place, we have small kids whose health is our primary concern," said Noxolo. She said some of the refuse plastic bags have already been damaged by dogs. "Its a matter of time before they attract flies into the area," she said. EThekwini municipality spokesman, Msawakhe Mayisela said the depot that services Glenwood has been closed due to the presence of the Covid-19 virus amongst employees. "Services will be provided by utilizing resources from other depots therefore expect services to run late. We apologise for any inconvenience caused,‚Äù said Mayisela.
