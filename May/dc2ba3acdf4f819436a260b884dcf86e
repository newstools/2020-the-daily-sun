FOREIGNERS who’ve finished their prison sentences are frustrated that the lockdown is forcing them to stay in jail. A 60-year-old Mozambican inmate at Barberton Prison in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun he was supposed to go home last month but the lockdown made it impossible. The man, who was bust for rhino poaching in 2016 and sentenced to eight years, was granted parole.  He’s not seen his family for years and was looking forward to finally spending time with them. He said when the lockdown was first announced, he had thought an exception would be made for people in his situation, but things didn’t turn out that way. “We were given release dates but now we can’t go home. I was looking forward to seeing my family,” he said. “I miss them a lot, but I have to wait until the lockdown ends.” The inmate said he and others in his situation had hoped the government would help them go home to be with their families. Another inmate, who’s also from Mozambique, said he was excited but felt as if he’d been grounded by the lockdown. “Now we don’t have a choice but to stay here. It hurts me so much as I wanted to see my kids,” he said. But correctional services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said no foreign inmate would be released into society as no one could travel across borders. “We will place them in centres to be ready for deportation,” he said “When borders are opened, they will be taken to their home countries by Home Affairs.”
