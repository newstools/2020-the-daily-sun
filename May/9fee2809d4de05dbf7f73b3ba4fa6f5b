We need to be more responsible and not refuse the face masks provided by government and community leaders. How on earth does one refuse a free mask? Remember, it saves lives. I’m concerned about non-adherence to the regulation to wear masks in public. Some people think they’re clever than others. Some have masks but don’t wear them. This has the potential to drastically reverse the gains made by the government and all who adhere to regulations. We’re in level 4 lockdown, and masks are compulsory for everyone going out to buy essential items or to do essential work. It’s not like we enjoy wearing these masks, but we have to adhere to regulations. People who don’t wear masks in public should face the full might of the law. It’s encouraging to see retailers and the taxi industry taking serious measures to curb Covid-19’s spread. I recently saw people not wearing masks being refused entry into shops. Those few people who refuse to wear masks should be made to pay for their ignorance. What they’re doing is equal to attempted murder. They still think the coronavirus is a joke.
