VETERAN midfielder Kurt Lentjies hopes to end his football career with Chippa United. Lentjies told SunSport that he will honour his contract with the Port Elizabeth-based club, as he quashed reports that he was shown the door together with Andile Mbenyane. “I am still contracted to Chippa United until June 2021,” he revealed. “I am still committed to the club. I train six days a week and rest on Sunday. I have been training hard for two month on my own (due to the lockdown) because I am self motivated.” At 35, Lentjies is aware that it won’t be easy to draw interest elsewhere. “Who will sign a 35-year-old?” he laughed. “At my age, the most important thing is to stay fit and strong. Football is part of my life and I will carry on playing, as long as I am healthy. I will take each day as it comes.” Even though Lentjies has already given up on getting a contract overseas before he retires, he insists that he still has a lot to offer in the PSL. He has scored 25 goals in his career to date, and hopes for more. “I am not sure if I will ever play overseas...” he said. “If I say I have achieved this and that, then I would be lying. “Everyone aims for more than what they have achieved, and that’s what I aim for.” The well travelled player, who also had a stint with Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns, said the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for him not to worry about the safety of his family. “The virus has made it difficult for everyone in general. Whenever I see news on coronavirus, I always think about the safety of my family and this worries me. But I always put everything in God’s hands to heal us, and ensure we follow the rules in order to combat the virus.”
