Having found Mamelodi Sundowns and their star player Gaston Sirino guilty on several charges, the Premier Soccer League (PSL) Disciplinary Committee has now delivered their sanction. The Uruguayan attacker found himself in hot water with the Disciplinary Committee after he lashed out at two SuperSport United SuperSport United players, Dean Furman and Clayton Daniels, during a MTN8 semi-final match last year.
