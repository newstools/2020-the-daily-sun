RESIDENTS of Olievenhoutbosch gathered in their thousands to receive food parcels on Saturday, leading to chaos. Over 30 000 desperate residents from the area in Centurion, Tshwane, descended on Walter Sisulu Primary School, mostly ignoring social distancing rules. They were there to collect food parcels handed out by the Mahlasedi Foundation in partnership with the Department of Social Development and community leaders. The foundation’s Bert Pretorius said chaos erupted after false information started spreading that if you didn’t come on Saturday, you would not get food. “There was miscommunication and many people in desperate need believed it,” he said. LESUFI SORRY FOR LYING ABOUT PREMIER'S BOOZE STASH! Acting Gauteng MEC for social development Panyaza Lesufi rushed to the area and found some people had spent the whole night queuing for food parcels. Lesufi said the desperation of people in the queues showed the need for the R350 social relief distress grant. “We can see from the queues that the government has made a correct decision in saying we can’t rely on food parcels alone. We need the R350 to be distributed immediately,” he said. Resident Thomas Matlhako said: “This food parcel is my only hope of not dying of hunger. I don’t mind waiting for hours as long as I know I will go home with something to eat.” The situation was reported as having calmed down yesterday. People continued receiving food parcels with no disruptions.
