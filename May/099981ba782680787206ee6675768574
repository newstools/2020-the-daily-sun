Rapper AKA has vowed never to work with Reebok again. This after he told some of his Twitter followers the brand didn't want to give royalty payment. When one of his over four million followers asked the star what happened with the deal he inked with Reebok to produce his own sneakers, he said they didn't want to pay him more. Tweeted AKA: "Well, same thing that happens most of the time ... you bring a brand back from the dead and someone in some office in Cape Town can’t stand to pay you more than they make in a year." IOL has reported that Reebok is aware of claims on Twitter made by the rapper, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes. According to the statement, they met all contractual obligations related to the launch. Earlier this year, Reebok had communicated with AKA and his management that, due to a shift in strategy, it would not be able to renew his contract as an ambassador for the brand.   He said he took the deal because of a dream he'd always had of owning his own sneaker brand. Furthermore, AKA said, the company said instead of paying him they'd offer him free clothing.
