THE sangoma in January predicted a new disease would kill people all over the world. Solly Mathebula is now complaining that government sidelines traditional healers. The 44-year-old from Mamelodi East extension 4, Tshwane, told Daily Sun big English words are used in meetings to intimidate him and his kind. He’s been a sangoma for 20 years and is willing to put his muthi under the microscope. “I don’t mind them taking my muthi to labs for trials. I have faith in the muthi I use,” said Solly.  “A lot of traditional leaders want to help, but no one ever takes our request seriously.” Solly said there’s value in traditional medicine. “In Madagascar they’re using lengana, a medicinal plant. But here traditional medicine is not taken seriously.” He said his ancestors showed him a corona cure will be found. “When the ancestors show you something they already have a solution,’’ he said. “We need to be called as traditional healers to help with corona patients. Africa and Africans will suffer as vaccines are on trial.” Spokesman Popo Maja said the health department does work with izangoma and izinyanga. “Traditional healers were engaged during the development of guidelines and the process is ongoing,” he said. “Some roles identified for them are participating in public health education and preventing the spread of fake news.” He said the department supported a formal research platform.
