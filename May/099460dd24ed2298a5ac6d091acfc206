Actress Nandi Madida shared words of wisdom with the youth. She said she often speaks to young people, who work in her company and gives them sage advice about life. The star, who is married to Zakes Bantwini, said young people need to realise that their 20s are the most critical years of their lives. In a tweet, she advised the youth to take life seriously, so that they won't have regrets later. Tweeted nandi: "I always say this to young people who work in my company. The ages 18-25 yrs are so critical. If u waste that time being a rebel wasting ur parents money, being cool, hanging around wrong circles etc. U waste so much time & before u know it uâ€™re 30 with nothing to show for your life."
