AMAZULU coach Jozef Vukusic will know his fate on Friday whether he will continue to be in charge of Usuthu or not. The Slovakian-born was put on “special leave” in March by the club’s board of directors due to internal matters management refused to divulge to the public. His assistant Ayanda Dlamini was given the task to guide the team on an interim basis assisted by veteran goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs, until Vukusic’s matters are resolved by the board. Dlamini started his job on a positive note when he helped Usuthu ease their relegation troubles with a 1-0 win over Absa Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs before the season was halted due to coronavirus. AmaZulu general manager Lunga Sokhela said the board will finally put the matter to rest on Friday. He went on: “I escalated the matter to the chairman (Patrick Sokhela) simply because I had a lot of work with the day to day running of the club. “I was also interviewed on the matter and the fact that there was no decision is not good. I won’t leave it hanging in the air, I want to end it by Friday. “I will speak to the board and I will be guided by them. The coach is still contracted to the club and this issue would have been sorted if it was not for the Covid-19.” Sokhela says the pandemic could affect his team’s momentum when they resume the season in a bid to avoid relegation. AmaZulu are second bottom on 23 points with six games still to be played. Explained Sokhela: “The performance (against Chiefs) was incredible and when you realise where the team was (bottom) it lifted the morale. We didn’t want (the season) to stop, but it’s not positive for us to progress. This are challenges everyone is facing and we need to work hard to come out of it (relegation zone) as quickly as possible.”
