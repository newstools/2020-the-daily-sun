IMPALA Platinum Mine workers say all the mine cares about is production even if it means compromising the safety of its employees. Impala Platinum mine in Rustenburg, North West workers are frustrated and fear for their lives. "We are forced to choose between our jobs, our health and safety," said one worker. The workers said that the mine has introduced new working shifts to their work schedules at 9 and 10 shafts. According to the workers the last shift will knock off at 10pm. This leaves workers worried about their safety. At this time movement is prohibited in terms of lockdown regulations. For those who use public transport the new developments have left them in disbelief. "How will we travel to our home when we have to knock off at a time when there are no taxis." "Our employers don't care about our safety. More shifts mean more employees will be called back to work. At a time when we need to maintain social distance and the 50% capacity regulations." "It's a nightmare thinking about the deadly virus. We worry that we might bring the virus home to their homes," they said. Impala Spokesman Johan Theron said that this is done to protect workers. "We will remain below 50% mining capacity in line with regulations. We have many essential services, hospital and processing employees working shift cycles that travel to and from work at all times of the day and night in line with their shift cycle. It will be no different. "Employees will be able to use available mine transport and where transport logistics are problematic we are working with employees and union representatives to assist them as far as possible." "To enhance social distancing measures, it is imperative that we spread working arrangements out over a longer period during the day to reduce the amount of people at work at the same time as far as possible." He further added that the changes being contemplated and tested are done in consultation with employees, unions and the regulator.
