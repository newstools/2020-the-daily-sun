THE co-operative governance department must speed up finalisation of a bill aimed at supporting dysfunctional municipalities. The co-operative governance and traditional affairs, water and sanitation and human settlements select committee said this on Monday. The bill would prevent application of Section 139 of the Constitution, when the provincial executive intervenes if a municipality doesn’t fulfil an obligation in terms of the Constitution or law. Chairman China Dodovu said: “Evidence points to invocation of Section 139 not always ensuring viability of municipalities. “We highlighted Section 139 interventions should be the last resort and hope this legislation will be key in offering necessary support to struggling municipalities.” He said finalisation and implementation of the bill, and full implementation of the district model, would be critical in achieving performance targets and delivery of services in the medium term strategic framework period. Said Dodovu: “South Africa must move beyond good policy statements towards effective implementation. Service delivery is important, going forward.” The committee called for a reversal of negative audits. “We don’t get a sense the department recognises the worrying trend and impact of negative audits. This must receive focus,” he said. There was a need for the department and the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agency to step up municipal infrastructure grant support and monitor spending as a driver of economic growth, job creation and positive socio-economic impact. Dodovu said it was important for municipalities to be enabled with skills, so as to deliver. The committee was committed to monitoring the department’s plans.
