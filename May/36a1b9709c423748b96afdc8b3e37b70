"For as long as we both shall live." I've always wondered why this bit of the wedding vows is recited last by couples. It was not until I realised that all the promises the couples make in between are summed up by this line: "For as long as we both shall live." Celebrity weddings and couples have recently suffered this sad fate as some of the most-anticipated weddings have sadly ended. We take a look at some of the local and international celebs whose wedding didn't last until the "For as the both shall live" bit:  In 2004, the pop star tied the knot with her childhood friend Alexander after partying in Las Vegas. Despite the fact that the marriage immediately made headlines all over the world, it lasted a mere 55 hours before it was promptly ended.  In 1998, basketball superstar Denis Rodman and actress/model Carmen Electra tied the knot in Las Vegas. The pair filed for an annulment nine days later. Do you think it has something to do with Las Vegas being called the "Lost City"? I think so too.  Rick Salomon (who famously co-starred in Paris Hilton’s sex tape in 2007) also tied the knot in the Lost City with actress Pamela Anderson. With their marriage only surviving 60 days, the pattern of Las Vegas marriage casualties continues.  The wedding that reportedly cost around $10 million (R185 million), and was part of a two-day E! special called Kim’s Fairytale Wedding lasted for 72 days. Many claimed that this wedding was a publicity stunt. Do you share the same sentiments?  Probably the shortest wedding stint in South African celeb history, Lerato and Thami decided to cut ties after only being married for two months. After a beautiful traditional wedding, the two in a joint statement agreed to part ways after 50 days of marriage.
