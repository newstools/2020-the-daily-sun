 HE felt insulted, so he put it in song. And he held nothing back with the lyrics. NOW TWO POPULAR MASKANDI STARS ARE FIGHTING OVER 4-5s! THE fighting started when Ali “Igeza” Mgube said Mthandeni “Igcokamelisha” Manqele had a small 4-5 that looked like 9mm pistol. Ali sings what he believes is a little pecker on the song Satanism, released last week. He says Mthandeni won’t have a steady girl because he has a small 4-5. The song doesn’t say how he knows Mthandeni has a little boy’s 4-5. He told Daily Sun yesterday he insulted Mthandeni back after he dissed him on the song iSkorokoro, released in December last year. “Mthandeni insulted me. He said I’m ugly. And that if I’m not ugly in Joburg I’m ugly in my hometown, Greytown in KZN. “Mthandeni insulted many people on the song, including Ukhozi FM DJ Tshatha Ngobe. “But he apologised to Ngobe because he’s a radio DJ and didn’t apologise to me.” Ali said it was him who hooked Mthandeni up in the music industry by featuring him on his songs. “I introduced him to many people in the industry when he was starting out,” he said. “I was hoping he’d thank me, but instead he bites me. He even failed to send condolences when my brother died last year.” But Mthandeni was unfazed, threatening to flash his 4-5 in public to prove Alihas no idea what size his 4-5 is. “I’ll flash my 45mm 4-5 in public to stop these lies,” said Mthandeni. But he admitted that he may have hurt Ali’s feelings. “I meant no harm,” he said. “I was teasing because I know him. We worked together when I was still new in the industry. “I apologise if I hurt him. Zulu men always tease each other. “But he gossiped about me to other musicians and made me angry.” Ali and Mthandeni were in the past members of the trio Ondabuzekwayo, which disappeared after the death of Mjikijelwa Ngubane in 2018.
