Gucci will reduce its catwalk schedule to twice a year. Creative Director of Gucci Alessandro Michele revealed that the Covid-19 lockdown has made him reevaluate how the fashion house operates. Taking to Instagram, Alessandro had this to say: "I will abandon the worn-out ritual of seasonalities and shows to regain a new cadence, closer to my expressive call. "We will meet just twice a year, to share the chapters of a new story. Irregular, joyful and absolutely free chapters, which will be written blending rules and genres, feeding on new spaces, linguistic codes and communication platforms."....cruise, pre-fall, spring-summer, fall-winter. I think these are stale and underfed words. Labels of an impersonal discourse that lost its meaning. Containers that progressively detached themselves from the life that generated them, losing touch with reality."I believe that we can build our tomorrow also starting from a renewed capacity of denomination. Here comes the desire to baptise our new encounters by naming them after a language that has marvelously ancient roots: classical music language.Â "Accordingly, there will be symphonies, rhapsodies, madrigals, nocturnes, overtures, concerts and minuets in the constellation of my creative path. Music, after all, has the sacred power to produce reverberations and connections. It travels beyond the borders, reconnecting the fragility to the infinity (sic)." *DIARIO* A post shared by  Alessandro Michele (@alessandro_michele) on May 24, 2020 at 7:09am PDT
