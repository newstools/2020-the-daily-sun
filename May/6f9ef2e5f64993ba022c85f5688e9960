TAPUWA Kapina has swapped goalkeeper gloves for blue overall! Holding spanner is not as easy as holding a holding a soccer during training, it takes a lot of skill. The beautiful game is familiar with sad tale of local soccer players who lurch into destitution after their careers come to an end. Highlands Park goalkeeper, Tapuwa Kapini, is determined to beat the trend and ensure he has something to fall back on when he eventually hangs up his gloves. In a somewhat unorthodox investment, the Zimbabwean international has made a foray into the motor mechanics industry as he reaches the twilight years of his footballing career.  The towering goal minder is intensifying investments into his motor workshop situated in Kempton Park. “It all began when my vehicle developed a mechanical problem. When I took it to the garage for repair, I could not believe the more than R20 000 bill I was slapped with,” he recounted in an interview. “I would like to encourage others out there to also start preparing for a new life after the end of football career. Imagine what happened to the majority of players at Platinum Stars when the club was demoted from the Premiership?” Kapini himself returned from a 13-month injury layoff as the current league campaign was heading for the lockdown. “Football players must always take advantage of the chance to do something while conditions are good," he said.
