ANGIE Motshekga will convene another special meeting of the Council of Education Ministers on Monday to discuss progress made on reopening of schools. The basic education minister was supposed to brief the media about the state of readiness yesterday, but it was postponed following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address on Wednesday. “The purpose of the meeting will be to consider the work done by provinces this week, including taking deliveries of Covid-19 essentials required as preconditions for the reopening of schools,” said department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga. He said in a meeting held on Monday that provinces reported they were at various stages of readiness and requested more time as they were awaiting deliveries of personal protection equipment from suppliers. Motshekga said they agreed that one week was needed to finalise outstanding issues. “So we will reconvene on Monday to consider progress made and then report to the public on the state of readiness,” she said. She said delays were attributed to challenges with the supplier, which resulted in the cancellation of contracts. Director-general Mathanzima Mweli told Daily Sun they will adopt a “risk-based differentiated approach” in reopening schools. “We appeal for patience as we work to find the best way forward under the circumstances,” he said.
