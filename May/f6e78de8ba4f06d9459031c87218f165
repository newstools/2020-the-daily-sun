GAUTENG Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku unveiled a walk-through temperature detector screen yesterday. The unit was donated by Gijima to Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Tshwane. It’s a walk-through frame with smart technology, and is assembled at the hospital’s pedestrian walk-through. As each patient walks through, the screening unit detects their temperature, age and if they are wearing a mask. If not, it reports to the healthcare manager. Group CEO of Gijima, Maphum Nxumalo, said the donation would play an important role in strengthening the fight against Covid-19. He said they donated two walk-through units to Charlotte Maxeke and Dr George Mukhari hospitals. “By using smart technology, both hospitals are better placed to be able to detect possible Covid-19 patients without the risk of further human exposure.” Masuku said the units would help to protect nurses on the frontline. “When we’re able to detect patients early, it gives an indication that the nurses can protect themselves when they deal with the patient. This one is so advanced that it gives us a better way to deal with patients,” he said. Dr George Mukhari Hospital CEO, Dr Richard Lebethe, said the unit would help with personal protective equipment. “This unit identifies the type of people who are at risk and says we must up the PPE on those people, so it means we are going to do much better,” he said.
