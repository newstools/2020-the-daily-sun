DJ Khaled's live Instagram video has gone viral, leaving people suspicious of his expression. This is after a woman braced the American DJ with a live twerking session that was ended after a couple of seconds. Khaled ended the live Instagram video call but this is after he repeatedly told the woman to stop, asking her to please talk to him like a normal person. He also emphasizing that he's got love and family and couldn't continue with this I have love for everyone please take it easy when I’m on fan luv ig luv . Again I have love for everyone please lets be respectful nothing but love BLESS UP ! A post shared by  DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) on May 3, 2020 at 4:25pm PDT  His reaction left people in tears. Some are questioning why he didn't just end the video immediately when the lady started twerking. That's actually a valid point Khaled. The curvy woman had bumshorts that some might find hard to resist and may think this was the case with Khalid. Certain individuals even stated that they understood why he couldn't just end the call immediately. Read: MANU WRITES A CORONA POEM
