The SABC is probing popular gospel show Iqonga Levangeli on Umhlobo Wenene Iqonga for allegedly playing the same songs three times during its hour-long programme. It emerged that the show, which is presented by Nomonde Vakalisa, was accused by different music producers known to the SunTeam that songs including Butusile Mcinga’s Itarhu Lakho and Dumi Mkostad’s Ziphozenkosi were on repeat rotation. SABC acting spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo confirmed that an internal investigation is being conducted. “The SABC can confirm that the incident in question did take place. Internal procedures will be followed to address this matter as it is in contravention of our standard operating procedures,” she said. A gospel music producer, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said that this has been happening for nine months.

This is not happening because the same songs are repeated throughout the show. The public broadcaster previously cleared Nomonde Vakalisa of wrongdoing after singer Yongama Mrwetyana accused her of requesting money to interview him on her show.
