EVERY month desperate people queue at mashonisas for loans. And mashonisas take their Sassa cards until the loans are fully paid. But on Wednesday two suspects were bust at Thabong Mall in Sebokeng, south of Joburg, by community patrollers with more than 200 Sassa cards and money. Community safety spokeswoman Ofentse Morwane told Daily Sun the suspects were caught while trying to withdraw money at various ATMs. “The arrest was made by cops following a tip-off from patrollers deployed to the mall. “The suspects are believed to be loan sharks who took Sassa cards from their owners.” The suspects were detained at the Sebokeng cop shop and investigations were continuing. She said Gauteng had deployed more than 3 000 community patrollers to bring stability during lockdown.  “They’re also tasked with assisting and ensuring the elderly, disabled and child support grant beneficiaries comply with social distancing at identified Sassa pay points as well as at various shopping malls.” Tshwane Metro cops spokesman Isaac Mahamba said two of the suspects were bust at Kolonnade Mall, north of Tshwane. “They were searching various people at ATMs,” he said. “On searching the two suspects, 13 Sassa cards and over R32 000 in cash were found “They were arrested for fraud after failing to account for the cards and money.” The other five suspects were bust later at the same shopping centre.  The seven were expected to appear in the Pretoria North Magistrates Court soon.
