Media personality Lerato Kganyago set tongues wagging this week when she called off her new traditional marriage, barely two months after marrying businessman Thami Ndlala. She posted a joint statement announcing their separation three days ago. In the statement, she said she and her husband had decided to go their separate ways because their different priorities and workloads had not afforded them time to invest in their relationship. The couple were already preparing for a big white wedding in September, according to reports by CityPress. According to the article, a source confirmed that celebrity designer Gert-Johan Coetzee had already started designing Leratoâ€™s white gown, but it's not clear what's going to happen with it now.
