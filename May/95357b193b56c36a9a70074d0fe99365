NORTH West Education MEC Wendy Matsemela says they’re ready to open doors to learning on Monday. She addressed the media during a sanitising programme at Kutlwanong School for the Deaf in Rustenburg yesterday. Only 500 schools were yet to be disinfected across the province. “We got into a plan to ensure there’s safety in our schools and screening must be done at all times,” said Matsemela. The department had hired about 1 200 community members for screening purposes. National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of South Africa provincial CEO Tshwanelo Mmutlane said the department knew schools were going to open and preparations should have been in place. “Our stand is that safety comes first. The minister of health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, was clear on safety regulations which apply to all, including teachers. Teachers are law-abiding citizens,” she said. “Employers have the responsibility to keep teachers safe and provide personal protective equipment.” “When people walk into a building, they need to be screened to lessen the risk of transmission. “If we don’t comply we’ll find ourselves with no education. Our stand is very simple: compliance first so we can save the academic year. This is responsible and reasonable.”
