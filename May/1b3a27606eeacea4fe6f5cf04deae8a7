TRADITIONAL male circumcision is still suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. Eastern Cape Cogta MEC Xolile Nqatha said all traditional initiation monitoring teams have been put on high alert to rapidly respond to initiation schools operating illegally during the lockdown. This is to enforce the executive council’s decision to suspend ulwaluko during the winter season in line with Covid-19 regulations. Nqatha commended the police and district forums’ good work in closing down initiation schools during the lockdown. “So far, 16 cases have been opened and 10 people have been arrested for unlawful circumcision and contravention of regulations. In addition, 24 illegal amabhuma have been closed down. We also thank members of the various communities for alerting us to these illegal operations. “We encourage them to do more to save lives by spreading messages to combat Covid-19,” said Nqatha. The affected areas include Ngqeleni, Port St Johns, Tsolo, Mdantsane, Scenery Park, Nxarhuni and Indwe. Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman nkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana urged traditional leaders to be vigilant at all times and guard against opening of amabhuma in their areas. “We call on parents and families to observe lockdown regulations by not sending their kids to the bush. Equally, parents must open cases against those people who circumcise their boys without their consent,” said Nonkonyana.
