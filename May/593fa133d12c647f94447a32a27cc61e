HIS wish is to get help for his son. William Mnguni (54) from extension 16 in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, said his son Mzwakhe (15) is living with a disability. The unemployed dad said it was painful to see him in such a state. “Life is very difficult because no one in the family works. “We rely on my son’s disability grant. “I appeal for help with a wheelchair, food, clothes, pampers, and a better home,” said William. He said his son needed transport for check-ups and therapy almost twice a month. William also appealed for a job as he has a Code 10 driver’s licence and could do any general work to support his family. “We’re struggling because we don’t have food as there’s no income. “I appeal to people to help us with whatever they can. We will appreciate it,” he said. The father of four said his son was supposed to be operated on this month, but the operation did not happen because of Covid-19. “My son has some pain and was supposed to be operated on his hip,” he said. William said Mzwakhe appealed for a specialised or automated wheelchair as the one he’s using is not suitable for his condition.
