TSONGA music legend Dr Thomas Chauke says the R20 000 relief grant given to musicians by government is too little. He said he wasn’t complaining, but asking government to offer more. “I have a band of more than 12 members and R20 000 is not enough for my band. What about me? “This is not going to work,” said Chauke. He pleaded with government to consider increasing the relief grant. Chauke said the future looked bleak for musicians, as lockdown continued to cripple the industry.

Limpopo sports, arts and culture spokesman, Lucky Tshilimandila, said the relief fund was a national project. He said the province had set aside R8,3 million to help practitioners in the sports, art and culture sector. He said Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka has called on all athletes and artists to apply for the provincial Covid-19 relief fund. He said they needed proof of loss of income and evidence that they were confirmed to perform at an event that was cancelled due to Covid-19.
