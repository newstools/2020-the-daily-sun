The total
number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the Department of Correctional Services
(DCS) stood at 605 on Monday, with 34 new cases reported since Sunday. The
department confirmed that 186 officials and 419 inmates had been infected.
Recoveries are currently standing at 118. The Western
Cape and Eastern Cape are receiving heightened surveillance owing to a high
number of cases, department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said. Some
prisoners at Port Elizabeth's St Albans Maximum Prison set alight objects at
the prison this week demanding cigarettes and court dates as lockdown
regulations take its toll. "This
can also be explained by [Monday's] confirmation of an increment of 24 cases of
inmates in the Western Cape.  "Healthcare
officials continue to render a tremendous service as recoveries are recorded on
a regular basis. Therefore, it remains critical that prevention measures do
work in our correctional centres in order to contain infections and drive down
active cases," Nxumalo said. Cases by
