"We just need to talk." These are the words of Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to music producer Max Hurrell who created the smash hit Zol. The song was created after NDZ's speech where she was explaining to the public of South Africa about the government's decision to uphold the ban on cigarette sales. ALSO READ:Â RAMAPHOSA TO ADDRESS THE NATION TONIGHT! She shared the reasons why it was necessary that they stick to their decision because people who smoke often share their zols or cigarettes. Max's track has soon taken the internet by storm and people have been sharing their recorded videos since then. Today, NZD tweeted that: "Who is this Max Hurrell fellow? We just need to talk."
