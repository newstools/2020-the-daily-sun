Musicians should get educated while in the industry. I applaud those artists who understand the importance of having an education. Itâ€™s crucial to have some type of qualification in the industry. There are people who studied while they continued to build their careers. Music producers are taking advantage of uneducated artists by making them sign dodgy contracts with record labels. The music industry is flooded with artists because it can be done without a qualification. What happens if one decides to retire earlier than they thought? Education provides more opportunities within the industry and opens up new doors for long-term growth. I think that even getting a formal music qualification is beneficial for aspiring musicians so they can protect themselves from exploitation.
