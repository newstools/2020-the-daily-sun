YET another Proteas star has raised his hand for the national team captaincy. Aiden Markram said he “would love” to be the new leader of the team, which has been without a permanent captain since Faf du Plessis stepped down from the position in February. Spinner Keshav Maharaj has also expressed his ambition of leading the Proteas. “From a personal perspective, I really enjoy captaincy,” said Markram, who was once described as the future South Africa captain. “I enjoy the responsibilities that come with it. I’ve been able to watch from franchise captains to a guy like Faf, and it’s just something that I would love to do. “It is just nice to be considered and I would give an absolute arm and a leg to be able to do it. But in the same breath, I don’t want to become desperate about it.” Markram has been working to regain his form after he recovered from a lengthy injury layoff. The opening batsman earned his 20th Test cap in a clash against England in December, but is one of the players earmarked for long term futures under coach Mark Boucher. Markram would not be new to leadership position, having captained the SA Under-19 team to World Cup glory six years ago. He continued: “It’s one of those things where if it were to happen it would be amazing. But if not, there is plenty of good leaders within the environment that will definitely take the team forward.”
