Bishop Bheki Ngcobo of the Inkanyezi Church of Christ appeared at the Durban magistrate court today for charges of contravention of the disaster management act after he was arrested by the Provincial Investigation Unit earlier this month. In his first appearance last Friday Ngcobo had said that he has no idea why he was arrested but today Ngcobo paid an admission of guilt fine of R1 500 and the matter ended. His lawyer Justice Nzimande told Daily Sun that the state has a recording of an interview with a reporter from TV where Ngcobo said that people should go out and gather for the Passover period. "In that interview he was asked if he means people can be over 100 and he said yes," he said. He said the bishop made that statement at a time when president Cyril Ramaphosa had made an announcement of state of emergency. "So we agreed that he should admit to that because it was on record and he did," said Nzimande. Speaking outside the courtroom Ngcobo said he had no choice but to admit becauseÂ  by asking people to gather in numbers which were over 100 it meant he was defiant. "But I don't regret what I said and the reason for that it's because I truly believe that only God can help us win this battle of Covid-19," he said. Ngcobo said but besides that statement he still says that he has never conveneved a gathering during the lockdown as he has been accused of doing that. "After the president Ramaphosa announced the lockdown in the country I decided to go to a secret mountain where I prayed alone," he said. He said he didn't gather with anyone. He said he isn't saying that there is no Covid-19 but he is saying that government must include God in this fight against Covid-19. However, magistrate Vanitha Armu thanked Bishop Ngcobo for paying the admission of gult fine and said that the matter has now ended.
