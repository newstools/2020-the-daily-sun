TWEEPS went into overdrive, with users questioning whether rapper Cassper Nyovest had filmed himself in a sexual act. A short video of a man wearing a doek, with a beard similar to his and performing oral sex on a woman, started doing the rounds on Saturday. The rapper threatened to take people making such claims to court. In a tweet, he wrote: “Nose ring, tattoos on my shoulders, to top it off, ke tswa Maftown mara tsa go mafa tsone ha se tsaka. . . Lol! Come on, bro. Try something else. Mara wena tronko yatla! Mark my words!” It emerged the video was probably taken from the Twitter account of American porn star, @foolieloaded. When the porn star was alerted, he tweeted: “I’ve never heard of Cassper but that’s funny lol.” Many Cassper fans saw the funny side but some seemed disappointed it wasn’t him.  @Mattdope wrote: “There’s nothing wrong.” @kabouter_dawie wrote: “It could be Cassper. That guy is eating the way Cassper raps lately. Maybe they’re related.” Cassper said: “The guy was even licking his fingers. Lockdown should come to an end.”
