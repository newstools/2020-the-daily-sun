Brits have been experiencing such warm weather during the past days that some have resorted to putting their bed sheets in the freezer to curb the heat. One woman was so hot that she thought sticking an ice lolly in her vagina might be a good way to cool off, according to the Metro.co.uk. After the reports consultant gynaecologist Dr Anne Henderson told The Sun in an interview that anything with food colouring, dye, perfume or high levels of sugar will have a negative impact on vaginal pH and lactobacillus and could increase the risk of vaginal infection such as thrush and bacterial vaginosis. "It is also a pointless exercise as the core body temperature, including internal organs such as the vagina, is set by the brain and cannot be altered by application of any cooling agent such as ice, which at best will provide a very temporary relief before the temperature rises once again. The body is very good at autoregulation and it is never a good idea to tamper," Dr Henderson said. Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director for Patient.info, also told The Sun it could definitely damage the lining of the vagina.
