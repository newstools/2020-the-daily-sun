BLOEMFONTEIN business Lebo Mokoena has stepped up his game to hijack Tim Sukazi’s deadline of 31 May to complete the purchase of Bloemfontein Celtic. Mokoena, who is originally from Bloemfontein and now lives in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, has vowed that he’ll try by all means to save the club from being sold. He said he’s in the process of getting a letter of approval to sponsor the team. Yesterday, Mokoena travelled to Bloemfontein in a bid to conclude a three-year sponsorship deal worth about R38 million. SunSport reported about the sponsorship in March this year. Reports that TS Galaxy boss Sukazi is about to conclude the Celtic take over at the end of this month, with only the financial part of it left, have left Mokoena hurting. He said Celtic are close to his heart, as well as Free State people who rally behind the team wholeheartedly. The businessman said it would be a shame to see the team go down after over 51 years of existence. Mokoena added that once he receives the letter of approval to sponsor the club, his company will take over the Celtic’s marketing, and he’ll engage a lot with the fans. “I’ll fight to ensure that the team stays with us. I know how painful this is for people in my province,” said Mokoena. “These days, I’ve had sleepless nights hearing that people are devastated that their favourite team might go to Mpumalanga. “I also heard the rumour that Celtic may go to Durban (with Shauwn Mkhize also alleged to be interested in buying the club). “But I’m going to fight and I want to assure people of Bloem that ‘we will stand’ together in helping Max Tshabalala (Celtic chairman) in these devastating times.”
