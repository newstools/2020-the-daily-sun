THIS Nissan Navara will be one of the fastest bakkies on the road. It’s coined the Navara-R mainly to the fact that a GT-R engine will find a home in this bakkie. According to Baggsy, this project has always been in SB Motorsport's cards since the drift-spec Nissan GT-R from years ago. SB Motorsport is the company behind Europe’s wildest Nissan GT-R Drift car build. Due to the coronavirus lockdown, they are taking full advantage of workshop downtime and are using it to plan the launch of its most challenging build to date - a GT-R powered Nissan Navara. The VR38 twin-turbo GT-R engine will replace the standard diesel option for a performance punching engine package from the infamous GT-R sports car, cultivating a bakkie with over 746kW on tap.
