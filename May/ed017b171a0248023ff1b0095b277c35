VENDORS trading at Nongoma town in northern KZN has
accused the municipality of being evil and cruel after burning down their
stalls in the town centre. One of the vendors, Thokozani Mpanza, who sells live
chickens in town told Daily Sun on Saturday that they found their stalls
demolished and burned down when they went to open this morning. He said when he arrived in town he was shocked to see
stalls up in flames. Mpanza said his chicken cage was destroyed. He said when
he asked other vendors what happened he was told stalls were burned down by
municipality cleaners. "This was evil and cruel deed. Why would our own
government do this to us poor people while we trying to support ourselves and
our families. I'm unemployed and only support my family by selling chickens
here," said Mpanza. Another vendor who asked not to be named said she has
been selling at her stall since 2010 and feed her kids but now she will have to
stay at home without food. Municipal manager Mpumelelo Mnguni denied that the
municipality destroyed or burned down stalls. He said what is true is that his
employees were instructed to clean the town and remove all the dirt. He said cleaning workers removed illegals makeshift
stalls built by pallets that were placed on the pavements. He said the removed belonged to illegal vendors who were
warned two weeks ago that only people with permits would be allowed to trade in
the town. "We met all informal traders when they came to apply
for lockdown permits to trade but we explained clearly that only those who
holding trading certificates will be issued with permits during lockdown after
government announced that informal traders must go back to their work,"
said Mnguni. He said the reasons for removing dirt is because the
municipality will fumigate the entire town tomorrow.
