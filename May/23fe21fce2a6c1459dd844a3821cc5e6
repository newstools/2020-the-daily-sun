 The
National Assembly Programming Committee's virtual meeting over the platform
Zoom was interrupted by hackers. Shortly
after the meeting started on Thursday morning, a pornographic image flashed
across the screen. A male voice was heard making insulting remarks to National
Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise. As MPs
expressed their disgust, more images and insults followed, and the virtual
meeting was ended. At the
committee's meeting last week, there was concern about how secure the Zoom
platform is. House
chairperson Cedric Frolick said at that meeting he was in discussions with them
about how to get a more secure connection.  Minutes
later, the meeting resumed over the Microsoft Teams platform. This is the
platform that has been used for most committee meetings since Parliament
resumed its functions two weeks ago. SOURCE:
