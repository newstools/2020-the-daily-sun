A poet and a producer Manu Ndlovu has written a poem dedicated to all artists around the world. The poem titled, Dear Artist, was posted on YouTube a week ago. "I've been watching how artists have been trying for stream line viewing. Being an artist myself, I know how it is frustrating to be at home without an income. I found myself motivating myself and out of those thoughts I wrote this poem," she said.

"After writing it down, I read it to my mother and she was moved. Then I decided to put it on video. It was actually inspired by solitude. It is intended to give hope to artists during this lockdown period," said Manu. Part of the poem reads: "Let your creativity not be on hold especially now when all that is delightful is everything that you have created. You have created a song which ear doesn't want to hear. You have created a story, how else would we pass time without telling your story.Â  The book you wrote in solitary is keeping human kind company in their own solitude now... Keep on creating, keep on thinking, keep on observing...."
