WE want to be tested for Corona here and now! This was the plea from gogos in Ramotse Village in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane. READ: MASKANDI'S BIG 4-5 WAR! They felt neglected and, along with local women, picketed next to the main road yesterday. They wore masks and stood a meter or more apart. They said they’re hungry even though government promised them food parcels but hadn’t received any.  Gogo Lorna Chane said she was risking her health and safety so that she could be heard. “We’ve been following the law and staying home,” she said. “We did that but came out because we needed help.” Lorna (72) said she’s hungry and wants to be tested. “It’s been over two weeks since we registered for food parcels and not received any,” she said. “Most of us don’t work and our children don’t have money because it’s no work, no pay at some companies.” Louisa Marang picketed alongside the gogos and said she’s self-employed but no longer has an income. “I used to sell cookies in the street and don’t have any source of income,” said Louisa (46). “My kids and I are stuck at home and have no food.”
