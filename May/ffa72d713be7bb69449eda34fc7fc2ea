Germany's Bundesliga will need to wait another week to find out about a possible restart after the government on Thursday delayed any decision for a possible league resumption amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the government to give the green light and end a two-month suspension but Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference any decision on if and when sports activities could resume would be taken on May 6. Football in Germany has been suspended since mid-March with the virus having infected some 160 000 people by Thursday. Almost 6 300 people have died of the disease in the country. Germany's neighbours the Netherlands and France have cancelled their seasons.
