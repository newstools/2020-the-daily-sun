  But one man who protested for his right to surf appeared to get away on a bicycle in a daring escape which News24 captured on video. A small number of people took up position on the walkway alongside Muizenberg's famous beach at Surfer's Corner. They held a variety of signs – on surfboards, bodyboards and small placards. It appeared to be part of a "national peaceful protest" to argue the right to get #BackIntoTheWater – to surf, longboard, bodyboard, stand-up-paddleboard, surf ski, dive, and swim during the "exercise window". Initially, local South African Police Service (SAPS) personnel who watched closely did not appear perturbed. But at about 08:20 this changed. Police began to tell individual protesters to "keep moving", to quote at least two uniformed members. This was in line with the regulation which permits South Africans to go out in public to exercise between 06:00 and 09:00. In response, some protesters began to walk slowly down the promenade – with their protest signs – and police allowed them to continue. But it appeared that several protesters did not hear or understand, or chose not to obey the "keep moving" command. Police then arrested several people for "standing still", to quote the police. These protesters were told that they broke the law by "standing still" and were led away to awaiting police vans. One man said he had been exercising, by walking with his paddles in his hands, and was only taking a short break. But police did not accept this explanation, and drove him off to a nearby police station to be formally charged. One nearby surf protester continued to speak loudly, saying surfers deserved the right to exercise in the sea, practising strict and proper physical distancing.
