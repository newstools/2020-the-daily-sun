WHILE many teachers are hesitant about going back to work, Khangelani “Babes WeMaths” Sibiya (33) can’t wait to be in the classroom. The global award-winning maths teacher from Siphumelele Secondary School in Richards Bay, northern KZN, misses the smell of chalk and the faces of his pupils. The maths and physical science teacher, who dances and sings during his lessons, told Daily Sun that being at home made him feel sick. “Being in the classroom and changing pupils’ lives is life for me. I enjoy waking up and going to school. It makes me feel complete. Knowing I changed someone’s life makes me sleep well at night,” said Babes WeMaths. He said although he kept himself busy by engaging with pupils on different social media platforms, it wasn’t the same as teaching them in the classroom. “When lockdown commenced, I decided to continue teaching through various platforms. The problem is that not everyone is able to access those platform, which makes it very difficult for me because I don’t want any pupil to be left behind,” he said.  He said when Basic Education Minister Angie Motshegka announced schools would resume on 1 June, he was over the moon. “The classroom is my favourite place in the whole world. If it were up to me, I’d stay there. Teaching completes me. It makes my blood flow,” he said. Babes WeMaths won a Global Teacher’s award in the maths category in December in India. He was competing with teachers from 79 countries around the world. Teachers in KZN are expected to go back to school today to prepare for the reopening of schools on Monday.
