After old social media posts by 2020 Miss SA entrants were dug up in the past weeks, Miss Universe has also apologised for her old posts. Zozibini said the apology was driven by the fact that people made her an example and made her sound perfect. She said: "Through those conversations, I noticed a particular pattern, where there were people who made me as an example. People who said that look at Zozi, she has no skeletons in her closet, she should be the standard that all these young women must look up to. And when I saw that, it hit me you know, I was taken aback because when I read those things I thought, I'm human, there must've been some mistakes that I've made. I can't be as perfect as I'm made out to be and that scared me."The beauty queen said she also went through her old Facebook account to look for old posts. "I saw posts that I had shared on Facebook that were very insensitive. Posts that I should've never shared or posted. I was just so disappointed with myself and just filled with shame that I would've thought it was okay to share that at that time. So I wanted to take the time to apologise for those posts that I shared. To apologise to anyone that is/was affected by those posts and just to say that those posts are in direct contrast to who I am and everything that I stand for," she said.
