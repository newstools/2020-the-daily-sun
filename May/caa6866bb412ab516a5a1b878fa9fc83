this mine Gwede
Mantashe, said that the government will shut down any mining operation found to
be not complying with Level 4 regulations. “At
the heart of our programmes is the protection of people's lives. When we agreed
that mines should operate at reduced capacity, we highlighted the importance of
protecting and saving the economic infrastructure beyond the lockdown period. “It
is in the interest of mining operations to comply with the lockdown
regulations. We are not going to put people at risk for production,” Mantashe
said. The
donation from Sibanye-Stillwater is part of the mining sector’s support in
containing the spread of COVID-19.  Mantashe

said that mineworkers must be tested for COVID-19, warning that failure to do
this will put the lives of miners at risk. The
Minister that screening and testing programme must be implemented at all mines
since employees are returning back to work. He
further added that the economy will never be the same again. Mining in South
Africa will never be the same again. The current lockdown regulations will be
applicable far beyond the lockdown period,” Said the minister. Mantashe
said he will be monitoring the mines by making unannounced visits to mining
operations to assess compliance with lockdown regulations.
