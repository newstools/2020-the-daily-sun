Rasta is on a mission and is ready to paint the cabinet ministers one by one. Lebani Sirenje affectionately known as Rasta appreciates the work done by ministers and wants to show appreciation by painting portraits of them. Rasta who's famous for his controversial portraits of celebrities told Daily Sun that he's ready to ignore all the negative criticism and get his work of appreciation done. Rasta said he also doesn't want his skills to get rusty so he's making sure he gets those fingers working. "I couldn't fold my hands so I picked my brushes and stretched my canvases doing Potraits of which turned to be Cabinet ministers," he said. He further stated that our ministers are doing a splendid job in ensuring that people understand the rules and regulations of the lockdown. "They're all doing a really great job. A lot of people probably weren't paying attention to their speeches before the lockdown but now more people pay attention. We're grateful," said Rasta. Lebani said he wishes to see his paintings in a monument. He said when he gets enough money from his paintings, he'd love to donate a certain percentage to charity or buy food parcelsÂ  to his community of Hillbrow, Yeoville, Berea and to have his own Art Academy. "I work on a potrait each time they address us. I'd also like to meet each one of them after this lockdown," he added.
