Dear MizzB I think my partner’s not attracted to me anymore. She always says she’s tired whenever I try to have sex with her. She complains that my penis is too small, and she always compares me with her ex-boyfriends. What can I do because this situation has been frustrating me a lot lately? Dear Frustrated Straight talk doesn’t break any friendship. Satisfaction during sex is a fact that we can’t shy away from. There are different ways of satisfying each other during sex, and the size of a penis is not an issue. It’s unfair for your partner to compare you to her ex-lovers because you’re unique in your own way. I suggest you receive couple’s counselling to help clarify things. Wishing you all the best!
