A MOZAMBICAN truck driver and a woman are expected to appear in the Komatipoort Magistrates Court today after allegedly being bust with drugs yesterday morning. The two, aged 50 and 48, were found with drugs worth about R10 million. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the two were arrested at about 6am, just after border officials started operating. “Officers from the police and Sars were busy with routine duties when they stopped a truck entering from Mozambique. “The truck was searched, as is normal practice, and a false compartment was found.” Hlathi said officials found heroin and tik worth about R10 million and illegal liquor and cash. The two were charged with drug possession. The substances were still being tested and, if found to be drugs, a case of dealing in drugs would be opened. “Our officers are hard at work trying to stop everything that’s illicit in nature entering the country. “They’re doing their best to make sure anyone trying to sneak things into the country faces the full might of the law.”
