Residents of Nyanga in Cape Town are worried after a spate of Uber and Taxify robberies. Mandisa Fono (39) told Daily Sun: “Our kids hijack Uber and Taxify drivers. This path won’t take them anywhere.” Mandisa said kids sometimes chill at the park next to Lansdowne Road or next to the unfinished houses. “It’s a matter of time before the drivers decide to stop coming to Nyanga. This has been happening for too long.” Lutho Pinyana (43) said: “There is free WiFi at one of the primary schools, so kids stay there and request drivers to come, only to rob them.” Lutho said there needed to be a solution. “It will be difficult because most parents don‘t know their kids are criminals until they get arrested, and kids behave well in front of parents.” Residents said kids use the free time they have to do crime. Monwabisi Sawutana said someone was teaching kids to rob cars. “They can’t wake up deciding to rob cars. An older person is teaching them and the worst part is they won’t mention that person.” Colonel Andre Traut said two suspects aged 14 to 15 were arrested on Thursday after allegedly robbing an e-hailing service driver. “They requested a ride from Claremont. When they reached Nyanga they held the driver at gunpoint, assaulted him, and robbed him of cash, his cellphone and wallet.” They will appear in court on robbery charges.
