THE budget of the Department of Water Affairs has been cut by R14 billion as the country battles the coronavirus. The chairman of the portfolio committee on human settlements and water sanitation, China Dodovu, said in a virtual meeting yesterday they were aware the reduction in the medium-term budget was due to economic performance of the country, but the department needed to up its game. “We’re also aware that part of the allocation cuts is a direct result of underperformance in relation to the urban settlements development grant, and the human settlements development grant. The department must rectify their shortcomings to allay future budgetary cuts,” he said. Dodovu said the impact of the budget cut would become evident in the future, and the department would need to co-ordinate. He said the budget cut would affect programmes such as the delivery of title deeds to the people. The concern comes as the department made an appeal to municipalities not to cut off water supply to residents during lockdown under any circumstances. Minister Lindiwe Sisulu made the appeal after the department’s received complaints that residents were being cut off. Most complaints received came from residents in Gauteng, KZN and Western Cape. “I appeal to municipalities who’re guilty of this practice to switch on water supply immediately,” she said. “This is not the time to punish people for not paying bills. We must rally behind the government’s call for people to wash hands frequently to defeat Covid-19.” Sisulu said cutting water supply abruptly was depriving residents of their right to basic clean water and hampered government efforts to fight the virus.
