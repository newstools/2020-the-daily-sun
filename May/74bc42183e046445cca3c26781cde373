Enhancing how you look makes you feel great. Some people may love how you look and may look at you and think that something's wrong with you. But not everybody's opinion matters right. Now people are dyeing their pubic hair. The latest trends in hair dyeing is changing the colour down there, whether it's to cover up some grays or match your pubic hair to your locks. Shocking but some people are loving it. A regular hair dye is being used, as long as you protect your skin and choose one without harsh chemicals. This is according to Tracee Cornforth from Vaginal Health. Some are loving it but some think this is a bit weird and should be stopped. "At first I thought this was posted jokingly. I think it looks awful. It can breed bacteria and not carry a pleasant odor. For me, it's not a cute trend to try to re-start! Too many other ways to express your individuality," said Cheryl Bryant.  Nomthandazo Shamase said she has a lot of hair on her body and definitely doesn't like this. "I have a hard time understanding “natural” if they also dye the hair. Yes it's what they love or prefer but it's pubic hair and I don’t get why people are making a photo shoot out of it. It's weird," she said. Innanen Laaban said this isn't for her but it's cute. "So many beautiful, strong individuals! I love it. Even though this isn't a challenge for me, I love that people are building a positive enviroment for natural bodies. Everyone should feel comfortable in their own skin and no-one should be shamed for their personal preferences regarding their own body. This was an amazing post, thank you for sharing it and helping to break the stigma around this subject!," said Innanen.
