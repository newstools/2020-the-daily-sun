Ramaphosa revealed during his televised addressed to the nation that places of worship will be opened in level 3 of the lockdown but they will be under strict restrictions. He said the role of the religious community has been vital since Mzansi went under lockdown two months ago and therefore the restrictions will be eased and places of worship will be limited to 50 people at a time.
