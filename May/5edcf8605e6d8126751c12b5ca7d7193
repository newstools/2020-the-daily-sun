A FAMILY is devastated after their four-year-old  child Onthatile Ribane drowned on Sunday. Onthatile of Mocoseng Village in Mahikeng was playing with friends when he fell into a six metre-deep toilet pit at Sejankabo Secondary School. It took residents six hours to pull his body out. His mum Eli blamed the school for leaving an open pit toilet unsecured. “His death could’ve been avoided. My son died because of negligence on the part of the school,” she said. Onthatile’s dad, Olebogeng Makaudi, said the community had been complaining for years. “Many domestic animals have fallen into that pit and the school didn’t close it. “How many people have to die?” he asked. Eli bought Onthatile winter clothes last week. “He was excited and couldn’t wait to wear his new clothes,” she said. Eli said Onthatile was a bright child with high hopes. “This is difficult. I am heartbroken. We’d send him to the shops with a list and he’d buy everything,” she said. Education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela said: “We never thought such an incident could happen during lockdown, when everyone is expected to stay home.” The date of the burial will be communicated after all family members have been notified of the boy’s death. Spokesman Johnny Nkoane said the municipality was called to the scene at about 1pm. They couldn’t do anything because the pit was full. He said a truck and a TLB were called and they started removing waste from the drain, and this took longer than expected. He said: “At about 7pm the truck managed to remove the waste and the TLB removed the top of the drain. “Community members removed the child’s body.” Nkoane consoled the bereaved family. “We also appreciate the co-operation displayed by the community,” he said.
