AMAZULU goalkeeper Siyabonga Mbatha is confident that the club will survive the relegation when the Absa Premiership resumes. Before the League was suspended in mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Usuthu were second from bottom with 23 points from 24 matches, the same points tally that 14th placed Polokwane City and 13th placed Baroka FC have. However, they were in high morale after defeating Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 at FNB Stadium in March for the first time in 13 years, and were looking forward to hosting Baroka at Kings Park Stadium in their following match. The players would have been on holiday had the league not been halted due to coronavirus. “I think I would be on holiday celebrating that AmaZulu had survived. “I think beating Chiefs was a turning point for us,” said Mbatha who has joined many footballers in PSL in giving food parcels to those in need with his Siyabonga Qhamukile Mbatha Foundation as the country battles with the Covid-19 pandemic. “We did so much prior to that game, and you could see a positive energy among the group. “I feel at that time we had turned the corner.” Since the league was stopped, the team from Durban, under the tutelage of interim coach Ayanda Dlamini – their third mentor this season — have not played football in 79 days now. While the PSL and Safa are working on contingency plans that will be submitted to the sports ministry in the coming days for the league to resume, Mbatha is drawing encouragement with what he has seen in Germany, where the Bundesliga resumed behind closed doors last week. He warned, though, that when the league does resume, if AmaZulu players are not keeping fit at home during the lockdown, they’ll be shooting themselves in the foot. “We have to be open minded because we might find ourselves in trouble,” Mbatha revealed. “One of the things that should drive us as AmaZulu players to keep on going is the position we find ourselves in. The position forces us to make sure that we do our best.”
