THE Gauteng premier has confirmed the province will drop to level 3 when lockdown is eased early next month. David Makhura, at the legislature’s first virtual sitting, said the province in March had 50% of all coronavirus cases nationally, but had gone down to 15%. “It’s evident that we’ve been able to slow down the spread of the transmission,” he said. Makhura said the province had the most recoveries while active cases were under 10% nationally. Gauteng had tested more people than any other province. “Of course, the Western Cape has tested more per capita. We have the largest number of tests done in the country, with 33% having been done in Gauteng, 21% in the Western Cape, and 18% in KZN,” he said. “Gauteng can’t go to level 3 in a disjointed way. “We can’t have one municipality or metro on level 4 and others on 2 or 3. “Districts are highly integrated. We’re going to level 3 together.” His government and various economic sector representatives would meet tomorrow to find a balance between residents’ health and economic effects. Health MEC Bandile Masuku told the sitting his department had met with traditional healers to discuss the use of lengana, or umhlonyane. It’s been reported in various media in Mzansi and elsewhere that the traditional herbal remedy does treat flu. Masuku said the department had been approached by various people with other medicines they believed could be used to fight the coronavirus. The department referred them to the University of Joburg, it’s research partner.
