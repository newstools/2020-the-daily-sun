OVER 2 000 zama zamas have been tested for coronavirus. The tests were done by community workers for the Gauteng health department and the City of Joburg’s medical team in the Riverside area of Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni. Several positive cases were identified. In a statement, the department revealed there were 165 cases in the Ekurhuleni North area. The area includes Tembisa, Kempton Park, Winnie Mandela, Bonaero Park, Birchleigh North, Crystal Park, Erin, Ethafeni and Olifantsfontein. Speaking to Daily Sun, zama zamas said they were concerned the virus would continue to spread among them.  “If one of us gets sick, we all stand a chance of catching the virus,” said Mrungu Dzungu (45). “Life is hard. We want to follow the president’s rules, but we are starving. “We end up going to hustle in the mines and there is no social distancing.” Mrungu said he and his colleagues were very happy when officials came and tested them.     “Now that we have been tested, we will make sure to protect ourselves. We will keep our distance and always wear our masks,” he said. Ntuthu Solomon (30) said: “When I heard there were a few cases in our area, I was worried. I got tested and after I was told I was negative, I celebrated.” Ntuthu said his mind had been playing tricks on him. “The mind is a powerful tool. Once you think you are sick, you start feeling symptoms,” he said.
