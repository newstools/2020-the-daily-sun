EASTERN Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba has intervened in the temporary closure of Grey Hospital. She also reversed the decision of making the facility solely for Covid-19 patients. Gomba said treating only infected patients would result in severe hardships for the poor communities of King Williams Town and surrounding areas, who rely on the hospital. She said the hospital would be open before the end of the week and would be open to everyone, except male general patients who would be admitted to Bhisho Hospital. She inspected the hospital to determine which part of it would be closed off to deal with Covid-19 patients. Gomba directed hospital management to fast-track the deep cleaning of the hospital. After meeting the hospital management, she rushed to Bhisho Hospital to address regional labour unions about her decision to re-open Grey Hospital for all patients. The unions appreciated the MECâ€™s efforts and pledged their support. However, they were very critical about management, especially for failing to provide personal protective equipments to all employees. The MEC explained the challenges faced by the department in procuring the equipment and warned management of both Grey and Bhisho hospitals to use the little the department provided sparingly.
