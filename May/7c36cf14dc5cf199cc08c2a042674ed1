Do we still give love bites to each other? I remember back in my high-school days when my then girlfriend would nibble on my neck and I would lie to my parents when asked about the mark left by her on my neck. I would call it a mosquito bite, but my mom would give me this smile as to say: "Boy, don't take me for fool." I never used to understand why she would do it, but it felt good. I let it slide because everyone called it the love bite. If you, like me, can only recall ever getting a love bite in high school, then it's time to rekindle the fun high-school days and take a love bite out of your partner. The love bite, or then referred to as hickeys, is a concept that can be traced to animals and mating. Male mammals frequently nibbled at female mammals’ necks during mating. It was then that the study was mentioned in the academic journal Studies in the Psychology of Sex. This concept was then made popular by the Kama Sutra when it called love bites ‘coral and the jewel’, where the lip is the coral and teeth the jewel. Before you go and sink your teeth into your partner's neck, you must remember that this is a consensual act. It is important that your partner agrees to this as some people have hygiene and other sexual preferences. Once they agree, the aim is not to hurt but to be like Ballentine and "leave a lasting impression".
