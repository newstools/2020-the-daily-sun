THE Nzuzo family were devastated on Saturday after their two young kids were killed. Sharon Gali (10) and Mihlali Nzuzo (9) were found murdered at their home in Lehae, south of Joburg. They had bullet wounds to their foreheads. Their 59-year-old father is the prime suspect. Mum Kholiwe Nzuzo (53) told Daily Sun she left her husband with the kids when she went to Braamfischerville on Saturday morning. “I took my oldest daughter with me. He never called to tell me the kids were dead,” said Kholiwe. “When we got back in the afternoon we found people, ambulances and cops near their gate. “As we came closer people started giving us their condolences. I didn’t know what was going on.” She said when they went into the house they found blood at the door. “My husband told me he was not there when the kids were murdered,” said the devastated mother. “He said he’d gone to the mall to fix his phone and only learnt what had happened when he got home.” Kholeka accused her husband of lying when he said he lost his gun. “The gun was found in the house next to the bed where one of the kids was,” she said. “If he indeed did it, he must be locked away and die in jail.” She said everything was fine when they left. Her firstborn son Samkelo Nzuzo (31) said he prays it wasn’t his father. Police arrested the father at the scene. He appeared yesterday in the Lenasia Magistrates Court and was denied bail. Captain Mavela Masondo saidthe nine-year-old boy was certified dead at the scene while the 10-year-old girl died in hospital. “The firearm belonging to the suspect was found at the scene and has been sent for ballistic tests,” he said. The motive for the killing could not be confirmed at this stage.
