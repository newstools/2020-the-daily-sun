Experimental Joburg rock band BLK JKS is hindered from picking up the pieces by the Covid 19 health crisis after a ten-year self-imposed sabbatical. Pronounced Black Jacks, the group’s founding member Mpumelelo Mcata told the SunTeam in an interview that the pandemic came at a time when they were looking forward to sharing their new album Abantu/Before Humans with the world. Speaking under strict lockdown conditions in Rennes, France, the 37-year-old said they were booked to perform at the American music festival SXSW, which had to be called off due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s obviously a setback that is beyond our control, the gents were looking forward to reconnecting with our audiences all over the world,” he said. He added that the album is a result of the ups and downs the band had to endure over the last ten years, including losing lead singer Lindani Buthelezi.

The album was ready, the physical and digital release date was scheduled for June 16th, 2020. The group had been contacted by booking agent Manu Dibango,” he said. The electric guitarist added that he doesn’t know when he will see the band members again considering the circumstances. “I remain hopeful that things will improve, and that SXSW will invite us again in 2021, I hope that the crisis is only delaying things.” They have previously worked with the likes of Thandiswa Mazwai and Lesotho rapper Morena Leraba on their singles, Harare and The Boy is Doin' It, a dedication to fallen music icon Hugh Masekela. “The new album will give people a sense of what we had to go through musically and the changes we had to undergo in our personal lives. It blends together to what I think is the essence of the band,” he said.
