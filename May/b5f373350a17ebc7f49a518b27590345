Mamelodi Sundowns youngster Siphelele Mkhulise has revealed that he draws a lot of inspiration from former teammate Percy Tau. Tau’s journey to stardom was not easy but he was patient and when his opportunity came, he grabbed it with both hands. He went on to cement his place in the Sundowns team and helped them win a number of trophies, including their maiden Caf Champions League. He was then snapped up by English Premier League outfit Brighton and Hove Albion 2018. Unable to secure a UK work permit, Tau has been sent out on loan stints in Belgium where he has continued to shine. Like Tau, Mkhulise is a product of the Sundowns academy and has had to go out on loan to get some game-time and gain experience. He managed to get the much needed minutes and gather some experience in loan at KwaZulu Natal outfit Richards Bay. Mkhulise reckons this was an important step in his journey to being a valuable member of Pitso Mosimane’s team. “Even Percy was sent away on loan and came back as a better player and became a regular in the first team,” Mkhulise told his club’s website. But growing up in Pietermaritzburg, Mkhulise looked up to former Sundowns and Orlando Pirates midfielder Teko Modise. “I loved watching him play because of the creativity that he brought to the team.  He inspired me as a player growing up.” Mkhulise, who has finally broken into the Brazilian first team this season, featured in his first cup final back in December. He was on the Starting XI that lifted the Telkom Knockout trophy. The first piece of silverware which he had an important role in winning. “I had mixed emotions because it was my first cup final as a professional player,” added Mkhulise. “I was a bit nervous because the expectations where high and when you play for a club as big as Sundowns, you’re expected to always win.”
