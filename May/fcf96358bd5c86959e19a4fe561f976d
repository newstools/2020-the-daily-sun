IT is every football fan’s wish to see the current PSL season come to a fair conclusion. The PSL are scratching their heads, looking for ideas of how they can possibly conclude the Absa Premiership and the GladAfrica Championship. They are more or less eight rounds of matches left in both leagues. But is that feasible under the coronavirus enforced lockdown? Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane reckons it is possible to complete the season, although acknowledging the health risks involved. “I think a month can conclude the season. If we do well, we do things right, we do the precautions and health issues right, I think a round of eight rounds can be done in a month,” explained Mosimane. “I think everybody expects the season to be concluded. We can complete in one month, to be honest. It’s not for me to say when and how. But yes, we can complete if we play on weekend, Wednesday, weekend.”  The German Bundesliga is back in action, albeit under strict health regulations. Sundowns are in the league title race and are also vying for the Nedbank Cup, having reached the semi-finals. The Brazilians are used to navigating hellish fixture lists in the past, their Champions League sojourns on the continents adding to their bumper domestic schedule. They spent their last Christmas away in Morocco and have played as many as five games in 10 days. “We have already done it with three matches in one week and so you can see a month is enough. The cup semi-finals and finals... it’s two weeks remember? “We can have it from Saturday to Saturday. It’s for seven days. In my opinion, we can complete it.” Level 3 of the national lockdown prohibits football activities. However, Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa has directed the PSL and Safa to work together and come up with a proposal on how football activity can resume.
