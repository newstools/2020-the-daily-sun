BLACK Leopards No.1 goalkeeper Jonas Mendes promises to perform at the highest level when the Absa Premiership resumes after the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The talented goal stopper joined Leopards from Guinea-Bissau club Academico Viseu this season. The 30-year-old, who has been voted Player of the Season in Guinea-Bissau for five consecutive seasons, wasted no time to become one of the trusted goalkeepers at Lidoda Duvha ahead of King Ndlovu and Rotshidzwa Muleka. But Mendes suffered a serious injury which has kept him out of action for almost three months and has not seen any on-field action this year. Mendes’ injury has been a huge setback for the Venda-based side. And to make matters worse for Leopards, even Mendes’ trusted assistant Ndlovu suffered an injury which kept the Pretoria-born out for two months. Lidoda Duvha was left with no choice but to call on Muleka. While Muleka did all his best, he was let down by his defenders because they did not have good communication at the back, and that cost the Venda-based side many Absa Premiership games and saw them dropping to the bottom of the log. But now Mendes is back and can’t wait for the season to restart. “I will improve the performance with every match. I will also help the team to perform better and improve our position in the league,” said Mendes, who is still struggling to speak English. Ndlovu is also expected to be back from his injury. The return of Mendes is a huge boost for the under fire Leopards coach Allan Clark. Clark has blamed his defence for schoolboy errors that have cost the team points. Leopards are bottom with 20 points with six matches remaining before the end of season. The league is currently suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, despite being rooted to the bottom of the log, Leopards are still fighting for their top flight status with the likes of AmaZulu, Polokwane City and Baroka, who are above them on three points with the same number of matches.
