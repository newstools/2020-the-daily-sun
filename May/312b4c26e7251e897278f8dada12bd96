THE COVID-19 outbreak might have brought the world to its knees, but with companies shutting down, sport events rescheduled and some cancelled.But this might have come at the right time for Maritzburg United coach, Eric Tinkler. Tinkler reckons clubs will take a hit, financially, and are less likely to spend money, as the main focus will be to recover and balance their books. The coach is in a tight corner at the moment as big guns Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns are said to be interested in Richard Ofori and Rushine De Reuck. Striker Judas Moseamedi a tormentor in chief of Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout semi final last year, is also said to have caught Bucs’ attention. But he has cast doubt on any of the big sides in the PSL beefing up their squads for the 2020/21 season. “This will hit all the clubs financially. That’s just the harsh reality,” he said. “I read an article recently about Cape Town City chairman, John Comitis, talking about sponsors not paying because there’s no return on investment. “And now, obviously, everyone is looking at what’s going to happen to sponsors moving forward.” Chippa United chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi, said the longer it takes to contain the virus, the harder it will be for many clubs in the PSL. Tinkler agrees with his former chairman. Tinkler’s provincial rivals – AmaZulu – have since felt the heat of the pandemic novel virus. Tinkler agreed to his former chairman Mr Mpengesi’s assessment of the current situation. “The longer this takes, the more likely sponsors will pull out,” revealed Tinkler., who said this season cannot be voided. “We’re in a vicious circle right now. We’re talking about the livelihood of many people, and harsh decisions have to be made and that’s reality we find ourselves in.”
