IT seems the restart of the academic year is weeks away for Walter Sisulu University’s Mthatha Campus medical students. University management confirmed its first Covid-19 case yesterday. Spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo told Daily Sun: “Yes, on Monday, we received confirmation that one of our essential service workers on the Mthatha campus tested positive. The staff member did not contract the virus on campus. We have done contact tracing of the small number of staff members who were in contact with the infected person.” Tukwayo said all those who had contact with the infected person were self-isolating, and the date of the return of key staff and medical students was unknown. SRC president Siphesihle Msomi said the case came as no surprise, as staff members have been attending gatherings such as funerals. “As deep cleaning was done last week at the campus.” He said it wasn’t the university saying students must return to class, but Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande. “Government should make sure when these students return they are safe and provide them with protective personal equipment. “It must also ensure the safety of those residing outside campus at hospitals. We’re calling on it to take full responsibility for all final-year medical students.” Msomi said the SRC was also speaking to the SA Union of Students to ensure that when students returned to campus, they were joined by their leaders. The university is the first higher education institution to report a confirmed Covid-19 case before classes are expected to resume by mid next month.
