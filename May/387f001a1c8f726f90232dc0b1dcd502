This was just evil spirits. This is very painful and anyone who has a child in such a situation will feel great pain,” said Winnie. She asked fans to give Rethabile privacy to heal, and for prayers and messages of support. She said her daughter was lucky as she had no broken bones. She said Rethabile’s legs were painful, but there were no fractures. Winnie said she wanted Rethabile, known for her hit song Umlilo with DJ Zinhle, to return to the music industry after the lockdown ended. The song has continued to dominate the airwaves even after the lockdown started. Rethabile started singing and dancing at the age of six, competing in talent shows and impressing audiences. She became a back-up singer and dancer for her mum in 2008. The songwriter, composer and guitarist first captured attention as a contestant in seasons eight and nine of Idols SA.
