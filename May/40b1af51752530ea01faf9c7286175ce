Skolopad has made a short video in which she strips and asks people to stay home. The video is captioned, “Enjoying LockdownHouseParty. They DJ, I dance”. As the country is now in stage 4 of lockdown, Skolopad has asked people to do things such as banking and shopping online. She said life’s precious and only comes once. “We’re now in level 4 of the lockdown, and that doesn’t mean much freedom for all of us to be outside. “There are many ways to entertain ourselves and make payments. Technology is there for us to use, and I urge people to continue staying at home. And those who want to pay accounts, please do it online if you can.” In the short video she posted on her Twitter page, Skolopad said she maintains social distancing when buying essential goods, and that she provides her services online. She captured her naked body while lying in bed. The entertainer recently appeared on SABC3 show Spirit, where she consulted psychic medium Cindy Kruger. Cindy told Skolopad about messages from her dead gogo and told her that being a rape victim wasn’t her fault and that she should embrace life. Skolopad said she’s happy the trauma she’s faced has healed.
