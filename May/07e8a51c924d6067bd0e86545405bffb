How many? How many international songs that you play that don't celebrate women but talk about women being objectified by rappers? How many? And now you're gonna take down a song that makes every single woman, whatever the size feel confident. Askies, I'm sorry, yini inkinga yakho?"She said kids don't feel confident because songs that play on radio portray certain types of bodies as perfect and she is trying to fight that stereotype.This is by telling people that women are fine with their bellies and thunder thighs.
