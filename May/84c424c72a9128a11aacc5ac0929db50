SOCIAL Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said greedy people sell food parcels and others took them for themselves. She appealed for people to be considerate in these difficult times. “When you take two instead of one parcel, you’re taking away from another vulnerable family,” said Zulu. She said the National Development Agency recruited and placed 580 volunteers in all of Mzansi’s 52 districts to support distribution of food parcels to poor families. “An additional 620 volunteers would be added to increase the number of volunteers, bringing the total to 1 200 volunteers.” The volunteers will help the department distribute food, teach families about the virus and help with application verification of the social relief or distress grant, as well as speed up payment of the grant. Zulu also announced some offices will be open from Monday to help beneficiaries apply for grants. This would especially benefit temporary grants, which had expired. “In the case of temporary grants that have been suspended, they’ll be reinstated and paid until the end of October. “The same applies to child decency and foster care that lapsed during the lockdown. “We have gazetted new directives that will allow 30% of the Sassa workforce to return to work on a rotational basis to continue to render social services to our people.” Zulu said the department employed an additional 1 809 social workers to reinforce its staff and provide a range of social services. The social workers will be employed for a period of three months. “Priority will be given to social work graduates who’e registered on the department’s database of unemployed qualified social work graduates that we developed last year,” she said. “A further 1 210 unemployed social work graduates will be given a one-year internship opportunity in a joint venture between the Health and Welfare Seta, the SA Council for Social Service Professions, the department, and the Wits Health Consortium.”
