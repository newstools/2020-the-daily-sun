SOCIAL DISTANCING as part of the adherence to the governmentâ€™s
regulations to fight against Coronavirus is still a challenge in Mzansi! This is mostly witnessed during the SASSA grants pay-outs around the
country as beneficiaries flock and get crowded to collect their share. On the fourth day of the grants collection people at Jubilee Mall in
Hammanskraal have been witnessed in crowds with no distancing at all during the
child grants collection. This is because grants beneficiaries often met with and come across
normal shoppers and other Sassa beneficiaries who were unable to collect their
grants on previous days.
