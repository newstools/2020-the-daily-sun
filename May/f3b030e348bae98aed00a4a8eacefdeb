THREE men, including a teen, went to try their luck at a
shopping centre on Wednesday. But things didn't go according to their plan as one died,
another sustained serious injury while the third one was arrested. It is alleged that the trio went to a store at Gateway mall
in Umhlanga north of Durban and allegedly stole clothes. But security guards saw and chased after them. The guards caught one of them, the 16-year-old teen and they
found him with stolen clothes. The other two escaped and they decided to jump onto a lower
level of the mall where they got injured. They were injured and rushed to hospital but one of them
died on arrival at hospital while the other is in a serious condition.  Gateway marketing manager Michelle Shelley confirmed that an
attempted shoplifting took place at a retail store. "The suspects attempted to flee the scene and in doing
so, injured themselves. Medical assistance was sought and the suspects were
transported to hospital,” she said. She said the matter is subject to an official investigation
and any further details regarding this incident should be sought through the
SAPS. The mall is operating under level four restrictions. Cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that three
men were chased by security guards after they were caught stealing clothes from
the clothing shops in Umhlanga. Gwala said a 16-year-old suspect was arrested with clothing
in his possession. "He was charged for shoplifting and was released on
warning to his parent’s care since he is a minor," said Gwala. She said other two males managed to run and jumped onto a
lower level. "They sustained serious injuries and were taken to
hospital for medical attention where a 25-year-old succumbed to his injuries.
An inquest docket was opened at Durban North SAPS," said Gwala.
