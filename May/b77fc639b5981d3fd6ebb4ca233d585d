NKOSI Cibane (27) was diagnosed with polio at a young age, but never allowed his disability to affect his craft. “I started telling my story through poetry. I then took my poetry to another level through collaborations with other artists,” said the Ndwedwe-born artist. “Soon I was approached by Gagasi FM to do poetry on a regular basis. Meanwhile, I was perfecting my craft. I ended up releasing a song called Nkanyezi.” He’s now working with gospel star Thinah Zungu on a song titled Noah Sivulele. “This is a prophetic song. It talks to the current situation in the world. “We’re all locked inside ‘Noah’s Ark’. We want to go out and continue with our lives, but can’t because there are many dangers outside.” He said the song meant a lot to him. “When I wrote it I wanted to do a lot of things. I could see my success from far away, but due to many challenges I couldn’t get to it. I kept knocking, but nothing positive was coming my way. Today I can see progress.” Nkosi recites a poem on the track, while Thinah sings. He’ll release a 12-track album titled Iphupho – the Dream. “On the album I worked with scathamiya group Thee Legacy and Amali, which is made up of the Mxakaza twins. The album is produced by Makabongwe Mbuli. I wrote all the songs. “I hope to release the album after lockdown.”
