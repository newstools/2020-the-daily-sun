THABANG Machitje apparently stepped out to the spaza shop to buy a loose draw. There were only a few cigarettes at the shop in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, so his friend pushed him out of the way. A fight broke out and Thabang (39) was stabbed in the neck and died on the way to hospital on Sunday. Barney Msibi was saddened that his cousin was killed over a cigarette. Nelly (55) said the suspect was her son Thabang’s friend. “They grew up together. We’re wondering why he killed my only child,” Nelly told Daily Sun. She said Thabang was rushed to hospital in a neighbour’s car, which ran out of petrol on the way. An off-duty paramedic came out of nowhere to help Thabang, who died before the ambulance could reach hospital. “I’m devastated. Thabang was a soccer coach and dedicated his life to soccer,” she said. Residents were hurt by the incident as Thabang’s after school activities helped take their naughty kids off the streets. Said a resident: “The ban on the sale of cigarettes has put a strain on many smokers, and it’s sad that they have to fight for the little that’s available. “This was really unnecessary and the family has lost a loved one over a smoke.” Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that a case of murder was opened at KwaThema cop shop. “The victim and suspect had just bought cigarettes at a certain house in KwaThema,” said Masondo. “They allegedly argued and fought, and the suspect ended up stabbing the victim in the upper body. Masondo said the suspect was expected to appear in court soon.
