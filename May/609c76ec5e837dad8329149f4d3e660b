Mpumalanga police have strongly condemned an incident of domestic violence whereby a 39- year - old woman from Mbombela was shot and killed by his 42-year-old husband on Thursday evening. The incident happened when the husband arrived home from work. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the husband came home from work and asked to speak to his wife. "They stepped outside for a brief discussion, but the husband went back into the house and upon going back outside, he allegedly fatally shot his wife before turning the gun on himself and getting wounded," said Hlathi. Hlathi said the woman was unfortunately certified dead by the paramedics at the scene while the husband was rushed to hospital where he is under police guard. The woman leaves behind her three children. Last week, a 44- year-old Kabokweni man with a pending murder case committed in 2015, reportedly ended his life after strangling and stabbing his 44- year- old wife. Preliminary investigations suggest that this too, was a domestic violence related incident. Mpumalanga police boss, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma has since condemned the incident and pleaded with members of the community to refrain from using violence to resolve domestic issues. Zuma has indicated that people should stop perpetuating domestic violence against women and children. "They should evade violence but rather try to make use of available structures such as social workers, traditional leaders and other relevant structures to intervene as well as to resolve their matters amicably," he said. Hlathi said a case of murder has been opened and investigations are underway.
