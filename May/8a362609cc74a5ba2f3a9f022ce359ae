MEC of Health in the Western Cape Nomafrench Mbombo has
warned citizens to stop visiting malls as families during this period of
coronavirus pandemic. The MEC visited Khayelitsha Mall, where she went into big
supermarkets including SuperSpar and Shoprite. “When shoppers come for shopping at these supermarkets, they
must not come as the whole family because they end up exposing the whole family
to COVID-19,” said Mbombo after a walkabout at the mall. She said over 50 positive cases of the COVID-19 emanated from
a supermarket at the mall. Mbombo and Winde paid a visit to the mall to find out the
level of hygiene levels practiced at the shopping mall. Several SuperSpar workers are currently on isolation after
testing positive to COVID-19 but Mbombo said the hygiene levels that are being
practiced at the shop are of a good standard. “The shop owner has put some measures, for example, everyone
has to spray their hands as they enter the shop and ensured that every member
of the staff has got a mask. When you exit again you must spray your hands so
that you don’t take the virus with you,” the MEC said. The Western Cape has recorded six more deaths bringing the
current total number of coronavirus related deaths to 46. Winde admitted that the number of positive cases is
increasing in the province because of the robust testing. As the lockdown is set to be relaxed at midnight, the Premier
said people must not think that lockdown is over. “The rules still apply, don’t live your house without a mask,
and practice physical distancing,” he warned.
