Media personality, Somizi Somhale Mhlongo is furious and sickened by the behaviour of Black Twitter. This comes after Hamilton Ndlovu apologised for showing off his new luxurious cars on social media. Ndlovu stated that he realised that the video was in poor taste and appeared at a very unfortunate time in our country. Somizi saw this apology and it did not sit well with him. A post shared by Somizi (@somizi) on May 27, 2020 at 5:03am PDT He said he got more furious when he saw his apology in newspapers. "Instead of drawing inspiration from him, we're dragging him down. Other races are flourishing because they're pushing each other forward but we're pulling each other backwards because of a stupid slavery mentality," said Somizi. "I wish he didn't apologise. I refuse to apologise for spending what I've earned from my hard work," he added. These are some of the things he said on Instagram. Some individuals on Twitter did not like this and started calling upon his fall while some can see and understand his point. #SomiziMustFall has been trending with some stating that he's not acknowledging some of the things they've celebrated while some think he's underestimating the power of Black Twitter to correct "wrong behaviour". @UmalambaneZN said Somizi is the last person to be complaining about praising and even dragged Idols SA while at it. "How many times have we watched him ridicule black kids trying to put food on their families' tables on Idols?" he questioned. "So Somizi is falling because of saying Black Twitter must be made of positivity instead of negativity? You people are bored," Pretty tweeted. "You can scream #SomiziMustFall all you want but you know he's right! When you think of Black Twitter, you don't think of positive things, it's a place where people are constantly tearing each other down. At times it seems like fun and games but it's toxic," said King Jonas.
