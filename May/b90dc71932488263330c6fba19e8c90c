WITH pupils expected back at school next week, Angie Motshekga says no
schools will be opened without personal protective equipment. Speaking during a visit to Seshego Secondary in Olievenhoutbosch in
Tshwane, the basic education minister said only schools that had satisfied all
safety requirements would open on Monday. She said schools spent this week cleaning classrooms so they would be
ready for pupils. “Classes will be cleaned, and deliveries are beginning to arrive today,”
she said. On Monday, the minister said she was expecting schools to make sure
every child had their books and personal protective equipment was handed out. “We are working towards Monday because just re-orientating the space is
not easy. We are expecting on Monday and Tuesday, we can do inductions and
reorientation to make sure we can thoroughly deal with health issues,” she
said. Motshekga said she expected learning to resume on Wednesday. She said whoever
was ready on Monday had to reopen but if schools didn’t get their equipment,
the department would not force them to work without it. The announcement about the reopening of schools has received mixed
reactions from parents with some calling it careless and claiming their
children’s lives were being put in danger. Some parents have vowed not to send
their kids back to school. Parent Natasha van Heerden said nobody was expecting schools to stay
closed forever but next week was too soon. “We said wait until the winter passes, perhaps August,” she said. Mqombothi Nsizwa said the minister must be held accountable for sending
kids back to school early
