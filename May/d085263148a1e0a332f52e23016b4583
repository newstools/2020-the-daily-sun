THE government’s Covid-19 Relief Fund, which was announced by Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa last month, has gone a long way in helping Banyana Banyana defender Bongeka Gamede. Mthethwa announced the R150 million relief fund in a bid to soften the heavy economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic after the cancellation, or suspension, of sporting events. The department said the money due to athletes who meet the qualifying criteria, will be capped at R20 000. Several Banyana players, who met the criteria, confirmed that they have received their monies from the government. Gamede is one of the few who benefited as she is idling at home with no work. The University of Western Cape Tourism student is currently at home in KwaZulu-Natal after she left the campus due to the virus outbreak. Talking to SunSport yesterday, Gamede said she received money from the fund, and it has come in handy for her family since her parents are no longer going to work. “Yes, I did receive the fund and it is helping a lot. I am the one who is taking care of the family,” said Gamede who will be turning 21 tomorrow. “Since the lockdown my parents have not been working, so there’s no income for them.” Other notable Banyana players who have benefited from the fund are veteran defender Noko Matlou, Amanda Mthandi‚ Kaylin Swart‚ Kholosa Biyana‚ Leandra Smeda‚ Lebohang Ramalepe‚ Mapaseka Mpuru‚ Pride Nthite‚ Robyn Moodaly‚Tiisetso Makhubela‚ Xiluva Tshabalala‚ Noxolo Cesane‚ Nomvula Kgoale‚ Neliswa Luthuli‚ Jessica Williams and goalkeeper coach Monde Hlatswayo. Gamede also opened up about some of her experiences and challenges regarding the roll-out of online studying. She stated: “Online studying has not been easy for me. So far the main challenge I have been experiencing is network problems, and some days I end up not attending classes due to that.”
