Nombulelo Mhlongo always wanted to be the best. She studied at one of the world’s most respected acting schools, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, in 2010. The 28-year-old from Pongola in KZN told SunBuzz: “I knew I was going to study so I could be one of the best actresses in South Africa. “I just didn’t think it would happen so soon. It’s fulfilling to see my hard work, sweat and tears were worth it.” She grew up in a village, and all she ever wanted was to be the women she saw on TV. “I loved watching TV so much because acting fascinated me. “I’d always beg my parents to take me to acting classes. After matric I knew acting was the way to go and I applied for school abroad.” She came back to Mzansi in 2013 and has been in various productions such as Skeem Saam and Ifalakhe. “When I got back I got lots of theatre gigs. The first was John Kani’s Nothing But The Truth and other productions. “My first TV appearance was on Skeem Saam as Cassandra Masemola in 2016. I took a break and hosted acting classes at the Market Theatre. “I came up with a project called Pan African Arts Space, where I taught youngsters about writing, reading, music and drama.” She now is playing Nomcebo Meyiwa on Uzalo. “I’m honoured to play Cebo because she’s been through a lot. “She had Khehla, played by Thobani Nzuza, at a young age and ran away from home to raise the child. “But we’re going to see a different side of Nomcebo in coming episodes. An evil side will surface.”
