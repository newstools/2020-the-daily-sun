A 17-year-old teenager was allegedly involved in the brutal murder of his father on Thursday at Roerfontein Village in Sekgosese outside Giyani. The boy was arrested in Brooklyn, Pretoria. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the arrest of the suspect follows an intensive search operation by the police after the gruesome discovery of the body. Upon arrival, she reportedly found the body under burnt rubbish with corrugated iron on top. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, has commended the detectives for arresting the suspect within a short space of time and further indicated that the law must take its course. He, however, raised a concern about the age of the suspect and has consequently called on all community members, especially parents, to exercise their responsibilities of properly raising the children. The police are working together with Probation Officers in this case and the case docket will be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecution for further processing in terms of the Child Justice Act. The suspect is expected to appear in Tiyani Magistrates Court on a charge of murder. Mojapelo said the motive behind the incident is still being investigated.
