American designer Mark Jacobs once said: "To me clothing is a form of self-expression. There are hints of who you are in what you wear." We often forget that underwear is an item of clothing, and the fact that it's the first item of clothing we put on means we need to change the perception we have of them. Underwear has become a deciding factor on whether or not you're going to be getting some action from your partner. According to Muscle and Fitness Magazine, underwear plays an important role in sex: "Depending on what you’re wearing, your lady will either assume that you’re game for a roll in the sack or having an asexual reproduction day." Simply put, the difference between you getting some action could be determined by your last item of clothing. A study done at the University of Montreal revealed that most men respond sexually to women wearing sexy lingerie. The study also revealed that women were also turned on by men who wore sexy and tight underwear. Dressing for "sexy success" as they would call it, underwear plays a significant role in a couple's sex life. It brings that much needed heat inside the bedroom and keeps things interesting. So the next time you put on your underwear, have this powerful quote in mind by Dr Steven R. Convey: "Always begin with end in mind."
