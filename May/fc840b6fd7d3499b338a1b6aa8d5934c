Khayelitsha Metro cops base has been closed for the second time in the space of less than a month due to coronavirus infections. On the 20thof April, the Metro cop depot in Mandela Park was closed for disinfection after a cop tested positive. But it had to be closed again yesterday after the cop who had been infected last month came back to work without following the proper procedures. Richard Bosman, Executive Director for Safety and Security said officers who have been in contact with him are self-isolating. Speaking to Sunteam Bosman said the officer was supposed to have had a follow-up test before returning to work but this was not the case. “There has not been another case of a staff member testing positive for Coronavirus. The staff member who tested positive a few weeks ago,returned to work without following protocols and going for follow up tests. He has since returned to the hospital for the follow up tests and upon medical advice, the facility was sanitised and deep cleaned again,”said Bosman. Though the depot has been closed for decontamination,services are still being rendered to the community by staff who have not had contact with the infected person. Western Cape currently has 5813 positive and is leading across allMzansi provinces. Khayelitsha is one of the Western Cape hot spots with 736 positive cases. Last week minister of Police Bheki Cele said the country has 253 cops who tested positive of coronavirus with 178 of the total number are from Western Cape. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to visit the province this week where he will meet the provincial leadership to discuss about the pandemic.
