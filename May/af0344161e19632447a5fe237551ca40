ACTOR and singer Zakhele Msibi wants people to know he’s alive and well. This after rumours circulated on social media that he died. Popularly known as Bra Nkebs, the former Isibaya actor said he was shocked when he woke up to news on Wednesday that he was dead. Speaking to Daily Sun, Bra Nkebs said his brother Ernest alerted him to the rumours. “My brother sent me a screenshot of a Facebook post that I am dead. “Someone posted this on the Ladies House Facebook page,” he said. “I was shocked and as I was trying to process it, calls from my friends and family started coming in. They were worried thinking I was dead.” Bra Nkebs said people must know he’s alive and kicking.   “Unfortunately, she hasn’t responded. I need to get to the bottom of this. People cannot be spreading lies like this and get away with it,” said Bra Nkebs. He said perhaps people were missing him.  “I’m assuming people want me back on TV. I am working behind the scenes, directing three short films and I’ll be dropping new music. “So if they miss me, they’ll see me soon,” said Bra Nkebs.
