SANGOMA Nongoku Makenana has seven tortoises, which she uses to treat sick people. The 88-year-old from Gugulethu told Daily Sun she left Eastern Cape in 1985 with one of the tortoises and it laid six eggs in Cape Town. Ramaphosa: the worst is still coming! The gogo said her ancestors worked through them. “I use the tortoises for my sangoma tasks because my ancestors come to me through them. “Without them, I don’t have guidance.” She said she healed people by having them bathe in the kak and pee of the creatures. She couldn’t go to her clients’ houses without the tortoises she wouldn’t have powers.  “All my sangoma work is done through these creatures. They link me with my ancestors. I understand their language. Just from the movement of a tortoise, I can tell there’s a person coming to me for help. When I go to a client’s house, the sound the tortoise makes tells me what kind of a problem is in that house.” The gogo said when she left the Eastern Cape with the first tortoise, she didn’t know it was pregnant. She said it laid three eggs and later laid three more. The tortoises ate cabbage and vegetables, and she left them huge dishes of water outside to cool off when it got hot.
