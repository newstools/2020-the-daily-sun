THANDO Mbatha said her year would be complete if she met singer Lady Zamar. She said she would love to have lunch with her. This is because the 28-year-old from Ncekwane Village outside Empangeni, northern KZN, looks almost identical to her role model. She told Daily Sun people stopped her to ask if she was Lady Zamar. “They ask for autographs and to take pictures with me. They don’t believe me when I tell them I’m not Lady Zamar and become disappointed. I ignored this for a long time, but wondered who was Lady Zamar and made it a mission to find out.” ALSO READ: ARROWS DEFENDER PASSES ON! Thando said she tried to inbox her on Facebook, but was not successful. “I thought it was time I step up my game. You’ll find that we have a lot more in common than just meets the eye,” she said. Thando, who moved to Joburg after the lockdown regulations were eased to start a new job, said meeting Lady Zamar would be a dream come true. “I would be happy to be her friend if we like each other. I have become her number one fan. I follow her on all her social media platforms. “I sometimes steal her pictures and put them on my WhatsApp status and people can’t tell the difference,” she said. Thando is a psychology graduate from the University of Zululand and now works as a social worker in Joburg. She got a job after looking for three years. “If I meet Lady Zamar, this year would be my greatest,” she said. Daily Sun couldn’t get hold of Lady Zamar at the time of going to print.
