MizzB MY boyfriend doesn’t work and he complains about everything. I only found out he smoked weed and drank alcohol when I was pregnant, and I hate it. When it comes to sex, he forces himself on me even when I don’t feel like it. When I try to talk to him, he accuses me of sleeping with someone else. If it wasn’t for my daughter, I’d dump him. I seriously don’t know what to do. Please help me. Hey Sista You’re in an abusive relationship! It’s admirable you want your daughter to be raised by both parents. But staying in such an environment will harm her. Your daughter is learning that it’s okay for a woman to be treated in that way. Kids learn through observation. Sometimes we stay for them, not knowing that leaving can benefit them and help them grow emotionally.
