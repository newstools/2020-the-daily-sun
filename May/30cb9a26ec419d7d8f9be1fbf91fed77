MANY soccer followers in the Mzansi diski circles still do not know a lot about successful coach Pitso "Jingles" Mosimane...and his bond with Mamelodi Sundowns. Mosimane, the most successful SA coach, was already a SANDAWANA as far back as 1984.  He had three spells with the Brazilians as a player... After he made his professional debut for Jomo Cosmos, Mosimane was snapped upÂ  by the Brazilians around 1985 - he then went back to Cosmos before returning to the Brazilians two years later. Mosimane then played for Orlando Pirates before he took his career to Greece, signing for Ionikos. When he returned home, he reunited with Sundowns around 1997, where he would end his playing career. He also played and scored a couple of goals for Bafana Bafana. So, many soccer followers in the country do not understand and know the bond Mosimane has with Sundowns...it stretches back to around 1983-84. Mosimane is a bonafide Sandawana through and through...
