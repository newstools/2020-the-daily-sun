SIX suspects are now behind bars after they were bust for hijacking a delivery truck transporting cellphones. The goods were recovered in Phomolong in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. Captain Kay Makhubele said the security guards escorting the truck were shot at by four men in an Audi A4. “The security guards retreated and took cover,” he said. “Police followed up on information, which led to the recovery of the stolen goods and the truck in Tembisa.” Police approached the truck and four suspects ran away, but one of them was arrested. “The driver, found in the back of the truck, told the police he was hijacked in Alberton,” he said. Makhubele said the suspects will appear in the Midrand Magistrates Court soon. Makhubele said the hijacked truck, which had been transporting soap and sanitisers, was recovered at the premises. “When police arrived at the premises, eight suspects were arrested and some of the items in the truck were recovered,” he said. The truck was allegedly hijacked in Midrand last week. The cops raided premises in Erasmia which they believed were selling fong kong goods and cigarettes. “When police arrived they found the owner, who allowed them to search the premises,” he said. “During their search police recovered sealed and opened boxes of cigarettes and the owner was arrested.” Makhubele said the owner of the business would be charged with dealing in counterfeit goods. “The arrested suspects will appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon,” said Makhubele.
