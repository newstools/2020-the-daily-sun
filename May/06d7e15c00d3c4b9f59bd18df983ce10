Two suspects were arrested for being in possession of boxes
of chicken which were looted from a truck that was hijacked in Monwood Drive,
in Browns Farm, Cape Town. Cops spokesman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said police were
alerted to the scene and apprehended the two suspects. She said a third suspect was also arrested for attacking
police after the members were pelted with stones. Rwexana said the suspects aged between 17 and 28 are scheduled
for a court appearance soon for the possession of stolen property and attack on
police. Mlungisi Mqikela, a 45-year-old resident, said when they
heard about the hijacked truck with chicken boxes they never thought they will
see people with those boxes. “We work with SAPS to end crime and the best way to do that
is by reporting any criminal activities happening in our areas", said
Mqikela. Another resident, Ayabulela Duze, (36) said seeing criminals
being arrested for breaking the law gives them hope. “This will also teach
young people who want to be involved in bad things that they will end in jail,”
said Duze. He told Daily Sun that if the community members can stop
buying stolen goods the criminals will stop robbing or hijacking people. “They are involved in crime because they know there are
people who will support them., if we can report them instead of supporting them
our communities can be a better place", said Duze. He said SAPS should continue doing a good job. "They respond early, that alone shows they are serious
about ending crimes and putting bad guys behind bars, if they continue doing
like this then we will continue reporting crime every time we see something
suspicious”, said Duze.
