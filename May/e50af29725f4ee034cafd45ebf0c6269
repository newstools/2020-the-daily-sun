THIRTEEN suspects were arrested in Mbentse Village in Qumbu, Eastern Cape, on Thursday. This followed the murder of four men on Wednesday. The four victims, aged between 20 and 22, were found with bullet wounds to their upper bodies. The dead, believed to be from Luxeni in Qumbu, were discovered by a herdsman taking his cattle to a dipping tank in Mbentse Village at about 7am on Wednesday. The herdsmen then alerted the community of the gruesome discovery. The motive for the killing is not yet known. Police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said a 9mm pistol with 21 rounds, believed to have been used in the crime, was confiscated. The four suspects, aged between 29 and 67 years old, are expected to appear in the Qumbu Magistrates Court tomorrow. They face four counts of murder and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Eastern Cape acting provincial commissioner Major-General Andre Swart condemned the gruesome murder and commended the members for the speedy arrest.
