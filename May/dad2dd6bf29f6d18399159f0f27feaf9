JOY Motswi is afraid his business, the Lehlabile Health Shop, will soon go under. The 32-year-old from Seshego zone 3 outside Polokwane, Limpopo, told Daily Sun his profits have gone down by almost 75% since lockdown started. He said he sold medicine, but only schedules 0 and 1, which meant customers didn’t have to have prescriptions and helped residents who couldn’t get to town when they were sick. “Now they can’t come to my shop as their movements are restricted. My business is suffering. I might be forced to close down,” he said. Joy said in an effort to save his business, he started doing home deliveries. “The home deliveries are also impacting me because I need to have petrol, airtime and data at all times. Sometimes it’s a challenge because some customers order a few products, but I have to compromise,” he said. Joy said the products he sold included cough remedies, supplements, cosmetics, pregnancy tests and sexual boosters. He also did ear and nose piercings. He said he used to make a decent living, but lockdown has affected him badly. “It’s a struggle to make ends meet because I have bills to pay and a family to look after,” he said. But Joy said he saw light at the end of the tunnel as he believed things would get better once level three started. “I believe my business will pick up as people will be allowed to move around. They will be able to come to my shop. I miss my interactions with them.”
