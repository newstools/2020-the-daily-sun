STRUGGLING Kaizer Chiefs striker Lazalous Kambole needs to show a calm head and not put himself under pressure. That is the advice from his Zambian countryman and Chiefs goal scoring legend Collins Mbesuma who added that Kambole needs time but he believed he would produce the goods. The Zambian international striker joined Amakhosi from Zambian giants Zesco United this season and a lot was expected from him. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has given the 26-year-old enough chances to showcase his much talked about talent, but the Lusaka-born star has struggled at the Soweto giants. Kambole has failed to find the back of the net for Chiefs and fans are starting to lose patience with him. “Chiefs are a big team and there is a lot of pressure,” he said. “When I joined Chiefs in 2004 I struggled in the beginning but after I scored, everything came right. I think Lazalous must keep calm. This (loss of form) happens to anyone when he is in a new environment. Lazalous will adapt and will show his best soon. All he needs is to score one goal.” Mbesuma scored a record 35 goals in all competitions with Amakhosi in the 2004-05 season. Added Mbesuma, who was voted Player of the Season in 2004-05: “Lazalous has played in African Champions League and won many trophies in Zambia. I speak to him and all Zambian players in South Africa all the time. And I give them advice.”
