THE City of
Cape town says garbage collection in some areas will be affected after two of
its refuse collection depots closed due to coronavirus. Two staff
members from Woodstock Collections Depot tested positive and one staff member
from Mitchells Plain Collections Depot has tested positive as well. The
municipality said two of the affected staff were office-based, and one staff
member was part of the refuse removal crew. The
temporary closure would lead to refuse collection delays in areas serviced by
the affected depots. “Residents
are asked to please bear with us as COVID-19 mitigation measures, especially in
the case of a confirmed infection amongst our staff, will have an impact on
service delivery from time to time. The City has contingencies in place to
ensure that operations and service delivery continue as far as possible while
ensuring the health and safety of our staff during this time, as well as the
health and safety of the public we serve,” the City of Cape Town said. The depots
are closed for at least three days to allow deep cleaning and disinfecting of
the buildings and vehicles have been completed. Those who
have been in close contact with the staff members are being required to
self-quarantine. The City
said the services in affected areas should be able to resume from next week. The area
affected by this temporary closure includes Langa, Ndabeni, Dunoon, Maitland,
Cape Town CBD, Sea Point, and many other places. Langa resident Nomusa Makeleni (35) said he
was not aware of the developments but she had noticed that garbage trucks were
not picking out their bins
