Drugs worth R1 million were found in a house in Robertsham. The JMPD spokesperson, superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun that the male suspect in his mid-40s was renting the house where the drugs were manufactured in the garage. He said officers were conducting a joint intelligence-driven operation when they busted the suspect. "Officers received a tip-off and immediately went to the property where they found dishes and homemade equipment which were used in the mixing of chemicals to make drugs commonly known as Crystal Meth," he said.  "The suspect will appear in the Booysens Magistrates Court soon facing charges of possession, dealing and manufacturing narcotic drugs," said Minnaar.  The Gauteng Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela warned those who think that normal day to day police operations are at the back burner due to lockdown, to think again. "I commend officers for the sterling collaborative effort and if anyone knows of any criminal activities.‚Äù Mawela urged the public to call the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or submit tip-offs through the MySAPS App.
