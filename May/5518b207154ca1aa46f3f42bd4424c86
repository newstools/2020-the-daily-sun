FREE State police have launched a massive manhunt for the killers of nurse Stephen Mogoasi (54). Stephen was gunned down at his home in Bloemspruit, Mangaung, on Tuesday night. He was returning home from Mediclinic Bloemfontein, where he worked, when he was shot on the day the world celebrated International Nurses Day. He died while being rushed to hospital. The SunTeam could not get hold of Stephen’s family for comment. Mediclinic Bloemfontein spokeswoman Barbara Steenkamp expressed shock at the sudden death of their member. She described Stephen as a kind man who respected every one. Steenkamp told Daily Sun: “Stephen Mogoasi was a Mediclinic Bloemfontein employee for 18 years. He was very caring and was highly respected by his colleagues and the patients he came in contact with. Stephen was incredibly hardworking and he will be dearly missed.”  Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the manhunt for the suspects has been launched. Makhele told Daily Sun: “The Bloemspruit police are investigating a murder case after there was a shooting at one of the plots in Hendrick Potgieter Street, where a 54-year-old victim was shot. It happened upon his arrival at home after getting out of his car at about 9.30pm. There was a second shot which was fired and apparently it did not hit him. “Suspects fled from the scene on foot. We are still hunting for the suspects and are appealing to anyone with information to please contact the Bloemspruit cop shop or nearest cop shop.
