WITH the government slowly easing lockdown restrictions, millions of people are expected to return to work soon. And as most will be using public transport, Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula inspected buses in Tshwane on Friday. Mbalula visited the municipal Areyeng buses and the Putco depot in Daspoort, Tshwane, to check whether they were following regulations. He said he was impressed by the measures taken by the municipality and Putco to ensure all passengers were protected from the coronavirus. “The measures put in place by the City of Tshwane are impressive. Buses go through deep sanitisation before trips, and social distancing is maintained on buses,” he said. Mbalula said it had been made clear that social distancing and masks were required. Seats were marked to ensure people knew where to sit. “I advise people to buy two masks so they can use one while they are washing the other one,” he said. The minister said South Africans were law abiding and had been following regulations. He said they did this not because they were scared of the president and the police, but because they understood the world was under attack. Mbaula also reassured the taxi industry that government would assist with losses suffered during lockdown. “We’re working and in few weeks, we will relate information on how we must assist those who have suffered losses during this time,” he said. During his visit to the Putco depot, the minister also received masks and protective gear from the Royal Danish Embassy to give to bus operators. He said the donation would go a long way in protecting people. Mbalula vowed to continue monitoring bus companies to ensure they were following regulations.
