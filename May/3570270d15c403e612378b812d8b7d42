COMEDIAN Mbulelo Msongelwa doesn’t regret quitting his job as a salesman. He’s happy he found something that matters to him. Mbu (38), as he’s known in comedy circles, used to work in a furniture store. The funnyman from Mdantsane in Port Elizabeth said a week before he resigned, he missed auditions for the TV show, So You Think You Are Funny. “I was very angry at a colleague for refusing to swap with me on the day of auditions,” Mbu told SunBuzz.. “Instead he gave me an ultimatum to go to the audition or keep my job. The following week I resigned.” It’s been 10 years since he quit, and he has no regrets. Mbu said after eight years of trying to penetrate the industry, he got his breakthrough when he was chosen as one of 13 comedians featured on Trevor Noah Presents NationWild in 2018. Mbu, who delivers some of his material in Afrikaans, said when he plans his sets he prepares only the first and last joke. The rest is directed by the energy from the audience. “If you speak a language that’s understood by your audience, you’ll make them feel relaxed,” said Mbu.
