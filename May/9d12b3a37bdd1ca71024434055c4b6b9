HE may be seen as heartless and selfish on Uzalo, but he’s a loving father in real life. After his baby mama died in 2018, Wiseman Ncube promised himself their daughter, Lwandle (6) would not feel her absence. READ: THE 5 DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUNANIS! The award-winning actor, who plays Sbonelo Mhlongo on the SABC1’s soapie, said: “I made a promise that I’ll do everything in my power to raise Lwandle in a Godly and responsible way. I don’t want her to feel that she has one parent. I give her all the love and make it a point to spend my free time with her.” But he told Daily Sun he was not comfortable about going into detail about how Lwandle’s mum died. “That part is too personal to me. But I believe she’s watching us, her spirit is always with us and she is a good ancestor to Lwandle,” said Wiseman. He said raising a girl child was not a walk in the park.  “She’s an adorable and smart young lady. But taking care of her is not easy. My daughter has a lot of questions. I’m able to answer some of them, but others are beyond difficult. She’s too curious,” he said. Although he’s a single father, Wiseman said he had help from his mum and brothers. “I’m lucky that my mum is still alive. I trust that she will help me raise Lwandle into a teenager. Lwandle lives with me and I leave her with some of my brothers when I go to work. “She’s always in good hands,” he said. The love that he has for his daughter is even evident on social media, as his Instagram page is full of her photos.
