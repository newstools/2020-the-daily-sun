MISSING teen Andile “Bobo” Mbuthu’s family says there will possibly be more arrests. A video showing Bobo (16) being assaulted was filmed before the teen went missing. His uncle Ntobeko Ngidi was in the Verulam Magistrates Court yesterday. Mlungisi Thabethe (28), Andile Nhleko (27), Mncedisi Mzobe (27), Siyanda Msweli (26), Lindani Ndlovu (22) and Melusi Mthembu (27) appeared on a video call in court for kidnapping. A seventh suspect aged 16 didn’t appear. Their lawyer Chris Gounden said they were forced to sign blank statements. Ntobeko (49) told Daily Sun more people were involved. There was a rumour a top cop helped the suspects get rid of the body. “I can’t talk much about that. The matter is with cops,” he said. “We’re waiting for DNA results, which we’ve been told will be ready within three weeks.” Residents carrying placards with “Justice for Bobo” written on them gathered outside court. They didn’t want the suspects to be granted on bail. Magistrate Rajesh Parshotam postponed the matter to Tuesday for Gounden to apply that his clients be allowed to physically appear in court. Gounden also wanted to see their statements. After the video went viral, angry residents of Hambanathi kasi torched Magagula Tavern in Tongaat, north of Durban, where the attack apparently took place.
