IT’S a war over panties on the washing line. “I’m tired of my neighbour hanging panties for my husband to see. She wants my man,” Mbuyiselo Dlalisa (40) told Daily Sun. Single next-door neighbour Beauty Leballo lives alone in a house separated from Mbuyiselo’s by a washing line. Said Mbuyiselo, who lives in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni: “We used to get along, but she’s always been after my man. She told me I’m lucky to have him.” She distanced herself when it continued. “Lockdown came and she started hanging panties on the line,” said Mbuyiselo, whose husband apparently finds this strange. She said she knows when a woman wants a man. “She comes up with all kinds of tricks. If I could get Beauty arrested I would,” she said. Beauty (35) apparently told Mbuyiselo where to get off when Mbuyiselo confronted her. Mbuyiselo’s man Hlanganani (45) said: “When I step out of the door I see them. I can’t miss them. It makes me uncomfortable.” He said he loves his wife of eight years. “If she’s trying to get my attention she can forget it. I won’t make a move.” Beauty said: “I have no need for a man who’s taken. I have men who’d die to be with me. Mbuyiselo should get a life!”
