SAFA boss Danny Jordaan has written a letter to Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa requesting his intervention in helping frustrated South African players in Europe to come back home. Bongani Zungu, Lebo Phiri, Percy Tau, Lebo Mothiba, Keagan Dolly and many others, which include Banyana Banyana players, are unable to travel back home due to the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. Zungu, Phiri, Mothiba and Dolly are all based in France, while Tau is in Belgium. Jordaan told SunSport yesterday that he has written to the minister seeking his support to get seats for the players in one of the flights that will be flying out of London to Mzansi next week Saturday. “I have spoken to Zungu and Phiri on Saturday and they desperately want to come back home. It’s not a joke,” Jordaan said. “I’ve sent a letter to the minister to help these players to get out of Europe. As we all know, Zungu’s team was relegated and he is now looking for a team, hence he wants to come back home. “He wants to work on his search for a team at home. He’s now struggling to get out of France.” Efforts to get comment from Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula on what kind of support government would give to help such desperate players were not fruitful. “France has decided to shut down the season and that has affected Zungu badly,” added Jordaan.” It is unclear when will the lockdown end in France, as they plan on extending it as they fear the coronavirus infection rates will rise after restrictions rules are relaxed. Euronews reports that France may have to impose a further period of confinement.
