According to cops spokeswoman sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana the two officers who hold a sergeant rank committed the alleged offense a year ago. Both officers, aged 32 and 35  are stationed at Manenberg cop shop on the Cape Flats. “Members from the Anti-Corruption Unit arrested two colleagues following allegations of corruption by a complainant against the sergeants aged 32 and 35 stationed at Manenberg police station. It is alleged that on 2019-06-15 the members visited the complainant’s home in Athlone and accused him of printing and selling passports,” Rwexana said. They took him to the cop shop and seized his laptop and cellular telephones. “It is alleged that the cops then demanded money in order to release him, but he only toldthem that he has only R5000 at his house. “They took him to his home and returned his laptop and cellular telephones in return for theR5000 he paid,” said Rwexana. The matter was later reported and the two cops were investigated and were arrested on Sunday. “The matter was reported and investigated by the Anti-Corruption Unit, and after the Athlone Magistrate’s court issued an arrest warrant, the members were arrested yesterday at Manenberg police station and made their court appearances today,” said Rwexana.
