Producer, Dr Duda has started teaching young producers more about producing. He started his first lesson on Tuesday. He announced these classes last Wednesday, saying he wants to help young boys who are producing in their own kasis. Dr Duda said the producers from ekasi inspire him because they make something big from nothing, meaning they don't have much equipment but they make great songs."I always tell them 'yo guys you inspire me because you remind me of where I started'. And then they'd say I inspire them instead. Big ups to them because they make hits out of nothing," he said.On his first lesson on Tuesday, he asked people to tag other producers whom they know are struggling with mixing.
