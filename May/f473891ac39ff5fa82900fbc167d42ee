Sadu Hlongo’s visit to the local clinic with a flu has led to the community of Makhuvele Block C in Collins Chabane Municipality to start mistreating and discriminating against her. The 51-year-old’s crime is that health officials visited her home in an ambulance to test her for Covid-19 because she had flu. “I had a terrible flu and decided to visit the local clinic; I was given flu remedy. I went back home as usual. I was suprised when a day later I was visited by an ambulance with people who tested me for Covid-19,” said Hlongo. Hlongo told Daily Sun that it happened on 24 April and she has never received any results. “I was told that if the results came back positive, they will come back. So since then they never returned.” She said that on 5 May, she went to Saselamani to receive child grant and everyone in the public transport started moving far away from her. “I entered the taxi and everyone got out; until another person told me that they heard that I have corona. “I was shocked because I have never received results of Covid-19 which said I was positive.” Hlongo’s life has turned into horror as everyone jn the village runs away from her. She cannot even go to collect water from the village tap. “I need help; I cannot take it anymore. My family is tormented by people who say nasty things about us when they pass by,” said the Gogo. Limpopo Provincial Health Department spokesperson Neil Shikwambana says that stigmatizing corona will lead to people not coming out to seek help and this will risk the lives of many people. “We must learn to accept that Covid-19 will affect all of us and to stigmatize people who did the test for Covid-19 is not assisting against the fight.”
