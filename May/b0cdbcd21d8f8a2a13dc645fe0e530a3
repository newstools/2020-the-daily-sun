Lindiwe Ntumbe (32) is looking for Pretty Mbali Mbatha who disappeared four years ago. Lindiwe said Mbali left behind her daughter who is now eight years old. She said the young girl is always asking about her mother. She said when Mbali last saw her daughter she was four years old and now she is eight years old and doing Grade 3. She said Mbali who was a girlfriend to her brother used to come and visit her daughter every month end while she was working in Jozi. Lindiwe from Tweefontein 'H' said Mbali is originally from KwaNongoma in KZN. She said she was working in Springs and rented a olacr in Tsakane. She said she wants to know whether she is still alive or not because her baby misses her a lot. "Mbali used to visit her daughter every month end. Sometimes she would take her daughter with her to visit her place in Gauteng and bring her back. She did that until 2016 in July then she disappeared." "I tried to call her many times but her cellphone was always on voicemail. Now her little girl wants her because she knows her. I don't know what to tell her because I don't know the whereabout of her mother," she said. "All I want is for Mbali to respond and come to visit her baby because she is always asking about her. We have tried many times to call her workplace but they also don't know her whereabouts." "Her bosses told me that Mbali just disappeared and she never made any claims for money at work. They said they are also in the dark and will wait for her to come back," she said. Lindiwe told Daily Sun that she also called the Mastandi where Mbali used to stay in Tsakane but they didn't know her whereabout. She said she also called her family in KZN but they also didn't know where she is. "I don't know which direction to take to look for her. I did not report her at the police because I thought she may have disappeared with another man." Lindiwe said anyone with information should contact her at: 072 311 8759.
