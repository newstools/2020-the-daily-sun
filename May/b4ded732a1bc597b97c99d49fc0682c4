The Gauteng High Court in Pretoria has ruled in favour of an urgent application brought on behalf of the family of Collins Khosa who was killed in Alexandra, Joburg. Yesterday afternoon (Friday), the court had ordered that those present when Khosa was allegedly assaulted and died as a result of the assault must be suspended pending the investigation. Khosa was allegedly killed by members of SANDF in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg.SANDF members allegedly entered Khosaâ€™s yard with sjamboks and accused him of breaking the lockdown regulations. He was allegedly poured with beer on top of his head and on his body, while his hand was held behind his back, choked, slammed against the cement wall, hit with the butt of the machine gun; kicked, slapped, punched on his face and on his stomach and ribs. In a letter from the family to President Cyril Ramaphosa it was revealed that the father of three's death is directly related to the assault by the members of the SANDF. The Khosa's family lawyers had argued the ministers of Police and of defence had failed to take steps to prevent illegal action by law enforcement officials, adding their public statement defended, downplayed and encouraged the use of force. They said the defence minister had particularly failed to condemn brutality by law enforcement officials. The family also believes the minister is putting the blame on civilians for the brutality.
