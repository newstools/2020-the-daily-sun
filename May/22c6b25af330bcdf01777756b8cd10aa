Cops saw we were are struggling and they helped us.”  He said young people didn’t listen to them and they always wanted to enter forcibly. “It will be like this for the whole week. We’re worried that we’ll get infected because when they want to get inside, they forget about social distancing,” said the guard. Gogo Nomvo Stemele (67) said she arrived at the mall as early as 5am just to be in the front. “I know the lines are long but these young stars are not making things easy for us. It’s our day but they’re pushing to get inside. We’re old and we don’t have the energy they have, so we just left them and went back home without getting our money.” Madala Mzulungile Xhaka (69) said he was ready to go home. “Before the cops came in to help I, was ready to go home. But as soon as I saw them, I decided to stay.” One of the cops said they saw how people were behaving and they decided to help.
