 City Power has warned that it may be forced to cut electricity to
certain areas of Johannesburg for six hours per day due to the proliferation of
illegal connections placing strain on its infrastructure as winter demand
spikes. Load rotation takes place when the utility stops providing electricity
to an area as a preventative measure to shield its equipment from being
overloaded and damaged. This is caused by heightened winter demand, together
with the growth in illegal connections. Unlike load shedding, City Power says load rotation only affects
specified areas that are experiencing extremely high demand. In a statement on Thursday morning, City power said that it would only
implement these cuts as a "last resort". "City Power will, where necessary, implement load rotation in areas
that are experiencing repeated power outages as a result of overloading caused
by, among other things, illegal connections." "This is done to protect the whole substation from blowing up." The utility said that the cuts would be implemented every day between 4
p.m. and 10 p.m. in areas where monitoring suggests infrastructure is at risk.
It asked residents to reduce power, especially during the peak hours between 4
p.m. and 10 p.m. SOURCE: NEWS24
