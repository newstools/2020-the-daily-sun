RESIDENTS have long waited for services. For some months, they had no water. Now they’ve decided to do it for themselves because Capricorn District Municipality is not helping them. They are now contributing money from their own pockets to buy water pipes for their connections. The residents have divided themselves into six groups. Each group is made up 20 households and they contribute R500. The residents of Ga-Rakgoatha Village outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo say they were tired of pushing wheelbarrows to fetch water from the mainline. “Pushing wheelbarrows makes our lives difficult because we can’t get enough water for our families. We’ve been pleading with our municipality to help us by connecting pipes which will provide water to our home taps. But no one came on board to assist,” said resident Merriam Ledwaba (50). Alfred Dolo (45) said the water shortage has really compromised their safety during the coronavirus pandemic. “It’s shocking to see people doing it for themselves, digging up holes for installation of water pipes which they bought with their own money while there’s a municipality responsible for that,” he said. Capricorn spokesman Moffat Senyatsi said only 89% of the district population has access to water. “It’s unfortunate that some parts of Zebediela are the hardest hit in the remaining 11% that is without water, including new backlogs that are created by breakdowns that require refurbishments.” Senyatsi said that interim measures have been put in place through Lepelle-Nkumpi Municipality to make water tanks available o supply the residents with water at certain intervals. “We understand that access to water is a right and no one should be without water,” he said.
