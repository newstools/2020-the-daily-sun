RESIDENTS of Diphale Village fear the coronavirus is stalking them. This comes after 13 mineworkers at the nearby Marula Platinum Mine, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, tested positive for the virus. Concerned resident Timothy Phala (58) told Daily Sun he is worried the virus will kill villagers. “I’m shocked that coronavirus cases have been found at the mine. We believe that if the mine didn’t continue with operations, we would not be talking about this virus in our villages today,” he said. Timothy said he felt the government and the mine didn’t listen to workers’ concerns. He said the government had failed poor villagers by allowing the mine to continue operating. “This virus is too deadly and it needs not chances. It worries us a lot that the mine has been on our soil for years but we continue to struggle. Both the government and the mine have denied us clean water and proper roads for years,” he said. Comfort Moropa (26) said he believed the new cases were caused by people recently being allowed to move between provinces. He said now that the virus had hit the villages, they didn’t know how they could protect themselves as there was a water shortage. “No one cares for us and it looks like we are going to die shocking deaths,” he said. Speaking in Polowkane on Saturday, health MEC Phophi Ramathuba said the government and ministerial task team would have a virtual meeting with mine bosses. “Through the meeting, we hope to come up with a clear way forward on how the government and mines will work together to protect the lives of the workers,” she said.
