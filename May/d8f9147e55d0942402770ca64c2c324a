IN-FORM Baroka FC young striker Evidence “Tower” Makgopa says he can’t wait for the Absa Premiership to resume after the coronavirus pandemic. The PSL has been suspended since 23 March due to worldwide Covid-19 crisis. And before the league was halted, the 19-year-old, who was promoted to the first team in February by Bakgaga head coach Dylan Kerr, was in a good shape and form, netting three goals in four matches. Makgopa’s form helped the Ga-Mphahlele outfit reach the Nedbank Cup semi-finals. Kerr will also put his trust in Makgapo to help his side fight relegation as they’re now perched 13th on the log with 23 points, with six matches remaining. They are only three points ahead of their neighbours Black Leopards, who are propping up the table in last position. And now the Lebowakgomo-born budding star, who is at home training alone, told SunSport that he is raring to go and continue with his form. “It’s tough sitting at home and training on you own,” said Makgopa. “But there is nothing we can do as we have to listen to our President Cyril Ramaphosa and follow the rules. “But now with other leagues starting to reopen, it gives us hope our league can also start again so that we can finish the season.” He added: “It is a dream come true for me to play in the top flight. I started well with the help of my coach and my teammates. I am positive that I will continue with the same form and learn more.” Makgopa said that he is following the club’s diet as it helps to look after players’ health and fitness. “I cannot afford to fail to follow the technical instructions while I am at home. I have seen that playing in the PSL is not easy and you have to work hard all the time and be disciplined.” “I consider myself lucky as I have the support of the club and my family, who are giving me good advice all the time.”
