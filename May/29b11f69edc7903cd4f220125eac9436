  The end of the month is unusually busy in the town of
Rustenburg. It seems like public members have gotten used to staying at
home and adhering to lockdown regulations. Shops are adhering to the social distancing regulations and
most of the shops don’t allow customers who are not wearing masks inside. People are becoming more patient with having to stand in
long queues to ensure that they maintain social distance. The government said South Africans will have to wear face
masks from 1 May when coronavirus lockdown restrictions will begin to be eased. Kopano Malepe (29) said people are wearing masks not because
they are scared of the virus, but they fear soldiers. However, it is great to see everyone wearing masks,
regardless of the reason because it's for a good cause. Nthabiseng Makodi (32) said: “It's good to see that people
are working along with the government for our safety. I feel like this level is just an extension of the lockdown
and we need to ensure that we don't take any chances.” "I came to get food and winter clothes for my
one-year-old. As much as it is frustrating to stay in the queue. I Understand
it's for my safety and those around me," said Selina Mokoena. The North West MEC for the Community Safety and Transport
Management Sello Lehari addressed the shoppers in North West. Where he emphasised that lockdown restrictions continue. The MEC explained that various ministers will explain
further on new regulations governing Level 4. North West province has 13 active cases, a total of 4
hospitalized patients and 16 recovered cases.  PHOTO CAPTIONS  The last day of the month was not busy as usually. Seems
