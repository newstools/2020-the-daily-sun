 THE Malawian ministry of health has assured its citizens that the 16 bodies received through the Mwanza border were not of coronavirus victims. The ministry released a statement after fear and panic erupted among Malawians when they heard bodies were brought into the country from Mzansi. Malawian secretary for health, Dr Dan Namarika, said 10 bodies were received on Saturday, while six were received on Monday. Some of the causes of deaths include road accident, Leukemia and assault. “The high number of bodies coming into the country at the moment was due to the lockdown that the Republic of South Africa implemented as a means to prevent the further spread of Covid-19,” he said. Namarika said during lockdown, all bodies were kept in the mortuary awaiting transportation to Malawi for burial. He said health authorities in South Africa, as per international health regulations and requirements, certified and ensured the corpses were free from infectious diseases. “Those dying from Covid-19 are being buried in South Africa, regardless of their country of origin. “Government therefore would like to assure the general public that there should be no cause for panic when such bodies come into the country for proper burials,” he said. Namarika said bereaved family members and the public were advised to take precautionary measures when handling these bodies, including observing social distancing during burial ceremonies. He encouraged all Malawians to observe prevention and control measures of Covid-19 during burials by working closely with health authorities.
