WHAT started out as a dog-walking exercise soon turned into a nightmare for PR guru Lerato Sengadi. This after she was almost mugged by a brazen thug masquerading as an Uber driver in Sandton, north of Jozi, this week. Speaking to Sunday Sun, rapper HHP’s widow said she is still shocked and that this experience has been painful. “I had my arms crossed and my instinct kicked in, so I fell forward because I knew he couldn’t lift me up,” she said. Lerato said the man soon fled the scene and got into a white Toyota Corolla, which had a passenger. “I’m not the only one who was a victim because many women, who were also jogging in the same street told me of their stories of being robbed of their cellphones by the similar car. “I went to report the incident at Sandton Police Station.” and I was given a case number.” She said she didn’t understand why police were not doing enough, as they are aware these thugs target only women who jog in the area. “There should be police patrolling the area between 6am and 9am because that is the time when most women jog. I’ve tried to take this up with the SAPS on social media, but they blocked me.” “Women continue to be victimised in this country and not enough is done to keep us safe. “What must we do?Carry guns? If we do that and kill thugs, then we will go to jail. And also what is the department of Women and Children doing about this,” said Lerato.  I feel let down by the police,” she said. “They’re not doing anything. As women, we’re on our own.” Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele hadn’t responded to our inquiry at the time of going to print. She said women cannot jog without her cellphone, because their need it in case of an emergency.
