British American Tobacco South Africa has demanded that Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma amend regulations prohibiting the sale of tobacco products by Monday. If the regulations are not rescinded, they will head to court. This is according to a letter from law firm Webber Wentzel, on behalf of British American Tobacco (BAT), dated 30 April, which News24 has seen. In a stunning about-turn on Wednesday, the government announced that a ban on the sale of tobacco products and cigarettes would continue from Friday when some Level 5 lockdown restrictions are eased. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new five-level risk-based approach to the lockdown last Thursday and explicitly stated that the sale of cigarettes would be allowed under Level 4 regulations, which took effect on Friday. But, in an about-turn on Wednesday, Dlamini-Zuma announced that the ban on the sale of tobacco products and cigarettes would remain in place. 'Severely prejudiced'      "Having been prohibited from selling tobacco products and vaping products from the commencement of the lockdown, our client commenced preparing for the upliftment of the prohibition. In a very short period of time, over 10 000 orders were received from retailers wishing to sell tobacco products. The upliftment of the prohibition was celebrated not only by our client, but by retailers and consumers throughout the country," read the letter.  On Wednesday, shortly after the announcement of the regulations, the Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association (FITA) said it would launch an urgent application over the government's decision to continue the ban.   https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/british-american-tobacco-threatens-dlamini-zuma-with-court-action-over-tobacco-sales-ban-20200501
