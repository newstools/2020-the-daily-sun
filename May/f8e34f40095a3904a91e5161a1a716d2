THE Protea Magistrates Court is closed after a worker tested positive for Covid-19. The Department of Justice and Correctional Services said all staff who came into contact with the worker were in self-isolation. Spokesman Chrispin Phiri said there will be screening today and the court will reopen tomorrow after completion of disinfection. “It’s likely that services to communities being served by the court will be affected,” he said. “However, alternative arrangements have been made to minimise potential disruptions, with existing cases being diverted to surrounding magistrates courts such as Lenasia, Meadowlands and Kliptown.” Phiri said all first appearances will in the meantime take place at the Lenasia court. “It’s important to stress that urgent domestic violence matters and applications for protection orders are being attended to by surrounding courts so these services are available,” he told Daily Sun. The Protea court is not the only one affected by Covid-19. The Durban Magistrates Court is also closed and is being sanitised after a possible case was reported on Friday. Phiri said: “All other court staff and judicial officers who came into contact with the person have been identified and have undergone testing. They’ve been requested to go into self-isolation.” He said all pending criminal cases, urgent domestic violence matters and applications for protection orders will be dealt with in courts 21 and 22, situated in the municipal court on Somtseu Road in Durban. “The well-being of our officials and court users is essential,” said Phiri. “The department commends the various justice role players for their efforts in ensuring service delivery continues.”
